LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



OF 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I WAS bom in the year 1633, in the city of York, 
of a good family, though not of that country, my 
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who fettled firft at 
Hull. — He got a good eflate, by merchandife ; and, 
leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from 
whence he had married my mother, whofe relations 
were named Robinfon, a very good family in that 
county, and from whom I was called Robinfon Kreutz- 
naer ; but, b^ the ufual corruption of words in Eng- 
land, we are now called, nay, we call ourfelves, and 
write our name, Crufoe ; and fo my companions always 
called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a lieute- 
nant-colonel in an Englifh regiment of foot in Flanders,

formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Loekhart, 
and was killed at a battle near Dunkirk, againil the 
Spaniards. What became of my fecond brother I 
never knew, any more than my father or mother did 
know what was become of mc. 

Being the third fon of the family, and not bred to 
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with 
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, 
had given me a competent fhare of learning, as far as 
houfe education, and a country free-fchool generally 
goes, and deiigned me for the law ; but I would be fa- 
tisfied with nothing but going to fea ; and my inclina- 
tion to this led me fo llrongly againft tht will, nay, 
the commands of my father, and againft all the ii>treati.es 
and perfuaiions of my mother and other friends, that 
there leemed to be fomething fatal in that projpenlion 
of nature, tending direftly to the life of mifer^'^which 
was to befal me. 

My father, a wife and grave man, gave me ferioas 
and e^^cellent couiifel againft what he forefaw was my 
defign. He called me one morning, into his chamber, 
^where he was confiujed by the gout, and expotlulated 
very warmly with me on this fubjccft. Ke aiked me, 
what reafops, more than a mere ^wandering inclination, 
1 had for leaving my father's houfe and my native coun- 
try, where I might be well introduced, and had a prol'- 
ped: of railing my fortune by application and induftVj, 
with a life of eafe and pleafure. He told me it \5fias 
'men of defpcratjc fortunes on one hand, or of afpiring 
fuperior fortunes on the other, and who went abroad 
.upon adventures, to rife by enterprife, and make them- 
felves famoi^s iii undertakings of a nature out of the 
common rpad ; that thefe things were all either too far 
' above me, or too far below me ; that mine was the 
middle ftate, or what might be Icallcd the upper ftation 
of low life, which he had found, by long experience, 
was the beft ftate in the world ; the mott fuited to l\u- 
man happinefs ; not expofed to the miferies and hard- 
ihips, the labour and fufferings of the mechanic part 
of mankind J and not embarrafted with the pride, lux- 
ury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. 

He 






ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOZ. $ 

He told mc 1 might judge of the happinefs of this ftatc 
by this one thing, viz. that this was the ftate of life 
"which all other people envied; that kings have fre- 
quently lamented the miferable conrequen9e8 of being 
bom to great things, and wifhed they had been placed' 
in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean 
and the great ; that the wife man gave h;s teftimony to 
Ihis, as the juil ilandard of true felicit)^ when he prayed 
tb have neither poverty noj riches. 

He bade me obferve it, and 1 (hould always find, that 
the calamities of life were {liarcd among the upper and 
lower part of mankind ; but that the middle flation 
htid thefeweft difafters, and was not expoted tofo many 
viciffitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ;-^ 
nay, they were not fubjedted to lo many diilempers and 
uneaiineires, either of body or mind, as fhofe were, who, 
by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one 
hand, or by hard labour, want of neceflaries, and mean 
or infufficient diet on the other hand, bring diilempers 
upon themiclves by the natural conlequences of their 
way of living ; that the middle llation of life was cal* 
culated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoy- 
ments ; that peace and plenty were the hand-maids of 
a middle fortune ; that temperance, moderation, quiet- 
nefs, health, fociety, alj agreeable diyerfions, and all 
defiraWe pleafures, were the bleffings attending the 
middle llation of life ; that this way men went lilently and 
fmoothly through the world, ancfcom fort ably out of it; 
not embarraiTed with the labours of the hands, or of the 
head ; not fold to a life of flavery for daily bread," or 
harrafled with perplexed circumltances, which rcb the 
foul of peace, and the body of reft ; not enraged with the 
pafHon of envy, or the fecret burning lull of ambition for 
great things^; but in eafy circumltances, Hiding gently 
through the world, and feniibly tailing the fweets of liv- 
ing without the bitter ; feeling that they are happy, and 
learning, by every day's experience, to know it more 
feniibly. 

After this he preffed me earneftly, and in the moil af- 
fedlionate manner, not to play the young man, or to 
precipitate myfclf into miferies, which nature, and the 
llation of life I was born in, feemed to have provided 
againll; that I. was under no neceffity of feeking my

l)read ; that he would do wellfor-mfc, and endeavour to 
enter me fairly into the itation of life which he had 
* been jull recommending to m? ; and that if I was not 
very eafy and happy in the world, it muft be my mere 
fate, or fault, that muft hinder it ; and that he (hftuld 
have nothing to anfwer for, having thus difcharged his 
duty in warning me againft meafures which he knew 
would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do 
very kind things for me, if I would ftay and fettle at 
home, as he dire(5ted, fo he would not have fo much 
hand in ray misfortunes as to give me any encourage- 
ment to go away : and, to clofcall, he told me I had my 
elder brother for an example, to whom he had ufed the 
fame earneft perfuaiions to keep him from going into 
the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young 
defires prompting him to run into the army, where he 
was killed ; and though he faid he would not ceafe trt 

?ray for me, yet he would venture to fay to me, that if 
did take this foolifh ftep, .God would not blefs me ; 
and I would have leifure hereafter to refledt upon having 
jiegleAed his counfel when there might be none to aflift 
in my recovery- ' ^ 

I obferved in this lail part of his difcourfe, which was 
truly prophetic, though I fuppofe my father did not 
know it to be fo himfelf ; I fay, I obferved the tears run 
down his face very plentifully, efpecjally when he fpoke 
of my brother who was killed ; and that when he fpoke 
of my having leifure to repent, and none to aflift me, he 
was fo moved, that he broke off the difcourfe, and told 
me his heart was fo full, he could fay no more to me. 
' I was fincerely afflifted with this difcourfe, as indeed 
who could be other wife ? and 1 refolved not to think of 
going abroad any more, but to fettle at home according 
to my father's defire : but, alas ! a few days wore it all 
off; and, in fhort, to prevent any of my father* s farther 
importunities, in a few weeks after 1 refolved to run 
quite away from him. However, I did not a6l fo 
hailily neither as the firlt heat of my refolution prompt- 
ed ; but I took my mother, at a time when I thought 
her a little pleafanter than ordinary, and told her that 
my -thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the 
wdrld, that 1 fhould never fettle to any thing with refo- 
lution 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 5 

lution enough to go through with it ; and my father had 
better give me his conlent, than force me to go without 
it ; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too 
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; 
that I was lure, if I did, I fhould never ferve out my 
time, but I fhould certainly run away from my matter 
before my time was out, and go to lea ; and if (he 
would fpeak to my father to let me go one voyage, 
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I 
would go no more, and I would promile, by a double ; 
diligence, to recover the time that I had loll. 

This put my mother into a great paflion : (he told 
me fhe knew it would be to no p\irpofe to fpeak to my 
father upon any fuch fubjedt ; that he knew too \yell 
what was my intereft.to give his confent to any thing fo 
much for my hurt ; and thatlhe wondered how 1 could 
think of any fuch thing after the difcourfe 1 had had with 
my father, and luch kind and tender expreflions as Ihe 
knew my father had ufedto me ; and that, in Ihort, if 1 
would ruin myfelf, there was no help for me, but I 
might depend I fhould never have their confent to it ; 
that, for her part, fhe would not havefo much hand in 
my deftruftion ; and I Ihould never have it to fay that 
my mother was willing, when my father was not. 

Though my mother refuled to move it to my father^, 
yet I heard afterwards that fhe reported all the difcouHe 
to him ; and that my father, after IJiewing a great con- 
cern at it, faid to her, with a Ugh, that boy might be 
happy if he would ftay at home ; but if he goes abroad,, 
he will be the moft miferable wretch that ever was bom ;. 
I can give no Confent to it. 

It was not till almoil a year after this that I broke 
loofe, though in the mean time I continued obllinately 
deaf to all propofalsof fettling to bulinefs, and frequently 
expollulating with my father and mother about their 
being fo pofitively determined againll what they knew 
m)^ inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at 
Hull, whither 1 went cafually, and without any pur- 
pofe of making an elopement that time ; but 1 fay,, 
being there, and one of my companions being going

me to go with him, with the common allurement .of a.

O ADVENTURES OT ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

fcafaring man, that it fhould cofl me nothiilg for my 
paffage, I confulted neither father nor mother any more, 
nor fo much as fent them word of it, but leaving them 
to hear of it as they might, without aiking God's blell^ 
ing, or my father's, without any confideration of cir- 
cumftances or confequences, and in an ill hour, God 
, knows, on the firft of September, 1 751 , I went on board 
aihip bound for London. Never any young adventurer's 
misfortunes I believe began fooner, or continued longer, 
than mine ; . the fhip was no fooner got out of the Hum- 
ber, but the wind began to blow, and the fea to rife in a 
moft frightful manner ; and, as I had never been at fea 
before, 1 was mod inexpreffibly fick in body, and terrified 
in mind. I began now lerioiiily to reflect upon what I 
had done, and how juftly I was overtaken by the judg- 
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving iny father » 
houfe, and abtindoning my duty ; ell the good counfel 
of my parents, my father's tears, and my mothei^'s entree- 
ties, came now freifhinto ray mind ; and my confcicncc, 
whith was not yet come to tne pitch of hardmefs which it 
has been fmce, reproached me with jhc contempt of ad- 
vice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father. 
All this while the l\orm increafed, and the fea went 
very high, though nothing like what I have (ten many 
tihics Ihice, no nor what I faw a few days after ; but it 
was enough to aflPeift. me then, who was but a young fai- 
lor, and had never known any thing of the matter, J 
expe^ed every wave would have fwallowed us^ap, and 
that every time the !fliip fell down, as I thought it did, in 
the trough or hollow of the fea, we ftioulcl never rife 
.more. Jn this agony of mind I made many vows and 
rcfolutions that, if it would pkafe God to fpare my lite 
in this one voyage, if «ver I got once my foot upon dry 
land again, I would go directly home to ray father, and 
never fet it into a (hip again while 1 lived ; that 1 would 
take his advice, and never mn rayfelf into fuch miferies 
as thefe any niore. Now I farw plainly the goodnefs of 
his obfisrvations about the middle ftation of life, how 
eafy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and 
never had been cxpofed to tempefts at fea, or troubles on 
fliore; and, in fhort, I refolved that I would, like a true 
lepcnting prodigal , go home to my father* 

Thefc 



ADVENTURES OF ROBIKSOK C&USQX* 7 

Thefe wife and fober thoughts continued all the while 
the florm continued^ and indeed fome time after ; but 
the next dajr the wind wa$ abated , and the fea calmer, 
and I began to be a little inured to it* However, I was 
verj grave for all that day, being alfo a little fta-fick 
ftill ; but towards night the weather cleared "up, the 
wind was quite oyer, and a charming fine evening fol- 
lowed ; the fun went down perfefftly clear, and rofe fo 
the next morning ; and having little or no wind, and a 
fmooth fea, the {tin (hining upon it, the light was, as 1 
thought, the moft delightful that ever I faw. 

I had llept well in the night, and was no more fea- 
fick, but Ycry cheerful ; looking with wonder upon the 
fea, that was fo rough and terrible the day before, and 
could be £o Calm and fo pleafant in fo little a time after, 
^nd now, left my good refolutions fliould continue, my 
companion, wholiad indeed enticed me away, comes to 
mc, Well, Bob, fays he, clapping me upon the (houlder, 
how do you do after it ? 1 warrant you were frighted, 
were npt you, laft night when it blew but sC cap full of 
wind ? A cap full, do you call it ? faid I, 'twas a ter- 
rible ilorm. A ilorra, you tool you ! replies he ; do 
you call that a ftorm ? Why it was nothing at all : give 
us but a good (hip, and fea room, and we think nothing 
of fuch a fquall of wind as that ; but you are but afreih 
water failor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, 
and we'll forget all that ; do you fee what charming wea-^ 
tber it is now ? To make ihort this fad part of my ftory, 
we went the way of all failors ; the punch was made,, and 
I was made half drunk with it ; and in that one night's 
wickednefs i drowned all my repentance, all my rejec- 
tions upon my paft condudl, all my refolutions for the 
future. In a word, as the fea was returned to itsfmooth-^ 
ncfs of furface, ind fettled calmnefs, by the abatement 
of that itorm, fo the hurry of my thoughts being Over, 
my fears and apprehenfions of being fwallowed up by the 
fea being forgotton, and the current of my formei deiires 
xctumed, I entirely forgot the vows and promifcs that I 
made in my diftrels. J found indeed fome intervals a£ 
refleAion, and the ferious thoughts did, as it were, 
endeavour to return a^ain fometimcs ; but I (hook them 
oft'y^d roufed myfelf from them, as it were, from a

difteraper; and applying myfelfto drinking and com- 
pany, tooa maftered the return of thofe fits {hr fo I 
called them) ; and I had, in five or fix days, got ai 
complete a viftory over my conrciencc a» any young 
fellow that refolved not to be troubled with it could 
defira. But I was to have another trial for it Itill ; and 
Providence, as in fuch cafes it generally does, refolved 
to leave me entirelv without excufe ; for 1 would not 
take this for a deliverance, the next was to be fuch aa 
one as the wotA and molt hardened wretch among us 
would confefs both the danger and the mercy. 

The fixth day of our being at fea, we came into Yap- 
mouth roads ; the wind having been contrary, and the 
weather calm, we hadmade but little way faice the Itorm. 
Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here wv 
lay, the wmd continuing contrary, via, at fouth-wcft, 
for feven or eight days ; during which time a great 
many fhips from Newcalile came into the fame roads, 
as the common harbour where the fliips might wait for 
a wind for the river. , 

We had not however, rid here fo long but we fliould 
have tided it «p the river, bijt that the wind blew too 
frelh ; and after we had lain four or five days, blew-vcry 
hard. However, the roads-being reckoned as good as 
an harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle 
very llrongi our men- were unconcerned, and cot the . 
lealt apprehenfive of danger, but fpeA_tt^ime in reft 
an:! mirth, after the mannPr ftf the fea; trat the eighth 
dayin the morning, ihe-vfihd increaied, and we had all 
hands at work to ftrikc our fop^iaiis, and make every 
thing Inug and dole, (hat the (hiplnigbrritle as e.il'y as 
poliible. By noon the fea went very high indeed, and 
our ihip rid fiirecallie in, fhipped ftveral fcas, and we 
thought i>nce or twice our anchor had come home ; 
upon which our malter ordered out the Iheel anchor^ 
fo that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables 
▼eered out lo the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible ftorm indeed ; and now 
I began to fee terror and amazement in the faces even of 
the leamen themfclves. 'I'he malter, thoagh vigjlant in 
the bufinels of preferring the flup, yet as he went in and 
out of his catHn by me, 1 could hear him, fQl'iiy to

be all loft, we ihall be all undone, and the like. During 
thefe firft hurries, I was ftupid, lying ftill in my cabin, 
which was in the fteerage, and cannot defcribe my tem- 
per. I could ill refurae the firft penitence which I nad fo 
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myfelf againft ; 
I thought thebitfernefs of death had been paft, and that 
this Would be nothing too, like the firft. But when the 
mafter himfelf came- by. me, as I faid juft now, and faid 
we fhould be all loft, 1 was dreadfully frighted : I got 
up out of my cabin, and looked out ; but luch a difmal 
iight I never faw ; the fea went mountains high, and 
broke upon us every three or four minutes : when Icould 
look about, I could fee nothing but diftrefs round us ; 
.two Ihips that rid near us we found had cut their mafts 
by the board, being deep laden ; and our men cried/ out, 
that a ftiip which rid about a mile ahead, of usj was 
foundered. Two more ihips, being driven from their an- 
chors, were run out of the roads to fea at all adventures, 
and that not with a maft ftanding. The light fiiips*^ 
fared the beft, as not fo much labouring in the fea, but 
two or three of them drove,*and came clofe by us, run- 
ning away with only thtirfpritlail out, before the wind. 
Toward^-the evening, the mate and boatfwain begged 
the matter of our lliip to let them cut away the foremaft, 
which he was very unwi ling to flo ; but the boatfwain 
protefting to him that, if he did not, the ftiip would 
founder, he confented ; and whenthey had cut, away the 
foremaft, the main ma It ftood fo loofe, and fhook the 
{hip fo much, they were obliged to cut her away alio, 
and make a clear deck. 

Any one muft judge what a condition Imuftbe in at 
all. this, who was but a young failor, and who had been 
in fuch a fright before at but a little. But if I can expfefs ^ 
at this diftance the thoughts I had abput me at that time, . 
I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of 
my former convictions, and the having returned from 
them to the refolutions 1 had wickedly taken at firft,:,than 
I was at death itfelf; and thefe^ added to the terror of 
the ftorm, put me into. fuch. a condition, that lican by 
no words defcribe it. But the worft was not come yet : 
the ftorm continued with fuch fury, that < the feamen 
themfelves acknowledged they had nev^rfeena^ worfe.

lowed in the fea, that the feamen every now and then 
cried out, (he would founder. It was my advantage in one 
refpeft, that I did not know what they meant by founder, 
till I enquired. However, the ftorra was fo violent, that 
I faw what is not often feen, the mailer, thcboatfwain,

^ hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that 
very word, my heart, as I thought, died within me ; and 
I fell backwards upon the fide of the bed where I fat, 
into the cabin. However, the m«|} fouled me, and told 
me, that I that was able to do nothang before, was as well 
able to pump as another ; at which I ftirred up, and went 
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was 
doing, the mailer feeing fome light colliers, who, not able 
to ride out the ftorm, were obliged toilip and run away 
to the fea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun 
as a fi^gnal of diftrefs. I, who knew nothing of-what they 
m^ant, was'fo furprifed, that I thought the thefliip had 
broke, or fome dreadful thing happened. In a word, I 
was fo furprifed, that I fell down in a fwoon. As this was 
a time when every body had his. own life to think of, 
nobody minded me, or what was become of me ; but 
another man Hepped up to the pump, and tjirufting me 
afide with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; 
and it was a great while before I came to myfelf. 

We worked on, but the water increafing in the hold, 
it was apparent thatthc ihip would founder ; and though 
the ftorm began to abate a little, yet as it was not pof- 
fible fhe could fwim till we baight run into any port, fo 
the mailer continued firing guns for help ; and a light 
ihip, who had rid it out juil a head of us, ventured a 
boat out to help uS. It was with the utmoft hazard the " 
ho3it came near us ; but it was impoffible for us to get 
on board, or for the boat to lie near the ihip'sfide ; iill;

ftern, with a buoy to it^ ancj then vecr^ it out a great 
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took 
hold of, and we hawledtKem clofe under our ftem^ and 
got all into their boat. It was to n© parpofe for them 
or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching 
to their own fhip ; fo all agreed to let her drive, and only 
to pull her in towards {hore as much as we. could : and 
our mafter promifed them, that if the boat was ftaved 
upon fhore, he would make it good to their matter : fo 
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away 
to the northward, Hoping towards the ihore, almoft As 
far as WintertonnefTe. 

We were not much" more than a quarter of aft hour 
out of our (hip, when we faw her fink ; and then I under- 
ftood, for the iirft time, what was meant by a fhip foun- 
dering in thefea. I muft acknowledge I had hardly eyes 
to look up, when the feamen told me (he was (inking ; 
for, from that moment they rather put me into the boat,, 
than that I might be faid to go in ; my heart was as it 
\vere dead within me, partly with fright, partly with 
horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet^before 
me. ' 

While we were in this condition, the men yetlabour-^,. 
ing at the oar to bring the boat near the ihore, we could 
fee (when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able 
to fee thelhore) a great many pepple 4-anning along the 
ftrand, to afiift us when we (hould come near : but we 
made but flov/ way towards the (hore ; nor were we 
able to reach the (hore, till being pait the light-houfe at 
Winl^erton, the (hore falls off to the weftward towards 
Cromer ; and fo the land broke off a little the violence of 
the wind. Here we got in ; and, though not without 
much difficulty, got all fafe oa(hore, and walked after- 
wards on foot to' Yarmouth^ where, as unfortunate m*en, 
we were ufed with great humanity, as well by the ma- 
giftrates of the town, who affigned us good quarters, as 
by particular merchants and owilcrs of (hips t and had 
money given \is fufficient to carry us either to London », 
or back to Hull, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the fenfe to have gone back to Hull, 
and have gone home, J had been happy ; and my father,

killed the fatted calf for me ; for, hearing the (hip I went 
away in was caft away in Yarmouth road, it was a great 
while before he had an yaflu ranees thati was not drowned. 

But my ill fate puihcd me on now with an obllinacy 
that nothing could reiift ; and though I ha^ feveral times 
loud calls from my-reafon, and my more compofed judg- 
ment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know 
not what to call this ; nor will I urge that it is a iccret 
over-ruling decree that hurries us on to be the inftru- 
ments of our own deftrudlion, even though itie before' 
us, and that we pu{h upon it with our eyes open. Cer- 
tainly nothing but fome fuch decreed, unavoidable mi- 
sery attending, and which it was impoffible for me to 
efcape, could have puihed me forward againll the calm 
reafonings and perfuaiions of my moil retired thoughts, 
and agamfl two fuch viiible inflru<5lions as I had met 
■with in my firft attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, 
and who was the mailer's fon, was now lefs forward 
than I. The firft time he fpoke to me after we were at 
Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we 
were feparated in the town to feveral quarters ; 1 fay, 
the firlt time he faw me, it appeared his tone was 
altered ; and looking very melancholy, and ihaking his 
head, afked me how 1 did ? and telling his father who I 
was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, 
in order to go farther abrdad ; his father, turning to me, 
with a very grave and concerned tone. Young man, fays 
he, you ought never to 'go to {j^a, any more ; you ought 
to take this for a plain and vifible token, that you are 
not to be a feafaring man. Why, Sir, faid 1, will you 
go to fea no more ? That is another, cafe, faid he ; it is 
my calling, and therefore my duty : but as you raadd 
this voyage for a trial, you fee what a tafte Heaven has 
given you of what you are to expedl if you perfift : per- 
haps all this has befallen us on your account, like Jonah 
in^the (hip of Tarihifh. Pray, continues he, what are you ? 
and. on what account did you go to fea ? Upon that I 
told him fome of ftiy ftory ; at the end of which he burll 
out with ^a ftrange kind of paflion ; What have I done, 
fays he,^t}iat fucn an unhappy wretch (hould come into 
my ftip ? I,^ould not fet m|[.foot in the fame (hip with

.thee again for a thoufanci pounds. This indeed was, as 
1 faid, an excuriion of his fpirits, which were yet agi- 
tated by the lenfe of his Ibis, and was further than he . 
could have authority to go. However, he afterwards 
talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to 
my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; told 
me I might fee. a vifible hand of Heaven againil me. 
And, young man, faid he, depend upon it, if you do 
not go back, wherever you go, you wili \mect with 
nothing but difafters and difappointments, till yout 
father's words are fulfilled upon you. 

'We parted foon after, for I made him little anfwer, 
and I faw him no more ; which way he went I know 
i^ot. As for me, having fome money in my pocket, 1 tra- 
velled to London by land, and there,as well as on the road, 
had many ilruggles with niyfelf what couvfe of life I 
ihould take, and whether 1 IhoQld go home or go to fea. 

As to going home, Ihame oppofed the bell motions 
,.that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc- 
cured to me how I fhould be laughed at among the 
neighbours, and fhoUld be aihamed to fee, not my lather 
and mother only, but even every body elfe ; from whence 
1 have llnce often obferved how incongruous and irra- 
tional the common temper of rnankind is, efpecially of 
- youth, to that reafpn that ought to guide them in fuch 
cafes ; viz. that they are not afliamed to fin, and yet are 
afhamed to repent ; not afhamed of the adiion for which 
they ought juftly to be efieemed fools ; blit are aihamed 
of the returning, which only can make them efteemed 
vife men. ' 

Jn thii ftate of life, however, I remained fome time, 
uncertain what meafures to take, and what courfebf life ^ 
to lead. An irreiillible reludlance continued to gping 
home : and as I ilaid awhile, the remembrance of the 
diftrefs 1 had been in wore off ; and as that abated, the 
little motion I had in my defircs to return, wore off with 
it, till at laft I quite laid afide the thoughts of it, and 
looked out for a voyage. 

That evil influence, which carried me firfl away from^ 
my father's ho ufe, which hurried me into the wild and 
indigefled notion of railing my fortune, and ^that im- 
prefled^thofe conceits fo forcibly upon me as to make me 
deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and even

the commands of my father ; — I fay, the fame influence, 
whatever it was, prcfentcd the moil tinfoitunate of all 
cnterprifes to my view ; and I went on board a veflel 
bound to the eoaft of Africa, or, as our failors vulgarly 
call it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my vreat misfortune, that in all thefc adven- 
tures I did not (hip myfelfas afailor; whereby, though 
I might indeed have worked a little harder than, ordi-s. 
nary, yet at the fame time 1 had learned the duty and 
office of a foremaflman, and in time might have qualified 
myfelf for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a mailer, Bui 
as it was always ray fate to chufe for the worfe, fo I did 
here ; for, having money in my pocket, and good 9lothes 
on m}'^ back, I would always go on board in the habit of 
a gentleman ; and fo 1 neither had any buiinefs in the 
fhip, nor learned to do any. 

It W^s my lot firil of all to fall into pretty good com- 
pany in Lonxlon, which does not always happen ^o fuch 
loofe and unguided young fellows as I then was, the devU 
generally not omitting to lay fome fnare for them very 
early ; but it was not fo with me. 1 lirft fell acquainted 
with the mafter of a (hip who had been on the coaft of/ . 
Guinea, and who, having had very good fuccefs there, 
was refolved to gOs^gain : this captain, taking a fancy to^ * 
my converfation, which was not difagreeable at that ' 
time, hearing me lay 1 had a mind to fee the worlds 
told me, if I would go the voyage with him^ Lihoi^ld be 
• at no expence, 1 (hould be his meilmate, and his compa- 
nion ; and if 1 would carry any thing with me, J fliould 
have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; 
and perhaps I might meet with fome encouragemeiit.' . 

I embraced the offer; and, entering into a drift 
-friendfhip with this captain, who was aivhoneft, plain 
dealing man, went the voyage with him> and carried a 
fmall adventure with me, which, by the difmtereftcd 
honelty of my friend, the captain,.! increafed very cori- 
fiderably ; for 1 carried about 40h in fuch toys and 
trifles as the captain dire<5led me to buy : this 401. 1 had 
muftcred together by the affiftailce of lome of my rela- 
tions, whom 1 correfponded with, and who, 1 believe, 
got my father, or at lead my mother, to contribute fo ' 
much as that to my firit adventure. 

^ This 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 

^This was the only voyage which I may fay was fuc-^ 
cefsful in all my adventures, and which 1 owe to the 
integrity and honefty of my. friend, the captain ; under 
whom I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics, 
and the rules of navigation ; learned how to keep an 
account of the iliip's courfe, take an obfervation, and^ 
in (hort, to underlland fome things that were needful to 
be underftood by a failor ; for, as he took delight to 
introduce me, I took delight to learn : and, in a word, 
this voyage made me both a failor and a merchant ; for 
1 brought home five pounds nini! ounces of gold duil for 
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my re- 
turn, almoft 3001. ; and this filled me with thofe afpiring 
thoughts which have lince lo completed my ruin. ' 

Yet, even in this voyage, 1 had misfortunes too ; par- 
ticularly that I was continually fick, being thrown into 
a violent calenture by the exceflive heat of the climate ; 
our principal trading being upon the coaft, from the- 
latitude of 15 degrees north, even to the line itfelf. 

1 was nowfet up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, 
to my g^ea^ misfortune, dying foon after his arrival, I 
refolved to go the fame voyage again ; and I embarked 
in the fame veffel with one who was ^his mate in the 
former voyage, and had now got the command of the 
fhip. This was the unhappiell voyage that ever man 
made; for though 1 /did not carry quite lOOl. oT my 
new gained wealth, fothat I had 2001. left, and which 
I-lodged with my friend's widow, who was veryjult to 
' me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ; . 
and thefirft was this, viz. Our ihip, making her,courfe 
towards the Canary iilands, or rather between thofe 
iflands and the African (hore, was furprifed in the grey 
of the morning by a Moorifh "rover of Sallee, who gave 
chace to us with all the fail fhe could make. We 
crowded alfo as much can vafs as our yards would fpre ad, 
or our igafts carry, to have got clear : but finding the 
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up 
with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our fhip 
having twelve guns, and the rover eighteen. About 
three in the afternoon he came up with us ; and, bring- 
ing to, by miftake, juft athwart our quarter, inftcad of 
athwart our ilern, as he intended^ we brought eight of

our guns to bear on that fide, and poured in a broadfid^ 
upon him, which made him (hcer off again, after return- 
ing OUT fire, and pouring in alfo hisfmallihot from near 
two hundred men which he had on board. However, we 
had not a man touched, all our men keeping clofe. He 
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourfelvcs ; 
but laying us on board the next time upon our other quar- 
ter, he entered ninety men upon our decks, who imme- 
diately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. 
We plied them with fmall (hot, half pikes, powder chefts,- 
and iuch like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How- 
ever, to cut (hort thi« melancholy part of our flory, our 
ihipbeingdifabled,and three of our men killed and eight 
"Wounded^ we were obliged to yield, and were carried all 
prifoners to Sallee, a j)ort belonging to the Moors. 

The ufuage 1 had there was not fo dreadful as at firft 
I apprehended ; nor was I carried up the country, to the 
Emperor's court, as the reilof our men were, but was 
kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize^ and 
made histlave, being young and nimble, and fit for his 
buiinefs. At this furprifing change of my circumftances, 
from a merchant to a miferable Have, I was perfeiStly 
overwhelmed x and now I looked back upon my father's 
prophetic difcourfe to me, that I (hould- be miferable, 
and have none to relieve me ; which I thought was now 
fo effectually brought to pafs, that 1 could not be worle ; 
and now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I 
was undone without redemption. But, alas! this was 
but a tafte of the mifery 1 was to go through j as will 
appear in the fequel or this ftory . 

As my new patroa or mailer had taken me home to 
his lioule, fo I was in hopes that he would take me with 
him when he went to fea again, believing that it wou^ 
be fome time or other his fate to be taken by a Spani(h or 
Portugal man of war, and that then I fhould be fet at 
liberty. But this hope of mine was foon taken away ; for 
when he went to fea, he left me on Ihor^ to look after 
his little garden, and do the drudgery of {laves about his 
houfe ; and when he came home again from his cruize, 
he ordered me to lie-in the cabin, tolook after the fhip. 

Here I nieditated nothing but my efcape, and what 
method 1 might take to efifeft it \ but found no way that

had the Icaft probability in it ; nothing prefented to make 
the fuppofition of it rational ; for I had nobod j to com- 
municate it to, that ^ would embark with me ; no fellow^ 
Have, no Englifhman, Irilhmen, or Scotfman there, but 
ihyfelf ; fo that for two years, though 1 often pleafed 
myfelf with the imagination, yet I never had the leaft 
encouraging profpeft of putting it in pra6iice. 

After about two years an odd circumllance prefented 
itfelf, which put the old thoughts of making feme 
attempt for my liberty again in ray head : * my patron 
lying at home longer than ufual, without fitting out hi»> 
fliip, which, as I heard, was for want of montfy, he ufed 
conftantly once or twice a week, fometimes oftener, if 
the weather was fair, to take the fhip's pinnace and go 
out into the road a fifliing; and as he always took me 
and a young Marefco with him, to row the boat, we made 
him very merry, and I proved very dextrous in catching 
fiih ; infomuch that fometimes be woi^ld lend me with 
a Moor, one of his kinlrnen, and the youth Marefco, as 
thty^ called him, to catch a difh of filh for him. 
. It happened one time, that going a tiihing with him in 
a calm motning, a fog rofe fo thick, that though we 
were not half a league from the (bote, we loft iig^ht of it ; 
an^^ rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we 
laboured all day, and the next night; and when the 
morning came, we found we had pulled off to fea, 
iniiead of pulling in for the lliore, and that we were at 
leaft two leagues from the land* However, we got welt 
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and fome 
• danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty freih in the 
morning; but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this dil'after, refolved to 
take more care of himfeJf for the future ; and having 
lying by him the long-boat of our Englifh ihip which 
he had taken, he refolved he would not go afifhing any 
more without a compafs and fome proviiion. Jio he 
ordered the carpenter of his ihip, who was alfo an Eng- 
liih (lave, to build a little ftate room, or cabin, in the 
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a 
place to ftand behind it to fteer, and bawl home the 
jnainftieet; and room before for an hand or two to 
iland and work the fails. She. failed with what we 
call a ihoulder of mutton fail ; and the boom jibbed over

the top of the cabin, which lay very ftiug and low, r/inf 
had in it room for him to lie, with a flave or two, and i| 
table to eat on, with Ibme fmall lockers to put in fom^i 
bottles of fuch liquor a« he thought fit to drink ; parti- "^ 
cularly his breads rice, and coffee. 

We were frequently out with his boat a fifhing, and 
as I was moil dexterous to catch fiih for him, he never 
went without me. it happened one day that he had 
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleafure or 
for fifh, with two or three Moors of fome diftindion, 
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily ; and had j 
therefore felit on board the boat over night a larger (lore 
of provifions than ufual ; and had ordered me to get 
ready three fulils with powder and (hot, which were on 
board his £bip, for that they defigned fome iport of 
fowling as well as fifhing. ^ 

1 got all things ready as he had dircdled, and waited 
the next mornmg with the boat wafhed clean, her an* 
cients and pendants out, and every thing to accommo« 
date his guefls; when by and by my patron came on 
board alone, and told me his guefls had put off jgoin?, 
, upon fome bufinefs that fell out ; and ordered me, witn 
the man alsd boy, as ufual, to go out with the boat and 
catch them fome fifh, for that his friends were to fup at 
bis houfe : he commanded me too, that as foon as I had 
got fome fifh, I fhoukl bring it hom^ to his houfe ; all 
which I prepared to do. ^ 

This moment ray former notions of deliverance darted 
int6 ray thoughts, for now 1 found I was like to have a 
little fliip at my command ; and my mafler being gone, 
I prepared to furnifh rayfelf, not forfifhmg butinefs, but 
for a voyage ; though I knew not, neither did 1 fo much 
as conlider whither 1 would lleer ; for any where to get 
out'of that place was my way. 

Mj firft contrivance was to make a pretence to fpeak 
to this Moor to, get fbmething for our fubfiitence on 
board ; for I told him we mud not prefume to eat of our 
patron's bread ; he faid that was true : fo he brought a 
large bafket of rufk, or bifcuit of their kind, and three 
jars with frefh water, into the boat. I knew where my 
patron's cafe of bottles flood, which it was evident by the^ 
make were taken out of fome £nglifh prize, and I con*

veyed them into the boat while the Moor was on {hoT^» 
as if they had been there before for our mafter. 1 con- 
veyed alfo a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which 
Weighed about half an hundred weight, with a parcel of 
twine or thread, a hatchet, a faw, and a hammer, all 
which were of great ufe to us afterwards, efpecially 
the wax to make xaildles. Another trick I tried upon 
him, which he innoc^tly came into alfo : his name was 
Ifmael, whom they calf Miiley, orMoloy ; fo 1 calletl to 
him, Moloy, faid I, our patron's guns are all on board 
the boat, can you not get a little powder and Ihot ? it 
may be we may-kill fome aleamies (a fowl like our cur- 
lew), for ourfelves ; for I know he keeps the gunner's 
ftpres in the ihip. Yes, faid he, Til bring fome ; accord- 
ingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held about 
4 pound and a half of powder, or rather more ; and 
another with fhot, that had f»vc or lix pounds, with fome 
tmlletfl, and pat all into the boat : at the ihme time I 
had found ibmc powder of my mailer' b in the great 
cabin; with which ! filled one of the large bottles in the 
Cafe, wljkich w^a almoft empty, pouring what was in it 
into andither ; and thus furnished with every thing need- 
ful, we t^|e<iout of the port to fiih. The cafHe, which 
was at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and 
took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out 
of the port before we bawled in our fail, and fat us down 
to filh. The wind blew from the N. N. E, which was 
contxarj to my defire { for had it blown foutherly, I had 
been fuf^J^have made the coait of Spain, and at leail 
reached td^w bay of Cadiz ; but my refolutions were, 
blow which way it would, I would be gone from thtit 
horrid place where [ was, and leave the reft to fate. 

After we had fiilied fome time and catched nothing 
f for when I had iiih on my hook 1 would not pull them

This will not do, our mafter will not bethus fervcd ; we 
<n\ift ftan^ ferther off ; he, thinking no harm, agreed ; 
and being in the head of the boat, fet the fails ;. and as I 
had the helm, I ran the boat out near a^ league farther, 
and then brought her to as if 1 would fiih ; when, giving 
the boy th^ helm, I ftepped forward to wherry the Moor

him, I took him by furprife with my arm under his twift, 
and tofled bim clear overboard into the fea : he rofc 
irmmediately, for he fwam like a cork, and called to rac, 
begged to be taken in, told me he. would go all over the 
world with me. He. fwam fo ftrong after the boat, 
that he would have reached me very quickly, there being 
but little wind ; upon which I ftepped into the cabin, 
and fetching one of the fpwling-ps^ces, 1 j>refented it at 
him, and told him I had done hini* no hurt, and if he 
would be quiet, I would do him none. But, faid I, 
you fwim- well enough to reach the fhore, and the fea is 
calm ; make the beic of your way to the fhore, and I 
will do you no harm ; but if you come near the boat, I 
will fhoot you through the head ; for 1 am lefolved to - 
have my liberty. So he turned himfelf about, and fwam 
for the more, and I make no doubt but he reached it with 
cafe, for he was an excellent fwimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor 
with me, gncVhave drowned the. boy, but there was no . 
venturing to truft him. When he was gone, 1 turned to 
the boy, whom they called Xury, and faidtphim, Xury, 
if you will be faithful to me, I will make you a great 
man ; butif you< will not ftroke your face to be true to 
me, thatis, fwearby Mahomet, and his father's beard, 
I muii throw yon into the fea too* The boy frailed in. 
my face, and fpoke fo innocently, that Ipould not mif- 
truft him, and iwore to be faithful to me, and go all 
over the world with me. 

While I was in the view of the Moor that was fwim- 
xning, I flood out dircdlly to lea, with the boat rather 
ihetching to windward, that , they might, think me gone 
towards the Streight-mouth (as ijideed any one that had 
been in their wits muft have \>etn fuppofed to do), for 
who would have fupjiofeii we were failed on to the fouth* 
ward, to ^he truly Barbarian coaft, where whole nations 
of negroes were lure to lurround us with their canoes, 
and deftroy us ; where we could never once go one fhore, 
but we fhould be devoured by favage beafis, or more 
mercilers fa V ages of humankind ! ' 

But as foon as it grew duik in the evening, I changed 
my courfe, and (leered direftly foutb and by eaft, bend-

ik0VENTUfi.tS OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

In with the fhorc ; and having a fair frefh gale of wind, 
and a fraooth.quiet fea, I made fuch fail, that I believe 
hy the next day. at three o'clock in the afternoon, when 
1 firft made the land, I could not be lefs than one hun- 
dred and fifty miles fouth of Sallee, quite beyond the 
Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any 
other King thereabouts, for we faw no people. 

Yet fuch was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and 
the dreadful appreheniions I' had of falling into, their 
hands, that I wpuld not ftop, or go on ihore, or cSome to 
an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had failed in 
that manner five days ; and then the wind fhifting to the 
fouthward, 1 concluded alfo, that if any of our veflels 
were in chace of me, they alfo would now give over ; fo 
I ventured to make the coalt, and came to an anchor in 
the mouth of a little river, 1 knew not what or where, 
neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or 
•what river. I neither faw, nor defired to fee any people ; 
the principal thing I wanted was frefli water. We 
came into this creek in the evening, refolving to fwim 
on ihore as foon as it was dark, and difcover the coun- 
try : but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch 
dreadful noifes of the barking, roaring, and howling of 
-wild preatures of we knew not what kinds, that the. 
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me 
not to go on ihore till day. Well, Xury, faid I, then I 
w^oi^'t ; but it may be we may fee men by day, v/hq will 
be as bad to us as thofe lions. Then we may give theiii 
the fhoot gun, fays Xury, laughing, make them run 
away : fftch Englifh Xury fpoke by converiing among 
■us ilaves. However, I was glad to fee the boy fo cheer- 
ful, and I gave him a dram out of our patron's cafe of 
bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was 
good, and 1 took it. We dropped our little anchor, 
and lay ftill all night — I fay ilill, for we flept none; 
for in. two or three hours we faw vaft great creatures, 
we knew not what to call them, of many forts, come 
down to the fea ihore, and run into the water, wallow- 
ing and waihihg themfelves, for the pkafure of cooling 
themfelves; and they made fuch hideoUs bowlings and 
yellings^ that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury 



S2 Apy£NTUR£8 OF HOBIKSOK CRUSOB. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, amt indeed fo was I • 
too. But we were both worfe frighted when we heard 
one mighty creature come fwimming towards-our boat ; 
we could not fee him, but we might hear him by his 
blowing, to be a monftrous, huge, and furious bead ; 
Xury faid it was a lion, and it might be for ought I 
kliow. Poor Xury cried out to me to weigh the anchor, 
and row away No, fays I, Xury, we can flip our cable 
wit^h a buoy to it, and go to (ea, they cannot follow us 
far. 1 had no fooner f?iid fo, but I perceived the crea- 
ttirc, whatever^ it was, within two oars length, which 
fomething furprifed rnc. However, I immediately 
ftepped to the cabin door, and taking up tny ^un, fired 
at him; upon which he immediately turned about, and 
fwam tov/ardsthe fhore aorain. 

But it was not poffible to defcribe the horrible noifes 
and hideous cries and bowlings that were raifed, as well 
upon the edge of the ihore as higher within the coun- 
try, upon the noife or report of a gun, a thing I have 
fome reafort to believe thofe creatures had never heard 
before. This convinced me th«U there wa? no going on 
fhore for us in the night upon that coaft ; and how to 
venture on fhore in the day, was another queftion too ; 
for to have fallen intp the hands of any of the favages, 
had been as bad as to have fallen into the. paws of lions 
and tigers ; at leatl wcwere equally appre^enfiv^e of the 
danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on fhore 
fomewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint 
Jeft in the boat ; when or where to get to it' was the 
point. Xury faid if 1 would let'him go on fhore with , 
one of the jars^ he would find if there was any wat^, 
and bring fome to me. I afked him why he would' gdf ^ 
why 1 fhould not go, and he ^ay in the boat ? The boy 
anfwered with fo much affection, that made me love 
him ever after. Says he, Jf wild mans come, they eat 
me, you go away. Well, Xury, faid J, we will both 
go, smd if the wild mans come, we will kill them ; they 
fhall eat neither of us. So I gave Xury a piece of rufk- 
bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's cafe q£ 
bottles, which I rhentioned before, and we, hawlfd the 
boat in as near the fhore as We thought was proper, 

I and 



ADVlHiTVaCS OP &OBINSON CRUSOE. SS 

tnd waded od fhore, carrying nothing but our arms, and 
two jars for water. 

J did not care to go out of fight of tlJKboat, fearing 
the coming of the canoes with favages down the river : 
but the boy, feeing a low place alx>ut a mile up the 
country, rambled to it ; and by and by 1 faw him come 
ruxining towards me. I thought he was purfued by ibmc 
favagc, or frighted by ibme wild beail, an.t 1 ran for- 
ward towards him to help him ; but when 1 came nearer 
to him, I faw fomethin^ hansnng over bis flioulders, 
which was a creature that he had (hot, hke a hare, but 
diiferent in colour, and longer legs : however, we were 
very glad of it, and it was very good meat : but the great 
joy that poor Xury came with, was m tell me he had 
found good water, and had feen no wild mans. 

But we found aftcnrards that we need not take fuch . 
pains for water, for a little higher up the creek where 
we were, we found the water frefli when the tide was 
out, which flows but a little way up ; fo we filled our 
jars,*and feafled on the hare we had killed, and prepared 
to go on our way, having feen no footileps of any human 
creature in that part of the country. 
. As I had been one voyage to this coaft before, I knew 
very^well that the illands of the Canaries, and the Cape 
d6 Vcr<l illands alfo, lay not far off from the coaft; but 
as I had no inftruments to take an oblervation to know 
wjiat latitude we were in, and did not exa<5lly know, or at 
leaft not remember wha^ latitude they were in, 1 knew 
not where to look for them, or when to ftand otf^o fea 
toward^ them, otherwife I might now eafily have found 
^xxca^ of thefe illands.' But my hope was, that if 1 flood 
dong this coaft till 1 came to that part where the Kng- 
lifh traded, 1 fhould find fome of their veffels upon their 
ufualdeiign'pf trade, that would relieve and take us in. 
By the beftof my calculation, that place where I no>v 
was, muft be that country which, lying between the 
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the negroes, litjs 
wafte and uninhabited, except by wUd beafts ; the ne- 
groes having abandoned it, ^and gone further fputh for 
fear of the Moors ; and the Moors not thinking it worth 
inhabiting by reafoii of its ban^nnefs ; and indeed both 
fori'akiiig it beoaufe of the prodigious numbecs ot tigers,

upon this finglc point, either that I muft meet with feme 
fhip^ or muft pcrifh. 

When I had purfued this rcfolution about ten days 
longer, as I faid, I began to fee that the land was inha- 
bited ; and in two or three places, as we failed by, we 
faw people ftand upon the fhore, to look at us ; we could 
alfo perceive they were quite black, and ft ark naked. I 
was once inclined to have gone on ihorc to them ; but 
Xury was my better counfellor, and faid to me, . No go, 
no go. However, I bawled in nearer the Ihore, that I 
might talk to them ; and I found they ran along the ihore 
by me a good way. I obferved they had no weapons ia 
their hands, except one, who had a long Render flick, 
which Xury faid was a lance, and that they could throw 
them a great way with good aim ; fo I kept at a diftance, 
but talked with them by Cgns as well as I could, and 
particularly made figns for fomething to eat. They 
beckoned to me to ftop my boat, and they would fetch 
me fome meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my fail, 
and lay by; and two of them ran up into tlie country, 
and in lefs than half an hour came back, and broufjht 
with them two pieces of dried flefh, and fome corn, fuch 
as is the produce of their country ; but we neither knew 
what the one nor the other was ; however, we were wil- 
ling to accept it. But hov/ to come at it was our next 
difpute ; for I was not for venturing op ihore to them,, and 
they were as much a/raid of us ; but they took a fafe w<iy 
for us all; for they brought it to the more, and laid it 
down, and went and ftood a great way off, till we fetched 
it on board, and Ihen came clofe to us again. 

We made figns of thanks to them, for we had nothing 
to make them amends ; but an opportunity offered that 
very inilant to oblige them wonderfully ; for while we 
were lying by the ihore, came two mighty creatures, one 
purfuing the other, as we took it, with gre^t fury, from 
the mountains towards the fea ; whether it was the male 
piwfuing the female, or whether they were in fport, or in 
: rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell 
whether it was ufual or ftrange ; but I believe it was the 
latter, becaufe, in the firft place, thofe ravenous creatures 
feldom appear but in the night ; and in the fecond |Slace, 
we found the jijeople terribly affrighted, efpecially the 

women.

Women. The man that had the lance to dart did not fly 
from them, but the rell did. However, as the two crea- 
tures ran diredtly into the water, they did not leem to offer 
to fall upon Ae negroes,but plunged themlclves into the fea, 
and fwam about as if they, had come for their diverlion. 
At laft one of them began to come nearer our. boat than 
I firft expedled ; but I lay ready for him ; for I had 
loaded my gun with all poffible expedition, and bade 
Xury load both the others. As foon as he came fairly 
within ray reach, I fired, and fhct him direftly into the 
head : immediately he funk down into the water, but 
rofe inflantly, and plunged up and down as flrugglingfor 
life, and fo indeed he was : he immediately made to the 
ftore ; but between th6 wound which was his mortal 
hurt, and the ilrangling of the water, he died jufl before 
he reached fhorc. 

It is impoffible to exprefs the aftonifhment of thefe 
poor creatures at the noife and fire of my gun ; fome of 
them were ready even to die with fear, and fell dowa 
as dead with the very terror. But when they faw the 
creature dead, and funk ihto the water, and that I made 
%ns to them to come to the fhore, they took heart, 
and came to the ihore, and besran to fearch for the crea- 
ture. I found him by his blood ftaining the water, and 
hy the help of a rope which I flung round him, and 
gave the negroes to hawl ; they dragged htm on fhore, 
and found that it was a mod curious leopard, fpotted and 
fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their 
hands with admiration to think what it was I killed him 
with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flafh of fire, 
^nd the noife of the gun, fwam to the 'fhore, and ran 
^ip dlredtly to^the mountains from which they caine, 
flor could I at that diltance know what it was. i found 

] tluickly the negroes were for eating the fl(-lh of this 
creature ; fo 1 was willing to have them take it as a 
favour from me; which, when I made figns to them 
tnat they might take, it, they, were very tliankful for. 
Immediately they fell.to work wilh him , and though they 
*^a^l no knife, yet, with afharpened piece of wood they 
^ook off his fkin as readily, nay much more readily than 

' We would have done with a knife ; they offcired me fome 



S5 ADVXNTVRES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

cf the flefhy which I declined, "hiaking as if I would give] 
it them, but made llgns for the fkin, which they gave "" 
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their, 
proviiion, which, though I did not underfland, yet I 
accepted. Then I made figns to them for fome water, 
and held out one of my jars to ,them, turning its bottom 
upward, to ihew that it was empty, and that I wanted 
to h^ve it filled. They called immediately to fome of 
theit friends, and there came two women, and brought a 
great veflel made of earth, and burnt, as 1 fuppofe, in the 
luh ; this they fet down for me, as before, and I fent 
Xury on fhore with my jars, and filled them all three.— 
The women were as (lark naked as the men. 

I was now furnilhed with roots and corn, fuch as it 
was, and water ; and leaving my friendly negrpes, I 
made forward for about eleven days more, without offer- 
ing to go near the fhore, till I faw the land run out a great 
length into the f^a, at about the diftance of four 'or five 
leagues before me ; and the fea being very calm, I kept 
a large offing to make this point. At length, doubling 
the point, at about two leagues from the land, 1 faw i 
plainly land on the other fide, to fea-wards ; then I con- 
cluded, as it was moft certain indeed, that this was the 
Cape de Verd, and thofe the iflands, called from thence 
' Cape de Verd Iflands. However, they were at a great 
diftance, and I could not well tell what I had bell to do ; 
for if I fhould be taken with a frefh. gale of wind, I might 
neither reach one nor the other. 

. In this dilemma, as I was very penfive, I flepped into 
the cabin, and fet me down, Xury having the helm ;— 
when on a fudden the boy cried out. Matter, mailer, a 
fhip was a fail ! and the fboliih boy was frighted out of 
his wits, thinking it muft needs be fome of his mailer's 
fhips fent to purfuc us, when I knew we were gotten tar 
cnougA out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, 
and immediately faw, not only- the ihip, but what fhe was, 
viz. that it was a Portuguefe fiiip, and, as I thought, was 
bound to the coafl of Guinea for negroes. But when I ob- 
ferved the courfe flie fleered, I was foon convinced they 
were bound fome other way, and did not defign to go any 
nearer the fhore ; upon which I flretched out to fea as 
much as I could, rcfolving to fpeak with them, if poflible. 

With 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* ^9 

With all the fail I could make, I found I ihould not be 
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone 
by before I could make any fignal to them ; but alter I 
had crouded to the utmoft, and began to defpair, they, it 
feems, faw me by the help of their perfpe<ftive-glafles, 
and that it was fome European boat, which they fup- 
pofed muft belong to fome fhip that was loft ; fo they 
Ihortened fail to let me come up. I w^s encouraged with 
this ; and as I had my patron's enlign on board, I made 
a waft of it to them, for a (ignal of diftrefs, and fired a 
gun, both of which they faw ; for they told me they faw 
' the fmoke, though they did not hear the gun ; upon thefe 
iignals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me, 
and in about three hours time I came up with them. 

They afked me what 1 was, in Portuguefe, in Spaniih, 
Mid in French, but I underftood none of them ; but at 
lad a Scots failor, who was on board, called to me, and 
I anfwered him, and told^him I was an Engliftiman, that 
had made my efcapc out of flavery from the Moors, at 
Sake ; then they bid me come on board, and very kindly 
took me in, and all my goods. ' 

It was an inexpreiSble joy to me, any one will believe, 
that I was thus delivered, as I efteemed it, from fuch a 
miferable, and almoft hopelefs condition as I was in ; I 
itnmediately offered all 1 had to the captain of the fhip, 
as a return for my deliverance ; but he generoufly told 
mc he would take nothing from me, but that a:ll I had 
&ould be delivered fafe to me when I came to the Brails ; 
for, fays he, I have faved your life on no other terms, 
than as I would be glad to be faved myfelf ; and it may 
one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the fame 
condition. Befides, when I carry you to the Brafils, fo 
jgreat a way from your own country, if I fhould take from 
you what little yoti have, you will he ftarved there, and 
then I only take away that life 1 have given. No, no, 
Signior Inglefe (Mr. Englifhman) I would carry you 
there in charity ; and thefe things will help you to buy 
your fubfiflence there, and your paffage home again. 

As he was charitable in this propofal, fo he was jufl in 
the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the feamen, 
that none ihould ofiP'er to touch any thing I had ; then he 
took every thing into his own pofleffion, and gave me

back an exaA inventory of them, that I might have them 
again^ even fo much as my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that be 
faw, and told me he would buy it of me for the fhip's 
ufe, and a(ked me what 1 would have for it. I told him 
he had been fo generous to me in every thing, that 1 could 
not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely 
to him ; upon which he told me he would give me a 
note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at 
Brafil ; and when it came there, if any one offered to, 
give more, he would make it up. He offered me alfo 
lixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I 
was loath to take ; not that 1 was unwilling to let the 
Captain, have him, but I was very loath to fell the poor 
boy's liberty, who had aflifted me fo faithfully in pro- 
curing my own. However, when I let him know my 
reafon, he owned it to be juft, and offered me this me- 
dium, that he would give the boy an obligation to fet 
him free in ten years, if he turned Chriftian. Upon this, 
and Xury faying he was willing to go to him, I let the 
Captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Braiiis, and arrived 
in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in 
about twenty-two days after. And now I wa^ once more 
delivered from the moll miferable of all conditions of life, 
and what ta do next with myfelf I was to confider. 

The generous treatment the Captain gave me I can 
never fufiiciently remember; he would take nothing of 
tne for my pafTage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's 
fkin, and forty for the lion's fkin, which 1 had in the 
boat; and caufed every thing I had in the fhip to be^ 
punctually delivered me ; and what I was willing to fell 
he bought ; fuch as the cafe of bottles, two of my guns, 
and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had made 
candtes of the reft. lA a word, I made about two him- 
dred and thirty pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with 
this ftock 1 went od fliore in the Brafils. 

1 had not been long here, but being recommended to 
the houfe of a good honeflman likehimfelf, who Jiad an 
ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation, and a fugar- 
houie, I lived with him fome time, and acquainted 
myfelf, by that means, with the manner of their plant- 
ing and making fugj^r ; and feeing how well the planters

lived, and how they grew rich fuddcnJy, I reiblved, if I 
could get a licence to fettle there, 1 would turn planter 
among them ; refolving, in the mean time, to find ou^ 
fome way to get my money, which I had left in London, 
remitted to me. To this purpofe, gettipg a kind of a 
letter of naturalization, 1 purchafed as much land, that 
was uncured^ as my money would reach ; and formed a 
plan for my plantation and fettlement, and fuch an one 
as might be fuitable to the Itock which I propofed to my- 
felf to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguefe of Lifbon, but born 
of Englilh parents, whofe name was Wells, and in much 
fuch circumftances as I was. 1 call him neighbour, be- 
caufe his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on 
very fociably together ; my ftock was but low, as well 
as his ; and we rather planted for food than any thing 
clfe, for about two years. However,we began to incre&fe, 
and our land began to come into order ; fo that the third 
year we planted fome tobacco, and made each of us a 
large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the 
year to come ; but we both wanted help ; and now I 
found more than before, I had done wrong in parting 
with my boy Xury, 

But alas 1 for me to do wrong that never did right, was 
no great wonder ; I had no remedy but to go on ; 1 wa» 
gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius, 
and diredlly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for 
which I forfook my father's hotife, and broke through all 
his good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very mid- 
dle ftation, or upper degree of low life, which my father 
advifed me to before, and which, if I reiblved to go on 
with, I might as well have ftaid at home, and never fa- 
tigued myfelf in the world, as I have done ; and I ufed 
often to fay to myfelf, { could have done this as well in 
England among my friends, as have gone five thouf&nd 
miles off, to do it artiong flrangers and favages, in a wil- 
dernefsi and at fuch a diftance as never to hear from any 
part of the world that had the leaft knowledge of me. , 

In this manner I ufed to look upon my condition with 
the utmoft regret. I had nobody to converle with but 
now and then this neighbour ; no work to be done but 
by the labour of my hands ; and I ufed to fay, I liv^d

juft like a man cad away upon fome defolate iiland, that 
had nobody there but himfelf : but how juft has it been, 
and how fhouldT all men refieft, that when they compare 
their prefent condition with others that arc wodc, heaven 
may oblige them to make thp exchange, and be con- 
vinced of their former felicity, by their experience 1 I 
faw how juft it has been, that the truly folitary life I re- 
fledbed on in an iiland, or mere defolation, ihould be my 
lot, who had fo often unjuilly compared it with the life 
which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in 
all probability, been exceeding profperous and rich ! , 

I was in fome degree fettled in my meafurii^ for carry- 
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend the Captain 
of the {hi p that took me up at fea, went back ; for the 
4hip remained there in providing her loading, and pre- 
paring for her voyage, near three months ; when telling 
iiim what little ftock I had left behind me in London, 
4ie gave me this friendly' and iincere advice :— Signior 
^nglefe, fays he (fbrfo he always called me), if you will 
^ive me letters, and a procuration here, in form to me, 
'with -orders to the perfon who has your money in Lon- 
»don, to fend your eftc6is toXifbon, to fuch perfons as! 
ihall dire A, and in fuch goods as are proper for this 
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God will- 
ing, at my return ; but fince human affairs are all fub- 
jeCT to changes and difafters, I would have you give 
orders but for one hundred pounds llerling, which you 
fay is half your ftock, and let the hazard be riin for the 
"iirft ; fo that if it comes fafe, you may order the reft the 
fame way ; and if it mifcarries, you may -have the other 
half to have recourfe to for your fupply. 

This was fuch wholefome advice, and looked fo friend- 
ly, that I could not but be convinced it was the bell 
courfe. I could take ; fo I accordingly prepared letters to 
the gentlewoman with-whom I had left my money, and 
a procuration to the Portuguefe Captain, as he deftred. 

I wrote the Englifli Captain's widow a full account 
of all my adventures, my ftavery, efcape, and how I 
had met with the Portugal Captain at fea, the humanity 
of his behaviour, and w:hat condition I was now in, with 
all other neceftary direftioiis for my fupply ; and when 
this honeft Captain came to Lift>onj he found means, by 

fome

fome of the Englifh merchant^ there, to fend over not 
the order only, but a full account of my ilory to a mer- 
chant at London, who prefentwl it effeftually to her ;— 
whereupon , ihe not only delivered the money, biit out 
of her own pocket fent the Portugal Captain a very hand-- 
foraeprefent for his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London veiled this hundred pounds in 
Engliih goods, fuch as the Captain had written for ; fent 
them dir^Alyto him at Lifbon, and he brought them all 
fafe to me to the Brafils : among which, without my 
direction (for I was too young in my bufmefs to think of 
them), he had taken care to have all forts of tools, iron- 
work, and utenfils neceflary for my plantation, and 
which were of jcreat ufe to me. 

When this^ cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made,, 
fori was furprized with the joy of it; and my good, 
ftcward, the Captain, had laid out the five pobnds which 
my friend had fent him for a pr^fent for himfelf, tb^ 
pnrchafe, and bring me over a fervant, under bond 
for fix years^ fervice, and would not accept of any cpnii- 
deration, except a little tobacco, which I would have 
him accept, being of my own prodtic?,. 
• Neither was this all ; but my goods, being all Englifh 
Tnanufa<5tures, fuch ?is cloth, (luff, bays, and things par- 
ticularly valuable and deli rable in the country, 1 foundi 
means to fell them to a very great advantage ;: fo that I 
may fay 1 had more than four times the value of my firft^ 
cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neigh- 
bour,.! mean, in the advancement of my plantation.; for 
for the firft thing 1 did, 1 bought me a Negro Have, and. 
an European fervant alfo ;. I mean ant^ther befides that 
which the Captain brought me from Lilbon. 

But as abufed profpenty is oftentimes made the very

fuch as are indeed often the ruin of the befl heads in 
buiinefs. 

Had I continued in the llation I was now in, I had 
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for 
which my father fo eameilly recommended a quiet re- 
tired life, and which he had fo feniibly defcribed the 
middle ftation of life to be full of; but other things at- 
tended me ; and I was ftill to be the wilful agent of all 
my own miferies ; and particularly to increafe my faults, 
and double the reflections upon myielf, which in my fu- 
ture forrows I fhould have leifure to make : all thele 
mifcarriage^ were procured by my apparent obftinate 
adhering to my foolifti inclination of wandering abroad ; 
and purfuing that inclination in contradiction to the 
clearell views of doing myfelf good in a fair and plain 
purfuit of thofe profpefts, and thofe meafures of life, 
which nature and Providence concurred to prefent roe 
with, and to make my duty. 

As I had once done this in breaking away from my 
parents, fo I could not be content now, but I muft go 
and leave the happy view 1 had of being a rich and 
thriving man in my new plantation, only to purfue a 
raih and imftioderate defire of rilincr fafter than the na- 
ture of the thing admitted ; and thus I call myfelf dowa 
again into the deepeft gulph of human mifery that ever 
man fell into, or perhaps could be conliHent with life, and 
a ftate of health in the, world, 

1. To come then, by juft degrees, to the particulars of 
this part of my ftory ; you may fuppofe, that having 
-now lived almoft four years in the Brafils, and beginning 
to thrive and profper very well upon my plantation, I 
had not only learned the language, but had contra<fled 
acquaintance and friendlhip among my fellow planters, 
as well as among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which 
w,as our port ; arid that, in my ^ifcourfe among them, I 
had frequently given them an account of my two voyages 
to the coaft of Guinea, the manner of tradins: with the 
negroes there, and how eafy it was to purchafe upon the 
coaft, for trifles (fuch as beads, toys, knives, fciflars, hat- 
chets, bitsofglafs, and the like) nbt only gold duft, 
Guinea grains, elephants teeth, &c. but negroes for the 
fervice of the BrafUs, in great numbers.

They liftened always very attentively to my difcourfes 
on thole heads, but efpecially to that part which related 
to the buying negroes, which was a trade at that time not 
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been 
carried on by the Affientos, or permiffion of the king of 
Spain and Portugal, and engroffed in the public Hock ; 
fo that few negroes wefe bought, and thofeexceffive dear. 

It happened, being in company one day with fome 
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking 
of thofe things very earneftly, three of them came to me 
the next morning, and told me, they had been muiing 
very much upon what I had difcourfed of with them the 
laft night, and they came to make a fecret propofal to 
me ; and, after enjoining me fecrecy, they told me that 
they had a mind to fit out a fhip to go to Guinea ; that 
they had all plantations as well as I, and were llreight- 
cned for nothing fo much as fervants ; that as it was a 
trade that could not publicly fell the negroes when they 
came home, fo they defired to make but one voyage, 
to bring the negroes on ihore privately,, and divide them 
among their own plantations ; and, in a word, the ques- 
tion was, whether I would go their fupercargo in the 
ihip, to manage the trading part upon the coail of ■ 
Guiuea ? And they offered me, aliat 1 {hould have my 
equal fhare of the negroes, withouft providing any pact 
of the Itock. 

This was a fair propofal, it mud be confefled, had it ' 
been made to any one that had not had a fettle ment and ^ 
plantation of his own to look after, which w^as in a fair 
way of coming to be very confiderable, and with a good 
flock upon it. But for me, that was thus eftablifhed, and 
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three or 
four years more, and to have fent for the other hundred • 
pounds from England, and who in that time, and with th^t 
little addition^ could fcarce have failed of beinsf worth 
three or four thoufand pounds fterling, and that increafmg . 
too ; for me to think of fuch a vojage, was the mo5 
prepoflerous thing that ever man, in fuch circumllancts, 
could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own dellroyer, could 
no more relift the oMer than 1 could reft rain my firft 
rambling defigns, when mv father's good • counfel was ^

loft upon me. In a word, I told them 1 would go with 
all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my 
plantation in my abfence^ and would difpofe of it to fucn 
as I fhould diredt, if I mifcarried. I'his they all en- 
gaged to do, 'an.d entered into writings, or covenants, to 
do fo i and I made a formal will, difpoiing of my plan- 
tation and effefts, in cafe of my death, making the Cap- 
tain of the (hip that had faved my life, as before, my uni- 
vcrfal h^ir, but obliging him to difpofe of my eff'e^s as I 
had diredted in my will ; one half of the produce being 
to himfelf, and the other to be (hipped to England. 

Jn ihort, I took all poffible caution to preferve my ef- 
fefts, and to keep up my plantation. Had I ufed half as 
much prudence to have looked into my own intereftj and 
have made a judgment of what 1 ought to have, done, 
and not to "have done, I had certainly never gone away 
from fo profperous an undertaki/ig ; leaving all the pro- 
bable views of a thriving circumftance, and gone upon a 
voyage to fea, attended with all its common hazards ;— 
to fay nothing of the realbns I had to expe<5t particular 
misfortunes to myfelf. 

But 1 was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the di6bates 
of my fancy, rather than my reafon ; and accordingly 
the ihip being fitted but, and the cargo finiihed, and all 
things done as by agreement, by my partners in the voy- 
age ; I went on board in an evil hour again ^ the 1ft of 
September, 1659) being the fame day eight years that I 
went from my father and mother at Hull, in orcier to aft 
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own 
intereft. 

Our fhip was about one hundred and twenty tons bur* 
then, carried fix guns and fourteen men, befides the mat- 
ter, his boy, and myfelf. We had on board no large 
cargo of goods, except fuch toys as were fit for our trade 
with the negroes ; fuch as beads, bits of glafs, fhells, and 
odd trifles ; efpecially little looking-glaffes,^ knives, fcif- 
fars, hatchets, and the like. 

The fame day I went on board we fet fail, ftanding 
away to the northward upon our own coafts, with deiign 
to ftretch over for the African coaft, when they came in 
about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, 
it feems, was the maimer of their courfc in thofe days.— 
3 We 



AOVBNTURES OP ROBlNSbK^ CRUSOK, 

We had very good weather, only exceffive hot, all the 
way upon our own coaft, till we came to the height of 
Cape St. Auguftino ; from whence^ keeping fartner off 
at fea, we loll iight of land, and ileered as if wfe were 
bound for the iile Femand de Noronba, holding our 
Gourfe N. E. by N. and leaving thofe ifies on the Eafl. 
In this courle we pafled the line in about twelve day's 
time, and were, by our laft obfervation, in feven degrees 
twenty-two min. northern latitude, when a violent tor- 
nado or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge ; it 
began from the fouth-eail, came about to'the north-weft, 
and then icttled in the horth-eaft, from whence it blew 
in fuch a terrible manner, that for twelve days together 
we could do nothing but drive ; and fcudding away be- 
fore it, let it carry us" wherever fate, and the fury of the 
winds, direAed ; and during thefe twelve days I need not 
Xay that I exped^ed every day to be fwnllowed up ; nor 
did any in thefhipexpcft to fave their livbs. 

Jn this 'diftrefs we had^ befides the terror of a ftorm,. 
one of oar men died of the calenture, and a man and a* 
boy wafhed over-board. About the twelfth day, the 
"weather abating a little, the mailer made an obfervation . 
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven 
degrees of north latitude, but that he was twenty-two 
degrees of longitude difference weft from Cape 8t. Au- 
guftinp, fo that he found he was gotten upon the coaii 
of Guiana, or the north part of Brafil, beyond the river 
Amazones, towards that of the river Ordonoque, com- 
monly called the Great River; and now he began to 
confult with me what courfe he ftiould take, for the fhip • 
was leaky, and very much difabled ; ^nd he was for 
going diredily back to the coaft of Braiil. 

I was pofttively againft that, and, looking over the 
charts of the fea coaft of America with him, we concluded 
there was no inhabited country for us to have recourfe to, 
till wc came within the circle of the Caribbee Iflands, and 
therefore relblved to ftand away for Barbadoes, which, 
by keeping off at fea, to avoid the indraught of the bay 
or gulph of Mexico, we might eailly perform, as we 
hoped, in about fifteen days fail ; whereas we could not 
poflibly m«ike our voyage to the codft of Africa without 
IbmeaSiftance both to our fhip acd to ourfelves.

38 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOl. 

With this defign we changed our courfe, and fleered' 
away N. W. by W. in order to reach fome of our Eng* 
lilh iflands, where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was* 
otherwife determined ; for, being in the latitude of twelve 
deg. eighteen min. a fecond llorm came upon us, which 
carried us away with the fame impetuofity weftward^ 
and drove us lb out of the very way of all human com- 
merce, that had all our lives been faved, as to the fea, wc 
were rather in danger of being devoured by favages, than 
ever returning to our own country. 

In this diftrefs, the win^ flill blowing very hurd, one 
of our men early one morning cried out land ; and we 
had no fooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes 
of feeing whereabouts in the world we were, but the fhip 
llruck upon a fand, and in a moment, her motion being 
lb flopped, the fea broke over her in fuch a manner that 
we expedled we fhould all have perifhed immediately ; 
and we were even driven into our clofe quarters^ to IheU 
tcr us from the very foam and fpray of the fea. 

It is not eafy for any one, who has not been in th« 
like condition, to defcribe or conceive the confternation 
of men in fuch circumftances ; we knew nothing where 
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven; 
whether an ifland or the main, s whether inhabited or 
not inhabited ; and, as the rage of the wind was ftill' 
great, though, rather lefs than at firft, we could not fo 
much as hope to have the fhip hold out many minutes 
without breaking in pieces, unlefs the winds, by a kind 
of miracle, fhould turn immediately about. In a word, 
we fat looking one upon another, and expecting death 
every moment, and every man adling accordingly, as 
preparing for another world; for there was little or 
nothing, more for us to do in this. That which was 
our prefent con^'brt, and all the comfort we had, was^ 
that, contrary to our expectation, the fhip did not 
break yet, and that the mafler faid the wind began to 
abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little 
abate, yet the fhip, having thus flruck upon .the fand, 
and fticking too faft for us to expeA her getting, off, we 
were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to 
do but to think of faving our lives as well as we could.— 

We 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

Wc had a boat at our ftern jufl beforjC the ftorm ; but 
(he was firft llaved by dafhing againft the fhip's rudder, 
^nd, in the next place, ihe broke aWay, and either funk, 
or was driven off to fea ; fo there was no hope from her : 
we had another boat on board, but how to get her ofF into 
the fea was a doubtful thing. However, there was nq 
room to debate ; for we fancied the fhip would break 'in 
pieces every minute ; and fome told us flie was adlually 
broken already. 

In this diftrefs the mate of our veiTel lays hold of the 
boat, and with the help of the reft of the men, they got 
her flung over the (hip's fide ; and getting all into her, let' 
go, an4 committed ourfelves, being eleven in number, to 
God*s mercy and the wild fea ; for though the florm was 
abated confidcrably, yet the fea went dreadfully high 
upon the fhore, and might well be called Den wild Zee, 
as the Dutch call the fea in a ftorm. 

And now our cafe was very difmal indeed ; for we all 
faw plainly that the fea went fo high, that the boat 
could not efcape, and that we fhould be inevitably 
drowned. As to making fail we had none, pov, if w^c 
bad, could we have done any thing with it : fo w« 
worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy 
hearts, like men going to execution ; for we all kn^w that 
•when the boat came near the fhore, fhe would be dafhed 
in a thoufand pieces by the breach of the fea. However, 
-we committed our fouls to God iii the moll earned man- 
ner; and the wind driving us towards the fhore, we 
haftened our deftrudion with bur own hands, pulling, as 
"well as we could, towards land. 

What the fhore was, whether rock or fand, whether 
fleep or fhoal, we knew not ; the only hope that could 
rationally give us the lead fhadow of expedlation was, 
if we might happen |nto fome bay or gulph, or the mouth 
of fome river, where by great chance \ve might have run 
our boats in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps 
made fmooth water. But there was nothing of this 
appeared ; but as we made nearer and nearer the fliore, 
the land looked 'more frightful than the fea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league 
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain- 
like

like, came rolling aftern of us, and plainly bid us cxpeft 
the coup de grace. In a Word, it took us with fuch a 
fury, that it overfet the boat at once ; and feparating us as 
well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time 
hardly to fay, O God ! for we were all fwallowed up in 
a moment. . 

Nothingr can defcribe the confuiion of thought which 
1 felt when I funk into the water; for though 1 fwam 
very well, yet I could not deliver myfelf from the waves 
fo as to draw breath, till that wave having driven mei or 
rather carried me a vaft way on towards the ihore, and 
having f])ent itfelf, went back, and left me upon the land 
almoft dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I- 
had fo much prefence of mind, as well as breath left, 
that, feeing myfelf nearer the main land than 1 expedied, 
I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on to- 
wards the land as fad as I could, before another wave 
ihould return and take me up again. But I foon found 
it was impoffible to avoid it ; for J faw the fea come after 
me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, 
which I had no means or llrength ^o contend with : my 
buiinefs was to hold my breath, and raife myfelf upon: 
the water, if I could, and fo by fwimmingto preferve my 
breathing, and pilot myfelf towards the (hore, if poilible ; 
my greatell concern now being, that the wave, as it 
would carry me a great way towards the fhore when it 
came on, might not carry me back again with it, Ayhenit 
gave back towards the fea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and J could 
feel myfelf carried with a mighty force and fwiftnefs- 
towards the Ihore a very gieat way ; but I held my 
breath, and aflilled myfelf to fwim ftill forward with 
all my might. , I was ready to buril with holding ray ' 
breath, when, as 1 found myfelf rifing up, fo, to my 
immediate relief, I found my head and hands (hoot 
out above the furface of the water ; and though it was 
not two feconds of time that I could keep myfelf fo, 
yet it relieved me greatly; gave me breath and new 
courage. I was covered again with water a good 
while, but not folong but 1 held it out : and finding the 
water had fpent itfelf> and began to return, I itruck 

forward ^

forward a^jtinft the return of the waves, and felt 
ground agai^ with my 1^, I flood flill a few moments 
to recover breath, and till the waters went from me, and 
then I took to my heels, and ran with what ftrength I 
had farther towards the fhore. But neither would thii 
deliver me from the fury of the fea, which came pouring 
after me again, and twice more 1 was lifted up by th€ 
waves, and carried forwards as before, the fhore being 
very flat. 

The lail tiitie of thefe two had well near been fatal 
to me ; for the fea, having nurried me along as before, 
landed me, or rather dafhed me, againft a piece of a 
rock, and thai: with fuch force, as it Iclt me fenfelefs, and 
indeed helpjjti^fs, as to mine own deliverances ; for the 
blow, taking my fide and breaft, beat the breath as it 
were quite out of my body ; and had "it returned again 
immediately, J muft have been ftrangled in the water ; ^ 
but I recovered a little before the return of the waves ; 
and feeing l^ould be covered again with the water, I 
rcfolved to hold fafl by a piece of the rock, and fo to 
hold my breath, if poiTible, till the wave went badk. 
Now as^ the waves were not fo high as at firfl, being 
near land, I kept my hold till- the waves ablated ; and 
fhen fetched another run, which brought mefo near the 
fhore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet 
did not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away ; and the 
next run I took I got to the main land, where, to my 
great comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the fhore, and 
fat me down upon the grafs, free from danger, and quite 
out of jhe reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and fafe on fhore, and began to 
look up and thank God, 'that my life was laved in a 
cafe wherein there was, fome minutes before, fcarce any 
room to hope. I believe it is impoffible to exprefs to the' 
life what the extaiies and traniports of the foul are 
when it is fo faved, as I may lay, out of the very grave ; 
and I do not wonder now at that cuftom, viz. that 
when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, 
is tied up, and juft going to be turned "olf, and has a 
reprieve brought to him ; I fay I do not wonder that 
they bring a furgeon with it, to let him blood that very 
moment they tell him of it, that the furprife may not

him* 

For fadden joyS) like grtefs^ confdund at'firfl. 

I walked about on the fhore, lifting up my hands^ 
and my whole being, as I may lay, wrapt up in the 
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thoufand 
geftures and motions which I cannot defcribe, refledting, 
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there 
ihould not be one foul faved but myfelf ; for as for thera 
1 never faw them afterwards, or anylign of them, except 
three of their hats, one cap, and two Ihoes that were not 
fellows. 

I call my eyes to the flrandcd vefTel, when the breacb 
and froth of the fea being fo big, I could hardly fee it, it 
lay fo farofF; arKl confidcrcd, Lord, how wa« it poffible 
1 could get on Ihore ! 

After I had folaced my mind with the comfortable 
pnrtof my condition, I began to look round me to fee 
what kind of place I was in, and what was the next to 
be done ; and I foon found my comforts abate, and that^ 
in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance ; for i was wet^ 
had no clothes to fhift me, nor any thing either to eat or 
drink to comfort me ; neither did I fee any profpc^ be- 
fore me but that of periihing with hunger, or being de- 
voured by wild bealls. And that which was particu- 
larly afHiaing to me was, that I had no w*eapon either to 
hunt or kill any creature for my fuilcnance, or to defend 
myfelf againft any other creature that might defire to kill 
me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a 
knife, a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a bo± ; this 
was all my provi{io;i, aiid this threw me into terrible 
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a mad- 
man. Night coming upon me, I began, with an heavy 
heart, to confider what would be my lot, if there were 
any ravenous beads in that country, feeing at night they 
always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that^ offered to my thoughts at that 
tfme was, to get up into a thick bufhy tree like a fir, but 
thorny, which grew near me, and where 1 refolved to fit 
all night, and conlider the next day what death I (hould

die ; for as yet I faw no profpedi of life. I walked 
about a furlong from the fhore, to fee if I could find any 
frefli water to drink, which 1 did, to my great joy ; 
and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth, 
to prevent hunger, 1 went to the tree ; and, getting up 
into it, endeavoured to place myfelf'fo as that, if I 
lliould lleep, I might not fall ; and, having cut mc 
a ihort ftick like a truncheon for my defence, I took up 
my lodging ; and having been exceffively fatigued, I fell 
fall alleep, and flept as comfortably as I believe few 
could have done in my condition ; and found myfelf the 
moft refrefhed with it, that I think 1 ever was on fuch an 
occaiion . 

When I awaked it was broad day, the weather clear, 
and the ftorm abated, fo that the fca did not rage and 
fwell as before. But that which furprifed me moil was, 
that the ihip was lifted off in the night from the fand 
where ihe lay, py the fwelling of the tide, and was 
driven up almofl as far as the rock, which I firft men- 
tioned, Avhere I hkd been fo bruifed by the dafhing me 
againft it : this being within about a mile from the fliorc 
where I was, and the Ihip Iceming to (land up ftill, I 
wiihed myfelf on board, that at leaft I might have Ibmc 
necclTary things for my ufe. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I 
looked about me again ; and thcfirll thing 1 found was 
the boat, which lay as the wind and the fca had tofled 
her upon the land, about two miles to my right hand. I 
walked as far as I could upon the, fhore to have got to 
her ; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and 
theljojlt, which was about half a mile broad ; fo I came 
back for the prefent, being more intent upon getting at 
the Ihip, where 1 hoped to find fomething for my prefent 
fubfiftencc. 

A little after noon I found the fea very calm, and 
the tide ebbed fo far out, that I could come within a 
quarter of a mile of the fhip. And here 1 found a freih 
renewing of my grief; for I faw evidently, that if we 
had kept on board, we had been all fafe ; that is to fay, 
wc had all got fafe on fhore, and I had not been fo mi'- 
ferable as to be left entirely dcftitute of all comfort and 
company as I how was. This forced tears from my

ewaffain; but as there was Jittle relief in that, I re- 
fulvxd, if pofliblc, to get to the (hip ; fo I pulled off my 
clothes (for the weather was hot to an extreme) and took 
to the water; but when I carhe to the fhip, my difficulty 
was ftill greater to know how to get on board ; as ihe 
lay a<^ound and high out of the water, there -was no- 
'thin<»" within my reach, tglay hold of, 1 (warn round 
her twice, and the fecond time I efpied a fmall piece of 
rope, which I wondered I did not fee at iirft, hang down 
by the fore-chains, fo low, as with great difficulty I got 
hold of it ; and, by the help of that rope, got up into 
the forecallle of the ihip. Here I found that the fhip 
was bilged, and a great ded of water in the hold ; but 
that (he lay fo on the fide of a bank of hard fand, or 
rather earth, that her ftern lay lifted up upon the bank, 
and her head low almoil to the water ;. by this means all 
her quarter was free, and all that was in that part Was 
dry ; for you may be fure my work was to fearch, and 
to fee what was fpoiled, and what -Was free. And firfl I 
found that all the ihip's provifions werQ dry, and un- 
touched by the water ; and, being very well difpofed to 
cat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with 
bifcuit, and eat it as I went about other thmgs, for I had 
no time to lofe. I alfo found forae rum in the great cabin, 
of which I took a large dram, and which In ad indeed 
need enough of, to fpirit me for what was before me. 
Kowl wanted nothing but a boat to fumiih myfelf with 
many things which I forefaw would be very necelTary to 
me; 

It was in vain to fit dill, and wifh for what was not 
to be had; and this extremely roufed my application. 
We had feveral fpare yards, and two or three large 
fpars of wood, and a fpare top-maft or two in the 
fhip ; I refolved to fall to work with theie, and tiung 
as many of them overboard as I could manage for their 
weight, tying ever)^ one with a rope, that they might 
not drive away. When this was done, I went down 
the {hip's fide, and pulling them to me, I tied four of 
them faft together at both ends as well as I could, in 
the form of a raft ; and laying two or three fhort 
pieces of plank upon them crofsways, I found I could 
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bcaV

any great weight, the pieces being too light. So I went 
to work, and with a carpenter's faw I cut a fpare top- 
maft into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with 
a great deal of labour and pains ; but the hope of fur- 
nifliing myfelf with neceHaries, encouraged me to go be- 
yond what I ihould have been able to have done upon 
another occaiion. 

My raft was now ftrong enough to bear any reafon- 
able weight ; my next care was what to load it with, 
and how to prel'erve what I laid upon it from the furge 
of the fea. But I was not long conlidering this ; I firft 
laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get ; 
and having conlidered well what 1 moll Wanted, I firfl 
got three of the feamen's chefts, which I had broken 
open and emptied, and lo^wered them down upon my 
raft ; the firil of thefe J filled with proviiions, vii. 
bread, rice^ three Dutch cheefes, five piepes of dried 
goat's fle(h, which we lived much upon, and a little 
remainder of European ^om, which had been laid by 
for ibme fowls which we brought to fea with us, but 
the fowls were killed ; there had been fo'me barley and 
wheat together ; but, tb my great difapijointment, I 
found afterwards that the rats had eaten or ipoiled it 
all. As for liquors, 1 found feveral cales of bottles 
belonging to our fkipper, in which were fome cordial 
waters, and. in all about five or fix gallons of arrack ; 
thefe I ^owed by themfelves, there being no need to 
put them into the cheft, or any room for them. While 
I was doihg this, I found the tide began to flow, though 
very calm ; and I had the mortification to fee my coat, 
fliirt, and waiflcoat, which 1 had left on Ihore upon 
- the fand, fwim away: as for my breeches, which were 
only linen, and open-kneed, I fwam on board in them 
and my ffockings. However, this put me upon rum- 
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took 
no more than J wanted for the preient ufe, for 1 had other 
things which my eye was more upon ; as firil, tools 
to work with on ihore ;,and it was after long fearch- 
ing that I found out the carpenter's chefl, which was 
indeed a very ufeful prize to me, and^ much more valu- 
able than a (nip laden with gold would have been at that 
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was,

one of the fowling pieces, and one of the piftols^ and a 
horn of of powder ; and thus armed, I travelled for dif- 
covery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with 
great labour and difficulty got up, I immediately faw my 
late, to my great afHi6tion ; viz. that I was in an idan^ 
environed every way with the lea, no land to be feen ex- 
cept fome rocks, which lay ^ great way off, and two 
I'mall idands lefs than this, which lay about three leagues 
to the weft. ' ^ 

I found alfo that the idand I was in was barren, and, as 
I faw good reafon to believe, uninhabited, except by wild 
beafts, of which, however, I faw none ; yet I faw abun- 
dance of fowls, but knew not their kinds ; neither when I 
killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what 
not. At my coming back, I ihot at a great bird which 
I faw litting upon a tree on the iide of a large wood : I 
believe it was the firft gun that had been fired there fince 
the creation of the world. I had no fooner fired, but 
from all the parts of the wood there arofe an extraordi- 
nary number of fowls of many forts, making a confufed 
fcreaming and crying, every one according to his ufual 
note ; but not one of them of any kind that I knew : as 
for that creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a 
hawk, its colour and beak refembling it, but it had no 
talons or claws more than common ; its fleih was carrion» 
and fit fpr nothing. 

Contented with this difcovery, I came back to my raft, 
and fell to work to bring my cargo on (bore, which took 
me up the reft of the day. What to do with* rayfelf at 
night I knew not, nor indeed where to reft ; for I was 
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing, but fome 
wild beaft might devour me ; though I afterwards found 
there was really no need for thofe fears'. . , 

However, as well as I could I barricadoed myfdf round 
with the chefts and boards that I had brought on ihore, 
and made a kind of an hut for that night's lodging. As 
for food, I yet. faw not which way to fupply myfelf, ex- 
cept that I had feen two or three creatures like hares run 
out of the wood where I ihot the fowl. 

I now began to confider that 1 might yet g^t a great 
many things out of the ihip, which -^ould be ufeful 
to me» ackd particularly fome of the rigging and faili, 

and

and fucli other things as might corht to hand ; and I le- 
Iblved to make another voyage on board the vefTcl, if ])of- 
fible : and as I knew that the firft ftorm that blew muft 
neceflarily break her all in pieces, I refolved to fet all 
other things apart, till I got every thing out of the fhip 
that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to fr.v, 
in my thoughts, whether I fliould take back the raft; but 
this appeared impracticable; fo I refolved to go as before 
when the tide was down ; and I did fo, only that I 
Gripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on 
kut a chequered flrirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair 
of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the fhip as before, and prepared a fecond 
raft ; and having had experience of the lirlt, 1 neither 
made this fo unwieldy, nor loaded it fo hard ; but yet I 
brought away feveral things very ufeful to me ; as firll, 
in the carpenter's ftore I found two or three bags full of 
nails and fpikes, a great fcrew jack, a dozen or two of 
hatchets, and, above all, that moft ufeiul thing called a 
grinddone. All thefe I fecured, together with feveral 
things belonging to the gunner, particularlj'^ two or three 
ifon crows, and two barrels of muikct bullets, iQ\^n 
mulkets, and another fowling piece, with ibme fmall 
quantit}^ of powder more, a large bag full of fmall {hot, 
and a great roll of iheet of lead ; but this lafi: was fo heavy 
I could not hoift it up to get it over the fliip's fuie. 

Betides thefe things, I took all the men's clothes that 
I could find, and'a fpare fore-top fail, hammock, and 
fonie bedding ; and with this I loaded my fecond raft, 
and brought them alfo all fafe on fhore, to my very great 
comfort. 

I was under fome apprehcnfions, during my ab fence 
from the land, that at lead my ])rovii]ons might be de- 
voured on fhore ; but when 1 came back, I found no fign 
ff any vifiter, only there fat a creature like a- wild cat, 
upon one of the chdls, which, v/hen I came towards it, > 
ran away to a little diftance, and then ilood itill ; flie fat 
very compofed and unconcerned, and looked full in my

of thofe knives is worth all this heap ; I have no manner

'the bottom, as a creature whofe life is not worth favhig. 

However, upon fecond thoughts, I took it away ; and 

wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think 

of making another raft ; but while I was preparing this, 

I found the fky overcaft, and the wind began to rife, and 

Jn a qufarter of an hour it blew a frefh gale from the 

. Ihore. It prefently occurred to me, that it was in vain 

to pretend to make a raft, with the wind off ihore ; and 

thai it was my bufinefsto be gone before the tide of flood 

.began, otherwife I might not be able to reach the ihore 

retail ; accordingly 1 let myfelf down into the water, and 

fwam acrofs the channel which lay between the ihip and 

the fand, and even that with difficulty enough, partly 

with the weight of the things I had about -me^ and 

partly the roughnefs of the water, for the wind rofe very 

haftily, and before it was quite high water, it blew a 

ftorm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay, 
with all my Wealth about me, very iecure. It blew very 
hard all that night;, and in the morning, when 1 looked 
out, behold no more Ihip was to be feen. I was a 
little furprifed, but recovered myfelf with this fatisfac- 
tory refiedlion, viz. that I had loft no time, nor abated 
any diligence to get every thing out of her that could 
be ufeful to me; and that indeed there was little left 
in her that I was able to bring away, if I had y^t 
' more time. I now gave over any more thought of 
the ihip, or of any thing out of her,, except what might 
drive on ihore from her wreck ; as indeed divers pieces of 
her afterwards did, but tkofe things were of fmall ufe to 
me.

* My thoughts were now wholly employed aboirt fecur- 
ing myfelf againft either favages, if any fhould appear, or 
wild beads, if any were in the iflaml ; and I had niany 
thoughts of a method how to do this, and what kind of 
dwelling to make, whether I ^ould make me a cjive in 
the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in fliort, I re- 
folvcd upon both, the manner and defcriprion of which*lt 
may not be improper to give an account of. 

I foon found the place I was in was not for my fettle- 
n^ent, particularly becaufe it was upon a low mooriib 
ground near the lea, and I believed would not be whol- 
fome, and more particularly becauie there was no water 
near it ; lb I re oh ed to find a more h^akhy and more 
convenient fpot of ground. 

1 coniultedfeveral things in my fituation which I found 
Would be proper for me ; firil, health, and freih water, as 
I juft now mentioned ; fecondly, (belter from the heat o^ 
the fun ; thirdly, fecurity from ravenous creatures, whe- 
ther man or bead ; fourthly a view to the fea, that if 
God fent any (hip in fight, I might not lofe any advan- 
tage of my deliverance, for which I was not willing to 
banifli ray expectation yet. 

In fearch-of a place proper for this, I found a little 
plain on the iide of a riiing hill, whofc form towards 
this little plain was ai« lleep as an houfe Iide, fo thAt 
nothing could come down upon me from the top. On 
the fide of this rock there' was an hollow place, Worn a 
little^ way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, but 

there was not really any cave or way into the rock at 

all. 

On the flat of the greeh, juft before this hollow place, 
1 refolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above 
a hundred yards broad, and about, twice as long, and 
lay like a green before^the door, and it the end of it de- 
fcended irregularly every way down into the low grounds 
by the lea -Iide. It was on the N» N , W. Iide of the hill, 
fo that it was fheltered from the heat every day, till it 
came to a W. and by St fun, or thereabouts, which in 
thofe couptries is near the fettixg. 

Before 1 fet up my tent^ 1 drew an half circle before 
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its

58 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 

Without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any maniler of co- 
vering ? And that now I had all thefe to a fufficient quan- 
tity, and was in a fair way to provide myfelf in fuch a 
manner, as to live without my gun when my ammuni- 
tion was fpent ; fo that 1 had a tolerable view of fubfifting 
"without any want as Ipng- as I lived ; for I eonfidered, 
from the beginning, how I Ihould provide for the acci- 
dents that rhight happen, and for the time that was to 
come, even not only after my ammunition fhould belpent, 
but alfo after my health or flrength fhould decay. 

I confefs I had not then entertained any notion of my 
ammunition being deftroyed at one blaft, I mean my 
powder being blown up by lightning ; and this made the 
thoughts of it furprizing to me, when it lightened and 
thundereJd, as I obferved juft now. 

,And notv, bein^to enter into a melancholy relation of 
a fcene of filent fife, fuch perhaps as was never heard of 
in the world before ; I fhall take it from its beginning, 
and continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 
3 0th of September, when, in the manner as above faid, 
1 firft fet foot upon this horrid ifland, wh^n the fun. being 
to us in its autumnal equinox, was almoft juft over 
my head ; for 1 reckoned myfelf, by obfervation, to be 
in the lotitude of 9 degrees and 52 minutes fouth of the 
line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came 
into my thoughts, that I fhould lofe my reckoning of time 
for want of books, and pen,*hnd ink, and fhould even 
forgetthe fabbath days from the working days : but -to 
prevent this, 1 cut it with my knife upon a large poft in 
capital letters, and making it into a great crofs, I fet it 
up on the fhore where I fim landed, viz. 1 came on (hore 
here, the 30th of September j 1659. " Upon the fides of 
this fquare poft I cut every day a notch with my knife, 
and every feventh notch was as long again as the reft, and 
every firft day of the month as long again as that long 
one ; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, 
and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next place we are to obferve, that among the 
many things thatrl brought from the fhip in the feve- 
jral voyages ,wh»cb, as above mentioned, I made to it, I

STot feveral things of lefs value, but not at all lefs ufeful 
to me, which I omitted fetting down before ; as in par- 
ticular pens, ink, and paper, feveral parcels in the cap- ' 
tain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three 
or four compailes, fome mathematical inftruments, dials^ 
pcrfpeftives, charts, and books of navigatiorii all which 
I huddled together, whether 1 might want them' or ndt.. 
I alfo found three very good bibles, which came to nve 
iri my cargo from England, and which I had packed up 
among ray things j fome ^Portuguefe books alfo, and 
among them two or three popifli prayer-books, and feve^ 
ral other books, all which I carefully fecured. ' And I 
mud not forget, that we htvd in the fhip a dog and two 
cats, of whofe eminent hiftory I mufl haveoccaiionto fay 
fomething in its place ; for I carried both the cats with 
me; and as f6r the dog, he jumped out of the ihip of 
himfelf, and fwam on Ihore to me the day> after I went on 
fhore with my firft cargo, ami was a trulty fervant to me . 
many years. .1 wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he • co'uld make up to me ; I only 
wanted to have him. talk to me, but that he could not do, 
-As I obferved before, I found pens j ink, and paj)fer, ami 
I hufbandied them to the utmoft ; and I fhall Ihew that,. 
while my ink laftedj I kept things very exadl, but after / 
that was gone, I could not ; for I could not make any. 
ink by any mean^ that I could get; 

And this put me in mind that I wanted mtiny things, 
notwithftanding all that 1 had amaffcd together ; and of 
thefe, this of ink is one ; as alfo a fpade, pick-axe, and 
(hovel, to dig or remove the earth ; needles, pins, and 
thread ; as for linen, I foon learned to want that -without 
much <lifficulty. . 

This want of tools made every work I did go on.: 
heavily ; and it was near a whole year t)efore I had en- 
tirely finifhed my little pale, or furrounded habitation. 
The piles, or ftakesj which were as heavy as 1 could 
well lift, were a long time in. cutting and preparing in 
the woods, and more by far in bringing home ; fo that 
I fpent fometimes two days in cutting and bringing home 
one of thofe pofts, and a third day in.xlriving it into-the 
ground ; for which purpofe 1 got -a heavy piece of 
wood at firft, but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the

njade driving thofe poi^s, or piles, very laborious and 
tedious work. 

But what need '•1 to have been concerned at the tedioul^ 
riefs of any thing I had to do, feeing 1 had time enough 
to do it in ? Nor had 1 any other employment, if that had 
been over, at lealt that I c0uld forefee, exce)pt the rang- 
ing the ifland to feek for food, which 1 did more or lefs 
every day. 

I now began ferioufly to coniider my condition, and 
the circumftances I was reduced to, and I drew up the 
ftate of my affairs in writing ; not fo much to leave them 
to any that were to come after me, for I was like to have 
but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from daily por- 
ing upon them, and afflicting my mind. And as my 
rcafon began now to mafter my defpondency, I b^gan to 
comfort myfeU'as well as I could, and to fet the good 
againil the evil, that I might have fomething to difiin- 
guifh my cafe from wprfe ; and I dated it very impartial Iy»

there ? 

I have no foul to fpeak But God wonderful]}^ fent

fliore, that 1 have gotten out 

fo many neceflary things as 

will either fupply my wants^ 

'\ or enable me to fupply my- 

felf, even as long as Wve. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted teftimony, 
that there was fcarce any condition in the world fo mi- 
ferable, but there was fomething negative, or fomething 
politive, to be thankful in it ; and' let this ftand as a 
dire^ion from the experience of the mod miferabls of all 
conditions in this world, that we may always find in it 
fomething to comfort ourfelves from, and to fet in the 
defcription of good and evil, on the credit fide of the 
account. . ^ 

Having now brought my mind a little to relifh my con* 
dition, and giving over looking out to fca, to fee if I could 
fpy a fhip ; 1 fay, giving over thefe things, I began to 
apply myfelf to accommodate my way of living, and to 
roak^ things as eafy as I could. 

I have already defcribed my habitation, which was a 
tent under the llde of a rock, furrounded with a Urong 
pale of pofts and cables, but I might now rather call it 
a wail ; for I raifed a kind of wall up againll it of turfs, 
about two feet thick on the outfide ; and after fome time, 
I think it was a year and a half, 1 raifed rafters from 
it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with 
^ough? of trees, and fuch things as I could get to keep 
out the rain, whicn I found at fome times of the year very 
violent. 

I have already obferved hoW I brought all my goods 
into this pale, ^nd into thfC cave which I had made be- 
hind me. But 1 mull obferve too, that at firll this w^s 
3 a confufed 



f 



62 ADVENTURES OF R^OBINSON CRUSOE. 

a confufed heap of goods, which, as thfey lay in no order^ 
fo they took up all my place ; I had no room to tunt 
myfelf ; fo I fet myfelf to enlarge my cave, and worked 
farther into the earth ; for it was a loofe fandy rock, 
which yielded eafily to the labour I bellowed on it. And 
fo, when I found 1 was pretty fafe as to beafts of prqy,^ 
I worked iideways to the right-hand into the rock, and 
then turning to the right-hand again, worked quite out> 
and made my door to come out on the outfide of my pal* 
or fortification. 

This gave me not only egrefs and regrefs, as it was a , 
back .way to my tent, and to my ftore-houfe, but gave 
me room to ftow my goods* 

And now I began to apply myfelf to make fuchnecef- 
fary things at I found I moft wanted, particularly a chair 
, and a table ; for without thefe I was not able to enjoy 
the few comforts I had in the world ; I could not write-, , 
or cat, or do feveral things with fo much pleafure, with- 
out a table. 

So Fwent to work : and here I mull needs obferve,^ 
that as reafon is the fubftance and origin of the mathe-^ 
matid, fo, by Itating and fquaring every thing by rea- 
fon ; and by making the moll rational judgment of 
things, every man may be, in time, lYialler of every me- 
chanic art. I had never handled a tool inmyJife, and 
yet in time, by labouT, application, and contrivance, I 
found at lall that I wanted nothing but i could have 
made; it, efpecially if 1 had had tools. However, I made 
abundance of things even without tools, and fome with' 
no more tools- than an adz-e and an hatchet, which per- 
haps were never made that way before, and that with 
infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I had 
no other way but to cut down a tree, fet it on an edge 
before me, and hew it flat on either fide with my axe, titt 
I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub 
itfmooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I 
could nibke but one board out of a whole tree-; but thia^' 
I had no remedy for but patience^ any more than I had 
for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took 
me up to make a pl^nk or board. But my time or labour 
was little vjorth^ and fo it was as well employed one way 
as another, 

' However, 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. G5 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I obferved 
above, in the firft place, and this 1 did out of the fhort 
pieces of boards thatl brought On my rait from the fliip. 
But when I had wrought out fome boards as above, I 
made large ihelves of the breadth of a foot and an half, 
one over another, all along on one fide of my cave, to 
lay all my tools, nails, and iron work ; and, in a word, 
to feparate every thing at large in their places, that I might 
caiily come at them : I alfo knocked pieces into the wall 
of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would 
hang up. 

So that, had my cave been to be feen, it looked like a 
general magazine of all neceflary things ; and I had every 
thing fo ready at hand, that it was a great pleafure to me 
to fee all my goods in fuch order, and efpecially to find 
my. flock of all necefTaries fo great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of 
every day's employment ; for indeed at firft I was in too 
much hurry, and not only an hurry as to labour, but in 
too much difcompofure of mind, and my journal would 
have been full of many dull things. For example,. I 
muft have faid thus : Sept. the 30th, after I got to ihore, 
and had efcaped drowning, inftead of being thankful to 
God" for my deliverance, having firft vomited with a great 
quantity of fait water which was gotten into my ftomach, 
and recovering mylblf a little, 1 ran about the fhore, 
wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, ex- 
claiming at my mifery, and crying out I was undone, 
undone ! till tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on 
the ground for repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being 
devoured. 

Some days after this, and after I had been oiVboard the 
fhip, and had got all I t^ould out of her, yet I could not 
forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and 
looking out to fea, in hopes of feeing a {hip ; then fancy 
at a vaft diftance 1 efpied a fail, pleafe myfelf with the 
hopes of it, and then, after looking fteadily till I was 
almoft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep like a 
child and thus increafe my mifery by my folly. 

But having gotten over thefe things in fome mea-> 
fure, and having fettled my houfehdld ftuff and habita- 
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handfome 

about

SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. 1, poor miferable Roblnfont, 
Crufoe, being fhip wrecked during a dreadful ftorrainv| 
the offing, came en fhore on this difmal and unfortunate ; 
iiland, which I call the iiland of Defpair, all the rcll of 
the fhip' s company being drowned, and myfelf alnK)ft ' 
diead. 

All the reft of the day 1 fpent in alHiding myfelf at the ^' 
difmal circumftances J was brought t6, viz. I had neither 
food, houfe, clothes, utapon, or place to fly to ; and, ni 
defpair of any relief, faw nothing but death betore me, 
cither that I ihould be devoured by wild beads, murdered 
by favages, or ftarved to death for want of food. .At the 
approach, of night, I il^pt in a tree, for fear of wild crea- 
tures but ilept foundry, thou;^h it riuned all night.

the fhip had floated with the high^tide, and, was driven on 
ihore again much nearer the iliand ; which, as it was 
fome comfort, on. one hand, for feeing her lit up-right, 
and not broken in pieces, 1 hoped, if the wind abated, I 
miofht get on board, anol <;^^l fome food and necelfaries 
out of her for ray relief; lb, on the other hand, it renewed 
r my grief, at the lofs of my comrades-, who, I imagined, 
if we had all llaid on board, might have faved the fhip, 
or at leait that they would not have been all drowned as 
they ^verc ; and that, had the men been faved, we might, 
perhaps, have built us a boat out of the ruins of the fhip, 
to have carried us to fome other part of the world. I 
fpent great part of this day in perplexing myfelf on thefe 
things : but at length, feeing the fhip almolt dry, I went 
on the fand as near as I could, and then fwam on board.

From the til of Oftobcr to the 24th. All thcfe days 
^ entirely fpent in making feveral voyages to get all I could 
oot of the ihip, which 1 brought on ihorc every tide pf

With fome intervals of fair weather. But it fcems this 
was the rainy, feafon . 

061. 24. I overlet my raft, and all the goods I had 
got upon it ; but being in flioal water, and the things 
being chiefly heavy, 1 recovered many of theiti when the 
tide was out. 

Od. 25. It rained all ni^ht and all dav, with fome 
gufts of wind, during which time the (hjp broke in pieces, 
the, wind blowing a little harder than before, and was no

at low water. I fpent this day in covering and fecurin^ 
the goo'Js whic]) I had faved, that the rain might not fpoU 
them. 

Od. 26. I walked about the (horc almofl all day to 
find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concemcd 
tofecure myfelf from any attack in the night; either from 
wild beads or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper 
place under a rock, and marked out a fetrii-circlc for ray 
encampment, which I refolved to ftrengthen with a work, 
Wall, or fortification, miide of double piles, lined within 
with cable, and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in car- 
rying all my goods to my new habitation, though fome 
part of the time it rained exceeding hard. 

'The 31fl, in the morning, I went out into the ifland

fo I gave it over : and fo, for carrying away the eartli 
"which I dug out of the cave, \ made me a thing like a 
>hod, which the labourers carry mortar in when they fervc 
the bricklayers. 

This was not fo difficult to me as the makinof of the 
Hiovel ; and yet this, and the ihovel, and the attempt 
which I made in vain to mkke a wheel-barrow, took m?e 
up no lefs than four days ; I mean always, excepting my 
morning's walk with my gurt, whicli I feldom failed ; 
and very feldom failed alfo of bringing home fomething 
fit to eat* ^ 

Nov. 23. My other work having ftood ftill, beeaufc 
of my making thefe tools; wheh they were tiniihed, 1 
went on, and working every day as my llrength and time 
allowed, 1 ipent eighteen days entirely in widening and 
deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods com- 
modiouily. . , 

Note. — During all this time I worked to make thi» 
room, or cave, fpacious enough to accommodate me as a 
warehoufe or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and 
a cellar ; as for a lodging, I kept to the tent, except that 
fomi times, in the wet feafon of the 'year, it rained fo 
hard, that I could not keep myfelf dry ; which caufed: 
me afterwa;^ds to cover: all my pla6e within my pale with 
long poles, in the form of rzifters, leaning againft the rock^. 
and load them with flags, and large leaves of trees, like 
thatch. 

Dec. 10. I began now to think my cave, or vault,^ 
finifhed, when on a fudden (it feems I had made it too 
large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the top^ 
and one fide, fo much, that in fhort it frightened me, and. 
not without reafon to ; for if I had been under it, I had 
never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this difafter 1 had a 
great deal of work to do over again ; for I bad the loofe 
.earth to carry out, and, which was of more importance,. 
I had the deling to prop up, fo that I might be fure no 
more would coxne down. 

Dec. 1 1 . This day 1 went to work with it accordingly, 
and got twd fhoars, or pofts, pitched upright to the top»

and the polls ftandirig in rows, ferved me for partitions 
to j)art of the houfe. 

Dec. 1 7. From this day to the 20th, I placed (helves, 
and knocked up noils in the poils, to hang every thing 
on that couM be hung up: and now I began^to be in 
fome order within doors. 

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave, and 

"began to furniOi ray houfe, and fet up fome pieces of board 

like a drelTer, to order my vi6tuals upon ; but boatd began 

to be very fcarcc/ with me : I alfomade me another table. 

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day ; no ftirrihg out. 

Dec. 25. Rain all day. 

Dec. 26*. No rain, and the earth much cooler than 
before, and pleafanter* 

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat,' and lamed another, fo 
that I catched, and led it home in a ftrinc: • when I had 
it home, I bound and fplintered up its leg which was 
broke. —N. B. I took fuch care of it that it lived, and 
the leg grew well, and as ftrong as ever : but by nurfing 
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the green at my 
-door, and would not go away. This was the firft time 
that I entertained a thought of breeding up fome tame 
creatures, that J might have food when my powder and ^ 
fhot was all fpent. 

Dec. 28, 2.9, 30. Great heats, and no breeze ; fo that 
there was no ftirring abroad, except in the evening, fof 
food. This time I fpent in putting ail my things in order 
within doors. 

January I. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad early and 
late with my gun, and lay ftill in the middle of the day. 
This evening, going further into the valleys, which lay 
towards the center of the ifland, I found there was plenty 
of goats, though exceedingly {hy, and hard to come at : 
however, I refolved to try if 1 could not bring my dog to 
hunt them down. * 

Jan. 2, Accordingly the next day I- went out with 
my dog, and fet him at the goats ; but I was miftaken, 
for they all faced about upon the dog, ^nd he knew his 
danger too well, for he would not go near them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence, or wall, which, being ftill 
jealous of my being attacked by fomcbody, I refolved to 
make very thick and ftcong. 



/ 



y€ ADVENTURE SOF ROBINSON CRUSOt>» 

N- B. This wall being defcribed before, I purpofely 

omit what was faid in the Journal ; it is fufficient 

to obferve, that 1 was no lefs time than from the 

3d of January to the I4th of April, working, finifh- 

ing, and perlfedling this wall, though it was no more 

than about twenty-four yards in length, being an half 

circle, from one place in the rock to another place 

about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being 

in the center behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin3^ring 

tne many days, nay, ibmetimes weeks together ; but I 

thought I ihould never be perfeftly fecure till this wall 

was Hnifhed ; and it is fcarcely credible what inexpref- 

iible labour every thing was done with, efpeciallj the 

bringing piles out of the wood,* and driving them into the 

ground, for 1 made them much bigger than 1 needed to 

have done. 

When this wall was finifhed, and the outfide double- 
fenced with a turf wall raifed up clofe to it, Tperfuaded 
inyfelf, that if any people were to come on fliore there, 
they would not perceive any thing like an habitation : 
and it is very well I did fo, as may be oblerved hereafter, 
'4ipon a very remarkable occafion. 

During this time, 1 made rounds in the woods for gramc 
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made fre- 
quent difcoveries in thol^ walks of fomething or other to 
xi\y advantage ; particularly, I found a kin,d of wild 
pigeoils, which build not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but 
rather as houfe-pigeons, in the holes of th^ rocks ; and 
taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up 
tame, and did fo ; out when they grew older, they all 
flew away, which perhaps was at firft for want of feed- 
ing them, for 1 had nothing to give them. However, I 
frequently found their nefts, and got their young ones, 
which was very good meat. V 

And now, in the managing my houfehold affairs, I 
found myfelf wanting in many things, which I thought 
at firil it was impoflible for me to make, as indeed as to 
fome of them it was : for inltance, i could never make a 
caik to be hooped \ 1 had a fmall rundlet jDr iwp, as Pob- 
^erved before, but I could never arrive to the capacity of 
making one by them^ though 1 fpent many \\eeks about 

it:

1 could neither put in the heads, nor join the ftavcs fo 
true to one another as to make them hold water ; fo I 
gave that alfo over. 

In the next place I was at a great lofs for candles ; 
fo that as foon as it was dark, which was generally by 
leven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remem- 
l)ered the lump of bees-wax with which I made candles 
in my African adventure; but i hild nolie of that now : 
the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a 
goat, I faved the tallow, and with a little difh made 
of clay, which I baked in the fun, to which I added a 
wick of fome oakum, I made me a -lamp ; and this 
gave me light, though not a clear fteady light like a 
candle. In the middle of all my labolirs it happened, 
that rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, 
as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feed- 
ing of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I fup- 
pofe, when the Ihip came from Lifbon ; what little re- 
mainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured by 
the rats, and I faw nothing in the bag but hufks and duft ; 
and being willing to have the bag for fome other ufe (I 
think it Avas to put powder in, when 1 divided it for fear 
■of the lightning, or fome fuch ufe), I ihook the hulks 
of corn nut of it on one iide of my fortification under the 
xock. 

Jt was a little before the ffreat rains, juft now men-* 
tioned, that I threw this llutFaway, taking no notice of 
any thing, and not fo much as remembering that I had 
tiirown anylhing there ; when about a morith after, or 
thereabouts, I faw, fome few llaiks of fomething green 
(hooting upon the ground, which I fancied might be 
fome plant J had not feen ; but I was furprifedj and per- 
• fe6tly aftonifhed, when after a little longer time, I faw 
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfeft 
green barley, of the fame kind as our European, nay, as 
our Engliih barley. ^ . 

It is irapofiible to exprefs the aftonifhmcnt and coh- 
fuiion of my thoughts on this occalion ; I had hitherto 
. adled upon no religious foundation at all; indeed I 
had" very few notions of religion in my hcsd, nor 
had entertained any fenfe of any thing that had befallen 
xne, otherwife than as a chance, or, as we lightly fay, 

what

•what pleafes Godj without (6 much as enquiring into the 
end of Providence in thefe things, or his order in govern- 
ing events in the world. But after I faw barley grow 
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, 
and efpccially as I knew ijot how it came there, it ftartled 
me ftrangely ; and 1 began to i\iggt(kf that God had mi- 
raculoully caufed this grain to grow without any help of 
feed fown, and that it was fo diredted, purely for my 
fuflenance in that wild miferable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out 
' of my eyes, and I began to blefs myfelf, that fuch a pro- 
digy of nature Ihould happen* on m}'- account ; and this 
was the more llrange to me, becaufe I faw near it ftill, 
all along by the fide of the rock, fome other ftraggling 
ftalks, which proved to be ftalks^ of rice, and which 1 
knev/, becaufe Ihad fecn it grow in Africa when I was 
afhore there. v 

I not only thought thefe the pure produ^ions of Pro« 
vidence for myfupport, but not doubting but that there 
was more in the [)lace, I went all over that part of the 
illand where 1 had been before, peeping into every cor- 
ner, and under every rock» to fee for more of it, but £ 
could not fintl any. At laft it occured to my thoughts 
tnat I had ihaken the bas: of chicken's meat out in that 
place, and the wonder began to ceafe ; and I mull con- 
fefs my religious thankfulnefs to God*s providence began 
to abate upon discovering that all this was nothing but 
w^hat was common ; though 1 ought to have been as 
.-thankful for fo ftrange and unforefeen a Providence as if 
ithad been miraculous ; for it was really the work of 
Providence as to me, that, ihould order to appoint, that 
ten or twelve grains of corn ihould remain unfpoiled, 
when the rats had deftroyed all the reft, as if it' had been 
dropped from heaven : as alfo, that I ihould throw it out 
into that particular place, where, it being in the ihade of 
an high rock, fprang up immediately : whereas, if I had 
thrown it any where ell'e at that time, ithad been burnt 
bp and deilroyed. 

I carefully ikved the ears of this corn, you may be fure, 
in their feafon, which was about the end of June ; and 
laying up every grain, I refolved tofow them all again, 
hoping in time to have fome quantity, fufficient to fupply

me with bread ; but it was not till the fourth year that I 
would allow ^yfelf the leaflgraiQ of this corn to eat, and 
even then but iparingly, as I fhall fay afterwards in its 
order ; for I loft all I lowed the firft feafon, by not ob- 
ferving the proper time ; for I fowed it jull before the dry 
feafon, fo that it never came up at ^11, at leall not as it 
would have done ; of which in its place. >' 

Befides "this barley, there were, as above, twenty jQt 
thirty llalks of rice, which I preferved with the fame care, 
and whofe ufe waS of the fame kind, or to the fame 
purpofe, viz. to make me bread, or rather food ; 
for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though 
I did that alfo after fome time. But to return to my 
journal. 

I worked exceflive hard thefe three or four months, to 
get my wall done ; and the 1 4th of April 1 clofed it up, 
contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over a wall by 
a ladder, that there might be no fign on the outfide of my . 
habitation. 

April 1 6. I finiihed the ladder; fo I went up with it 
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it 
down on the iniide. This was a complete inclofure to. 
me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could 
come at rne from without, unlefs it could firlt mount njy 
wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finifhed, I had 
almoft had all ray labour overthrown at once, and my- 
felf killed; the caufe was thus: as I was bufy in the 
infide' of it, behind my tent, jult in the entrance mto 
my cave, I was terribly frightened with a , moll dreadful 
furprifing thing indeed ; for all on a fudden I found the 
earth came tumbling down from the roof of my cave,, 
and from the tdgt of the hill over my head, and two 
of the pofts I had let up in the cave cracked in a fright- 
ful manner. I was heartily feared, but thought nothino* 
of- what really was the caufe ; only thinking that the top 
of my cave was falling in, as fome of it had-done before ; 
and for fear I Ihould be buried in it, I ran forwards to 
my ladder, and not thinking rnyfelf fafe there neither, 
I got over piy wall fpr fear of the pieces of the hill; 
which I expedled might roll down upon me. I w^s no 
fooner liepped down upon the firm ground, but ^plainly

faw it was a terrible earthquake ; for the ground I flood 
on fhook three times, at about eight minutes diftance, 
-with three luch (liocks as would have overturned tht 
Itrongeft buildings that could be luppofed to have ilood 
upon the earth ; and a great piece of the top of the rock, 
which flood at about half a mile from me, next the fea, 
fell down with fuch a terrible noife as I never heard in all 
my life. I perceived alfo the very fea was put into a 
violent rnotion b^ it ; and I believed the {hocks were 
llronger under the water than on the ifland. 

I was fo amazed with the thing itfelf, having never felt 
the like, ordilcourfed with any one that had, that I was 
like one dpad or flupified ; and the motion of the earth 
made my flomach tick, like one that is tofTed at fea : but 
the, noife of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, 
and routing mefrom the ftupified condition I was in, filled 
me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the 
hill falling upon my tent, and all my boufehold goods, 
and bur^ng all at once; and this funk my veiy foul 
within n^e a fecond time. - 

After t^e third fhock was over, and I felt no more for 
fome time, I began to take courage ; and yet I had not 
heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of being 
buried alive; but Hill fat on the ground, greatly cad 
down, and difconfolate, not knowing what to do. Ail 
this while I had not the lead ferious reli^rious thought, 
nothing but the common. Lord,' having have mercy upon 
me ! and when it was over, that went away too. 

While I fat thus, I found the air over-cail, and it grew 
cloudy, as if it would rain ; and inlets than half an hour 
it blew a motl dreadful hurricane of wind. The tea all 
' on a fudden was covered with foa^n and froth, the fhore 
was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were 
torn up by the roots, and a terrible ftorm it was ; and 
this held about; three hours, and then began to abate; 
and then in two hours more it was calm, and began to 
rain very hard. • , ' 

All this while I fat upon the ground very much terri- 
fied and dejected, when on a fudden it came into my 
thoughts that thefe winds and rain being the confequence 
of the earthquake, the earthquake itfelf was fpent and 
over, and I might venture into my cave again. With

tbis thouglit my fpirits began to revive, and the rain 
helping alfo to perfuade me, i went in, and lat me down 
in my tent ; but the rain was fo violent, that my tent was 
ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forced to gi) 
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneafy for 
fear it fhould fall on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut 
a hole through my new fortification, like a fink, to let th*; 
water out, which would eUe have drowned my cave. 
After I had been in my cave fome time, and found ftill no 
more (hock of the earthquake follow, I began to be more 
compofed. And n6w, to compofe my fpirits, which 
indeed wanted it very much, 1 went to my little (lore, 
and took a foiall fup of rum, which however I did then, 
and always very fparingly, knowing I could have no 
more when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night, and great part of 
the next day, fo that I could not fiir abrond ! but my 
inind being more cortipofed, I began to think of what I 
had beft to do; concluding, that if the ifland was fub- 
jedl to thefe earthquakes, there would be no jivjng for 
me in a cave, but I mull think of building me fome 
little hut in an open place, which I might furround with 
a wall, as I had done here, and fo make myfelf fecurc 
from wild beads or men ; but concluded if I llaid where 
I was, I {hould certainly, one time or other, be buried 
alive. 

With thefe thoughts, I refolved to move my tent 
from the; place where it llood, which was jull under the 
hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it Ihould bo 
Ihaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent : and 
1 fpent the two next days, being the 1 9th apd $iOth of 
April, in contriving where and how to removc^ihy habi- 
tation. 

The fear of being fwallowed up alive afFecled, me fo, 
that I never ilept in quiet ; and yet the apprehcnlions of 
lying abroad, without any fence, were almofl equal to 
it. But ftill, when I looked about and faw how every 
thing was put in order, how perfedlly concealed I 
was, and how fafe from danger, it made mc loth to 
Remove.

,76 ADVENTBRES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

In the mean time It occurred to me, that it would re- 
quire a vail deal of time for me to do this, and that I muil 
be contented to run the venture where 1 was, till I had 
formed a camp for myfelf, and had fecured it fo as to re- 
move to it. So with this refolution I compofed myfelf 
for a time ; and refolved that I would go to work with all 
fpeed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a 
circle, as before, and fet my tent up in it when it was 
linifhed ; but that 1 would venture to flay where I was till 
it was finifhed and fit to remove to. — This was the 2lfl. 

April 22. The next morning I began to coniider of 
means to put this refolve in execution ; but I was at a 
great lofs about ray tools : I had three large axes, and 
abundance of Jiatchets (for we carried the hatchets for 
traffic with the Indians) but with^much chopping and 
cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, 
and dull ; and though 1 had a grindllone, I could not turn 
it and grind my tools too. Thi^ coll me as much thought 
as a llatefman would have bellowed on a grand point 
of politics. Or a judge upon the life and death of a- cri- 
minal. At lenfjjth I contrived a wheel, with a flrins: to 
turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands 
at liberty. — Note, I had not feen any fuch thing in Eng- 
land, or at leall not to take notice how it was done ; 
though fince I have obferved it was very common there : 
> befides that, my grindflone was very large and heavy.' 
"This niachine coft me a full week's work to bring it to 
perfedlion. 

April 28, 2.0. Thefe two wh^le days I took up in 
grinding ray tools ; my machine for turning my grind- 
Hone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been low 
a great while, I now took a furvey of it, and reduced 
myfelf to one bifcuit-cake a day, which made my he'art 
very heavy. 

May 1. In the morning, looking towards the fea-lide,- 
the tide being low, I faw fomething lie on the fliore 
bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a c^ik : . when I 
came to it, 1 found a fmall barrel, and two or three 
pieces of the wreck of the fhip, which were driven on 
fhore by the late hurricane ; and looking .towards the 
wreck itfcif, I thought it feemed ta lie higher out of the 
5 water

water than it ufed to do. I examined the barrel which 
was driven on fhore, and foon found it to be a barrel of 
gunpowder £ but it had taken water, and the powder 
was caked as hard as a ilone. However, I rolled it far- 
ther on the fhore for the prefent, and went on upon the 
lands as near as I could to the wreck of the fhip, to look 
for more. 

When I came down to the (hip, I found it ftrangely 
removed; the fore-caltle, which lay bt^'forc buried in 
fand, was heaved up at lead iix feet ; r.nd the ftcrn, which 
was broken to pieces, and pasted from the reit by tiie 
force of the fea, foon after I had left rumm^.c;ing her, 
was toflfed as it were up, and caft on one.fule; and the 
tdiWiS was thrown fo hi^h on that fide next the ftern, that 
whereas there was a crreat place of water before, fo that 
I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck 
without fwiraming, I could now walk quite up to her 
when the tide was out. 1 was furprifcd at this at firfl:, 
but foon concluded it mud be done by the earthquake ; 
and as by this violence the fhip was more broke open 
than formerly, fo many things came daily on (horc which 
the fea had loofened, and which the winds and water 
rolled by degrees to laud. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the delign of 
removing my habitation ; and I bulled myfelf mightily, 
that day efpecially, in fearching whether i could make 
any way into the fhip ; but I found nothing was to be^ 
expe6led of the kind, for that all the iniide of the fhip was 
choaked up with fand. However, as I had learned not. 
to defpair of any thing, I refolved to pull every thing to 
pieces that I could oi* the fhip, concluding that every 
thing I could get from her would be of fonie ufe or other 



to me. 



May 3. I began vfith ray faw, and cut a piece of a 
* beam through, which I thought held fome^ofthe upper 
part, or quarter deck together ; and when I had cut it 
through, j cle;*red away the fand as well as I could from 
the fide whifiih lay higheft : but the tide coming in, 1 wa» 
obliged to give it over for that time. 

May 4- I went a lifhing, but canghtbut one fifh that 
I durtt eat of, till I was weary of my fport ; when ju ft 
going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin.' I had

made me a long line of ibme rope-yarn, hut I had no 
hooks, yet 1 freqifently caught fiih enough, as niuch as I 
cared to eat ; all which I dried in the fun, and eat them 
dry. 

May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam afun- 
der, and brought three great fir plunks off from the decks, 
which I tied together, and made fwim on fhoje when the 
^ide of flood came on. 

May 6. Workdd on the wreck, sgot feveral iron bolts 
out of her, and other pieces of iron-work ; worked very 
hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts 
of sjivinjr it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent 
not to work; hut found the weight of the wreck had 
broken itfelf down, the beams being cut, that feveral 
j'ieces of the (hip feemed to lieloofe, and the iniide of the 
hold lay fo open, that 1 could fee into it, but almoft full 
of water and fand. 

May 8. Went to, the wreck, and carried an iron crow 
to wiench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the 
watei;^or fand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought 
them on ihore alfo with the tide. I left the iron, crow in 
t.ie wreck for the next day. 

May 9, Went to the wreck, and with the cro\^ made 
Way into ths body of- the wreck, and telt- feveral caiks, 
and loofexie;! them with the crow, but could not break 
them up ; 1 felt alfo a roll of Englifli lead, and could ftir 
it, but it was too heavy to remove. ' 

May 10, n , 12, 13, 1'"^. Went every day to the wreck, 
and got a great deal of irleces of timber and boards, or 
planks, arid two or three hundredweight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not 
cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one 
hatchet, and driving it with tl;ie other ; but as it lay about' 
a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow 
to drive the hatchet. 

May 16% It had blowed hard in the night, ancj the 
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water; 
but I (laid fo long in the woods to get pigeons for food> 
that the tide prevented nie going to the wreck that day. 

May 17. I faw fome pieces of the wreck blown on 
ihore at a great diftancc, two miles off me, but refolvcd

to fee what they were, and found a piece of the head, bulf 
too heavy- for me to bring away. 

May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the 
wreck ; and with much labftur I loofened fonie things fo 
much with the crow, that the fii*ft flowing tide fevcral 
cafks floated out, and two of the feamen*s cheils. Bi^t the 
wind blowincr from the fliore, nothincr came to land that 
(lay but pieces of timber, and an hogftiead which had 
fome Braiil pork in it, but the fait water and the land had 
fpoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of June^ 
except the time neceffary to get food, which [ always ap-* 
pointed, during this part of my employment, to be wheir 
the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed , 
out ; and by this time had gotten timber and plank, and 
iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if 1 had 
kuown how : and I alfo got, at leveral times, and ia 
feveral pieces, near one hundred weight of the fheet lead. 

June 1 6. Going down to the fea-iide, I found a large- 
tortoife, or turtle ; this was the firfl: I had feen, which, it 
feems, was only my misfortune, not any defe<5t of the 
place, or fcarcity ; for had I happened to be on the other 
fide of the illand, 1 might have had hundreds of them- 
every day, as 1 found afterwards; but perhaps have paid 
dear enough for them. 

June 17, I fpent in cooking-the turtle ; I found in her 
threefcore eggs ; and her A.i{h -was to me, at that time^ 
the moft favour/ and pleafantthat ever I tailed in my life,, 
having had no flefli but of goats and fowls lince I landed 
in tbis horrible place. 

June 18. Rained all the day ^ and I (laid within ; I 
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was fome- 
what chilly, which I knew was not ufiial in that latitude. 
June 19- V'ery' ill and fliivering^ as if the weather hadt 
been cold.

apprehenfions of ray fad condition — to be fick, and no

June 26*. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took

a (he goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and 
broiled fome of it, and eat : I would fain have flewed it, 
and made fbme broth,, but had no pot. 

June 27, The ague again fo violent, that I lay a-bed 
all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready to pe- 
rifli with thirft, but fo weak 1 had no ftienVth to ftand

things have not brought thte. to repentance, now tbou

fpear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that fiiall ever, read this account, will expedl 
that I fhould be able to defcribe the horrors of my foul 
at this terrible vifion ; I mean, thattrven while it was a 
dream, I even dreamed of thole horrors ; nor is it any 
more poflible to defcribe the impreflion that remained 
upon my mind w^hen I awaked and found it was but a 
drearn. ' * 

I had, alas I nq divine knowledge ; what I had re- 
ceived by the good inilrudlion of my father, was then, 
worn out by an uninterrupted feries, for eight years, ot* 
fea-faring wickednefs, and a conftant converfation with 
none but fuch as were like rayfelf, wicked and profane 
to the lali degree. I do not remember that J had in all 
that time one thought that fo much as tended either to 
looking upwards towards God, or inwards towards a re- 
flection upoii my own ways ; but a certain flupidity cf 
foul, without deli re of good, or confcience of evil, had 
entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that the moil 
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our com- 
mon faifors can be fuppofed to be, not havings the lea it 
fenfe of the fear of God in dangers, or of thankfulnefs to 
God iiT deliverances. 

In relating what k already paft of my llory, this will 
be the more eafily believed, \vhen I (hall add, that through 
all the variety of miferies that had to this day btifailcn 
me, I never had fo much as once thought of its beine the 
band of God, or that it was a juft puniihment for mj- iins, 
my rebellious behaviour againft my father, or my prcfent 
fins, which were great ; or fo much as a puniflinicnt.ti^r

the defperate ex|)edition on the defart (hores of Africa, J 
never had fo much as one thought cf what would become 
of me, or one wifhto God to dire6l me whither J Ihouitl 
go, or to keep me from th'e danger which ap^^arently 
Jurro.unded me, as well from voracious creatures,, as cruel

and indeed hardly that. 

When I was delivered and taken up at lea by the Por* , 
tugal captain, well ufed and dealt juftly and honourably 
with, as well as charitably, I had niDt the lead "thankful- 
nels in my thoughts. \Vher> again I was ihipwrecked, 
ruined, and in danger of drowning on this ifland, I was 
as far from vemorfe, or looking on it as a judgment; I. 
only faid to myfelf often, that 1 was an unfortunate dog, 
and born to be always miferable. \ 

It is true, ^\hen f got onihore firfl here, and found all 
my {hip's crfew drowned, and myfelf fpared', I was fur- 
prifed with a kind of ecilacy, and forhe tranfports of foul, 
which, had the grace of God affifted, might have came up 
to true thankfulfefs ; but it ended where it began, in a 
mere common flight of J03' ; or, as I may fay, being glad 
I was alive, without the leaft refleiflion upon the diftin-p 
guiihing goodnefs of the Jiand which had preferved me, 
and fingled me out to be prefers'ed, when all the reft were 
dellroycd ; or an enquiry why Providei^ce had been thus 
merciful to me ; even jull the fame common fort of joy 
which feamen generally have, after they have got fafe 
ajhore froin a ihipwreck, which they drown all in the 
next bowl of punch, and forget almoft as foon as it is 
o\ef, and all the reft of my life was like it. 

Eve.i when I was afterwards, on due confideration, 
made fcnfible of my condition i how I was call on this 
dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of 
aH hope ©f relief, or profpedl of redemption ; as foon as 
Ifaw a prot)ability of living, arid that I fhould not ftarve 
-and periih for hunger, all the fenfe of my affli<^ion wore 
off, and I began, to be very eafy, applied rpyfelf to the 
•works proper for my nrefervation and fupply^ and was 
far enough frona being afHidcd at ray condition, as a 
judgment from Heaven^ or as the hand of God againltme: 
thefe vvere thoughts that very feldom entered into my 
head. " v^

it had fomething miraculous in it ; but as foon as ever 
that part of thought was removed, all the impreffioa: 
which was raifed from it, wore ofilalfo, as I Have noted; 
already. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more- 
terrible ih its nat-ure, or more immediately directing to thej 
Invifible Power which alone directs fuch things ; yet na^ 
fooner was the lirft fright over, but the impreflion it had 
made went off alfo. 1 had no more fenfe of God, or hi*, 
•judgment, much lefs of the prefent afBi^ion of my cir-* 
cumftances being from his hand, than if I had beeninthe* 
moll profpero us condition in life. 

But now, when 1 began to be lick, and aleifurely view- 
of the miferies of de^th came to place itfelf before me-; 
when my fpirits began to fmk under the burthen, of sfe 
llrong dillemper, and nature was exhaufted with the vio-^ 
lence of the fever ; confcience, that haH flept fo- long,, 
began to awake, arul I began to reproach myfelf withmy 
pall life, in which I had fo evidently, by uncommoflii 
wickednefs, provoked the juftice of God to lay me under 
uncommon ftrokes, and to deal with, me info vindidliyc sk 
manner. . . 

Thefe reflbAions opprelTcd me from the ftcond or thir4i 
day of my diilemper, and in a violence, as well of the- 
fever, as of the dreadful reproaches of my confcience^ ex-* 
torted fome words from, me, like praying to God^ though; 
I cannot fay they were either a prayer ^ttended with: 
defires, or with hopes;: it was rather the voice of mere: 
fright and diftrefg : my thoughts were confufed, the con-- 
vifiions great upon, my mind, arid the horror ofv dying, in* 
&ch a miferable condition, raifed vapoursinto, my head* 
with the mere apprehenfions; and in thefe hurries of my 
foul,, I knew not what my tongue might exprefs :. but. it: 
was rather exclamation, fuch as,. Lord what a miferablc- 
creature am I! If lihould be iick, I flial} certainly, die- 
for want of help, and what will become of me ? Then the: 
tears bufft out of my eyes, and 1 could jQiy no more a good, 
while. 

In this interval, the good*^^ advice of my father came tp!> 
my mind, and prefcntly his predidlion, which I men-- 
tioned in the beginning of thi& ftory, viz. That if I did

have leifure hereafter to reflect upon having negledled bis 
counfeI» wh«n there might he none to affift nie in my 
necovcry. Kow, iaidl aloud, my dear father's words 
are come to pafs ; God's juftice has overtaken me, and 
I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of 
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a poftum 
^r ils^jtion of life wherein 1 might have been happy and 
ckfy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, nor learn to 
know the blefling of it from my parents ; I left them to 
moiirn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under 
the consequences of it. I refufed their help apd affift- 
ance, who would have lifted me into the world, and would 
have made every thing eafy to me ; arid now I have dif- 
ficulties to ftruggle with, too great for even nature itfclf 
to fupport, and no alliftance, no help, no comfort, no 
advice. Then I cried out, Lord be my help, for 1 am in 
great diftrefs! * - 

This was the firft prayer, if I might call it fo, that I 
had made for many years. But I return to my Journal. 

June 28. Havihg been fomething refreftied with the 
fleep I had taken, and the fit being entirely oft\ I got up ; 
* and though the fright and terror of my dream was very 
great, yet I confidered that the lit of the ague would re- 
turn again the next day, and now was my time to get 
fomething to r'efrefh and fupport myl'elf when I fhould 
be ill : and the firft thing I did, I filled a large fquare cafe 
bottle with water, and fet it upon my table, in reach of 
my bed : and to take off' the chill oraquiih difpofition of the 
water, I put about'a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and 
mixed them together ; then. I got me a piece of the goat's 
ficlh, and broiled ,it on the coals, but could eat very little* 
I walked about, but was very weak, and withal, very 
fad and heavy-hearted in the fenfe of my miferable con- 
dition, dreading the return of my diftemper the next day. 
At night I made my fupper of three of the turtle's eggs j 
which I roafted in the allies, and eat, as we call it, in the 
fhell ; and this was the firft bit of meat I had ever afked 
God's bldling to, even, as I could remember,, in my 
whole life. 

After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myfelf fo 
weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went 

, ^ out 



ADVENTURES OF ROBIKSOK CRUtOE. 8l^ 

out wHhout that), fo 1 went out but a little way, and 
fat down upon the ground, looking out ^pon the lea, 
which was juft before me, and very calm and imootbr 
As J (at here, fome thoughts, fuch as thefe, occurred to 
me* 

.What is the earth and Tea, of which I have feen fo 
inuch ? Whence is it produced ? And what am 1, and 
all the other creatures, wild and tame^ human and brutal, 
whence are we ? 

Sure we are all made by fome fecret power, who 
formed the earth and fea, tne air and flcy ; and who is 
that? 

Then it followed mod naturally, It is God that has 
made it all. Well, but then it came on ftrongly, if God 
has made all thefe things, he guides and governs them all, 
and all things tluit concern them ; for the Being that coidd 
make all thiiigs, muft certainly have pdwer to guide and 
direft them. 

If fo, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his 
works, either without his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he 
knows that I am here, and in a dreadful condition ; and 
if nothing happens without his appointment, he has ap- 
pointed all this to befal me. ^ 

Nothing occured to my thoughts to pontradic^ any 
of thefe conclufions; and therefore it refled upon me 
with the greater force, that rt muft needs be that God 
had appointed all this to befal me ; that I was brought 
to this miferable circumftance by his diredlion, hp 
having the fole power, not of me only, but of eVery 
thing that happened ia the world. Imniediately it fol- 
lowed, 

W' hy has God done this to me? W'hat have I done to 
be thus uled ? 

My confciencc prefently checked me in that enquiry, 
as if i had blafphemed ; and methought it fpoke to me 
like a voice, Wretch ! doft thou aik what thou hail done ? 
look back u^on a dreadful mil-fpent life, and afk thy- 
felf what thou hafl not done ? Afk, why it is that thou 
wert not long ago deftroyed ? W'hy wert thou nr>t

by the wild beads of the coaft of Africa? Or drowned 
here, when all the crew perifhed but thyfelf ? Doll thou 
dflc, What have I done ? 

I was flruck dumb with thefe , refledlions as one allo- 
,nii]icd, and had not a word to fay, no, not to.anfwcr to 
myfelf ; but rofe up penfive and lad, walked back to my 
retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been ^oing 
to bed ; but my thoughts were fadly difturbed, and 1 bad 
no inclination to fleep ; fo 1 fat dowh in my chair, and 
lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark: Now, as the 
apprehenfionsof the return of my diftentper terrified me 
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Bralilians 
take no phyfic but their tobacco for almoft all diilempers ; 
and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco ia one of the chefts, 
which was quite cured, and fome alfo that was green, 
and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt ; for in this 
cheft I found a cure both for Ibul and body. I opened 
the cheft, and found what I looked for, viz, the to- 
bacco : and as the few books I hqtd faved lay there to^. 
I took out one of the bibles which 1 mentioned before^ 
and which, tq this time, I had not found leifure, or fo 
much as inclination, to look into ; I fay I took it out,, 
and brought both that and the tobacco with, me to the 
table. 

What ,ufe to make of the tobacco I knew not,, as to. 
my difiemper, or whether it was good for it or no ; but 
I tried feveral experiments with it, as if I was refolved 
it (hould hit one way or othjsr. I firft took a piece of a 
leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed at firil: 
almoii ttupitied my brain, the tobacco being green and 
llrong, and that 1 had not been much ufed to it ; then I 
took fome, and ftceped it an hour or two in rum, and re-- 
folved tn take a dole of it when I lay down ; and laftly,. 
I burnt fome upon a pan of coals, and held my nofe clofe 
over thefmokeof it, as long as I could bear it, as well 
for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held aimoft to fuffo- 

cation* 

In the interval of this op^eration, I took up the Bible,. 
and began to read ; but my head was too much, difturbed; 
with the tobacco to bear reading, at leaft at that time, only, 
paving opened the book cafually, the firft words that

ADVENTCRtS OF ROBTKSON CRUSOE** 87 

occuTcd to me were thefe, Call ot^ ffie in the day of irauhU^ 
and I will deliver, and ihoujiuih glorify me* 

The words were very apt to my cafe, and made fome 
irapreffion upon my thoughts at the time of readmg 
them, though not fo much as they did afterwards ; for 
as for being delivered: the w^ord had no found, as J may 
fay, to me ; the thing was fo remote, fo impoilible in 
my apprehenfion of things, that I began to fay, as the 
children of Ifrael did, when they were promifed flefli to 
cat, Cayi Godfpreada table in the wtlderncfs f So I began 
to fay, can God himfelf deliver me from this place ? 
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap- 
peared, this prevailed very often upon my tl^oughts: 
but however, the words made a very great impreflion 
upon me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew 
now late, and the tobacco had, as I faid, dozed my head 
fo much, that 1 inclined to lleep ; fo I left my lamp 
burning in the cave, left 1 fhould want any thing in the 
night, and went to bed ; but before I lay down, I did 
what I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled down 
and prayed to God to fulfil the promife to me, that if I 
called upon hira in the day of trouble, he would deliver 
me. After my broken and imperfedt prayer was over, I 
drank the rum in which I had fteepcd the tobacco, 
which was fo ftrong and rank of the tobacco, that in- 
deed I could fcarce get it down. Immediately upon this 
I went to bed, and 1 found prefently it flew up into my 
head violently ; but I fell into a found ilecp, and waked 
no more, till by the fun it muft neceflarily be near three 
c^clock in the afternoon the next day ; nay, to this hour 
1 am partly of the opinion, that 1 llept all the next day 
and night, and till almoft three the next day after ; for 
otherwife I knew not how I fhould lofe a day 9ut of my 
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared foroe 
years after 1 had done ; for if I hajd loll it by eroding and 
re-crofiing the line, I (hould havq loft more than a day ; 
but in my account it wj^s loft^ and 1 never knew which^ 
way. 

Be that however one way or other, whep I awake<l, 
I found niyfelf exceedingly lefreihed, and my. fpirits 
lively and cheerful ; when 1 got up, I was ftronger than 
I was the day before, and mj^ ftomach better; for I

was hungry,; and, in fliort^ I had no fit the next day, 
but continued much altered for the better : this was the 
2i:th. 

The SOth was -my well day of courfe, and I went 
abroad with roy gun, but did not care to travel too far. 
I killed a Tea fowl or two, fomcthing like a brand gooie, 
and brought them home, but was not very forward to 
eat them ; fo 1 eat fome more of the turtle's eggs, which 
were very good. This evening I renewed the medrcipe 
which J had fuppofed did me good the day before, viz. 
the tobacco lleeped in rum; only I did, not take fo- 
much as before, nor did 1 chew any of the leaf, or hold 
my head over the fmoke. Hv:)wever, I was not lb well 
the next day, which was the lit of July, as 1 hoped I 
fliould have been ; for I had a little fpice of the cold fit^ 
but it was not much. 1 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, 
and dozed myfelf with it at firft, and doubled the quantity 
which I drank. 

July 3- I miffed the fit for good and all, though I did 
, not recover my fuU itrength for fome weeks after. 
While I was thus gathering ftrength, my thoughts ran 
exceedingly upon this fcripture, I will deliver thee ; and 
the impoflibihty of my deliverance lay much upon my 
mind, in bar of my ever expe<5ling it. But as 1 was dil- 
couragingmyfelfwith/uch thoughts, it occurred to my 
mind, that I pored fo much upon my deliverance from 
the main afHi&ion, that 1 difregarded the deliverance I 
had receivecf ; and I was, as it were, made to afl: myfelf 
fuch queftions as thefe ; viz. Have I not been .delivcr%'.l, 
and wonderfully too, from licknefs ?• from the moil dif- 
trelfed condition that could be, and that was'fo frightful 
tonje? and what notice had I taken of it? had I done 
' my part ? God had delivered me, but 1 had not glorified 
him ; that is to fay, I had not owned and been thankful 
for that as a deliverance ; and how could I expert greater 
deliverance? 

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I 
kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for my reco- 
very from my ficknefs. 

July 4. In the morning 1 took the Bible, and begin- 
ning at the NewTeftamcnt, 1 began ferioufly to read it ; 

and 



' ADVEKTURESf ;OF R0BIKS6N CRUSOE. 89 

and impofed upon myfeJf to read a while every morn- 
ing and every night, not tying myfelf to the number of 
chapters, but as long as my thoughts fhpiild engage me. 
It was not long after I fet lerioully to tliis work, but I 
found my heart ipoft decj)ly and fincerely afFe<5ied with 
the wickedneis pf my" paft life ; the imprcflion^ of my 
dream revived, and the words All thefe things have not 
hroughl thee to repentance ^ ran feriouily in my thouijlits. 
I was earneftly begging of God to give me repentdncc, 
when it happened providentally the very day, that, 
reading the fcripture, I came to thefe words. He is ex* 
dted a Prince^ and a Saviour ^ to give repentance^ and to 
give rertiilJion* i threw down the bpolc, and with my 
heart as well as my hand lifted up to Heaven, in a kind 
ofecftacy of joy, I cried out aloud, Jefus, thou fpn of 
David, Jefus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me 
repentance ! 

This wais the firft time that I could fay in the true fenfe 
of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I . 
prayed with a fcnfe of my^ condition, and with a true^ 
Icripturc view of hope, founded on the encouragement of - 
the word of God : and from this time, I may fay, 1 began 
to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to conftnie the words mentioned above, 
Qtdl on me^ and I will deliver thee^ in a ditFerent fenfe 
from what I had ever done before ; for then I had no 
notion of any thing being called deliverance, but my be- 
ing delivered from the captivity I was in ; for though I 
was indeed at large in the place, yet the ifl'and wajf cer- 
tainly a prifon to me, and that in the worft fenfe in the 
world % but now J learned to take it in another fenfe* 
Now I looked back upon my paft lite with fuch horror, 
and rayiins appeared fo dreadful, that my foul fought; 
nothing of God, but deliverance from the loail of guilt;^ 
that bore down all my comfort. As for my folitary life» 
it was nothing ; I did not fo much as pray to be deli- 
vered from it, or think of it ; it was all of no confidera- 
tionJn comparifon of this : and 1 added this part here, 
to hint to whoever fhall read it, that whenever they 
come to a true fenfe of things, they will find deliverance 
from fin a n\uch greater blelling, than deliverance from 

afflidion. . 

But 



50 ADVENTURES OP R0BINS019 CRUSOK^r 

But learing/this part, I return to tAj journal* 

My condition began now to be, though not lefs mifcr- 
able as to my way of living, yet much eaiier to my mind ; 
and my thoughts being direfted, by a conftapt reading 
the fcripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher 
nature, I had a great (leal of comfort within-, which till 
now I knew nothing of. Alfo as my health and ftrength 
returned, 1 beilirred myfelf to furnifh myfclf with every 
thing that I wanted, and make ray way of living as regu- 
lar as 1 could. ** 

From the 4th oY July to the 1 4th, I was chiefly em- 
ployed in walking about with ray gun in my hand, a little 
and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his 
ftrength after a fit of {icknels ; for it is hardly to be ima- 
gined, how low 1 was, and to what weaknels I was re-^ 
duced. The application which I made ufe of, was per- 
fe6Wy new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague 
before ; neither can 1 recommend it to any one to prac- 
tife by this experiment ; and though it did carry off the 
fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me ; for I had 
frequent convulfions in my nerves and limbs for fome 

-time. 

I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that sbein^ abroad 
in the rainy fe'afon was the moft pernicious thing to oiy 
health that could be, efpecially in thofe rains which came 
attended with dorms and hurricanes of wind ; for as 
the rain which came in a dry feafon was always raoft 
accompanied with fuch ftorms, fo I found this rain was 
much more dangerous than the rain which fell in Sep- 
tember and 06tohtr, . ■ 

I had been now in this unhappy ifland above ten 

. months ; all pofllbility of deliverance from this condi- 
tion fecmed to be entirely taken from me ; and 1 firmly 
believed that no human (hape had ever fet foot upon 
that place. Having now fecured my habitation, as I 
thought, fully to my mind, I had a ^reat deiire to make 
a more perfect difcovery of the iiland, and to fee what 
other productions I might find, which yet 1 knew nothing 
of,. -^ 

h 



ADVEKTUflES OF ROBINSON CRUSOt. Qt 

It was the 1 5th of July that I began to make a more . 
particular furvey of the iiland.itfelf ; I went up the creek 
fifft, where as I hinted, I brought my rafts on fhore. I 
found, after I came about two miles up, that the tide did 
' not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little 
brook of running water, and very frefh and good ; but 
tKis being the dry feafon, there was hardly any water in 
in fome parts of it, at leall not enough to run into any 
ftream,fo as it could be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many pleafant favan- 
nas, or meadows, plain, fmooth, and covered with grafs ; 
and on the rifing parts of themliext to the higher grounds, 
where the water, as .it might be fuppofed, never ov<;r- 
flowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and grow- 
ing to a great and very ftrong ftalk : there were divers 
other plants which 1 htid no notion of, or underftanding 
about; and might perhaps have virtues of their own 
which I could not find out. 

I fearched for the calTava root^ which the Indians in 
all thtVt climate malie tiieir bread of, but I could find none. 
Ifawlarge plants of aloes, but did not then underlland 
them - 1 law feveral fugar-canesi I *\t wild, and, for want 
of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myfelf with thefe 
difcovcries for this time, and came back, mufing with roy- 
felf what courfe I might take to know the virtue and 
goodnefs of any of the fruits or plants which I fliould 
difcover, but could bring if to no conclufion ; for, in 
fhort, I had made fo little obfervation "wrhile i was in the 
Brafils, that I knew little of the plants of the field, at Icaft 
very little that might ferve me to any purpofe, now in my 
dillrefs. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the fame way 
again ; and, after going fomething farther than I had 
done the day before, I found the brook and the favannas 
began to ceafe, and the country became more woody 
than before. In this part I found different fruits, and 
particularly I found melons upon the ground in great 
abundance, and grapes upon the trees ; the vines had 
fpread indeed over the trees, and the cluilers of grapes 
were juil now in their prime, very ripe and rich. 
This was a furpriting difcovery, aVid I was exceeding 
glad of them; but 1 was warned by my experience 

to 



9^ ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to eat fparingly of them, remembering that^ whefl I 
was aihore in Harbary, the eating of grapes killed feve- 
Tal of our Englifhmen who were {laves there, by throw- 
ing them into fluxes and fevers. But 1 found an excel- 
lent ufe for thefe grapes, and that was to cure or dry 
them in the fun, and keep them as dried grapes or raifms 
are kept ; which I thought would be, as indeed they 
\vere, as wholefome, and as agreeable to eat, when no 
grapes might be had. 

1 fpent all that evening there, and went not back to my 
habitation, which, by the way, was the firil night, as I 
might fay, I had lain from Home. In the night I took my 
firil contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I flept 
well, and the next morning proceeded upon my difcovery, 
travelling near four miles, as T might judge by the length 
of the valley, keeping dill due north, with a ridge of hills 
on the fouth and north fide of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where 
the country feemed to defcend to the weft; and a little 
fpring of freih water j ^which ilTued out of the fide of the 
hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due eaft ; and the 
country appeared fo f* fh, fo green, (b flourifliing, every 
thing being in a conftant verdure, or flourifli of fj^ring, 
that it looked like a planted garden. 

I defcended a little on the iide of th^t delicious valley, 
furveying it with a fecret kind of pleafure (though mixed 
with other afflicting thoughts) to think that this was all 
my own, that I was king and lord of~this country inde- 
feafibly, and had a right of poffeffion ; and if I could, 
convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as 
any lord of a manor in England. 1 faw here abundance 
of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and citron trees ; but 
all wild, and few bearing any fruit, at ieaft not then: 
however, the green limes that i f^^athered were not only 
pleafant to eat, but very wholefome ; and 1 mixed their" 
juice afterwards with water, which made it very whole- 
fome, and very cool and refrefhing. . 

I found now 1 had bufmefs enough to gather and carry 
borne ; ;and refolved to lay up a itore,jas well of grapes 
as limes and lemons, to furnifli mj felf for the wet Icafon, 
which i knew was approaching; 

la 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in 
one place,.and a lefler heap in another place, and a great 
parcel of limes and lemons in another place ; and taking 
a few of each with me, I travelled homeward, and refolved 
to come again, and bring a bag or fack, or what I could - 
make, to carry the reft hprnc. 

Accordingly, having fpent three days in this journey, I 
came home (lol mull now call my tent and my cave) ; 
but before I got thither, the grapes wcrefpoiled ; the rich- 
nefsofthe fruit, and the weight of the juice, having 
broken them, and bruifed them, they were good for little 
or nothing ; as to the limes they were good, but I could 
bring but a few. 

The next d?y, being the 1 9th, I went back, having 
made me twofmall bags to bring home my harveft. But 
I was-furprifed, when coming to my heap of grapes, 
^vhich were fo rich and fine when 1 gathered them', I 
found them all fpread abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged 
about, Ibme here, fome there, and abundance eaten and 
devoured : by this 1 concluded there were fome wild 
creatures thereabouts, which had done this, but what 
they were I knew not. , 

However, as I found there was no laj'ing them up on 
heaps, and no carrying them away in a fack, but that one 
way they would be defiroycd, and the other way they 
would be crufhed with their own weight, 1 took another 
courfe ; fori gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and 
hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they 
might cure and dry in the fun ; and as for the limes and 
lemons, I carried as many back as I could vy^ell ftand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated 
with great pleafure the fruitfulnefs of that valley, and 
the pleafantnefs of the lituation, the fecurity from ftorms 
on that fide of the water and the wood ; and con- 
cluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode, 
which was by far the worlt part of the country. Upon 
the whole, 1 began toconfider of removing my habitation, 
and to look out lor a place equally fafe as where I now 
was fituat^, if pofiible, in that pleafant fruitful part of 
the iiland. 

This thought ran long in imr head, and I was ex- 
ceeding fond of it for fome time, the pleafantnefs of the

on my poft, and found I had been on (hore three hundred 
find lixty-fivc days. 1 kept this day as a Iblemn faft, fctting 
it apart to a religious exercife, prollrating myfelf to the 
ground with the mod ferious humiliation, confefling my- 
felf to God, acknowledging his righteous judgment upon 
me, and praying him to have mercy on me through Jefus 
Chrift ; and having not tafted the lead refreihment for 
, twelve hours, even till the going down of the fun, I then 
e:it a bifcuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and went to 
bed, finilhing the day as I began it. 

1 had all this time obferved no (abbath-day ; for as at 
firft 1 had no fenfe of religion upon my mind, i had after 
foraetime omitted to diftinguiih the weeks, by making a 
longer notch than ordinary for the fabbath-day, and fo 
did not really known what any of the days were ; but 
row having caft up the days as above, I found I had 
been there a year ; fo 1 divided it into weeks, and fet 
apart every feventh day for a fabbath ; though I found 
at the end of my accdunt I had loli: a day or two of my 
reckonin"f. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me^ and fo 1 
contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and to write 
down only the moft remarkable events ol my life, without 
continuing a daily memorandum of other things. . 

The rainy feafon, and the dry feafon, b^egan now to ap- 
pear regular to me, and I learned to divide them fo as to 
provide for them accordingly. But J bought all my ex- 
perience before I had it ; and this I anv going to relate, 
was one of the moil difcouraging experiments that I made 
-at all. J have mentioned that 1 had faved the few ears of 
barley and rice which I had fo furpriiingly found fpring 
up, as 1 thought of themfelves, and believe there were 
about thirty Hal ks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; 
and now 1 thought it a proper time to fow it after the 
rains, the fun being in its fouthern pofition going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I 
couKl with my wooden fpade, and dividing it into' two 
parts, I Hbwed my grain ; but as I wasfewing, itcafully 
occurred to my thoughts, that I would not fow it* all at 
fird, becaufe I did not know when was the proper time 
for it ; fo I fowed about two-thirds of the feeds, leaving 
an handful of each.

Tt was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did fo. 
Ibrnot onf .grain ofEhat 1 fowcd (his time came to any 
ihing; for the dry months following, the earth having 
liad no rain after Che feed was Town, it had no moifture 
1a aflift its growth, anil never came up at all till the wet 
kiCon hadcuFDc again, uml then it grew as if it bad beea 
newly fowti. 

Finding my firfl feed did not growj whJcb I eafily 
imagined was by the drought, J fought for a motfler' 
pitce of ground, to mK.ke another trial in ; and 1 dog up 
a piece of ground near my jiew bower, and l^wed the 
telt of my feed in FAruary, a Unle before tfce vernal 
(quJuoi ; and this, having the rainy Aionthls of March 
ind April to water il, fpriJng \ip very pleafaritly, and 
yielded a very good cib]»5 but having part of the ferd 
lefionly, and not daring lofow all that 1 had yet, I had 
t>ut a fmall quantity at lafl-, my whole -crop not amount 
ing to aboTC half a peck of each kind. 

Hut by this eijicrience 1 was made maftcr of my buii- 
Btfs, and knew exadly when the proper Italbn was lo 
fow; and that 1 might expert two feed times and two 
tirvefts every yeat. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little dilco- 
very, which was of ufe to me afterwards. As" Toon-aa 
the rains were over, and the weather began to fettle, 
wbich was about the month of November, I made a 
^ilitup the couAtry'to my bower, -where, though 1 had 
not been fomc months, yet I found all things jutlas I left 
them. The circle or double hedge thai I had made 
■was not only firm and entire^ but (he flakes which I had 
cut oft' of fome, trees that grew thereabouts, were all Ihot 
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a wil- 
low tree ufually ftioots the tirft year after lopping its 
head. I could not tell what tree to call it, that thde 
Hakes were cut from. 1 wa^furprifed, and yet very weil 
pFeafed to fee the young trees grow j and I pruned them, 
and led them up to grow as much alike as I could ; and 
it isfcsffce credible, how beautiful afigurethey grew into 
in three years ; fo that, though the hedge made a circle of 
about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, f^r 
fijcfi- 1 might now call them, foon covered it, and it was a . 
tompleat (hade, futficient lo lodge under all the dry feafon.

This made me reColve to cut fome more ftakes, and 
ntigike me ah hedge like this* in a femicircle round my 
wall, I mean that of my firfl dwclUag, which I did ;— 
and, placing the frees or ftakes in a doiible row, at above 
eight yards diftance from my firil fence, they grew pre- 
4'ently, aod were at firil a. fine cover to my habitation, 
and afterwards ferved for a ^defence alio, aslfhalltb-

I fouxjd now that the feafons of the year might general-

the winds happened to blow ; but this was the general 
obfervation 1 made. After 1 had found, by experience, 
the ill confequcnce of hcmg abroad in the rain, 4 took 
care to furnifli myfelf with proviiions beforehand, that I 
might not be obliged to go out ; arid I fat v?ithin doors 
as much as poffible during the wet months. 

In this time I foimd much employment (and very 
fuitable alfo to the time), for I found great occaiion of 
many things which I nad -lio way to furnifh myfelf 
with, but by hard labour, and conrtadt application ; — 
particularly, I tried mary way« to ^inake myfelf a

tiafkct; but all the twigs I could get for the purpofe 
proved fo brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved 
of excellent advantage to me now, that, when I was a 
toy, I uled to take great delight in Handing at a bafket- 
inaker's in the town where n^y father lived, to fee them 
make their wicker-wjare ; and being, as boys ufually 
are, very oflrcioxis to lelj^^nd a great obfefver of the 
manner how they wgJKed "ftrdfe things, and fometimes 
lent an hand, I had B this means fo full knowledge of 
the methods of it, t^V I wanted nothing but the mate*- , 
Tials ; when it came1«o mv mind, that the twiors of that 
tree from whence I ^r my ftakes that grew, might pof- 
libly be as tough as mc fallows, and willows, and oficrs, 
in England ; and I fefolved to try. 

Accordingly, next day, I w^nt to my country- 
lioufe, as I called it, and cutting fome of the fmaller 
'Iwigs, I found them to my purpofe as much as 1 could 
tlelirc ; whereupon 1 came the next time prepared with 
•an hatchet to cut down aquantity, which I loon fbun<l, 
for there was a great plenty of them s thefe I fet up to 
^Iry within my circle or hedges^; and when th-ey were 
iit for ufe, I carried them to my cave ; and here, during 
the next f^afon, 1 employed my felf in making (as well 
^s I could) a great many bafkets, both to carry earth, ^ 
or to carry or lay up any^thing, as 1 had occiifion ; and 
though 1 did not tiniih them very handibmely, yet I 
made them fufficiently ferviceable for my purpofe ; and 
thus afterwaVds I took care never to be without them ; 
and as my wicker- ware decayed, I made more ; efpe- 
cially I mad6 iirong deep baikets to place my corn in, 
tnltead of facks* when Iftiould come to have anjF quari-* 
iity of it. ' 

Having mailered this difficulty, and employed a 
World of time about it, 1 beftirred myfelf to fee, if pof- 
fiblc, how to fupply two wants. 1 had no veflels to 
hold any thing that was liquid, except two rundlets, 
which were aJmoll full of rum^ and fome glafs bbttles, 
ibme of the common fite, and others which were cafe- 
bottles, fquare, for the holding of waters, fpirits, &rci 
I had not fo much as a pot to boil any thing in, cxce;)t

cond thing i would fain have had was a tobacco pipe, 
but it was impoffible for me to make one ; however, l 
found a contrivance for that too at lall.

of piles, iind in this wi<iker work, M the fummer, or 
dry feafon ; when another bufinefs took me up more 
time than it could be imagined I could fpare". 

1 mentioned before, that I had a great mind to fee the 
whole ifland, and that I had travelled up the brook, and 
fo on to where I built my bower, and where I had aa 
opening quite to the Tea, on the other iide of the iilandJ 
J now refolv€d to travel quite acrols to the fea ihore oit 
that fide ; fo taking my gun and hcltchet, and my dog, 
and a larger qutmltjr of powder and fliot than ufual, 
with two bilculf-CHkes, and a great bunc^ of raifins m 
my pouch, for tny ftore, I began my journey. When I 
had pafTed the vale where my bower flood, as above, I 
came within view of the fea, to the Weil ; and it being a 
very cle^r day, 1 fairly defcried land, whether ^an ifland 
or continent J could not tell ; but it lay very high, ex- 
tending from the weft to the W^S.W. at ia very great di'f- 
tance ; by my guefs it could nOt be lefs than nfteeii or 
twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell "What part of the world this might be, 
otherwife than that 1 knew it muft be part of America; 
and, as I concluded by all my obfervations, muft be ne$ir 
the Spanifti dominions, ^nd perhaps ^as all inhabited 
by favages, uhere, if J ihould have lattdecf, I had bieen 
-in a worfe condition than I was now ; and therefore I ^c- 
quiefcedifl the difpoiitions of Providence^ which I begaa 
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing for the

With thefe confiderations I walked very leifurely for- 
ward ; I found that fide of the ifland where I now was 
much pleafanter than mine, the open or favanna fields 
fweet, adorned with flowers and grais, and full of very 
fine woods.. 1 faw abundance of parrots, and fain would 
I have caught one, if poffible, to have kept it to be tame, 
and taught it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome pains* 
taking, catch a young parrot ; for I knocked it down 
with a iHck, and having recovered it, brought it home, 
but it was fome years before I could make him fpeak.^ 
However, at laft 1 taught him to call me by my name very 
familiarly ; but the accident that followed, though it be 
a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

1 was exceedingly diverted with this journey : I found, 
in the low grounds, hares, as 1 -thought them to be, 
and foxes, but they differed greatly from all the other 
kindtl had met with ; nor could 1 fatisfy my felt" to eat 
them, though I killecl feveral ; but I had no need to be 
Tenturous, for 1 had no want of food, and of that which 
was very good too; efpeciaUy thefe three forts, viz, 
goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoile ; which, ackled to 
i»y grapes, Leadcnball-market couldnot have fumifhed 
a better table thart I, in proportion "to the company.— 
And though my cafe was deplorable enough, yet Ihad 
great caufe for thankfulnefs, that 1 was not driven to 
any extremities for food ; but rather plenty, even to 
dainties. 

1 never travelled in this journey above two miles 
outright in a day, or thereabouts ; but I took fo many 
turns and returns to fee what difcoveries I could make, 
that I came weary enough to the place where I refolved 
to fit down for all night ; and then either repofed my- 
felt'in a tree, or furrounded myfelf with a row of ftakes 
fet upright in the ground, either from one tree to. ano- 
ther, or lb as no wild creature could come at me without 
waking: me. 

As foon as I came to the fea fiiore, I was furprifed to 
fee that I had taken up my lot on the worft fide of the 
iiland ; for here indeed the Ihore was covered with in- 
numerable turtles.; whereas, on the other {idcy 1 had 
found but three in a year and a half. Here was alfo an 
infinite number of fowls of many kinds, fonjie of which

I had not feen before, and many of them very g6od 
meat ; bnt I'uch as I knew aot the naoies of, except tbofib 
called penguins. 

I could have {hot as many as 1 picafed, but was very 
fparing of my powder and (hot ; and therefore had more 
xnind to kill a ihe goat, if I could, which I could better 
leed on; and though there were many goats here, more 
than on th^ other iide of the idand, yet it was with much 
more difficulty than I eouJd come near them ; the coun* 
try being flat and even, and they faw me much fooner 
thanAvhen I was on the' hi lis. 

I confefs this ilde of the country was much pleafantet ' 
than mine, but yet I had not the leall inclination to re^ 
move, for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became 
natural to me, and I feemed, all the while 1 was here, to 
be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home. How-^ 
ever, I travelled along the fliore of the fea towards the 
eail, I fuppofe about twelve miles, an^l then fettincj up 
a great pole upon the fhorc for a tuark, 1 concluded Jt 
would go home again; and the next jourtey I iKiok 
jhould be o» the other lide of the Hland, eaft from my 
<lwellmg, and fo round till 1 came to my pofl again : of 
which iijits place. 

I took another way to come back thafr that I went,, 
thinking I could eafily keep all the iiland fo {nuch in 
staY yietv, that 1 could not mifs Ending ray firil dwelling 
hy viewing the country, but I found myfelf miftaken; 
for being come about two or three miles, 1 found myfelf 
defcended into a very large valley ; but fo furrounded 
^iih bills, and thofe hills covered with woods, that I 
could not fee which was the way by any dire<ftion but 
that of the fuu, nor even then, unlefs I knew very weli 
the polition of the fun at that time of the day. 

li happened to my further misfortune, that the wea* 
tber proved ha*y for three or four days, while I was in 
this valley, and not being able to fee the fun, 1 wan- 
dcrec^ about very uncoinfortably, and at laft was obliged 
to find out ^he fea-iide, look for my. pofl, and come 
back the lame way 1 went ; and then, by eafy journies, 
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot; 
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet^ and other things,, 
very heavy,

In this journey my dog furprifed a young kid,' and 
feized upon it ; and I, running in to take lioUl of it, 
caught it, and {a*ed it alive from the dog. I had a great 
mind to brinoj it home, if I could, for I had often been 
mufing whether it might not be poflible to get a kid or 
two, and fo taife a breed of tame goats, which might 
fupply me when my powder and (hot ihould be fpenfe. 

I made a collar to this little creature, and with a firings 
. "which I made of fome rope yarn, which I always carried 
about me, I led him along, though with fome difficulty » 
till I came to my bower, and there I inclofed him, and 
left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from 
T¥ hence I had been abfent above a month. 

I cannot! exprefs what a fatisfadtion it was to me to 
come to my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-* 
bed. This little wandering journey, without a fettled 
place of abode, had been fo unpleaQmt to me, that m^yi 
own houfe, as I called it to myfelf, was a perfeft fettle- 
ment to me compared to that ; and it rendered 'everjf 
thing about me fo comfortable, that I refolved 1 would 
never go a great way from it again, while it fhould b^ 
my lot to ftay on the ifland. 

1 repofed myfelf here a week, to reft iuid regale my- 
felf after my long journey ;. during which, naoft of the 
time was taken up m the weighty afeir of making a 
cage.for my poll, who began now to.be a mere doraellic, 
and to be pretty well acquainted with me. Then \ 
began to think of the poor kid, which I had pent i^ 
Vrithin my Kttle circle, and relblved to go ancl fetch i| 
home, and give it fome food. Accordingly 1 went, and 
found itVhere 1 left it, for indeed it could not get outy 
but was almoft ftarveil for want of food. I went and cu^ 
boughs of trees and branches of fuch ihrubs as I could 
iind, and threw it over, and having fed it, 1 tied it as \ 
did before, to lead it away; but it was fo tamewitl^ 
being h4mgry, that I had no need to have tied it; for it 
followed me hke a dog ; and as I conftantly fed it, thi 
creature became fo loving, ib gentle, and fo fond, that it 
became from that time one of my domedics alio, and

folemn manner as before, being the anniverfary of my 
landing on the ifland, having now been there two years^ 
and no more prof])e<ft of being delive^d than the firfl; 
day I came there, I fpent the whole day in humble and 
thankful .ncknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies 
which my folitary condition was ~ attended with, and 
without which it might have been infinitely more mifer- 
able. I gave humble and hearty thanks^ that God had 
been pleafed to difcover to me, even that it was poffible 
I might be more happy in this folitary condition, than I 
fhould have been in-a liberty of fociety, and in all the 
pleafures of the worlds That he could fiiUy' make up 
to me the deficiencies of my folitary ftate, and the want 
of human fociety, by his prefence, and the communica- 
tion of his grace to my foul, fupporting, comforting, and 
encouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and 
l^pe for his eternal prefence hereafter. 

it was now that 1 began fenfibly to feel- how much 
more happy the life I now led was, with all its roiferable 
circumftances, than the wicked, curfed^ abominable lifo 
I led all the pad jpart of my days : and now 'having 
changed both my forrows and ray jpys,. my very delire^ 
altered, my aflredk>ns changed their gad, and my de- 
. — .-^-Jights were perfc^fcly new from what they, were at firft 
comincr, or indeed tor the two years pad. 

Before, .as I walked about, either on ray hunting, or 
for viewing the country, the anguifli of my foul, at my 
condition, would break out upon me on a fudden, and 
my very heart would die within noe, to think of the 
•woods, the mountains, the defarts I was ia ; and how I 
■was a prifoner locked up, with the eternal bars anc^ bolts 
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs> without re- 
demption. In the midd of the greated eorapofures of 
jny mind, this would break out upon me like a ftorm^ 
and make xiie wring my hands, and weep like a child.— 
gometiraes it would take me in the middle of my work, 
dnd I would immediately fit down and figh, and look 
upon the ground for an hour or two together, and t&is 
was>diU worfe to me ; for if I could burd out into tears^ 
or vent myfelf by words, it would go oiF, and the grief 
having cxhauded itfelf, would abate*

< 

But now I began to exercife niyfelf with new 
thoughts ; I daily read the word of God, and applied alt 
the comforts of it to my prefent (late. One morning^^ 
being very fad, I opened the Bible upon thefe words^ 
" I will never, never leave thee, nor forfake thee !*' Im- 
mediately^it occurred that thefe words were to me ; why 
elfe fhould they be diredied in fuch a manner, juil at the 
moment when! was mourning over n^y condition, as- 
one forfaken of God and man ? Well, then, faid J, if 
God does not forfake me, of what ill confequence can it 
be, or what matters it, though the world fliould all for* 
fake me ; feeing, on the other hand, if 1 had all the 
•world, and ihould lofe the favour and bleffing of God,; 
there would benocomparifon in the lofs ? 

JFrom this moment I began to conclude in. my mind, 
that it was poffiblefor me to be more happy in this for- 
faken, folitary condition, than it was probable Lfhouid 
have ever been in any other particular ilatein the world ^ 
and with this thought 1 was going^ to give thanks ta 
God for bringing me to this place 

I know not what it was, but fomething fliocked myv 
mind at that thought, and I durft not fpeak the words- 
How canft thou be fuch a hy[X)crite, laid 1,. even au- 
dibly, to pretend to be thankful for a condition, which, 
however thou mayeft endeavour to be contented with,th6a 
wouldfl rather ptay heartily to be delivered from ? So 1 
Hopped there ; but though 1 could not fay I thanked God 
for being there, yet 1 fincerely gave thanks to God for 
. opening my eyes, by whatever amidling Providences, to 
fee the former condition of my life, and to mourn for 
my wickednefs, and repent.. 1 never-opened the Bible 
or flaut it, but my very foul within me blelfed Gbd for 
dired;ing my friend in England, without any order of 
mine, to pack it up among my goods ; and for affilUng; 
me afterwards to fave it out of the wreck of the (hip. 

Thus, and in this difpolition of mind, I began my 
third year ;, and though 1 have not given ihe reader the 
trouble of fo particular an account of my works this, 
year as the firlt, yet in general it may be oblerved,. that 
I was' very feldom idle; • having regularly divided my

that were before me ; fuch as — Firft, My duty to God^

Tnany hours, which, for want of tools, want of help^ 
want of fkill, every thing that I did took up out of 
my time. For example, I was full two and forty days 
Dinakinor me a board for a long fhelf, which J wanted ia 
jTiy cave ; whereas two fawyers, with their toolsr and 
ibw-pit, would have cut fix of them out of the 'fame tree 
in half a day. 

My cafe was this— It was to be a large tree w,hieh 
•was to be cut down, becaufe my board was to be a 
broad one. The tree I was three days in cutting down^ 
and two more cutting: off the boughs, and reducing it 
to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpreffible hack- 
ing and h6Wmg, I reduced both the fides of it into chips, 
tilt it began to be light enough to move ; then I turned 
it, and mack one fide of it fmooth and fkxt^ ^s a board, 
from end to end. Then turning that fide downward, 
cut the other fide till I brought the plank to be about 
three inches thick, and fmooth on both fides. Any one 
may judge of the labour of my hands in fuch a piece of 
work ; but labour and patience carried me through that 
and many other things. I pnly obferve this in particu- 
lar to (hew the reafon why fo much af my time went 
away with fo little work, viz. That what might be a 
little to be done with help and tools, was a vaft labour, 
j»nd reqiuircd a prodigious 'time to do alone, and by 
hand. 

But 



JrtCrVEKTURtS OV ROBINSON CRDSOE. tOT 

^ut notwithftant^ing tbUj^ with patience and labour f 
went through inany things, and indeed everything that 
my circumftances made necelTary for me to do, as will 
appear by what follow^. 

1 was how in the months of November and December^ 
expedling my crop of barley and rice. The^ ground I 
bad manured or dug up for theni was not great ; for a* 
I obferved, my .feed of e^ch was not above the quantity 
of half a peck ; for I had loft one whole crop by fowing 
in the dry fealbn ; but now my crop promifed very wejl,. 
when on a fuclden I found 1 was in danger of lofing it 
all again by enemies of feveral forts, which it was fcarce. 
poflible to keep from it. As, firft, the goats, and wild' 
creatures, which I called hares, who, tafting th6 fweet- 
nefs of the blade, lay in it all night and day, as foon as 
it came up, and eat it lb clofe, that i* could get rio time- 
to ft oot up into ft alks. 

This I faw no remedy for, but by making an inclofure. 
about it with a hedge, which 1 did with a great deal o£ 
toil ; and the more, becaufe it required a great deal oC 
i|)eed ; the creatures daily fpoiling my corn. However,, 
as my arable land was but fmall, fuited to my crop, I got 
it totally well fenced in about three weeks time; ancV 
ihooting fome of the creatures in the day time, I fet my 
dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a ilake at. 
the gate, where he could ftand and bark all night long ; 
foin a little time the enemies forfook tlife place, and the 
corn grew very llrong, z^nd well, and began to ripen apace^ 

But as the beads rained me before, while my corn was 
in the blade, fo the birds were as likeily to ruin me^now,^ 
when it was in the ear; for going along by the place, to 
fee how it throve, I faw my IJttle crop furrounded with 
fowls of I know not how many forts, which ilood as it 
were watching tilt I. lhould.be gone. I immediately let 
fly among them, fo^ 1 had, always my gun with me. — 
I had no fooner flipt t,han, there arofe \\p A httle cloud of 
fowls, which 1 bad not leen at alU from amons the cora 
melf. .. ./ 

This touched me feniibly, for I forefaw, that in a few 
days they would devour all ^y hopes : th^t I fhoukl be 
ftarved, andnever.be ablC' to raife a crop" at all, and 
what to do 1 couid^not tdl. However, 1 refolvcdjpot t'o"

vras an ine(!imahle comfort and acKantage to me too 5 
but aJl this, as I faid, made every thing laborious artil 
tedious to me, but that there was no help for ; neither 
was my time fo much lofs to me, becaufe I hacl dividetj 
it ; p. certain part of it was every day appointed to thefe 
works; and as I refolved to ufe none of the corn for 
bread, till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next 
fix months to apply myfelj wholly by labour and inven- 
tipn, to furnifh myfelf with utenfi Is proper for the per- 
forming all the operations neceffary for the making the 
corn, when I had it, fit f^r my ufe. 

Put firft I had to prepare more land, for I had now 
feed enough to fow above an acre of ground. Before I 
did this, 1 had above a week's work to rmjke me a ipade, 
which, when it was done, was a very Ibrry o^e indeed,, 
- and very heavy, and required double labour to work 
with it ; however, 1 went through that, and fowed my 
feeds in two large fiat pieces of ground, as near my houfe 
as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them m 
with a <rood hedo^c, the ilakes of which were all cut off 
that wood which I had fet before, which I knew would 
grow, fo that in one year's time I knew I fliould have a 
quick, or living hedge, that would want but little re- 
pair. This work was not fo little as to take me up lefs 
than three months, becaufe great part of that time was 
the wet "afon, when I could not go abroad. 

Within doors-, that is, when it rained, and I could not 
go out, I found employment on the following occafion : 
.Always obferving, that alt the while I was at work I' 
Inverted myfelf with talking to my parrot, and teaching 
him to fpcafc, and 1 quickly learned him to know his 
ownjiame; and at 1 aft to fpcak it pretty loud. Poll ; 
which was the firfl word levet heard fpoken in the iftand^ 
by any mouth bat my own. This therefore was not my- 
work, but an affiftant to my work ; for now^ as I faid^ 
I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows, 
viz. I had long iludied, by fo me means or other, ta 
make myfelf fome earthen veflfels, which indeed I want- 
ed forely, but knew not where to come at them ; how-' 
ever, confidering the heat of the climate, I did not 
doubt but, if I could find out any fuch clay, I might 
botch up Ibme fuck ptSl as might, being dried by the 



fon, behard enoti^, and flrong enough, to bear hand-* 
ling, ^^^ ^o hold any thing that was dry, and required 
to be kept, £b ; and as this was necefTary in preparing 
corn, rneal, &c. which was the thing I was upon» I re- 
folved to make fome as large as I could, and fit only to 
fend like jars, to hold what I (hould^put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at 
n\e, to telt bow many auk ward ways I took to raife this 
pafte, what odd mis-fhapen ugly things I made, how 
many of them fell rn, and how many fell out, the clay 
not being ftiff enough ^o bear its own weight ; how many 
cracked by^ tiie over violent heat of the fun, being fet out 
too hallily ; and hovf many fell to pieces with only re- 
moving, as well before as after they were dryetl ; and, in 
a word, how, after having laboured hard to tind the clay, 
to dig it, to temper it, to bring it Jiome, and work it, I 
could not make above two large earthen ugly things, I 
cannot call them jars, in about two months labour. 

However, as' the fun baked thefe two very dry and 
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet them dowxfc 
agam in two great wicker baflkets, which } had made on 
purpol'e for them, that they might not break ; and, as 
between^the pot and the bafket, there was a little rooxu 
to fpare, I (luffed it fall of the rice and barley draw :— 
and thefe two pots being to ftand always dry, I thought 
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, whea 
♦he corn was bruited. 

Though I mifcarried fo much in my defign for large 
pots, yet I made feveral fmalkr things with better fuc- 
cefs ; fuch as little round pots, fiat dithes, pitchers, ami 
pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to ; and the 
heat of the fua baked them itrangely hard. 

But all this wouid not anfwer my end, which was to 

fet an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the 
re, which none of thefe could do. It happene<l, after 
fome time, making a pretty large fire, for cooking' my 
meat, when 1 went to put it out, after 1 had done with 
it, 1 found a broken piece of one of my earthen ware 
vefiels in the fire, burnt as hard a? a Hone, and red as a 
tile. 1 was agreeably furprifed to (ee it, and faid to 
myfelf, that certainly they might be made to bwrn whole, 
ifthey would bum broken,

Tb's i4rt me to fi;o<!j how to order mj fire, ib as to 
maVe it bum me feme pots. I hud no nodoo of a kiln> 
fuch as the potters born in, or of giaxing them with 
lead, though I had fome lead to do it with ; • bat I 
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a 
pile one upon another, and placed my nre-wood all 
round it, with a great heap of embers under them : I 
plied the fire with fre(h fuel round the outtide, and u[ion 
the top, till I faw the pots in the iniide red hot quite 
ihrough, and obferved that they did not crack at all :— 
when 1 Taw them clear red, I let them ftand in that heat 
about five or iix hours, till I found one of them, though 
it did not crack, did meit or run ; for the fand which 
was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the 
hfat, and would have run into glafs, if 1 had gone on ; 
fo I Slackened my fire gradually, till the pots began to- 
abate of the red colour ; and watching them all nighty 
that I mic^fat not let the fire abate too fait, in the mom* 
ing 1 had three very good, I will not fay handfome, pip- 
kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could 
be dedred ; and one of them perfe<5ily glazed with the 
running of the fand. » 

After this experiment, I need not fay that I wanted no 
(brt of earthen ware for my ufe ; but 1 mud needs fay, as 
to the fhajies of them, they were very indifferent, as any 
one may fuppofe, when I had no way of making them, 
but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would 
make pies that never learnt to raife pafte. 

No joy, at a thing of fo mean a nature, was- ever equal 
to mir^e, when 1 found I had made an earthen pot that 
wotild bear the fire , and I had hardly patience to ftay 
till they were cold, before I let one upon the, fire again, 
with fome water in it> to boil me fome meat, which I 
did admirably well ; and with a piece o^ a kid I made 
fome very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and 
feveral other ingredients requilite to make it fo good as I 
would have had it. 

My next concern was to get me a flone mortar to- 
(lamp or beat fome corn in-; for as to the mill, there 
was. no thought of arriving to that perfection of^ art 
with one pair of hands. To fupply this want, I was 
at a great lofs ; for of all trades in the world I waa as

perfec^tly unqualified for a ftone-cutter as for any what-* 
ever ; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I fpenti 
many a day to find out a great llone, b"^^ enough to cut 
hoUow, and make fit for a mortar, anil could nnd none 
at all, except what was in the folid rock, and which I 
b;id no way to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks 
in the ifland of hardncfs fufficient, but were all of a fandy^ 
crumbling ilone, which would neither bear the weighl 
of a heavy peille, nor would break the corn without 
filling it with fand : fo, after a great deal of time loft in 
fearching for a ftone, I gave it over, and refolved to look 
out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed 
much eafier ; and getting one as big as I had ftrength ta 
llir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outfide with my 
axe and hatchet ; and then, with the help of fire and in- 
finite labour, naade an hollow place in it, as the Indians 
in Brafil majce their canoes. After this, 1 made a great 
heavy peille or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood» 
and this 1 prepared and lal.d by againfl I had my next 
crop of corn, when I propr^led to myfclf to grinds or ra- 
ther pound, my corn or meal to make -my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a lie ve or fierce, to 
drefs my meal, and ixart it from the bran and the hiifk,^ 
without which 1 did not fee it poffibie 1 could have any 
"bread. This was a. mod difficult thing, fo much as but 
to think on ; for to be fure 1 had nothing like the ne-« 
celTary thi:ngs to make it Avith ; I mean fine thin canvalV^ 
or ftutf'to fierce the nxeal through. And here I was at 
^ full ftopt for nvany months ; nor did I really know 
what to do ; linen 1 had none left but what was mere 
rags; I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how ta 
weave or fpin it ; and had I known liow, here were no 
tools to work it with ; all the remedy that I found for 
this was, that at lail I did remember 1 had ^nxong the 
feamen'^s clothes, which were faved out of the ihip, fomc 
neckcloths^ of callico of mufiin ; and with fame'pieces of 
thefe I made three fmall fieves, but proper enough for the 
work ; and thus | made (bift for fome years ; how I 
did afterwards, I ihall (hew in its place. 

'I'he baking part was the next thing to be eonfidered,^

there was no fupplying the want, fo I did not concern 
mylelf much about it. But for an oven, I was imlecid inr 
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for 
tliat alfo, which was this ; I made forae earthen veflfelj? 
very broad, but not deep; that is to fay, about two feet 
diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; thefe 1 burnt 
jn the fire as I had done the x)ther, and laid them by ; — 
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon 
the hearth, which I had paved with fome fquare tiles of 
my own making and burning alfo ; but I fhould not call 
them fquare.' 

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into» 
embers, or live coals, I drew them for\yard upon this 
hearth, fo as to cover it all over ; and there I Jet them 
lie, till the hearth was very hot ; then fweeping away all 
the embers, I fet down my loaf, or loaves ; and whelm* 
ing down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers 
all round the outfide of the pot, to keep in, and add ta 
the heat : and thus, as well as in the beft 'oven in the 
world, I baked ray barley-loaves, and became in a little 
time a mere paflry-cook into the bargain ; for I made 
myfelf feveral cakes of the rice, and puddings ; indeed I 
made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into them^ 
fuppoiing I had, except the fleih either of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered/ at, if all thefe things took 
me up mod part of the third year of my abode here ;— • 
for it is to be obferved, that in t^e intervals "of thefe 
things I had my new harvcft and hufbandry to ma- 
nage ; for 1 reaped my com in its feafon, and carried 
it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, 
in my large baikets, till I had time to rub it out; for 
1 had no floor to threih it on, or inftrumcnt to thrcfh it 
with. 

And now indeed my flock of corn increafing, I really 
wanted to build my barns bigger ; i wanted a place to. 
lay it up in ; for the increafe of the corn now yielded me 
fo much, that 1 had of the barley about twenty bufhels, 
and of the rice as much, or more ; infomuch that I now 
refolved to begin to ufe it freely, for my bread had been 
quite gone a great while : alfo I refolved to fee what 
quantity would be fufficient for me a whole year, and ta 
low but onc^ a year. 

Upoa 



ADVJBKTURES OF ROBINSON CUCSOr. / 1!5 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bufhcls of 
barley and rice were much more than T could confume in 
a year ; fo I refolved to ibw juft the fame quantity every 
year that I fowed the lail, in hopes that fuch a quantity 
"would fuVfy provide me with bread, &c. 

All the while thefe things were doing,, you maybe fure 
my thoughts ran many times upon the profpcA of the 
land which I had feen from the other ftde of the ifland ; 
and I was not without fecret wifhes, that I was on (hore ' 
there,- fancying, that feeing the main land, and a«i inha- 
bited country, 1 might findfome way or other to convey . 
myfclf farther^ and perhaps at laft find fome means of 
elbape. 

But alj this while 1 made no allowance for the dangers 
of fuch a condition, and how 1 might fall into the hands 
of favages, and perhaps fuch as I might have realbn to 
think far worfe than the lions and tigers of Africa : thqt 
if I once came into their power, I ftiftuld run an hazard 
more than a thoufand to one of being killed, and per- 
haps of bejng eaten ; for 1 had heard that the people of 
the Caribean coafis were cannibals, or men-caters ; and 
I knew, by the latitude, that I could not be far off from 
that ihore : that, fuppofe they were not cannibals, yet 
they might kill me, as many Europeans, who had fallen 
into thpir bands, had been fcrved, even when they had 
been Un or twenty together, much more 1 that was but 
one, and could make little or no defence. All the(e 
things, I fay, which 1 ought to have confidered well 
of, and 1 did caft up my thoughts afterwards,^ yet 
took none of tny apprchenfions at firft ; and my bend 
ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to that 
Ihore. < 

Now^ I wifhed for my boy Xury, and the long-boat^ 
■with the ihoulder of mutton fail, with which 1 faHed 
above a thoufand miles- on the coaft of 'Africa ; but thi& 
was in vain. Ti^n I thought 1 would go and look on 
ow fhip'd boat, which, as 1 have faid, was blown up 
upon the Ih^re a grett way in the ftorm, when we were 
firft caft away. She lay almoil where (he did at firft, 
but not quite, and waa turned by the for,ce of the waves 
end the winds, atniolt bottom upwards* againft the 
high ridge of beachy rough fandj, but no water about her 
tfrbfforCn ' • ' 



116 ADVENTURES OF- ROBINSON CRUSCTBw 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have 
launched her into the water, the boat would have don* 
well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brafils 
with her eafy enough ; but I might have ealily- foi«feent 
that I qould no more turn her, and fet her upright upoa 
her bbttora, than 1 could remove theifland. However^ 
1 went to the wood, and cut leaves and rollers, and 
brought them to the boat, refolved to try what I could 
do ; fuggeftijig to myfelf, that if I could but turn her 
do»wn> 1 might eafily repair the damage (he had re- 
ceived, and (he would be a very good boat, and I might 
go to fea in her very eafily. 

1 fpared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitleis toil» 
and fpent, L think,, three or four weeks about it; At laft,. 
finding it impoflible to heave it up with my little. ft riength^ 
1 fell to digging away the fand to undermine it ; and fa 
to make it fall down^ fetting. pieces of wood to thruft 
and guide it right in the faiL 

But when I had done this,* I was unable to ftir it ii\> 
again, or to get^undcr it, much lefs to move it forwards- 
to\yards the water ; fo I was forced to give it over ; and 
yet, though 1 gave over the hopes of the^boat, my delire 
to venture over for the main increafed,. rather than de-^ 
creafed, as the means for it feemed impoffible. 

This at length fet me upon thinking whether it wa» 
not pofliblc to make myfelf a canoe or periagua, fuch as 
the natives of thofe climates make, even without tools, 
or, as 1 might fay, without hands> vix. of the trunk 
of a gre^t tree. This 1 not only thought poflible, but 
eafy ; and pleafcd myfelf extremely with my thoughts 
of making it, and with my having much more conve- 
nience for it than any of the negroes or Indians ; but not 
at' all coniidering the particular inconveniencies which 
1 lay under fnore than the Indians did, viz. want o€ 
hands to move it into the water, when it was* made ;— 
a difficulty much harder for me to f^rmount than all 
the confequences of want of tools could be to them w^ 
for. what was it to me,^ that when I had chofen a vaft 
tree in the woods, J might with great trouble cut it 
down,, if, after I might be able -vyith my tools to hew

%here I found it> aud was not able to launch it into the 
water. 

Que would have thought I icould not have had the 
leaft refie6lion ujKjn my mind of my circumitance, while 
I was making this boat, but I ftiould have immediately 
tho€ight how 1 could get it into the Tea ; but rrty thoughts 
were fo intent upon my voyage over the »ea in it, that 
I never once coniidered how I (hould get it off* of the 
land ; and it was really in its own nature more ealy fof 
me to guide it over foity-five miles of iea, than about 
forty-frve fathom of land, where it lay, to let it afloat in 
the water. 

1 went to work upon this boat the moft like a fool 
that ever man did, who had any of his fenfes awake.-— 
i pleafed niylelf with the delign, -without determining 
whether I was ever able to undertake it ; not but that 
the difficulty of launeliing my boat came oi ten into niy 
head; but 1 put. a (lop to my own inquiries into it by 
this foolifli anfwer, which I gave myfelf;^ Let me firil 
make it ;^V\\ warrant I'll find fomc way or oth^r to get 
k along, when it is done. 

This was a moil prepollerous method > but the eager* 
nefs of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and 
felled a cedar-tree ; 1 queftion much vvhether Solomofi 
ever had fuch an one for the building the ^emple. at 
Jerufalerri ; it was five fee^ ten inches diameter at the 
lower part next the Hump, and four feet eleven inches 
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which-4t 
^eflened for a while, and then parted into branches. ^^ 
It was not without infinite labour that 1 felled this 
tree: I was twenty days backlog and hewing at it. at 
the bottom ; 1 was fourteen more getting the branch^ 
^nd limbs, and thevaft fpreading head of it, cutoff, 
.which t hacked and hewed throtgh with my axe and 
hatchet, with inexprefiible labour: After this it colt me 
a month toihape it, and dub it to a proportion, and t<> 
ibmethinor like the bottom of a boat, that it mi«jht 
fwira upright g»s it ought to do» It coft me near three

out fire, by mere mallet and chifi!el, and i>y the dint of 
kard labour; till 1 had brought it to be a very band*-

twenty men, and confequentJy big ehoitgh to have ^ar** 
tied me axid all ray cargo, ^ 

When I had gone through this Worki I \Vas extremelj^ 
tlclighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than 
1 ever ftiw a canoe or periagua, that was made of •one tree, 
in my life ; many a wenry ftioke it had colt, you may be 
fure, for there remained nothing but to get it into the wa* 
tcr ; and hud I gotten it into the water, I make nq quef'* 
ticn but Ifnould h'ave begun the raadeil \oyagc, and the 
molt unlikely to be ]>crformed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all jiiy devices to get it into the water failed me, 
though they coll infinite labour too ; it lay about one 
hundred yard^ from the Water, and not more ; but the 
firft inconvenience was, it was upiiill towards the creek, 
Well', to take atvay this, difcourag^ment, I refolved«to 
tlig into the furfacc of the earth, and fo make a decli- 
vity ; this J began, and it coft me a prodigious deal erf 
pains • but who 'grudge pains that have their deliverance 
in view ? But when this was worked through^ and this 
diffictilty managed, it was ftill much as one; for 1 could 
jio moreitir the ca.noe than 1 could the other hoot. 

Then I meafured the diilance of the ground, and re<* 
folvc<l to cut a dock, or canal, to brfng ihe water up to 
the canoe, feeing 1 could not' bring the canoe down to 
the water : Well, I bei an this work ; and when I began 
to enter into it, tmd calculated how deep it was to b6 
dug, how broad, how the Itufftobe thrown out, I found, 
that by the number of hands I had, being none but my 
own, it muli have been ten or tweU*e years before I 
Hiould have gone through with it; for the fhorc lay 
high, lb that at the upper end it muft have been at leaft 
twenty feet deep ; fo at length, though with great reluc* 
tancy, I gave this attempt over alfo.^ 

'Ibis gtievedme heartily ; and now I faw, though too 
kte, ^the folly of beginning a work before we count the 
coft, and before we ju4ge rightly of oiir own iirength to 
go through with it. 

la the middle of this work I flniiHed my fourth je.^t

devotion, and with as much comtortj as ever before ;

word of God, and, by the 'afilftance of his grace, I 

fained a different knowledge ivjm what i had before ; 
entertained different notions of things ; I looked now 
upon the world as a thing remc/te, which i liad nothing 
to do withv no exped:a icn from, and indeed no delires 
labout : In a w'ord, 1 had nothing indeed to do with it, 
nor was ever like to have ; fo 1 thought it looked as we 
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I 
had lived in, but was come out of it; and well 1 niight 
fay, as father Abraham to Dives, between me and thee 
there is a great guJph fixed. 

in the nrlt place, I was removed from all the \vicked»- 
nefs of the world here: 1 had neither the ju ft of the 
flefh, the luft of the eye, or the pride of life : 1 had no- 
thins^ to covet, for 1 had all I was now capable of enjoy- 
l.ig : I was lord of the whole memory or, if J plealed, 1 
m.ght call myfelf king or emperor over the whole coun- 
try which I had poffeflion of: There were no rivals*:— 
J. had no competitor, none to difputefovereignty or com- 
mand with me. I might have railed ihip loadings of 
com, but 1 had no ufe for it ; fo 1 let as little grow aS I 
thought enough for my occalion ; I h<id tortoil'es or tur- 
tles enough ; but now and then one was as much as I 
could put to any ufe : I had timber enough to haVe built 
a fleet of fliips ; 1 had graj)es enough to, have made 
vine, or to lluv^ cured into lailins, to have loaded that 
fleet when they had been built. 

But all 1 couK^ make ufe of was tW that was valuable : 
I had enough to cat, and to fupj)ly my w^nts, and what 
•was all the reft to me ? If 1 killed more flefli than I 
could eat, the dog muil eat it, or the vermin : if 1 fowed 
more corn than 1 could eat, it mult be fpoiled : Thetre«s 
that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground, 1 coukl 
'make no more ufe of them than for fuel, and that 1 haxl 
no occaiioiT for,b it to drefs my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things 
didtatetl to me ui)on juil refiedtiou, that all the , good 
things of this world are no farther good to us than 
'they are for our ufe ; and that whatever wo may hea{) 
up ihcieed to give to others, we enjoy as murh as we can 
ufe, and no more. The mofi covetous grijiing mifer in 
the world would have been cured of the vice gf 

covctoufnefs.

t^ovetoufnefs, if he had been in mytiafe; for I pofiefieil 
infinitely mofe than I knew what to do with. I had no 
room for delite, cscept it was of thinj^s which I had not) 
end they were but trilies, though indeed of great ufe to 
me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well 
^old as lilver, about thirty-fix pounds fterling. Alas! 
there the nafly, forry, Ufelels ftufrlay. I had no man^ 
tier of butinefs for it } and I ofteh thought with myfelf^ 
that I vvould hnve given an handful of it fot a grois of 
tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind ray cDrii ; nay, 
I would have given it all for fix penny-worth of turnep 
^ml carrot feed t)ut of Endand, or for an handful of 
peafe and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it Was, I had 
tiot the lead advantage by it, or benefit from it ; but there 
it Jay in: a drawer, and grew mouldy With the damp of 
the cave, in- the wet feafon \ and if 1 had haxl the drawer 
full of diamonds, it had been the fame cafe ; and they had 
been of no manner of value to me, becaufe of no ufe. 

I had now brought rtiy Hate of life to be mUch eaiier 
in itfelf thaivit was atfirll, and much eaiier to my mindj 
as well as to my body. I freqliently fat down to ray 
meat with thankfulnefs, and admired the hatid of God's 
providence, which had thus fpread my table in the 
wildernefs : I learned to look more upon the bright fidi* 
of my condition, and lefs upon the dark fide; and to 
confider what I enjoyed, rather than What I wan/ed \ 
and this gave rtie fometimes fuch fecret comforts, that I 
cannot exprefs them ; and which I take notice pf herej 
to put thofe difcontented people in mind of it, who can- 
not enjoy comfortably what God hath given tjiera, be-* 
caufe they fee and covet fomething that he has not giveh 
them. All our difcontehts about what we want, ap-* 
Speared to me to fpring from. the want of thankfulnefs fot 
what we have. 

Another Tcfle6lion was of j^reat ufe 16 me, and doubt-k 
lefs would be fo to any one that fhould fall , into inch, 
dillrefs as mine was 5 and this Was, to compare my pre- 
fent condition with what I at iirft expected it fhould be ; 
nay, with what it woUld certainly have been, if the good 
providence ojt^God had not wonderfully ordered the (hip 
to be call up nearer to the (horCj wherie 1 not only 
could come at her^ but could bring whajL I got out df

Iier to the (ho re for my relief and comfort i without 
which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, 
or gunpowder and (hot for getting my food. 

J fpent whole hours, I may fay, Whole days, in repre- 
lenting to myfelf, in the moll lively colours, how I muft 
have ad:ed, if 1 had got nothing out of the (hip ; how I 
could not have fo much as got any food, except fiih and 
turtles ; and that, as it was long before I found any of 
them, I mull have perifhed firft ; that 1 (hould have lived, 
if 1 had not perifhed, like a mere favage : that if 1 had 
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way 
to flay or open them, or part the flefh from the fkih and 
th'^ bowels, or to cut it up, but muft gnaw it with my 
teeth, and pull it with my cl&ws, like a beaft. 

Thefe reflections made me very fenfible Of the good- 
nefs of Providence to me, and very thankful for my pre- 
fent condition, with all its hardChips and misfortunes: 
and this part alfo I cannot but recommend to the reflec- 
tion of thofe who are apt, in their mifery, to fay, Is any 
ftfflidtion like mine ? Let them confider how much worle 
the cafes of fome people are, and vvhat their cafe might 
have been, if Pfovidencehad thought lit. 

1 had another refledlion which affided me alfo to 

comfort my mind with hopes, and this was, comparing 

my prefent condition with what I had defer ved, and had 

therefore reafon to expedl from the hand of Providence :* 

I had lived, a dreadful life, perfe(flly deflitute of the. 

knowledge and fear of God : 1 had been well inllruc- 

ted by my father and mother ; neither had- they been. 

wanting to me in thcir^ early endeavours, to infufe a 

religious awe of God iiito my mind, a fenfe of my 

duty, and of what the nature and end of my being 

required of. me: but alas! falling early into the fea- 

faring life, which of all the lives is the moll deflitute 

of _the fear, of God, though his terrors are always before 

them ; I fay, falling early into the fea-faring life, and 

into feia-faring company, all that little fenfe of celigion 

w^hich I had entertained, was laughed out of me by my 

meffmates ; by an hardening defpiling of dangers, and 

the views of death, which grew habitual to me ; by 

my long abfence from ail Tiianncr of opportunities to 

converfe with any thing but what was like myfelf,

or to hear any thing of what was good, or tended to^ 
wards it. 

So void was I of every thing that was good; or of the 
leaft fenfe of what I was, or was to be, that in the 
greatefl: deliverance I enjoyed, fuch as my efcape from 
Salee, my being taken up by the Portngueie mailer of 
the ihip, my being planted fo well in Brai'il, my receiv- 
ing the cargo from England, and the like, I never once 
bad the word thank God, fa much as on my mind, or in 
jny mouth ; nor in t]ie greateft diiirefs had 1 io much 
thought as to pray to him ; nor fo much as to fay. Lord 
have mercy upon me ! No, not to mention the name of 
God, unlefs it was to fwear by, and blafpheme it. 

I had terrible refledlions upon my mind for many 
months, as I have already obferved, on account of 
my wicked and hardened life paft ; and when I looked 
about me, and confidered what particula(r providences 
had attended me, fmce my coming into this place, and 
^ h w God had dealt bountifully with me ; had not only 
puniihed me Icfs than my iniquity deferved, but had fo 
plentifully provided for irte ; this gave me great hopes 
that my fepcntance was accepted, and that God had yet 
mercies in ftore for me. 

With thefe reflections I worked my mind up, not only 
to reiignation to the will of God in the prefent difpo- 
- ^tion of my circumllances, but even to a lincere thank- 
ftilnefs of my condition ; and that 1, who was yet a living 
man, ought not to complain, feeing 1 had not the due 
puniihment of my fins ; that I enjoyed fo many mercies, 
"which I had no reafon to have expe<5ted in that place; 
that I ought never more to repiiie at my condition, but 
to rejoice, and to give daily thanks tor that daily 
bread, which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have 
"brought: that I ought to coniider 1 had been fed even 
by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by 
tavens; nay, by a long feries of n^iracles; and that X 
• could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part 
of the world where 1 could have been caft more to my 
advantage : a place, where, as 1 had no fociety, which 
was my affli<5lion on one hand, fo 1 found no ravenous 
beads, no furious wolves or tygers, to threaten my 
life; no venomous cr^tures, or poifonous, which I might 

hav* 



"feave fed oft to my hurt, no favages to murder and de- 
vour me. " ' ' 
In a word, as my life Was. a life of forrow one way, fo 
it was a life of mercy another ; and I wanted nothing to 
make it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my 
fenfe of God's good nefs to me, arid care Over mein thi^ 
condition, be my daily confolation ; and after 1 miide a 
jjuft improvement of thefe things, I went away, and was 
no more fad. 

Ihad now been here fo l6ng, that my things, which I 
brought pn fhore for my help, were either quite gone^ 
or very much walled, and near fpent. 

My ink, as I obferved, had been gone foffome time^ 
all but a very little, which I eked out with water ^ 
little and a little, till it was fo pale it fcarce left any ap- 
pearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lafted^ 
I made ufe of it to minute down the days of the rao;ith • 
on which any remarkable thing happened to me ; and 
iirft by cafting uptimes pail, P remember that there wa3^ 
a flrange concurrence of days, in the various providences 
which befel me, and which, if I had been luperftitioully 
inclined to obferve days as fatal or fortunate, I mij^Ut 
have had reafon to have looked upon witn a great deal 
of CTiriolity. 

Firft-, I had obferved, that the fame day that I broke 
away from my father and my friends, anf tan away to 
Hull in order to go to fea, the fame day afterwards I wa8 
taken by the Sallee man of war, and made a flaye. 

The fame day of the year that I efcaped out of the wrecfe 
of that Ihip in Yarmouth Roads, that fame day of the yeac 
afterwards I made my efcape from Sallee in the boat. 

The fame day of the year I was born on, viz. the 
SOth of September, the fame day 1 had my life fo mira- 
culoufly faved cwenty-fix years after, when I was caft 
afhore in this iiland ; fo that my wicked life, and foji- 
tary life, both began on a day. 

The next thing to my ink's beinj^ walled was that of 
my bread, I mean the biicuit which I brought. out of the 
ihip: this Ihad hufbanded to the lalt degree, allowing 
itiyfelf but one cake of bread a day, for above a y>ear ; 
and yet i was quite without bread for a year before I 
got any corn of my own ; and great reafon I had to be

thankful tbat I had any at all, the getting it being, as .hat 
teen already obfcrved, next to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. As to linen, 
I had none a good while, excej)t fome checquercd iliirts 
which^ 1 foynd in the chefls of the other leamen, and 
ivh.ichl carerully prelerved, becaufe many times I could 
'bear no qlher clothes on but a fliirt ; and it was a very 
'great help to mCf ihat I had, among all the men's clothes 
bf the fliip, ahnoftjhree dozen of (hirts. There were alio 
ieveral thick \\;atch-coats of the Teamen, which were left 
pehlrid, but they vrere too hot to wear ; and though it is 
\rue, that the weather was fo violent hot, that there was 
no need «f clothes, yet I could not go quite naked ; no, 
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not ; noj 
"tould I abide the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. 

One reafon why I could not go quite naked was, I 
"could not bear the heat of the fun fo Well when^ quite 
^xiaked, as with Ibme clothes on ; nay, the very heat fre- 
quently bliltered my (kin ; whereas, with a fhirt on, the 
* air itfelf made fome motion, and whiftling under" the 
fhirt, was twofold cooler than without it : no more could ' 
I ever bring myfelf to go out in the heat of the fun with- 
out a cap or an hat ; the heat of the fun beating with 
fuch violence as it does in that place, would give me the 
head-ach prefently, by Parting fo diredlly on my head^ 
without a cap or hat on, fo that 1 could not bear it :— 
'whereas, if 1 put on my hat, it wo-uld prefently go away. 

Upon tkefe views I began to confider about putting 
the few fags I had, wliich 1 called clothes, into fome 
order ; I had worn out all the waiftcoats 1 had, and my 
bulinefs was now to try if I could not make jackets out^ 
of the great tvatch-coats which 1 had by me, and with 
fuch other materials as I had ; fo I fet to work a taylor* 
" ing, or rather indeed a botching ; for I made moll: pite- 
N ous work of it. However, I made fliift to make two or 
three warftcoats, which I hoped would ferve me a great 
while : as for breeches pr drawers^ I made but forry fhift 
indeed, till aftervVards, 

I have mentioned that I faved the fkins of all the 
creatures that I killed ; 1 mean four-footed ones ; and I 
bad hung them up, ftretched out with fticks in the fun; 
by which means fome of them were fo dry and hard, that 

they

fiiey were fit for little ; but otlrers, it feems, were very 
ufeful. The firlt thing I made of thefc was a great cap 
for my head, with the hair on the outfide to Ihoot off* the 
rain ; and this I performed fo well, that after this I macj^ 
a fuit of clothes wholly of thofe fkins ; that is to fay, a 
Waiilcoat and breeches opeii at the knees, ' knd both 
ioofe ; for they were rather "wanting to keep me cool, 
than to keep me warm. I mufl not omit to acknow- 
ledge, that they were wretchedly made; for ifl was ^ 
bad carpenter, I was a worfe taylor. However, they 
•werefuch as I made a very good fhift with ; and when 
I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the 
"waiftcoat and cap being outmoft, I was kept very dry. 

After this I fpent a deal of time and pains to make me 
an umbrella*: I-was indeed in great want of one^ and 
had a great mind to make one, 1 had feen them made in 
the Brafils, where they are very ufeful in the great heats 
which are' there ; and I felt the heats every jot as great 
here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox. Befides,, 
as 1 was obliged to be much abroad, it was a moil ufe- 
ful thins: to me, as well for the rains as for* heats. I 
ttook a wbrld of pains iat it, and was a great whilt bef?r^ 
I coiild make any thing likely td hold. "Na^,- aft^r I 
thought 1 had hit the way, 1 fpoiled two or three before 
J made one to my mind ; but at lail I made one that an- 
fwered indifferently well : the n\ain difRcalty 1 found 
was to make it to let down. 1 could make it to fpread ; 
but if it did not let dowi^ too, and draw in, it would not 
be portable for me any way, but jufl over my head, 
"which would not do. However, at lall, as I faid, I rnade 
one to aufwer ; I covered it with fkins, the hair upwards, 
fo that it Caft oft' the rain like a penthoufe, and kept off 
the fun fo efFe<ftually, that I could walk out in the hot- 
eft of the weather, with greater advantage than I couM 
before in thecoolefl ; and when I had no need of it, I >^ 
could clofe it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind 'being 
entirely compofed, by refigning to the will of God, and 
throvvmg myfelf wholly upon. the difpoi'al 6f his provi- 
dence. This made my life better than fociable; for

would afk myfelf,- whether thus converting mutually

For this purpofe, and that I might do every thing with 
clifcretion and conlideration, Mitted up a little m aft to 
my boat, and made a fail t6 it out of fome of the pieces 
o^thefliip's fails, which lay in ftore, and of which I 
had a great ftore by me. 

Having fitted my maft and fail, and tried the boat, I 
found fhe would~ fail very well. Then 1 made little 
lockers and boxes at either end of my "boat, to put pro- 
•vifions, neceflarics, and ammunition, &c. into, to be kept 
dry, either frgm rain, or the fpray of the fea ; and a little 
long hollow place'] cut in the inilde of the boat, where 
I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over 
it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella alfoin a flep at the ftern, like a 
maft, to Hand over my head, and keep the heat of the 
fun off" me like ai% awning ; and thus I every now and 
then took a little voyage upon the fea, but never went 
far out, nor far from the little creek : but at laft, being 
eager to view'the circumference of my little kingdom, I 
relolved upon my tour, and accqrdingly I victualled my 
ihip-for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves 
^ cakes I fhould rather call them) of barley bread ; an 
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal 
of, a little bottle of riira, half a goat, and "J^owder with 
ihot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of 
thofe which, as I mentioned before, 1 had faved out of 
the feamen's chefts : thefe I took, one to lie upon, and 
the other to cover me in the night. ^ 

It was the iixth of November, in the fixth year of my 
reign, or my captivity, which you pleafe, that i fet out 
on this voyage and I found it much lohger than I ex- 
pected; for though the illand itfelf was not very large, 
yet when I came to the eaft lide of it, I found a great 
ledge of rocksr lie out about two leagues into the fea, 
fome above water, fome under it ; and beyond this a 
ihoal of fand, lying dry half a league more ; fo that 1 
was jobiiged to go a great way out to fea to double that 
point. 

When I firft difcovered them, I was going to give 
.over my enterprize, and come back again, not knowing 
how far ix might oblige me to go out to fea, and above 
all, doubting how I fhould get back again ; fo I came

to an anchor, for I had made rae a kind of an anchor* 
with a piece of broken grappling, whith-f got out of the 

fhip. #. . * 

Having fecurcd my boat, I took my gun, and went 
on fhore, climbing up an hill, which ieemed to over- 
look that jK)int, where I faw the full extent of it, and 
lefolved to venture. 

in my viewing the fea from that hill where Iftood, I 
perceived a firong, and indeed a moil furious current, 
which ran to the eaft, even came clofe to the point ; and 
1 took the more notice of it, becaufe I faw there might be 
lome danger, that when I came into it, I might be car- 
ried out to fea by the firehgth of it, and not be able to 
make the iiland again. And indeed, had I not gotten 
firll upon this hill,. I believe it would have been fo ; for 
there was the fame current on the other fide of the ifland, 
only that it fet off at a farther dillance ; and I faw there 
was a ilrong eddy under the ihore ; fo I had nothing to 
'do but to get out of the firft current, and I ihould pre- 
fently be in an eddy. , 

I lay here, however, two days; becaufe the wjnd> 
blowing pretty _frefh (E. at S. E. and that -being juft 
contrary to the faid current), made a great breach of the 
fea upon the point ; fo that it was not fafe for me to 
keep too clofe to the {bore for the breach, nor tp go too 
far off becaufe of the ftream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having 
abated overnight, the fea was calm, and I ventured; 
but I am a warning-piece again to all rafh and ignorant 
pilots ; for no fooner was I come to the poiijt, when 
even I was not my boat's length from the fhore, but 
I found myfelf in a great depth of water, and a cur- 
rent like a fluice of a mill. It carried my boat along 
with it with fuch violence, that all I could do coukl 
not keep4ier fo much as on the edge of it ; but I found 
it hurried me farther ^nd farther out from the eddy, 
which was on the left hand. There was no wind llir- 
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my pad- 
dles fignified nothing ; and I npw began to give my- 
lelf over for loft ; for, as the current was on both fides 
the iiland, I knew, in a few leagues diftance, they 
mull join again,' and then i was irrecoverably gone;

thankful temper, and how 1 had repineJ at my folitary* 
condition ; and no\V what would 1 give to be on {hor;e 
there again ? Thus we never fee the true (late of our 
condition, till it is illnftrated to' us by its contraries ; 
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want 
of it ; it is fcarte poffible to imagine tb6 conllernation I 
was now in, being driven from my beloved ifland (foe 
ib it appeared tome now to be) into the wide ocean, 
almoft two leagues, and in the utmod defpair of ever 
recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till in- 
deed my llrength was alrtioft exbaufted, and kept my 
boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the 
fide of the current which the eddy lay on, as poflibly 
1 could ; when about noon, as the fun palfed the me- 
ridian, I thought 1 felt a little breeze of wind id my 
face, fptinging up from the S. S. E, This cheerctl my 
heart a little, and efpecially when in about half an hour 
more it blew a pretty Imall gentle gale. By this'time 
1 was gotten at a frightful diilance from the illind ;'— 
and, had the leaft cloud or hazy weather intervened, I 
had been undone another way too ; for 1 had no com-^ 
pafs on board, andfhould never have known Viow ta 
have ftcered towards the ifland, if I had but on<;4i lo4t

ADV^NTURIS OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. t^l 

^bout a league of the ifland, I found the point of the 
rocks which occafioned this diftance frt etching out as i& 
defcribed before, to the- foathward, and, calling ofFthc^ ' 
current rpore foutherly, had of courie made another 
eddy to the north, and this I found very ftrong, but not 
ciiredlly fetting the vvay my courfe lay, which was due 
"vveft, but almoil full north. However, having a frefli 
gale, I liretched acrofs this eddy, flanting north well, and 
in about an hcmr came within about a mile (hot of the 
Ihore, where, it bejng finooth water, 1 foon got to land^ 

When I was on ihore, 1 fell on my knees, and gave 
God thanks tor my deliverance, refolving to lay aiide 
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and refrefh-* 
* ing myferf with fuch things as 1 had, 1 brought my boat 
clofe lo the ihore, in a little cove that 1 had efpied under 
fome trees, and iaid me down to deep, being quite fpent 
with the labour and fatigue of the voyage. - ^ . ' 

I was now at a great lofs which way to get home with 
my boat; 1 had ran ib much hazard, and knew toa 
much the cafe to thmk of attempting it by the way I 
•went out ; and what.rpight beat the other lide (I meaa 
the weft-fide) 1 knew nor, nor had I any mind to rua 
any more ventures : fo 1 only refolved in the morning ta 
make ray way weftward along the fhore, and to fee if 
there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in» ^ 
fafety, fo as to have her again it' 1 wanted her. In about 
three miles, or thereabouts, coafting the {liore, 1 came 
to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which 
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook» 
where 1 found a convenient harbour for my boat, and 
where (he lay as if the had been in a little dock- made oa 
purpofe for her. Here 1 put in ; and having flowed my ' 
boat very fafe, I went on ihore to. look about me, and 
lee where I was. 

i foon fojand I had but a little pafled by t^e place 
where 4 had been before, when I travelled on foot to that 
fhore; fo* taking nothing out i of my boat but my gua 
and' my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my 
march. The way was comfortable enough after fuch at 
voyage as 1 had been upon, and 1 reached my old bower 
in the evening, \Vhere I found e^ery thing Handing as I 
left it ; for 1 always kept it in good order^ being, as 1

132 ADVENTI3RES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the (hade 
to reft my limbs, for 1 was very weary, and fell afleep r 
"but judge you, if you can, that read my flory, what a 
furprize I muftbe in, when I was awaked out of my 
ileep by a voice calling me by my name feveral times, 
Robin, Robin, Robinion Crufoe, poorRobinfon Crufoet 
Where are you, Robin Crufoe ? Where are you ? Where 
tave you been ? 

I was fo dead afleep at firft, being fatigued ^ith row- 
ing or paddling, as it is called, the tirfl part of the day, 
and walking the latter part, that I did not awake tho- 
roughly ; and dozing between ileeping and waking, 
thought I dreamed that fomebody fpoke to me : but as 
the voice continued to repeat Robin Crufoe, Robin 
Crufoe, at laft I began to awake more perfedtly, and was 
nt firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the utn^oft 
confternatlon ; but no fooi^r were my eyes open, but I 
faw my Poll fitting on the top of the hedge, and imme- 
diately knew that this was he that fpoke to me; for juft 
in fuch bemoaninof lansfuaere 1 had ufed to talk to him,. 
and teach him ; and he had learned It lb perfedly, that 
he would fit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe to my 
face, and cry. Poor Robin Crufoe, where are you ?— - 
Where have you been ? How came you here ? and fuch 
things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and 
that indeed it could be nobody elfe,. it was a good while 
before 1 could comp'ofe myfelf. Firft, I wats amazed how 
the creature got thither, and then how he fiiould juft 
keep about the place, and no where elfe ; but as I was 
well fatisfied.it could be nobody but honetl Poll, I got it 
over ; and holding out my hand, and calling him by his 
name, Poll, thet'ociable creature came to me, and fat upon 
my thumbs as he ufed to do, and continued talking to me» 
Poor Robin Crufoe, and, how did I come here ? and, 
where had 1 been ? jull as if he had been overjoyed to 
fee me again ; an.d fo I carried him home along Avith me. 
I had now had enough of rambling to fea for fomc 
time, and bad enough to do for many days to fit ftill, 

and refledl upon the danger I had been in. 1 would 
have been very gkd to have had my boat again on 
jny fide of the illalxd, but 1 knew not how it was

prafticjble to get it about. As to -the eail fide of the 
ifland, which I had gone round, I knew well enough 
there was no venturing that way ; ray very heart would 
Ihrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of Lt : 
and to the other fide of the iffand I did not know how 
it might be there ; but fuppofing the current ran with 
the fame force againft the Ihore at the eaft, as it palfcd 
by it on tiie other, I might run the fame rifque of being 
driven down the ftream, and carried by the iiland, as 
I had been before of beinor carried awav from it ; Co 
•with thefe thouorhts I contented myfelf to be withoQt 
any boat, though it had been the produdl of many 
months' labour to make it, and of fo many more to get 
it into the fea. 

In this government of my temper I remained near a 
year, lived a very fedate retired life, as you may well 
luppofe ; and my thoughts being very much compofed, 
as to my condition, and fully comtbrted in reiiigning 
mylelf to^the difpofitions of Providence, I thought 1 lived 
really very happily in all things, except that of iociety. 

I improved myfelf^ in this time, in all the mechanic 
cxcrcifes which my neceilities put me upon applying 
myfelf to ; and I believe could, upon occafion, have 
made a very good carpenter, efpecially confidering how 
few tools 1 had. 

Belides this, I arrived at an unexpe6led perfeftion in 
roy earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make 
them with a wheel, which I found infinitely ealier and 
better, becaufe 1 made things round and (hapeable, which 
before were filthy things indeed to look on. But 1 think: 
I never was more vain of my own j>erformance, or more 
joyful for any thing I found out, than for my being able 
to make a tobacco-pipe.; and though it was a very ugly 
clurnfy thing when it was done, and only burnt red like 
other earthen ware, yet as it was hard and tii m, and would 
draw the fmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it ; 
for I had always been ufed to fmoke, and there were jnpes 
in the fbip, but 1 forgot them at firl't, not knowing there 
was tobacco in the iiland ; and afterwards, when 1 fearch- 
ed the fhip again, I could not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware 1 alfo improved much, and made 
abundance of ueceEary bafkets as well as my invention

ihewed me, though not very handfome, yet convenieBt 
' for my laying things up in, or fetching thint^s home in. 
For example, if] killed a goat abroad, 1 could hang it up 
in a tree, flay it, and dreis it, and cut it in pieces, and 
bring it home in a buiket ; and the like by a turtle ; I 
could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two 
of thefiefh, which was enough for me, and bring thera 
home in a biiflc^t, and leave the reft behind me. Alfo 
large deep bafkets were nly receivers f6r my corn, which 
1 always rubbed out as loon as it was dry, and cured ; 
and kept it in great bcfk^ts inftead of a granary. 

1 began now to perceive my powder abated conilder- 
abiy^ ; and this was a want which it was impoiiible for 
me to lupply, and J began ftriouilly to coniider what- I 
raui: do when Lfhould have no more powder ; that is to 
fay, how I Ihould do to kill any goats. J had., as I ob- 
ferved in the third year of my being here, kept a youn^ 
kid, and bred her up tanie. I was in hopes of getting 
a he kid, but I could not by any means bring it to 
pafs, till my kid grew an old goat;' and 1 could never 
find in ray heart to kill her, till, (he died at lall of mere 
age. 

But being pow in the eleventh year of my refidence^ 

and, as 1 have Paid, my ammunition growing low, 1 fet 

' myfelf to Itudy fome art to trap and fnare the goats, to 

fee whether 1 could not catch fome of them alive,' and 

particularly I wanted a fhe-goat great with young. 

To this purpofe I made fnares to hamper them ; aivl 
believe they were more than once taken in thera ; but ray 
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and alwaya 
' found them bro'ken, and my bclit devoured. 

At length I refolvedto try a pit-fall ; '^o. I dug feveral 
large, pits in the earth, jn places where 1 had obferved 
the goats ufed to feed, and o\er thefepits I placed hurdles 
of my own making too, v/ith a great weight upon them, 
and feveral times 1 put ears .of barley, and dry rice, with- 
out fetting the trap ; and 1 could eafily perceive that the 
goats had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that 1 could 
lee the mark of thek feet. At length i let three traps 
in one night, and going the next morning, 1 found them 
all fianding, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was

in one of the other, three kids, a male and two females. 

As to the old one, ] ^cnewnot what to do with him ; he 
was fo, fierce I durft not go into the pit to him ; that is 
to fay, to go abovt to bring him away alive, which was 
what I Wfinted. I could have killed him, but that was 
^ot npy V^iinefs; nor would it anfwer my end ; fo I e'er^ 
|et him out, and he ran away as if he had been fright-r 
^ned put of hisrwits; but I did not then know what J 
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a lion. If 
I had let him ft^y there three or four days without food, 
and then have carried him fome water to drink, and thti^ 
fi little ^ona, -he would have been as tame as one of the 
Jcide ; for they are mighty fagacious tradlable creatures^ 
.-where they are well ufed. 

However, for the prefent I let him. go, knowing no 
better at: that time ; theh 1 went to the three kids ; anU^ 
taking them one by one, I tied them with firings toge- 
ther; and with foAe ditBculty brought thern all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed, but

I3S ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CKVSOt, 

I was fomething impatient, as I had obferved, to hav^

"went up the hill to Tee how th^ flrorelay, and how. the 
current fet, that I might fee what I had to do. This in- 
^clination increafed upon me every day, and at length I 
lefolved to travel thither by land, and following the edge 
of the fhore, I did fo : but had any one in England been 
to meet fuch a man as 1 was, it mull either hav^frighted 
them, or raifed a grea^ deal of laughter ; ^nd as 1 fre- 
quently ftood ftill to look at myfelf, I could not but fmile 
at the notion of my travelling through Yorkfhire with 
fucn an equipagp, apd in fuch a drefs. Be pleafed to 
take a fketch of my figure, «ns follows :— 
^ I had a great high ihapelefs cap, made of goat's fkin, 
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to,^keep the 
fun from me, as to fhoot the rain off from running into 
my neck ; nothing being fo hurtful in thefe climates as 
the rain upon the flefti under the clothes. 

1 had a fliort jacket of goat^s ikin, the fkirts coming 
down to about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair of 
open-kneed breeches ^f the fame. The breeches were 
made of afkin of an old he-goat, whofe^air hung down 
fuch a lepgth on either (ide, that, like pantaloons, it 
reached to the middle of my legs. Stoc^iings and fhoes 
1 had none ; hut I had made me affair of fomething, I 
fcarce kne\y what to call them, like buikins, to flap over 
my legs, and lace on either fide like fpatterdaflies ; but 
of a moll barbarous fiiape, as indeed were all the reft of 
my clothes. . 

I had on a broad belt of goat's fliin dried, which I 
drew together with two thongs of the farjie, inllead of 
buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either fide of 
this, inflead of a fword aud dagger, hung a little faw 
and a hatchet, one on one tide, one on the other. I 
had another belt not fo broad, and faftened in the farae 
manner^ which hu;ig over my Ihoulder; and at the 
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both

inade of goat's fkin too ; in one of which hung my 
pow/ler, in the other my iliot. At my back 1 carried 
my bafket, on my fhoulder my gun, and over my head 
a great clumfy ugly goat's-fkin umbrella, but which, 
after all, was the moll neceliary thing I had about me, 
next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was 
really not io Mullato-like as one might expe6l from a 
maji not at all careful of it, and liviug withm nine or 
ten degrees of the Equinox. My beard I hjid once fuf-* 
fcced to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long ; ^ 
but as 1 had both fcilfars and razors futficient, Lhad cut 
it pretty fhort, except what grew on my upper lip, which 
, I had trimmed into a large ])air of Mahometan whiikers,

but they were of length and ihape monllrous enough, and 
fuch as in England would have paffed for frightful. 

Bpt all this is by the bye ; for as to my figure, I ha<J 
ib few to obferve me, that it was of no manner of con- 
:fequci3ce ; fo I fay no ipore to that part. In this kind of 
£gure I went my new journey, and was out five or ii|: 
idays. I travelled firft along the fea-lhore, diredlly to the 
^la^ where 1 firft brought my boat to anchor, to get up 
upon .the rocks ; and, having no boat now to take care 
ofV I >^€|it 6v*r the land a nearer w^y, to the famei 
height that 1 was upon betpre ; when, looking forward to

tiad planted them fo very thick, I was forced to pull fom6 
of them up again. 

Jn this place alfo I had my grapes growing, which I 
principally depended on for my winter Itore' of raiiins, 
and whicli 1 never failed to preferve very carefully, ^s the 
beft arid moil agreeable dainty of my whole Kliet ; and 
indeed they were not agreeable only, but phyfical, whole- 
Ibme, nourifhing, and refrelhing to the lalt degree. 

As this was aifo about half-way between my other ha- 
bitation and the place where I had laid up my boat, I 
generally {faid and lay here in my way thither ; fori 
ufed frequently to vifit my boat, and 1 kept all things 
about or belonging to her in very good order. Some- 
times I went out in her to divert myfelf, l)ut no morfe 
hazardous voyages would I go, nor fcarcc ever above a 
Clone's cail or two from the iHore, I was fo apprehenfive 
of being hurried out of my knowledge &gain by the cur- 
rents, or winds, or any other accident ; but now I come 
to a new fcene of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towaVds my 
boat, I was exceedingly furprized with the print of a 
man's naked foot on the (here, which was very plain to 
be.leefi in the land. I ftood like one thunderltruck, or 
as if 1 had feen an apparition ; I liftened, I looked round 
me, 1 could hear nothing, nor feeany thing; I Ayent up 
to a rifing ground, to look farther. I went up the Ihore, 
and down the fhore, but it was all one, I could fee no 
other imprellion but that one. I went to it again to fefc 
if there were an)* more, and to oblerve if it might not be 
my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there was 
exafflly the very print of a foot, toes, heel, and every 
part of a foot. How it came thithar I knew not, nor 
could in the leafl imagine. But after innumerable flutter- 
ing thoughts, lilife a man perfe(^ly confufed, and out of 
myfelf, 1 came home to my fortitication, not feeling, as 
•we fay, the ground] went on, but terrified to the laft de- 
gree, looking behmd mef at every two or three fteps, mif- 
taking every bufii land tree, and fancying fcvery-^ump 
at a diliance to be a man ; nor is it poffible to defcribe 
how many various (hapes an atfrighted imagination re- 
prefented things to me in ; how Inany wild ideas were

finaccountable whimiies came' into my thoughts by the 
■way. 

When I came to my catlle, for fo I think I called it ever 
after this, I fled into it like one purfued : whether 1 went 
oyer by the ladder, as firll contrived, or went in at the 
liple in the rock, which 1 called a door, I canriot remem- 
ber ; for never (^righted hare -fled to cover, or fox to earth, 
with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. 

I had no deep that night ; the farther I was from the 
occafion of my fright, the greater my jtppreheiifions 
•were, which is iamething contrary to the nature of iuch 
things, andefpecially to theut'ual pradlice of all creatures 
in fear. But I was fo embarraiTed with my own fright- 
ful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing bQt difmal 
imaginations to myfelf, even though I was now a great 
way off it. Sometimes 1 fancied it mud be the devil ; 
and reafon joined in with me upon this.fuppotition. For 
how (hould any other thing in human {hape come into 
the ^)lace ? Where was the veflel that brought them ?— * 
What marks were there of any other footlteps ? And 
how was it poiTible a man fhouhl come there ? But therl 
to think that Satan fhould take human fhape upon him, 
in fuch a place,, where there could be no manner of occa- 
fion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him, 
and that even for no purpofe too (for he could not be 
fu re 1 {hould fee it), this was an amazement the othei? 
way.' I conlidered that the devil might have found out 
abundance of other ways to have terriiied me than this 
of the fingle print of a foot. That as I lived quite on 
the other tide of the -iiland, he would never have been fo 
fimple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou- 
fand to one whether 1 (hould ever fee it or not, and in 
^ the fand too, which the tirft furge bf the fea upon an high 
wind would have defaced entirely. All this feemed in- 
€onfiftent with the thing itfelf, and with all notions we 
tifually entertain of the fubtlety of the devil. 

Abundance of fuch thing's as thefe aflifted to argrue 
^e out ot all apprehenfions of its being the devil. And 
^ ptefently qoncluded, then, that it mufi: be fome more 
dangerous creature, viz. That it mull be fome of the

illand ; and had been on ihore, but were gone away again 
to iea, being as loth, perhaps, to have ilaid in this defb-- 
kteifland, as I would have been to have had them. 

VV hiie thefe reflections were rolling upon, my mind, 
I was very thankful in my thought, that I was fo happy 
as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did 
not Tee my boat, by which they would have concluded 
that fome inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps 
have fearched farther for me : then terrible thousrhts 
racked my imaginations about their having found my 
boat, and that there were? people here ; and that if To, 
I fhould certainly have them come again in greater num- 
bers, and devour me : that if it fhould happen fo that 
they {bould not find me, yet they would find my inclo- 
iure, dellroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of 
tame goats, and I Ihould periih^t laft for mere want. 

Thus my fearl)anilhed all my religious hope ; all that 
former confidence in God, which was founded i*pon 
fuch wonderful experience, as 1 had had of his good- 
nei's, now vanilhed ; as if he that had fed me by miracle 
hitherto, couUl not preferve, by his power, the provifion 
ivhich he had made for me by his goodnefs. 1 re- 
proached myfelf with my eafinefs, that i would not fow 
any more corn one year, than would juft ferve me till 
the next feafon, as if no accident could intervene to pre- 
vent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground : 
and this 1 thought fo juft s^ reproof, that I refolved, for 
the future, to have two or three years' corn before-hand, 
fo that whatever might come, I might not perilh for 
want of bread. > 

How firange a chequer-work of providence is the 
life of man ! And by what fecret differing fprings are 
the affediions hurried about, as diflering circumltances 
prefent ! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate ; to- 
day we feek wiiat to-morrow we limn ; to-day we de- 
lire what to-morrow we tear ; nay, even tremble at the 
apprehenlions of. This was exemplified in me at this 
time in the mod lively manner imaginable ; for I, 
whofe only afflidion was, that 1 feemed baniflicdfrom 
human Ibciety, that i was alone, circumfcribed by the 
bouncllefs ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned

tb what I call a filent iifc ; that I was as one whom 

Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the 

Uving, or to appear among the reft of his creatures ; that 

to have feeU one of my own fpecies would have feemed 

to me a railing me from death to life, and the greateft 

Wefling that Heaven itfelfi next to the fupreme bleffing 

offalvation, could bellow: I fay, that I fliould now 

tremble at the very apprehenlions of feeing a man, and 

•was ready to fink into the ground, at but the (hadow, or 

fllent appearance of a man s having fet his foot on the 

illand. 

Such is the uneven llaite of human life ; and it afford- 
ed me a great many curious fpcculations aftei'wards, 
when I had a little recovered my lirft furprife. i ccmfi- 
dercd that this was the ftation of life the infinitely wife 
and good providence of God had determined for me ;— 
that as I could not forefee what the ends of divine wifdom 
might be in all this, fo I was not to difpute- his fove- - 
reignty, who, as I wats his creature, had an undoubted 
right by creation to govern and difpofe of me abfolutely 
as he thought flt : and who, as I was a cr<^ture who had 
pffeAded him, had likewife a judicial right to condenin , 
me to what punifhment he thought fit ; and that it was 
my part to fabmit to bear his indignation, becaufe I had 
finned againiVhim. 

I then refle6ted, that God, who was not only right- 
eous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thvis to 
punilh and afHidt me, fo he was able to deliver me ; that 
if he did not think fit to do it, it was ray unquelUoned 
duty to refign myfelf abfolutely and entirely to his will. 
And, on the other hand, it was my duty alfo to hope in 
him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dilates and 
diiedions of his daily providence. 

Thefe thoughts took me)Up many hours, days, nay, I ' 
may fay, weeks and months ; and one particular efl^ft of 
^Y cogitations on this occalion I cannot omit, viz. one 
morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts 
about my danger fromthe appearance of favages, I found 
it difcompofed me very mucn ; upon which tbofe word?

Upon this^ rifing cheerfully out of my bed, my heart 
was not only comtbrt^d, but 1 was guided and encoii- 
ragecJ to pray earneftly to God for delivei-ancc. Wheo 
I had done praying, 1 took up my Bible, and opening: it 
to read, the fim v/ords that prefented to me were — IVatt 
on the Lord^ arid he of ^ood cheer ^ and he Jliall firengthtrt 
thy heart : kVait, Ifay, on the Lord. it is impcliible to 
cxprefs the comfort this gave me ; and, in return, I 
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more' fad, at 
katl not on that occasion. 

In the middle of theic cogitations, apprchenllons, and 
refle(5tions, it came into my thoughts one day, that all 
this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this 
foot might b the j)iint of my own foot, when 1 came on 
Ihore from my boat. Th,s cheered rne up a little too, 
a-nd I began to j)eriuadc myfclf it was uU a delution ;— 
that it was nothing elfe but my own foot; and why 
might 1 not come that way from the boat, as v\el; as I 
was going that way to the boat ? Again, I coniiv.:ered 
alio, that i tould bv no means tell for cciiain where I. 
had trod, and where I had not ; and that if at lail this 
was only the print of my own foot, 1 had played the part 
of thole fools who ftrive to make Itorics of fpecueft 
and apparitions, and then are thcmfelvcs frighted at 
thf m more than any body elfc. 

Now I began to take coui age, and to' peep abroad 
again ; for i had not furred out of my Calile for threer. 
days and nights, fo that 1 began to liarve for provifion ; 
for 1 had little or nothing withm doors, but fome barley- 
cakes and water. Then I knew that my goats waiupd 
to be milked too, wh:ch ufually was my evening diver-' 
lion ; and the poor creatures were in great pain and in- 
convenience for want of it ; and indeeil it almoll i'poiled- 
fome of them, ^nd almoit dried up their milk. 

Heartening mj'felf, therefore, with the belief that this ^ 

was nothing but the print of one of my own feet (and.^^'

lia^e thought I was haunted with ati evil confcicnce, or 
that I had been lately mod terrib-y frighted ; and fo in- 
deed I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, 
and having Icen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, 
and to think there was really nothing in it but my own 
imagination ; but I could not perfuade myl'elf fully of 
this, till 1 fhould go down to the (hore again, and fee: 
this print of a foot, and meafure it by my own, and fee 
if there was any fimilitude or titncfs, that I might be 
alTured it was my own foot. Rut when I came to the 
place firft, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid 
up my hoat, I could n:.t pollibly be on (hore any where 
thereabouts. Secondly, when I camQ to meafure the 
mark with my own foot, 1 found my foot not fo large by 
a great deal. Both thefe things fillrd my head with new 
imaginations, and gave me the vapouiv again to the 
highell degree ; fothat I (hook vvith cold, like one in an 
ftgue, and I went home again, filled with the belief, that- 
iomc man or men had been on (hore there ; or, in fhort, 
that the iiland was inhat)itv^d, and I might be' furprifed • 
hefore I was aware ; and what courfe to take for my fe-.

of anxiety greater by much than the evil which wc are 
anxious about ; but, which was worfe than all this, I 
had not that relief in this trouble for the reiignation I 
ufed to praftife, that I hoped to have. I looked, I 
thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the 
Sbiliftines were upon him, but that God had forfaken 
him ; for I did not now take due ways to compofe my 
mind, by crying to God in my didrefs, and reding upon 
Kis providence, as I had done before, for my defence and 
deliverance ; which, if I had done, 1 bad, at leaft, been ' 
more cheerfully fupported under this new furprife, and 
perhaps carried through it with itiore refolution. 

This confulion of my thoughts kept me waking all 
night ; but in the morning I fell afleep ; and having, by 
the amufement of my mind, been, as it were, tired, and 
my fpirits exhaufted, 1 (lept very foundly, and awaked 
much better compofed than I had ever been before. And 
now I began ^ think I'edately : and^ upon the utmoft 
debate with myfelf, I concluded, that this ifland, which 
was fo exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from 
the main land than as I had feen j was not fo entirely 
abandoned as I might imagine. 7'hat although there - 
were no dated inhabitants who lived on the fpot, yet that- 
there might fometimes come boats off from the fhore, 
who, cither with deiign, or perhaps never but when they 
were driven by crofs winds, might come to this place. 

That 1 had lived here fifteen years now, and had not- 
met with the lead diadovv or figures of any people be- 
fore ; and that, if at any time they (hould be driven here, 
it was probable they went away again as foon as ever 
they could, feeing they had never thought fit to fix there 
tipon any occafion, to this time. 

That the mod 1 could fugged any danger from, was 
from any fuch cafual accidental landing of draggling 
people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were 
driven hither, were here againd their wills ; fo they 
m&de no day here, but went off again with all poffibic 
fpeed, feldom ftaying one night on Siore, left they ihould 
not have the help of the tides and day-light back again ; 
and that therefore I had nothing to do but to confider of 
fome fafe retreat^ in cafe I ihould fee any favages land

Now I be^n forely to repent that I had dug my cave 
fo large, as to briilg a door through again, which door, 
»s I faid, came out beyond where my fortification joined 
to the rock. Upon maturely confidering this, therefore, 
Irdblved to draw me a fecond fortification, in the fame 
manner of a femicircle, at a diftance from my wall, jutt 
where I Had planted a double row of trevs about twelve 
years before, of which I made mention. Thefc trees 
having been planted fo thick before, there wanted but a 
few piles to be driven between them, that they (hould be 
thicker and flronger, and my wall would be foon finifhed. 
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer waH 
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and 
every thing I codld think of to make it ftrong ; having 
in it feven little holes, about as big as i might put my 
arm out at. In the inlide of this I thickened my wall to 
about ten feet thick, continually bringing earth out of 
my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walk- 
ing upon it ; and through the feven holes 1 contrived to 
plant the muikets, of which I took notice that I got 
leven on ihore out of the (hip ; thefe, I fay, I planted 
like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held 
them like a carriage, that fo 1 could fire all- the feven 
guns in two minutes time. This wall I was many a 
weary month in- finifliing, and yet never thought myfelf 
lafe till it was done. 

When this was done, I fluck all the ground without 
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with Hakes- 
or fticks of the oiier-like wood, which I found fo apt ta 
grow, as they could well {land ; infomuch that I believe 
I might fet in it near twenty thoufand of them, leaving a 
pretty large fpace between them and my wall, thati 
might have room to fee an enemy, and they might have 
no ihelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap* 
proach my outer wall. 

I'hus, in t^o years time, I had a thick grove ; and iHt 
five or lix years time I had a wood before my dwelling,, 
grown fo monitrous thick and ftrong, that it was in- 
deed perfeftly impalTable ; and no man, of what kind 
foever, would ever imagine that there was any thin^ 
beyond it, much lefs an habitation. As for the way I 
propofed myfelf to gd in and out (for I left no avenue )>

it was by fettirig two ladder? ; one to a part of tf-3

ladders were taken down, no man- living could cortr7< 
down to inc without mifchiefin^ himfdf : and if they 
had come down, they were flill on the outiide of n^y 
x)uter wall. 

Th\:s 1 tpok all the rheafures human prudence could 
fnggcd for my own prefervation ; and it will be fj?en at 
length, that they were not altogether without jull rea- 
fon ; though I forefaw nothing at that time more than 
iny mere fear fu[;geiicd. 

While this was doinsf, I was not altoo^ether carelefs of 
my other affairs ; for 1 had a great concern upon me for 
jny little herd (*f goats ; they were not only a prefent 
fupply to me upon every occafion, and began to be fuf- 
f^cient to me, without the cxpcnce of powder and (hot, 
but alio abated the fatigrne of mv'hunting a.ter the Wild 
ones ; and I was loath to lole the advantage of them, 
and to have them all to nurfe up over again. 

To this purpofe, after long confideration, I could 
think but of two ways to preferve them ; one was to find 
another convenient place to dig a cave under ground, 
and to drive them into it every night ; and the other 
was to inclofe two or three little bits of land, remote 
from one another, and as much concealed as I could, 
where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in 
each place , lb that, if any difafler happened to the flock 
in general, I might be able to raife them again with 
little trouble and time ; and this, though it would re-« 
cjuire a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the 
mod rational deGgn. 

Accordingly I fpent ibme time to find out the moft 
retired parts of the iiland, and I- pitched upon one, which 
was as private indeed as my heart could wifh ; for it was 
a little damp piece cf grouiid in the middle of the hol- 
low and thick woods, where it, is obferved, I almoil 
loit myfelf once before, endeavouring to come back 
that way from the eaftern pajt of the ifland. HeVe I 
found a clear piece of land of near three acres, fo lur- 
rounded with woods, that it was almoft an inclofure by 
nature; at leaA it did not want nearibmucli labpur to 

; ' itoake

Wake It fo as the other pieces of ground X had worked ib 
hard at. 

i immediately went to n*ork with this piece of ground, 
and in lefs than a month's time I had lb fenced it round^^, 
that ray flock or herd, call it which you pleafe, which 
^'ere not ib wild now as at firll they mifi;ht be luppoied 
to be, were well enough fecuied in it. So without any 
farthcT delay, 1 removed ten (he-goats and two he-goats 
to this piece ; and when there, I continued to perfed: 
the fence, till 1 had made it as feeureasthe other, which, 
however, I did at more leilbre, and it took me up morfe 
time by -a c^reat deal. 

All this labour I was at the expence of purely from 
my apprehenlions on the account of the print of a man*s 
foot, which 1 had feen ; for as yet, 1 never faw any hu- 
t\nn creaiure come near the iiland, and I bad now lived 
two years under thefe uneaiineires, which indeed made 
niy life much lefs comfortable than it was before ; as 
'may weli be imagined, by any who know what k 
is to live in the conllant fnare of the fear of man ; and 
this I muft obferve with grief, too, that the difcompofure 
of my mind had too great impreffions alfo upon the reli- 
gious part of my thoughts ; for the dread and terror of 
falling into the hands of favages and cannibals lay fo 
upon my fpirits, that I feldom found myfelf in a due 
temper for application to my Maker ; at lead, not with 
the fedate calmnefs and reiignation of foul which I was 
wont to do^ i rather prayed to God as under great af- 
fliclion and preflfure oY mind, furrounded with danger, 
and in expectation every pight oi being murdered ami de- 
voured before the morning ; and I muil telHfy, froln my 
experience, that a temper of peace, thftnkfulnefs, love, 
and aiTe<5tion, as much more the proper frame for prayer 
than that of terror and difcompofure; and that, under 
the dread of rcifchief impending, a man is no more fit 
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to 
God-, than he is tor repentance on ^lick bed ; for thefe 
difconppofures.affedl the mind as the dthers do the body ; 
and the diicompofure of the mind milft neceflarily be as

better fort of creatures than .cannibals to make mjfetf; 
known to. 

Yet I entertained fuch an abhorrence of the favagc 
wretches that I have been fpeaking of, and of the 
"wretched inhuman cuftotn of their devouring and eating 
one another up, that i continued peniive and fad, and 
kept clofe within my own circle for almoft two years 
after this ; ^hcn I fay my own circle, I mean by it my 
three plantations, viz. my Caille, my country- feat, 
which 1 called my bower, and my inclofure in the 
woods; nor did I look after this for any other nPe than 
as an inclofure for my goats ; for the averlion which 
nature gave me to thefe hellifli wretches was fuch, that 
.1 was as fearful of feeing them, as of feeing the devil 
himfelf; nor did I fo much as go to look after my boat 
in all this time, but began rather to think . of making 
me another; for I could not think of ever making any 
more attempts to bring the other boat round the ifland 
to me, left I (hould meet with fome of thofe creatures at 
fea, in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their 
hands, 1 knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the fatisfac^lion I had that I was 
in no danger of being difcovered by thefe people, began 
to wear off my uneaiinefs about, them ; and J began to 
live juft in the fame compofed manner as before ; only 
with this difference, that I ufed more caution, and kept 
my eyes more about rae than I did before, left I (hould 
happen to be feen by any of them ; and particularly, I 
was more cautious of firing my gun, left any of them 
on the iiQand Ihould happen to hear it ; and it was there- 
fore a very good providence to me, that I h^d furniihed 
myfelf with a tame breed of goats, that 1 had no need 
to hunt any more about the woods, or ihoot at them ; 
and if I did catch any more of them after this, it was 
by traps and fnafes, as I had done before; fo that for 
two years after this, I believe, 1 never fired my gun 
once off, thought I never went out without it; and, 
which was more^ as I had faved three piftols out of the 
fhip, 1 always carried them out with me, or at lead 
two of them, fticking them in my goat-ikin belt ; 1 like- 
wife burnifhed up one of the great cutlaffes that I had

when I went abroad, if you add to the former defcrip- 
tron cf myfelf, the particular of two piiloh^, and a great 
broad fword, hanging at my fide in a belt, but without 
a. fcabb'ard. 

Things going on thus, as I ha-ve faid, for fome time, 
I feemeJ, excepting thefe cautions, to be reduced to my 
former calm fedate way of living ; all thefe things tended 
to fhew me more and more how far my condition was 
from bting miferable, compared to fome others; nay, 
to many other particulars of life which it might have 
pleafed God to have made ray lot. It put me upon 
J^efting, how litt'e repining there would be among 
niankind, at any condition with thofe that are worfe in 
Older to be thankful, than be always comparing, them 
^ith thofe which are better, to affift their murmurings 
^^l complainings. 

As in my prefent condition there were not really 
^'•^ny things which f wanted, fo indeed I thought that 
the frights J had been in about thefe favage wretches, 
^d the concern i had been in for my own prefervation 
had taken off the edge of ray invenUon for my own con- 
'leniencies, and 1 had dropped a good defign, which I had 
o^ce bent my thoughts upon ; and that was, to try if I 
Could not make fome of ray barley into, malt, and then 
^'y to brew myfelf fome beet; this was really a whim- 
^<^al thouo-ht, and, 1 reproved myfelf often for the iim- 
pHcity of it; for I prefenily faw there would be the 
^ant of feveral things neceflary to»the making n^y.beer,' 
that it would be irapoflible for me to fupply ; as firft, 
c^^s to preierve it in, which was a thing that, as I have

where they made their fire,' and put in five or fix pounds 
of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, 
:Mrould confequently take fire, and blow up aVl that wai 
ii^ar it ; but, as in tfie firft place I fhould be very loatl 
to waile fo much pdWder upon them, my flore being 
flow within the quantity of a barrel; io neither could J 
be fure of its going off" at any certain time, when it migh' 
furprife them ; and, «it bell, that it would little mon 
than juft blow the fire about their ears, and fright thenii 
l)ut not fufHcient to make them forfake the place; fo J 
laid it afide, and then propofcd, that I would place my- 
ielf in ambufh, in forne convenient place, with my thre< 
guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their bloodj 
ceremony let fly at fhem, .when 1 ihould be fure to kil 
or wound perhjips two or three at every (hot ; ami ther 
falling in upon them with my three piftols, and mj

I fhould kill them all; this fancy pleafed my thoughtj 
for fome weeks, and I was fo full of it that I oftet 
dreamt of it; and^ fometiiSres, that I was jufi going tc 
let fly at them in myfleeii. ^ 

I went fo far with it in jny indignation, that I em- 
ployed myfelf feveral days to find out proper places tc

and 1 went frequently to the place itfelf^ whidx was

HOW ffrown more familiar to me ; and efpectallf while 
tny mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge, and 
of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the 
iword, as I may call it ; but the horror I had at the 
place, and at the (ighals of the barbarous wretches de- 
vouring one another, abated my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the fide of the hill, 
where I was fatisficd I might fecurely wait till J faw any 
of th^ boats coming, and might then, even before thej^ 
Would be ready to come on ihore, convey myfelf unfeen 
into thickets of trees, in one of which there was & 
hollow large enough to conceal me entirely ; and where 
I might fit, and obferve all their bloody doings, and 
take my full aim at their heads, when they were fo cloie 
together, as that it would be next to impoflible that I 
ihould mifs my (hot, or that 1 cotdd fail wounding three 
or four of them at the firft ^oU 

jn this place then I refolved to fiTC my dt^ga; an<t 
accordingly 1 prepared two mufkets, and my ordinary 
fowling-piece. The two mufkets I loaded with a brace 
of flugs each, and four or five fmaller bullets, about 
the.fize cff piftol bullets, and the fowling-piece I loaded 
with near a handfol of Iwan-fliot, of the largeft fize ;: 
I alfo loaded ray piftols with about four bullets each ; 
and in this pofture, well provided with ammunition for 
M fecond and third charge, I prepared myfelf for my 
expedition. 

After 1 had thus laid the fcbeme for ray defign, and 
in my imagination put it in pra6l:ice, I continually madQ* 
my toOT every morning Up to the top of the hill, wRicb 
was from my Cadle, as I called it, about three miles or 
more, to fee if I could obferve any boats upon the Ica^ 
coming near the ifiand, or Handing over towards it ; but 
I began to tire of this hard duty, alter I had fop two or 
three months conllantly kept, my watch ; but came al* 
ways back without any difcovery, there having not in all 
that time beenifhe leatk appearance, not only on. or near 
the fhore, but not on the whole ocean, fo far as my eyes 
or glafies cou^d reach every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour, to the hiU ta 
lookout, fa long alfo I kept up the vigour of my de- 
£gn, and my fpirits feemed to be all the while in a fuit-^

able frame, for (b outrageous an execution, as the kj^ 
ing twenty or thirty naked favages for an offence, whi <7J. 
1 had not at all entered into a difcirffion of in my thoughts^ 
any further than my palRons were at firlt iiied hy the 
horror I conceived at the unnatural cuftom of the 
- people of that country, who, it feems-, had been fufferetl 
by Providence, in his wife difpoiition of the world, to 
have no other guide than that of their own abominable 
and vitiated palHons ; uiid.confequently were left, and 
perhaps had been for fome a^es, to a(5l fuch hordcl 
things, and receive fuch dreadful cuiloms, as nothing' 
but nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and acftuated 
by fome hellifh degeneracy, could have run them into J 
but now, when, as I have faid, 1 began to be wea»^y of 
the fruitlefs excurlion which I had made fo lonsc, and 
fo far, every morning in vain ; fo my opinion of the 
a<5lion itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler 
and calmer thoughts to conlider what it was I was go- 
ing to engage in ; what authority or call I had, to pre- 
tend to be judge and executioner upon thefe men as 
criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for fo many 
ages to fuffer, unf.unilhed,'to goon, and to be, as it 
were, the executioners of his judgments upon one an- 
other; alfo how far thefe people were offenders againft 
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of 
that blood which they (hed promifcuoully one upon an^ 
other; 1 debated this very often with myfelf thus: how 
do I know, what God himfelf judges in this particular 
cafe ? It is certain thefe people do not commit this as a 
crime; it is not againft their own confciences reproving, 
or their light reproaching them. They do not know it 
to be an offence, and then commit it, in defiance of di- 
vine jullice, as, we do in almoll all the fins we commit. 
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken 
in war, than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat human 
flelh, than we do to eat mutton. 

When 1 had confidered this a little, it followed necefla- 
rily, that 1 wj>8 certainly in the wrong in it ; that thefe 
people were not murderers in the fenfe that 1 had be- 
fore^ condemned them in my thoughts, any more than 
thofe Chriilians were murderers, who often put to 
death the prifoncrs taken in battle, or more frequently,

upon many occaiions, put whole troops of men to the \ 
fword, without giving quarter, though tb^y threw 
down their arms and fubmitted. 

In the next place it occurred to me that albeit the 
ufage they gave one another was thus brutiOi and in- 
human, yet it was really nothing to me ; thefe people 
had done me no injury; that it* they attempted me, or 
1 i'aw it neceflary for my immediate prefervation to fall 
upon them, fomething might be faid for it; but that 
I was yet out of their power, and they had really no 
knowledge of me, and confequently no delign upon me; 
and therefore it could not be juil for me to fall upon 
them; that this would jutlify the condudl of the Spa- 
niards, la all their barbarities pradiifed in America, 
where they deflroyed millions of thefe people, who, 
however they were idolaters and barbarians, and liad 
feveral bloody and barbarous rites in their cuftoms, fuch 
98 facrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as 
to the Spaniards, very innocent people ; and that the 
rooting them out of the country is fpoken of with the 
utmoft abhorrence and deteftation even by the Spani- 
ards themfelvcs, at this time, an^ by all other Chriftian 
cations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and 
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjuilifiable either to God 
or man ; and fuch, as for which the very name of a 
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful smd terrible to all 
people of humanity, or of Chriltian compaflion; as if 
the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the 
product of a race of men, who were without prjjiciples 
of tendernefs, or the common bowels of pity i<^- the ' 
miferable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a geiieirous 
temper in the mind. 

Thefe conliderations really put me to a paufe, ^pd to 
a kind of a full llop ; and 1 began by little and little to 
be off of my defign, and to cgnclude I had taken wrong 
meafures in my refolutions to attack the favages ; that 
it was not my bulinefs to meddle with them, unlefs they 
lirll attacked me, and this it was my bufinefs, if ppflible, 
to prevent ; but that, if I were difcovered and at^^qked, 
then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myfelf, that this 
really was the way not to deliver myfelf, biit entirely 
to ruin and dcftroy myfelf; for unlefs 1 was furc to kill 

every 



160 ^tvttfTV^ta oir moinfisoni cmusoe.^ 

every one that not only ihould be on (horc at that time, 
but that ihould ever come on (hore afterwards. If but one 
of thcra cfcaped to tell their country- people what had 
happened, they wonid come over again by thoufanda to^ 
fevtnge the death of their fellows ; and I ihould only 
bring upon myfelf a certain deftrudlion, which at prcfent 
I had no manner of occafion for. 

Upon the whole I concluded, that neither in principles^ 
nor in pr^llcy, I ought one way or other to concern myfelf 
in this affair ; that my buiincfs was, by all poffible means 
to conceal myfelf from thera, and not to leave the leait 
fignal to them to guefs by, that there were any living 
creatnres upon the liland ; I mean of human ihapew 

Religio» joined in with this prudential,, and I was oon*» 
vinccd now many ways, that 1 was perfe£Uy out of my 
duty, when I was laying all my bloody fchemes for the 
dc(lru6iicn of innocent creatures; I mean innocent zs 
to me ; as to the chmes they were guilty of towards 
one another, J bad nothing to do with them ; they were 
national punifhrnents to malce'a juft retribution foi^ 
national offences ; and tJ bring public judgments upoii 
thofe who oif'end in a public niianner^ by fuch ways a» 
bed pleafe God. 

This apeared to me £o dear now, that nothing was A 
greater Catisfad^ton to me, than that I had not been fuf- 
rered to do a things which I now faw fo much reafon? 
to believe would have been no lefs a fin than, that ot 
wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave mo(i 
humble thanks on my knees to God that had thus de-^- 
livered me from blood-guiltinefs ; befeeching him to. 
grant me the proteftion of bis providence, that 1 might 
not' fall into the hands of bapbariabs ; or that I might- 
not lay my hands upon them, unlefs 1 had a more clear 
call fVom Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life. 

Id this diipoiition I continued for near a year after 
this ; and fo far, was I from defiring an occafion for fall« 
ing upon thefe wretches, that in all that time I nevef 
once went up the hill to fee whether there wer6 any of 
them in fight, or to know whether any of them had been 
on ihore therc^ or not; that I might not be tempted toi 
renew any of my contrivances againfl them, or be pro- 
voked by any advantage which might prelent itfelf,^ to;.

fall upon them; only this I did, I went and removed 
my boat, which I had on the other (ide of the ifland, and 
carried it down to the eail: end of the whole ifland, where 
I ran it into a little cove, which I found under fome high 
rocks, and where 1 knew, by rcafon of the currents, the 
favages durft not, at lead would not come with their 
boats, upon any account whatfoever. 

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had 
left there belonging to her, though not neceffary for. the 
bare going thither ; viz. a raafl and fail, which I had made 
for her, and a thing like an anchor, but indeed, which 
could not be called either anchor or grappling ; however, 
it was the bed 1 could make of its kind. All thefe 1 re- 
moved, that there might not be the leaft fliadow of any 
difcovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of aiiy 
habitation upon the i£and« 

Befides this, I kept myfelf, as I faid, more retired than 
ever; and feldomwent from my cell, other than upon 
my conflant employment, viz. to milk my ilie-goats, 
and manage my little flock in the wood ; which, as it 
was quite on the other part of fte ifland, was quite our 
of danger; for certain it is, that thefe favage people, 
who fometimes haunted this ifland, never came with any 
thoughts of finding any thing here^ and confequently 
iiever wandered off from the coafl ; and I doubt not, but 
they might have been feveral times on fhore, after my 
apprehenflons of them had made me cautious, as well 
as before ; and indeed, 1 looked back with ibme horror 
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have 
been, if I had chopped upon them, and been difcovered 
before that, when naked and unarmed, except with one 
gun, and that loaded often only with fmall fhot. I 
"walked every where, peeping and peering about the 
ifland, to fee what 1 could get ; what a furprife ihould 
I have been in, if, when! difcovered the print of a man*s 
• foot, I bad inllead of that feen fifteen or twenty lavage.^, 
and found them purfuing me, and, by the fwiftnefs of 
their running, no pofllbility of my efciip^ng them 1

contrived to burn fomc wo id here, as I had feen done in 
I'ngland under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal; 
and then putting the fire out, I preferved the coal to 
carry home, and perform the other ferviccs, which fire 
was wanting for at home, without danger of fmoke. 

But this by the bye; while I was cutting down fomc 
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick brancb 
of low brufh-wood, or underwood, there was a kind 
of hollow place; I was curious to look into it, and 
getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it 
was pretty large, that is to fay, fufBcient for me to 
Aand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but 
I mufl confcfs to you, 1 made more hade out than I did in; 
when looking further into the place, which was perfectly 
dark, I faw two broad ihining eyes of Ibme creature^ 
whether devil or man, I knew not, which twinkled like 
two itars, the dim light from the cave's mouth fhining 
diredlly in and making the reflexion. 

However, after fome paufe, 1 recovered myfelf, and 
began to call myfelf a thoufand fools, and tell myfelf^ 
that he that aivas afraid to fee the devil, was not fit to» 
live twenty years in an ifland all alone, and that I durft 
to believe there was nothing in this cave that was m<jffe 
frightful than myfelf; upon this plucking up my cou- 
rage, I took up a large firebrand, and in I ruihed again, 
with the (lick flaming in my hand ; I had not gont 
three fteps in, but I was almoft as much frightened as 
I was before ; for I heard a very loud figh, like that of 
a man in fome pain ; and it was 'followed by a brokeii 
noife, as if of words half exprefled, and then a deep 
ifigh again ; 1 llepped back, and was indeed ftruck with, 
fuph a furprife, that it put me into a cold fweat ; 
and if I had had a hat oajny head, I will not anfwer for 
it, that my hair might not have lifted it off. But ilill 
plucking up my fpirits as well as 1 could, and encou- 
raging myfelf a little, with donlidering that the power 
and prefence of God was every where, atid was able to 
protect me; upon this I ftepped forward again, and by 
the light of the firebrand, holding it up a litlc over 
my head, I faw lying on the ground a moil monftrbus 
frightful old he'goat» juft makiag his will, as we fay^ 
|;alping for life, and dyinj^inci^d of a mere old age.

I ftirred him a little, to lee if I could get him out, and 
beaflajed to, get up, but was not able to raife himfeif ; 
and I thought with myielf, be might e'en lie there ; for 
if he had frightened me lb, he would certainly fright any 
of the favages, if any of fhem fhould be fo hardy as to 
come in there, while he had any lite in him. 

I was now recovered from my furprife, and began to 
look round me, when I found the cave was but very 
fmall ; that is tO fay, it might be about twelve feet over, 
but in no manner of Ihape, either round or fquare, no 
bands having ever been em])loyed in making it but thofe 
of mere nature. I obferved alio, that there was a place 
at the farther fide of it that went in farther, but fo low, 
that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to 
get into it, and whither it went I knew not ; fo having 
no candle, 1 gave it over for Ibme time, but refolved to 
come again the next day, provided with candies and a 
tinder-box, which 1 had made of the lock of one of the 
muikets, with fome Wildfire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with fix 
large candles of my own making^, for I made very good 
candles 6aW of goat's tallow ; and, goings into this low 
pJace; I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have 
feid, almoit ten yards ; which, by the way, I thought 
vas a venture bold enough, confidering that 1 knew not 
how far it might go, or what was beyopd it. When I 
^asgot through the ftreight, I found the roof »ofe higher 
<Jp,r believe mar twenty feet; but never was fuch a 
glorious fight fcen in the ifland, I dare fay, as it was, to 
look round the fides and roof of this vault or cave. The 
Walls refledied an hundred thoufand lights to me from my; 
two candles. What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, 
or any othcrprecious (tones, or gold, which I rather fup- 
pofcd it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a moil delightful cavity, or 
grotto, of its kind, ^s could be expelled, though per- 
fcftly dark, 4 he floor was dry and level, and had a fort 
of fmall loofe gravel upon it ; fo that there was no nau- 
feous creature to be feen ; neither was there any damp 
f>f >vet on the fides of the roof. The o'nly difficulty in- 
H was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place 
^f fecurity, and fuch a retreat as I wanted, I thpughj'

that was a convenience ; fo that 1 was really rejoiced at 
the difcovery, ana relblved, without any delay, to bring 
fonne of thofe thinp;s, which I was moll anxious about, 
to this place ; particularly, I refolved to bring hither my 
magazine of powder, and all my fpare arms, viz. two 
fowling-pieces (for 1 had three in all) and three raufkets 
(for of them I had eight in all) ; fo I kept at my Caltle 
only five, which flood ready mounted, like pieces of 
cannon, on my outmoll fence ; and were ready alfo to 
take out upon an)'^ expedition. 

Upon this occafion of removing mv ammunition, I 
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which 1 took 
up put o^ the fea, and which had been wet ; and I found 
that the Water had penetrated about three or four inches 
into the powder on every iide, which, caking and grow- 
ing hard, had prefcrved the infide like a kernel in a (hell ; 
fo that I had near fixty pounds ot very goed powder in 
the centre of the caAc ; and this was an agreeable difco- 
very to me at that time ; fo I canicd all away thither, 
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder witb 
mc in my Caiile, for fear of a furprife of any kind. I- 
alfo car rieil thither all the lead 1 had left for bullets. , 

1 fancied myfelf now like one of the ancient giants, 
who were faid to live in caves and holes in the recks, 
where none could come at them ; for 1 perfuaded myfelf, 
while I was here, if live hundred lavages were to hunt 
me, ihey could never find me out ; or if they did, they 
"^ould not venture to attack me here. , 

The old goat, ivbich I found expiring, died in the 
mouth of the cavfe, the next day after 1 made this difco- 
very ; and 1 found it much eafier to dig a great hole 
there, and thruw hiinin, and cover hi^i with earth, than 
to drag him out ; fo 1 interred him there, to prevent of- 
fenfe to my nofe. . 

J was now in my tv/enty third year of refidence in this 
ifland, and was fo nuturalized to the place, and to the 
manner of livings that could I hare but enjoyed the cer- 
tainty that no favages would come to the place to difturb

. liad taught my Foil, as T noted before, to ipeak ; and he 
^ did it fo familiarly, and' talked fo articulately and plain, .. 
that it was very j>leaQint to me ; and he lived with me no 
lefs than llx and twenty years. How long he might live 
afterwards, I knew not ; though I know they have a no-

haps ibme iii my Polls may be alive there itill, calling 
after poor Kobin Crnlbe to this day. I wifh no Fnglifh-^ 
man the ill luck to come there and hear them ; but if he 
did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. My 
dog was a very pleafant^nd loving companion to me for 
nolels than Tixlecn years of my time, and then died of 
mere old a^e. As ibr my cats, the)^ multiplied, as I have, 
obferved, to that degree, that 1 was obligetl to (hoot feve- 
ral of them at fjrtr, to keep them from devouring me, and ; 
^n 1 had ; but at length, when the two old ones I 
brought with me were gone, and after fome^ time conti- 
nually drivmg them from me, and letting them have no 
proviiion with me, they all ran wild into the woods, ex- 
cept ttvo or three favourites, which 1 kept tame, and 
"whofe young, when thej^ had any, i always tlro.vned, and 
thefe were part of my family. Befides thefe, 1 always

which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Cru-,

is the moft dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very mcam 
or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raifed again from the afflidlion we are fallen into. I 
<»uld give many examples of this in the courfc ofmy 
unaccountable life ; but in nothing way it more particu- 
larly remarkable, than in the circumflances of my laft 
years of folitary refidcnce in this idand. 

It was now the month of December, as I faid above, 
in my twenty-third year; and this being th6 fouthem 
folflice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular 
time of my harveft, and required my being pretty much 
abroad in the fields ; when, going out pretty early in the 
morning, even before it was thorough day-light, I wai 
furprifed with feeing a light of fome fire upon the ihore, 
at a dillance from me ot about two miles, towards thi 
end of the illand, where I had obferved fome favagcs had 
been, as before, but not on the other fide ; but, to my 
great afHiAion, it was on my fide of the ifl and* 

I was indeM terribly furprifed at the fight, and (lopped 
ihort within my grove, not daring to go out, left 1 might 
be furprifed ; and yet I had no more peace within, from 
the apprehenlions 1 had, that if thefe favages, in ramb- 
ling over the ifland, fhould find my corn flanding, ot 
cut, or any ofmy works and improvqtnents, they would 
immediately conclude, that there were people in the 
place, and would then never give over till they found mc 
out. In this extremity 1 went back diredly to my Ca(llc> 
and pulled up the ladder ^fter me, having made all things 
without look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then 1 prepared myfelf within, .putting royfelfio* 

pofture of defence, I loaded all my cannon, as 1 called 

them, that is to fay, my mufkgts, which were mounted 

upon my new fortification, and all my piftols, and re* 

folved.to defend myfelf to the laft gafp ; not fdrgctting 

feriouily to recommend myfelf to the divine prote^iioflj 

and earnef^Iy to pray to God to deliver me out of th< 

hands of the barbarians ; and in this^pofiure I continued 

about two hours, but began to be mighty impatient fo>

gan to look for the place ; I prefently found there were 
no lefs than nin^ naked favagcs fitting round a fmall fire 
they had made ; pot to warm thfem, for they.had no need 
of that, the weather being ejctreme hot ; but, as I fup* 
pofed, to drefs fome of their barbarous diet of human 
flefe, which they had brought with them, w^hether alive 
or dead, I could not know. > 

They had two canoes with them, which they had haul- 
ed up upon the fhort; and as it was then tide of ebb, 
they feemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go' 
«»W2y again. It is not eafy to imagine what coufufiou 
this fight put me into, efpecially feeing them come on 
my fide the iflarul, and fo near me too; but when I 
obferved their coming muft be always with the current 
of the ebb, I b^gan afterwards to be more fedate in my 
niind, bein<j fatisfied that I might oro abroad with fafety 
^1 the time of tide of 'flood, if they were not on fhore 
before; and having tnade this obfervation I went abroad 
about my harveil work with the more compofure. , 

As I expeAed, fo it proved; for as foon as the tide 
made to the weft ward, I faw them all take; boat, and ro w 
(or paddle as we call it) all away; I fliould have ob-. 
ferved, that for an hour and more before they went ofl-', 
they went to -dancing, and 1 could eafily difcern th^ir 
poftures and geflures by my glafTes ; I could not perceive, 
hy myiii{5feft obfervation, but that they were Itark-naked, 
and had not the lealt co\rering upon them; but whether 
they were men or women, that 1 could not diftingujih. 

As foon as I faw them fhipped and gone, •! took two 
:^ns upon my flioulders, and two p'iflols at my girdle, 
and my great fword by my fide, without a fcabbard ; 
and with all the ipeed I was able to make, I went away to 
the hill, where I had difcovered the firll appearance of all. 
As foon as I got thither, which was not lei's than two hours 
'for I could not gd apace, being fo loaded with arms as

lavages on thcit place ; and looking out further, I faxr 
they were all at fea together, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadful fight to me, efj^ecially when going 
down to the fhore, I could fee the marks of horror, which 
the difmal work they had been about had left behind it, 
viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flefh of homr.n 
bodies, eaten and devoured by thofe wretches, w ith mer- 
riment and fpoit. I was fo filled with indignation at the 
light, that t began now to premeditate the deftruftion of the 
next that I faw there, let them be who or how many foever. 

It feemed evident to me, that the viiits which they 
tlfus made to this iil^nd, were not very frequent ; for it 
was above fifteen months before any more of them can>e 
on ihore there again ; that is to fay, I never faw them, or 
an^ footfteps or iignals of them, in all that time ; fo'r as 
to the rainy feafons, then they are furc not to come 
abroad, at leait not lb far ; yet all this while I lived un- 
comforti'bly, by reafon of the conllant appreheniions I 
was in of their coming upon nic by furprife ; from whence 
I oblerve that the expedlation of evil is more bitter than 
the fuffering, efpecially if there is no room to ihake off 
thatexpe(5lation or thofe apprehenfi on s. 

During all this time, I was in the murdering humour ; 
and took up mod of ,my hours, which Ihould have been 
better employed, in contrivmg how to circumvent and 
fall upon them the very next time I fhould fee them; 
eipecially if they ihould be divided, as they were the laft 
time, into two parties ; nor did I coniider at all, that if 
1 killed one party, fuppofe ten or a dozen, I was fiill the 
next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and (o 
another, eyen ^rf tfijmituin ^ tdl 1 (hould be at length no 
lefs a murderer than they were in being raen-eateis, an^ 
perhaps much more fo. ^ 

J f pent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety 

of mind, expedting that I ihould one day or other fall 

into the hands of thofe mercilefjf creatures; if J did a^ 

any time venture abroad, it was not without looking

t:arae, left I (hould alarm the favages; and if they had. 
fled from me now^ I was fure to have them come back 
a^ain, with perhaps two or three huncl',:ed canoes with 
them, in a few days, and then I knew what to cxpeiSt. 

However, I wore out a year and three months more 
before I ever faw. any more of the favages, and then I 
found them again, as I (hall foon obfexve. It is true, 
they might have been there once or twice, but either 
ttcymade no ftay, or, at leal V I did not hear them; 
but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, 
and in my four-and-twcntieth year^ I had every ftrangc 
encounter with them^ of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, 'during this fifteen or 
fijcteen months interval, was very great ; 1 flept unquiet, 
dreamed always frightful dreams, and often ftarted out 
of my fleep in the night; in the day great troubles 
©verwhelmed ray mind; in the night I dreamed pftca 
of killing the lavages, and the reafons why I mi<Tht 
jiiftify the doing of it ; but to wave all this for a while, 
it was in the middle of May, on the iixtecnth day, I • 
tbink, as well as my poor wooden calendar \;'ould rec- 
Ifon ; for 1 marked all upon the pod Hill ; 1 fay it was on 
the fixteenth of May, that it blew a great itorm of wind 
all day, with a great \3eal of lightning and thunder, and 
a very foul night was after it ; 1 know not what was the 
particular ^ccation of it; but as I was reading in tho 
Bible, and taken up with ferious thoughts about my 
prefent condition, I was furprifed with the noife of a 
gun, aB I thought, fired at lea. 

• This was to be lure a furprifc of a quite different nsf* 
ture from any I had met with before ; for the notions 
tnis put into my thoughts were quit€ of another kind ,' [ 
^Isrted up in the greateit halte iraiiginable ; and in a trice 
clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the roclT, 
and pulled it after me, and mounting ic the fecond time, 
got to the top of the hill ; that very moment a flalh of 
fire bade me hlten for a fecond gun, which accordingly 
in about half a moment I heard, and by the found knew 
that it was from that part of tjie iea wh:re I was driven 
out with the current in my boat. 

I immediately contidered, that this muil be fome (hip in 
<liftrefsj and that they had fome con.rade^ or fome other

ihip in company, and firecl thefe guns for iignals of dlf- 
tfels, and to obtain help ; I had this prefence of mind 
at that minute, as to think, that though I could not help 
them, it may be they might help me ; fo I brought to- 
gether all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making 
a good handfome pile, I fet it on fire upon the hill ; the " 
■wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though the wind 
blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, fo that I was certain 
if there was any fuch thing as a fhip, they mull need 
fee it, and no doubt they did; for as foon as ever my fire 
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that feveral 
others, all from the fame quarter. I plied my fire all . 
night long, till day broke ; and when it was broad day, 
and the air cleared up, I faw fomething at a great dif- 
tance at fea, full eail of the ifland, whether a fail, or a 
hull, I could not difiinguifh, no not with my glnfles, 
the diftance was fo great, and the weather ftili fome- 
thing hazy alfo ; at leait it was fo out at fea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and fobn per- 
ceived that it did not move; fo I prefently concluded 
that it w^s a (hip at anchor; and being eager, you may 
be fiire, to be fatisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and 
ran towards the fouth-ealt fide of the ifltind, to the rocks 
where I had been formerly carried away with the cur- 
rent; and .getting up there, the weather by this time • 
being perfedtly clear, I could plainly fee, to my great for- 
row, the wreck of a Ihlp caft away m the night upon thofc 
concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; 
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of tkc 
llream, and made a kind of co<5nter-ftream, or eddy, were 
the occaiion of my recovering then from the moil defperate 
hopelefs condition that ever 1 had been in all my lif*?. 

Thus, what is one man's faicty is another man's 
deftrudticn ; for it feems, thcfe men, whoever they 
wert:, being out of their "knowledge, and the rocks be- 
ing wholly under water, had been driven upon them in 
the night, the wind -'blowing hard ^t E. and E. N. E.

With my thoughts ; firil I ima^ned, that, upon feeing' 
my light, they might have put therafelves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the fliore ; but that 
the fea going very high, they might have been cad 
away ; other times I imagined', that they might have loll 
their boat before, as might be the cafe many ways ; as 
])articularly by the breaking of the fea upon their fliip, 
which many times obliges men to Have, or take in pieces 
their boat, and fometiraes to throw it over-board with 
their own hands; other times I imagined, they had 
fome other (hip or (hips in company^ wlio upon the fig- » 
nals of diftrefs they had, made, had taken them up, and 
carried them off; other whiles I fancied they were all 
gone off. to fea in their boat, and being hurried away b;j 
the current that I had been formerly in, were carried 
out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but 
iriifery and perifhing; and that perhaps they might by 
this time think of ftarvino:, and of bein^ in a conditioa 
to eat one another. 

As all thefe were but conje(5bures at beft, fo, in the 
condition I wa,s in, L could do no more: than look upon, 
the mifery of the poor men. and pity them ; which 'had 
ftill this good etfedt: on my fide, that it gave me more 
and more caufe to give thanks to God, who had {o hap- 
pily and comfortably provided for me in my viefointc 
condition; and that of two Ihips' companies who were 
now call away upon this part ol' the world, not one life 
fhould be fpared but mine. I learnt here again to ob- 
ferve, that it is very rare that the providence of God^ 
cads us into any condition of life fo low, or any mifery fo 
^gr#at,but we mayTee fo mething or other to be thankful fo.r, 
and may fee others in worfe circumftances than our own. 

Such certainly was the cafe of thefe men, of whom I 
could not fo much as fee room to fup^)ofe any of them were 
faved ; nothing could make it rational fo much as to wifli 
or expeil: that they did not all perifti there, except the 
pofiibility only of their being taken up by another (hip ia 
company ; and this was but mere pollibility indeed ; foe 
I faw not the leaft lignal or appearance of any fuch thing,

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture 
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might 
find fomething on board that might be ufeful to me ;— f 
but that did not altogether prefs me fo much, as the poffi- 
bility that there might be yet fome living creature on 
board, whofe life I might not only fave, but might, by 
faving that life, comfort my own to the lall degree.— 
And this thought clung fo to my heart, that I could not 
be quiet night nor day, but 1 muft venture out in my 
boat on board this wreck ; and committing the rellj|o 
God's providence, I thought the impreffion was fo ftroSg' 
upon my mind, that it could not be relifted, that it muil 
coine from fome inviiihlc diredlion, and that I fhould be 
wanting to myfelf if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impreffion, I hailened back 
to my caitle, prepared every thing for my voyage, toolc 
a quantity of bread, a great pot for frefh water, a com- 
pals to fteer by, a bottle of rum (for I had dill a great 
deal of thatl^t), a baiket full of raiiins. And thus load- 
ing myfelf with every thing neceflary, I went down to 
my boat, got the water out of her, and got her afloat, 
lOaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again 
fc.r more. My fecond cargo was a great bag full of rice, 
the umbrella to fet up over my head for a (hade, another 
large pot full of frefh water, and about two dozen of my 
fmall loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a 
bottle of goat's^ milk, and a cheefe ; all which, with great 
labour and fweat, I broug"ht to my boat ; and praying 
to God to direA my vo}'^ge, I put out, and rowing or 
paddling the canoe along the ihore, I came at latl to the 
utmoll point of the ifland, on that fide,. viz. N. E.-— 
And now 1 was to launch ou^ into the ocean, and either 
to venture, or not to venture, I looked on the rapid cur-» 
rents, which ran conttantly on both fides of the iflanfl, at 
a ditlance, and which . were very terrible to me, from 
the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, 
and my heart began to fail me ; for I forelaw, that if I 
was driven into either of tbofe currents, I fbould be ear- 
ned a valt way out to fea, and perhaps out of my reach, 
or light ot the ifland again ; and that then, as my boat 
was but fmall, if any little gale of wind Ihouid rife, 1 
ibouid be inevitably loH. :

Thefe thoughts fo oppreflcd my mind, that I liegan 
to give over my eatcrprize ; and having hauled my boat 
into a little creek on the ihore, I (lepped out, and fat me 
<5own upon a little I'pot of riiing gro'und, very penfive and 
anxious, between fear and defire, about my voyage;— 
•when, as I was mufing, 1 could perceive that the tide 
•wras turned, and the flood came on, upon which mv 
going was for fo ^nany hours impraAicablc. Upon this 
it prefently occurred to me, that I fliould go up. to the 
higheft piece of ground 1 could find, and obferve, if I 
could, how thefets of the tide or currents lay, when the 
ifiood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was 
driven one way out, I might not expedV to be driven 
another way home, with the fame rapidnefs of the cur- 
jTents. This thought was no fooner in my head, but I 
<aft my eye upon a little hill, whiich fufficiently over- 
looked the fea both ways, and from whence I h^d a clear 
*viewof the currents, or fets of the tide, and 'which way 
1 was to guide myfelf in my return. Here I found that 
«18 the current of the ebb fet out clofe by the fouth point 
of the ifland, fo the current of the flood fet in cloie by 
the fhore of the north-fide ; and that I had nothing to do 
"but to keep to the north of the ifland in my return, and 
1 fl)6uld do wdl enough* 

Encouraged with this obfervation, I refolved the utxt 
morning to fet out with the firft of the tide ; and re- 
pofing myfelf for th^t night in the canoe, under tlie^reat 
watch-coat 1 mentioned, 1 launched out : 1 made nrft a 
little out to fea full north, till I began to feel the benefit 
of the current, which fet eattward, and which carried me 
at a great rate, and yet did not fo hurry me as the 
foqtherli fide current had done before, and fo as to take 
trom me all government of the boat ; but having a 
^rong fteerage with my paddle, I went, I fay, at a great 
fate, dire<5l]y for the wreck, and in iefs than two hours i 
came up to it. 

It was a difmal fight to look at. The ihip, which, by 
itt building, was Spanifh, lluck faft, jambed in between 
two rocks: A 1:1 the ftem and quarter of her was beaten 
te pieces with the iea ; and as her forecallle, which 
iiruck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, 
liernoaiu-mail and fore-mall were brought by the. board,

that is to fay, broken (hort off; bi^t her bow-fprit was 
found, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I 
came clofe to her, a dog appeared upon her, which, fee- 
ing m? coming, yelped and cried ; and as foon as I called 
him, jumped into the fea to come to me ; and I took 
him into the boat, but found him almoft dead for hun- 
ger and thirft. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he 
cat like a ravenous wolf that had been ftarving a fort- 
night in the fnow. I then gave the poor creature fome 
frelh water, with which, if I would have let him, he 
"Would have burft himfelf. 

After this I wt*nt on board : the. firft fight I met with 

Was two men drowned in the cock-room, or forecaftle, 

of the, (hip, with their arms faft about one anothef. I 

concllided, as is indeed probable, that when the (hip 

firuck, it beinor in a ftorm, the fea broke fo high, and 

10 continually over her, that the men were not able to 

hear it, and were (Irangled with the conftant rufhins: in 

or the water, as much as if they had been under water.— 

Befides' the dog, there was nothing lej't in the fhip thjvt 

had life, nor any goods that I could fee, but what we^e 

spoiled by the water. There were fome caiks of liquor, 

whether wine or brandy I knew not, which Ijiy lower in 

^hc hold, and which, the water being, ebbed out, I 

could fee ; but they were too big to meddle with. I faw 

Several chefts, which I believed belonged to fome of the 

teamen, and I got two of them into the boat, without 

examining what was in them. 

Had the Hern of thefliip been fixed, and the fore part 
hroken ofF, 1 am perfuadcd 1 might have made a good 
Voyage j for by what I found in thefe two chefts, 1 had 
room<to fuppofb- the ihip had a great deal of wealth on

and fo perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great trea- 
sure in her, but of no ufe, at that time, to any body ; and 
Vrhat became of the reft of her people I then knew not.

liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my

in a cabin, and a ^reat powder-horn » wi^h about four 
pounds of powder in it. As for the mufkets, I had no 
pccaiion for them, fo I left them, but took the powder- 
iorn. I took a fire-lhovel and tongr., which 1 wanted 
extremely ; as alio two little brafs kettles, a copper pot_ 
to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this cargo, 
land the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make 
Lome again ; and the fame evening, about an -^hour 
•within night, I reached the iiland again, weary and fa- 
tigvied to thelail degree. 

I repofed that night in the boat, and in the morning I 
Tefolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, 
not to carry it home to my eaftle. After refrefhing my- 
self, I got all my cargo on ihore, and began to examine 
the particulars. The cafk of liquor I found to be a kind 
of rum, but not fuch as we had at the Brafils ; and, in a^ 
"word, not at all good ; but when I came to open the 
chefts, I found feveral things which I wanted. For ex- 
ample, I found in one a fine cafe of bottles, of an extra- 
ordinary kind, cfid filled with cordial waters, fine, and 
very good : the bottles held about three pints each, and 
were tipped with filver. I -found two pots of very good 
fuccades, or fweetmeats, fo faftcncd alfo on the top, that 
the fait water hatl not hurt^hem; and two more of the 
fame, whicli the water had fpoiicd. I found fo me very 
good ihirts, which wei'e very welcome to me, ^nd about 
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, and 
coloured neckcloths. The former were alfo very welcome j 
being exceeding refrefhing to wipe itiy face in a hot 
day. Befides this, when 1 came to the till in the chefts, 
1 found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which 
held about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in <xnc of 
them, wrappedup in a paper, fix doubloons of gold, and 
ft^me fmall bars, or wedges of gold. I fuppofe they 
might all weigh near a pound. 

The other chell I found bad fomeclothes in it, but of 
little value; but, by the circumftances^ it muft have be- 
longed to the gunner's mate, though there was no pow*

money, I had no manner of occaiion for it ; it was to me 
as the dirt under my feet ; and I would have given it 
all for three or four pair ot EngUlh Ihoes and (lockirigs^ 
■which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on 
my feet now for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two- 
pair of (hoes now, which I took off the feet of the two- 
drowned men, whom I faw in the wreck ; and I found 
two pair more in one of the chefts, which were very wel- 
come to me ; but they were not like our Engliih Ihoes^ 
cither for eafe orfervice, being rather what we call pumps 
than (ho€5. - I found in the Teaman's cheft about fifty 
pieces of eight in rials, but no gold. - 1 fuppofe this- 
belonged to a poorer man than the other, which feemed 
to belong to fome officer. 

Well, however, 1 lugged the money home to my cave^ 
and laid it up, as I had done that before, which I 
brought from our own fhip ; but it was great pity, as I 
faid, that the other part of the fhip had not come to my 
fhare, for i am fatistied I might have loaded my canoe 
feveral times over with money, which, if I had ever 
cfcaped to England, would have lain here fafe enough. 
till 1 mijiht have come again and fetched it. 

-Having now brought all my things on fhore, and fe-- 
cured them, i went back to my boat, and rowed or pad-- 
dled her along the fhore to her old harbour, where 1 laid 
her up, and made the bell of my way to my old habita- 
tion, where I found every thing fafe and quiet ; fo 1 be- 
gan to repofe myftlf, live after my old fafhion, and take 
care of rby family affairs: and for awhile 1 lived eafy 
enough ; only that 1 was more vigilant than I uled to 
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad fo much i. 
And if at any time 1 did llir with any freedom, it was 
always to the call part of the ifland, where I was pretty 
well ("atisfied the favages never came, and where J could 
go without fo many precautions, and fuch a load of arm^^ 
and ammuuitioh, a* iKilways carried with me, if X went, 
the other way. 

I lived in this condition near two years more ; but 
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it 
was'born to make my body miferable, was all chote two- 
years lilled with projedts and defigns, how, if it werer 
pofiible, I might g;ct away from this illand ; for fome-

times 1 was for making another voyage to* the wrec^, 
though my reafon told me, that there was nothing left 
there worth the hazard of my voyage : fometimes for a 
ramble one way, fometimes another : and I believe ve- 
rily, if I had had the boat that 1 went from Sallee^ in, I 
ihould have ventured to Tea, bound any where, I knew 
not whither. ' 

I have been, jn all my circumfiances, a memento to 
thofe who are touched with that general plague of man- 
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their mife- 
riesflow ; ] mean that of not being I'atisfied with the ita- 
tion wherein God and Nature hath placed them ; for, not 
to look back upon my primitive condition, and the ex- 
cellent advice of my father, the oppofition to which w^as, 
as I may call it, my^origmal iin,yray fubfequent mifiakes 
of the fame kind have been the means of my coming into 
this miferable condition ; for, had that Providence, 
which fo happijy had feated me at the Brazils as a plant- 
er, bklfed m^ with confined defires ; and could I have 
been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have 
"been by this time, I mean in the time of my bein^ on 
this iflc^nd, one of the moft comfortable planters in the 
Brazils : nuy, I am perfuaded, that, by the improvements 
I had made in the little time I lived there, anxl the in- 
creafe I fhould probably have made, if I had ftayed, I 
might have been worth an hundred thoufand moidores ; 
and what bufinefs had I to leave a fettled fortune, wcll- 
llocked plantation, improving and increafmg, to turn fu- 
percargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when patience and 
time would have fo increafed our ftock at home, that we 
could have bought them ^t our own doors, from thofe 
Avhofe bulinefs it was to fetch them. And though it had 
coll US fomething more, yet the difference of that price 
was by flo means worth faving at fo great a hazard. 

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, fo rc- 
fleftionr upon the folly of it is as or^iinarily the exeroife 
of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of time ; 
and fo it was wifh me now ; and yet fodeep had the mif- 
take taken root in my temper, that 1 pould not fatisfy

T>ring on the remainlno^ part of my (lory, it may not be 
improper to give feme account of my tirtl conceptions on 
the**fubje6t of this foolifh fcheme for ray efcape ; and 
how, and upon what foundation, I a(5led. 

I am now to be fuppofed to be retired into my caftle, 
after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up, 
and fecured under water as ufual, and my condition re- 
ilored to^ what it was before. 1 had more wealth indeed 
than I had before, but was not at ail the richer ; for I 
had no more ufe for it than the Indians of Peru had be- 
fore the Spaniards e:^me thither. 

'It was one of the nights, in the rainy feafonin March, 
ihe four-and-twcntisth year of my firft fetting foot in this 
illand of lolitariners, I was lying in my bed or ham- 
mock, awake, and very well in health, had no pain, no 
diUemper, no unealinels of body, no, nor any uneafmefs 
of mind more than ordinary, but could by no means 
clofe my eyes ; that is, fo as to lleep ; no, not a wink 
all night lons^, otherwife than as follovvs : — . 

It is as impoilible as needlefs, to fct down the innu- 
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that 
gr^at thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this 
night's time. I ran over the whole hiilory of my life 
in miniature, or by abridgement, a& 1 may call it, to my 
coming to this ifland ; and alfo of that part of my life 
lince 1 came to this illand ; in my reflections ui)oh the 
flate of my cafe, lince I came on (hore on this illand, 
J was comparing the happy pofture of affairs, in the 
firlt years 'of my habitation xhCre, to that courfe of 
anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in ever lince 
i had leen the print of a foot in the fand ; not that I did 
^lot believe the favages had frequented the ifland evei> 
all the while, and might have been feveral hundreds of 
them at times on Ihore there ; but as I had never known 
it, and was incapable of any apprehentions about it, 
my fatisfa6lion»was perfe6t,' though my danger was the 
fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my danger,, 
as if 1 had never really Keen expofed^to it ; this furniihed 
tny thoughts with many very profitable refiedtions, and 
particularly this one, how inlinitefy good that Provi- 
dence is, which has fettled in its government of mifm- 
kind fuch narrow bounds to his light and knowledge

of things ; and though he walks in the mldft of fo many 
thouland dangers, the fight of which, if difcoverCd to 
him, would diftradl his niind, and firik his fpirits, he is 
kept ferene and calm, by having the events of things hid 
from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which 
furround nim. 

After thefe thoughts had for fome time entertained me, 
I canie to refle6i ferioufly upon the real danger 1 had 
been in for fo many years in this very ifland ; and how I 
bad walked about in the greateft fecurity, and with all 
poffible tranquillity, even perhaps when nothing but a 
brow of a hill, a great tree, or the cafual approach of 
night, had beea between me and the worft kind of de- 
ftrudlion, viz. that of falling into the hands of cannibals 
and favages, who would have feiz.ed on me with the 
fame view as I did on a goat or a turtle, and have 
thought it no more crime to kill and devour me, than I 
did of a pigeon or a curlieu, i ihould unjuftly flander 
myfelf, if 1 ihould fay I was not fuicerely thankful to my 
great Preferver, to whofe (ingular proteftion 1 acknow- 
ledged, with great humility, that all thefe unknown de- 
liverances were due, and without which I ihould inevi- 
tably have fallen into their mercilels hands. 

When thefe thoughts were over, my head was foe 
fome time taken up in conliderlng the nature of thefe 
wretched creatures, 1 mean the favages : and how it 
came to pafs in the world, -that the Wife Governor of all 
things fhould give up any of his creatures to fuch inhu- 
manity, nay, to fomething fo much below even brutality 
itfelf, as to devour its owi\ kind ; but as this ended in 
fome .(at that time fruitlefe) fpeculations, it occurred to 
me to enquire what part of the world thefe wretches 
lived in ; how far off the coaft was from whence they 
came ; what they ventured fo far from home for ; what 
kind of boats they had ; and why 1 might not order my- 
felf and my bulineis fo, that 1 might be as able to go 
over thither as they were to come to me. 

I never fo inuch as troubled myfelf to coniider what 
I (hould do with myfelf when I came thither, what fhould 
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the favages, or 
how I fhould erca])e from them, if they attempted me;, 
no,, nor fo much as h^ow it was poliible for me to reach th«

coaftj and not be attacked by fomc or other of thetp, 

without any poffibility of delivering myfelf ; and if I 

lliould not fall into their hands, what I (hould do for pro- 

vifion, or whither 1 fhould bend my courfe; noneofthefe 

thoughts, I fay, fo much as came in my way ; but my 

mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my pafling 

over in my boat to the main land. I looked back upon 

my prelent condition as the moft miferable that could pof- 

fibly be ; that I was not able to throw myfelf into any 

thing but death that could be called worfe ; that if I 

xeached the (hore of the main, 1 might, perhaps, meet with 

relief^ or I might coail alon^, as I did on the (hore of 

-Africa, till I came to fome inliabited country, and where 

I might fin;l fome Chriftian (hip that might take me in ; 

and if the worft came to the worft, I could but die, which 

would put an end to all thefe miferies at once. Pray 

note, all this was the fruit of a diflurbed mind— an im* 

patient temper, made, as it were, defperate by the long 

continuance of my troubles, and the difappointraents 1 

bad met in the wreck I had been on board of, and where 

I had been fo near the obtaining of what 1 fo earneftly 

longed for, viz. fomebody to fpeak to, and to leara 

fome knowledge from, of the place where I was, and of 

the probable means of my deliverance. I fay, I was 

agitated wholly by thefe thoughts. All my calm of 

mind in ray relignation to Provideiice, and waiting the 

iffue of the difpofitions of Heaven, feemed to be iufpend- 

cd ; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts 

to any thing but the proje6t of a voyage tp the main, 

which came upon me with fuch force, and fuch an im- 

petuoiity of de(ire,that it was not to be reiifted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours 
or more, with fuch violence, that it fet my very blood 
into a ferment, and my pulfe beat as high as if I had 
been in a fever, merely* with the extraordinary fer- 
vour of my mind about it, Nature, as if 1 had beea 
fatigued and exhaufted'with the very thought of it, 
threw me into a found lleep. One would have thought 
I ihould have dreamed of it ; but I did not, nor of any 
thing relating to it ; but I dreamed, that as I was^oing 
QU.t in the morning, as ufu'al, from my caftle,- 1 iaw

upon the (hore two canoes, and eleven favages coming 
to land, and that they broucrht with them another favage, 
whom they were going to kill, in order to cat him ; when, 
on a fudden, the favage that they wete going to kill 
jumped away, and ran for his life ; then I thought in my 
ileep, that he came running info my little thick grove, 
before niy fortification, to hide himfelf ; and that I, fee- 
ing him alone, and not perceiving that the others fought 
him that way, fhewed myfelf to him, and fmiling upon 
'him, encouraged him : that he kneeled down to me, 
feeming to pray me.toaffift him ; upon which I ihewed 
my ladder, made him go up it, and carried him mto my 
cave, and he became my fervant ; and that a^ foon as I 
had gotten this man, I faid to myfelf, now 1 may certain- 
ly venture to the main land ; for this fellow will ferve me 
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither^ to go 
for provifions, and whither not to go for fear of being de- 
voured, what places to-venture into, and what to efcape. 
I waked with this thought, and was under fuch inex- 
preffibie imj^rellions of joy at the profpeft of my efcape 
in my dream, that the di {appointments which 1 felt upon 
coming to myfelf, and finding it was no more than a 
dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and 
threw rne into a very great dejection of fpirit. 

Upon this, however, 1 made this conclufion, that my 
only way to go about an attempt for an efcape, was, if 
poflible, to get a favage in my pofleffion ; and, ifpof- 
lible<it Ihould be one of their prifoners whom they had 
condemned to be eaten, and (hould bring hither to kill ; 
but thefe thoughts^ Hill were attended with this dif- 
liculty, that it was impoflible to effect this without at- 
tacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them all ; 
and this was not only a very defperate attempt, and 
might mifcarry ; but, on the other hand, I had greatly 
fcrupled the lav^^fulnefs of it to me, and my heart trem- 
bled at the thoughts of fhedding fo much blood, though 
it was for my deliverance. J need not repeat the argu- 
ments which occurred to me againit this, they b,eing the 
fame mei^tioned before. But ttiough 1 had other reafons 
to offer now, viz. that thofe men were enemies to iny 
life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was 
felf-prcfervatioajn the hig heft degree, to deliver myfelf 

from 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSOI^ CRUSOE, 185 

from this death of a life, and w^s acting in my own 
defence, as much as if they were aftually afTauUing me, 
and the like ; I fay, though thefe things argu.ed foj: it, 
yet the thoughts offhedding human blood for my deliver- 
ance wcre^ very terrible to me, and luch as 1 could by 
no means reconcile my felf to a great while. 
. However, at laft, after many fecret dilputes with my-** 
I felf, and lifter great perplexities about it (for all thefe ar- 
guments, one way and another, flruggled in my head a 
long time),, the eager prevailing defire of deliverance at 
length maftered all the reft, and I refolved, if poflible, to 
get one of thefe favages into my hands, coft what it 
would. My next thought then was to contrive how tp 
do it ; and this indeed was very difficult to refolve on : 
but as 1 could pitch upon no probable means for It, fo I 
refolved to put myfelf upon the watch, to fee them when 
they came on (hore, and leave the reft to the event, taking ' 
fuch nteafures as the opportunity ihould prefent, let it, be 
*what it would. 
- With thefe refolutions in my thoughts, 1 fet my felf 
upon the fcout as often as poflible, and indeed fo often, 
till I was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a year and 
a half that 1 waited, and for a great part of that, time 
went out to the weft end, and to the fputh-weft corner 
oftheifland, almoft every day to fee the canoes, but 
none appeared. This was very difcou raging, and be- 
gan to trouble me much; though I can't fay that it 
cjid in this cafe as it had done forae time before that, viz. 
wear off the edge of my 'defire to the thmg ; but the 
longer it feemed to be delayed, the more eager i was for 
it.— In a word,! was not at firft more qareful to ihun 
the light of thefe favages, and avoid being feen by them, 
than 1 was now eager to be upon them. 

Befides, I fancied mylelf able to manage one, nay, two 
or three favages, if I had them, fo as to make them en- 
tirely flavesto me, to do whatever I ihould diredl them, 
and to prevent their being able, at ^ny time, to do me 
any hurt. It. was a great while that 1 pleafed myfelf 
with this affair, but nothing ftill prefented^ all my fan- 
cies and fchemes came to nothihoj, for no favages came 
near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I had entertained thefe 
notions,' and, by long inufing, ha-d, as it were, refolved

them all into nothing, for want of an occafion to put 
them in execution, I was furpri fed one morning early, 
with feeing no lefs than five canoes all on (hore together, 
on my fide the ifland, and the people who belonged to 
them all landed, and out of my fight. The number of 
them broke all my meafures ; for feeing fo many, and 
knowing that they always came four, or fix, or fome- 
times more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of 
it, or how to take my meafures to attack twenty or thirty 
men fingle-handed ; "fo 1 lay ftill in my caftle, perplexed 
and dii'comforted : however^ I put myfelf into all the 
fame poftutes for an attack that 1 had formerly provided, 
and was juft ready for aiftion, if any thing had prefented. 
having waited a- good while, liftehing to hear if they 
made any noife ; at length, being very impatient, I fet my 
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to ,the 
top of the hill by my two ftages, as ufual ; flanding fo, 
however, that my head did not appear above the hill ; 
fo that they could not perceive me by any means. Here 
I obferved, by the help of my perfpeclive-glafs, thaf they 
were no lefs than thirty in number ; that they had a fire 
kindled, and that they had meat dreffed. How they 
cooked it, that 1 knew not, or what it was; but they 
were all dancing in I knew not how many barbarous 
geftures and figures, their own way, round the fire. 

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my 
perfpe(5live, two miferable wretches dragged from the 
bf>ats, where, it feems, they were laid by, and were now 
brought out for the flaughttr. I peiceived one 'of them 
immediately fall, being knocked down, I fuppofe, with 
a club or wooden fword, for that was their way: and 
two or three others weVe at work immediately, cutting 
him open for their cookery, while the other vidlim was 
left llanding by himfelf, till they (hpuld be ready for him. 
In' that very moment" this poor wretch, feeing himfelf a 
little at libe ty, nature infpired him with hopes of life, 
and he fl:arted away from them, and ran with incredible 
fwiffnefjyal. ng the fands, dire tly towards me, I mean to- 
wards that part of the coail where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frigiited (that i mufi acknowledge) 
when I perceived \\un to run my way ; and efjjecially 
when, as I thought, I faw him purfued by the whole

^ody-; and now I expe(3:ed that part of my dream was 
coming to pals, and that he certainly would take flicker 
in my grove; but 1 could not def>end, by any means, 
upon my dream for the rell of it, viz. that the other ia- 
vages would not purfue him thither, and find him there. 
However, 1 kept my llation, and my fpirits began to re- 
cover, when 1 found that there were not above three 
men that followed him ; and flill more was I encou- 
raged^ when I found that he outftripped them exceedingly 
in running, and gained ground of them ; fo that, if hie - 
could but hold it for half an hour, I faw eafily he would 
faiHy get away from them all. 

I'here was between them and my caflle the creek, - 
which I mentioned often at the firfi part of my flory, 
where I landed my cargoes out of the fhip ; and this I 
knew he raufl necefTarily fwim over, or the poor wretch 
would be taken there. But when the favage efcapin^ 
came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide wa» 
then up ; but plunging in, fwam through in about thirty 
flrokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceed- 
ing firength and fwiftneis. When the three purfuer* 
came to the creek, I found that two of them could fwim,. 
tut the third could not,- and that he, flanding on the 
other fide, looked at the others, but went no farther ; and 
foon after went foftly back again, which, as it happened, 
-was very well for him in the main. 

I obferved that the two who fwam were yet more- 
than twice as lon^f fwimming: over thft creek than the 
fellow was that fled from them. It came now very 
•warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irrelilHbly, that 
iio\y was my time to get me a fervant, and perhaps a 
companion or alliflant, and that 1 was called plainly 
by Providence to lave this poor creature's life. 1 im- 
mediately got down the ladders with all poflible expc* 
dition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the 
foot of the ladder, , as 1 obferved above ; and getting 
up agam with the fame halle to the top of the hill, 
I crofTed towards the lea ; and, having a very ihort cut, 
and all down hill, clapped my felt in the way between 
the ptirfuers and the purfued, hallooing aloud to hinx 
that fled, who, looking back, was at lirft perhaps ^s 
much frighted at me as at them ; but I beckoned with

buried them both in a quarter of an hour ; then calling* 
him awajs 1 carried him not to my caule, but quite away'' • 
to my cave, on the farther part ol the ifland ; fo I did ti(^^,f 
let my .dream come to pafsin that part, viz. that hecaime^ 
into my grove for (lielter. ' jf,^ 

Here i <;ave him bread, and a bunch of rair!ns to ea^^' 
aTJd a draught of water, v/hich I found he was indeed m' 
great dirtrel's for, by his running ; and having refrcfiieft.iv 
him, I made fi<^ns for him to go lie down and ilee^v 
pointing td a place where I had laid a great parcel of i'icc^. 
ftraw, and a blanket upon" it, which 1 ufed to ficep upon *- 
myfelf fometirnes ; fo the poor creature lay down, and - 
went to lleep. 

He was a comely, handfome fellow, perfe(flly well made, . 
with flraigbt long limbs, not too large, tall, and well- K 
fhaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-fix years of age. 4> 
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and furly;f 
afpe<ft, but I'cefned to have fometbirig very manly in hia J ' 
face, and yet he had all the Iweetnefs and foftnels of aft?*"^'. 
Kuropeon in his countenance, too, efpecially when IvSj^ 
fmiled. His hair was long and black, not curled lik$ i' 
wool; his forehead very high and large, and a great . . 
vivacity and fparkling Iharpnefs in his eyes. The colour ;|| 
of his fkin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet. j^l 
not of an ngly, yellow, naufeous tawny, as the Bralilians || 
ai^d Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of i 
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it ibme- 
thing very agreeable, though not very eafy to defcribe.-*- 
His face was round and plump, his nofe fm all, not fl«t' 
like the negroes, a very good mouth, thm lips, and his |v 
teeth fine, well-fct, and white as ivory. After he had 
ilumbered, rather than flept, about half an hour, he wak-^

ferve me as long as be lived. I underftood him in many 
tiings, and let him know I was very well pleafed with 
him. In a little time 1 Degan to fpeak to him, and teach 
him to fpeak to me ; and firft, I made him know his nan* e 
^)uld be Friday, which was the day I faved his 'life ; 
aifd I called him for the memory of the time. I likewife 
taught him to fay mafter, and then let him know that 
wjis to be my name. I likewife ta.ught him to {'ay yes 
and no, and to know the' meaning of them. I gave hirn 
fome milk in an earthen \)ot, and let him fee me drink it 
before him, and fop my bread in it. J gave him ;. cake 
of bread to. do thelike, which he quickly complied with, 
and- made (igns that it was very good for him, 

I kept there with him all that night ; but as (ben as it 
was day, 1 beckoned him to come en with n^.e, and let 
him know 1 would give him fome clothes, at which he 
feemed very gliid, for he was itark-naked. As we went 
by the place where we [vdd bu^ried the two men, he point- 
ed exadtly to the fpot, and Ihewed me the marks that he 
had made to fmd them again, making (i^ns to me that 
"we (hould<lig them up again, and eat them. At this 1 
appeared very angry, expreifed my abhorrence of it, made 
as if L would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned 
. with my hand to him to come away, which he did im- 
mediately, with great fubmiffion. 1 then led him up to 
^hetop of the hill, to fee if his enemies were gone, and: 
pulling out my glafs, I looked, and faw ])lainly the place 
^^here they had been, but no appearauce of them, or of 
^"cir canoes ; fo that it wa^ plain that they were gone, 
^'I'i had left their comrades behind them, without any 
^^ai'ch after them.

^.^ook my man, Friday, with me, giving him the fword in

^'^^ gun for me, and I two for myfelf, and away we

at lead it was fo to me, though Friday made nothing of 
it. The place was covered with human bones, the ground 
died with the blood, great pieces of fleih left here and 
there, ha'/ eaten, mangled, and fcqrched : and in fhort, 
all the tokens of the triumphant feaft they had hi^\ 
making there, after a vidlory over their enemies. I law 
three fkulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four 
legs and fcet^ and abundance of other parts of the bodies; 
and Friday, by his (igns, made me underftand that they 
brought over four prifoners to feaft upon ; that three of 
them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himfelf, 
was the foufth ; that there had been a great battle be- 
tween them and their next King, whofe fubjeds, it 
feems, he had been one of; and that they had taken a 
great number of prifoners,^ all which were carried to 
feveral places by thofe that had taken them in the fight, 
in order to feaft upon them, as was done Jaere by thefe 
wretches upon thofe they brought hither. 

I caufed l^fiday to gather all the fkulls, bones, fleft, 
nnd whatever remained, and lay them together pn a 
heap, and make a great fire upon it^ and burn them all 
to afhes. 1 found Friday had ftill a hankering fiomach 
after Ibme of the fiefti, and was ftill a cannibal in his na- 
ture; but I difcovered fo much abhorrence at the very 
thoughts of it, and at the leall appearance of it, that he 
durft not difcover it ; for I had, by feme means, let him 
know, that I would kill him if he offered it. 

When we had done this, we came back to our^caflle, 
and there I fell to .work for my man Friday ; and firflof all, 
1 gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the 
poor gunner's cheft I mentioned, and which I found in 
the wreck, and which, with a little alteratjori, fitted him 
\erv well ; then I made him a jerkin of goat's (kin, as well 
as my (kill would allow, and I was now grown a tolera- 
ble good tailor ; and I gave him a cap, which I had 
made of a hare-fkin, very convenient, and fafhionable 
enough ; and thus he was dreffed, for the prefent, tolera- 
bly well, and mighty well was he pleafed to fee himfelf 
almofl as well clothed as his mafter. It is true he went 
awkwardly ^n thefe things at firft ; wearing the drawers 
was very awkward to him, and the fleevcs of the waiftcoat 
galled his ihoulders, and the infideof his arms; but a little

The next <iay after I came home to ' my hiitch with 
bijtn, I began to confider where J (hou Id lodge hrrti; and ' 
that I might do well for him, and yfct be perfeftly cafy 
Tnyfelf. I made a Nttle tent for him in the vacant place 
between my two fortifications, in the Intide of the l^ll, 
and in the outfide of the firft. And as there was a door 
or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed 
door-cafe, aiid a door to it of boards, and fet it up in 
the pafTage, a little within the entrance ; and causing the 
door to open on the infide, I barred it up in the nrght, 
taking in my ladders too ; fo that Friday could no way 
come at me in the infide of my innermolt wall, without 
making fo niuch noife iti getting over, that it mnll needs 
^Mvaken me^ for nfiy firft wall had now a complete roof 
over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning 
up to the fide of the hill, which was again laid crofs witn 
f mall flicks in Head of laths, and then thatched over a 
great thicknefs with the rice flraw, whicli was ftrohg 
like reeds ; and at the hole or ])!ace which was left to 
go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap 
door, which, if it had been attempted on the otutiidc, 
would not have opened at all, bat would have fallen 
down, and made a great noife ; and as to weapons, I 
took them all in to my (idc every night. 

But i needed none of all this precaution ;♦ fornevet 
man had a -more faithful, loving, fince re fcrvant,' than 
Friday was tome; without pafiions> fullerihels^ 6r dei* 
iigns; perfectly obliging and engaging ; his Wfy^fFec- 
tioiis Were tied to me, like thofe of a child to arfMliiir';*^-^ 
and, I- dare fay, he would have facrificed hiiLllTr-rdrth^

teftimonles he gave me of this put it out of doubt ; and 
loon convinced- me, that I needed to life to 'precautions 
as to thy fafety on his account. '- " ' • 

This frequently gave me occaiion to obffefve, and that 
with wonder, that, 'however it had pleafed God in his 
providence, and in the government of the works of his 
hands, to take froni fo great a part of the world of his

very pleafant to me to talk to him; and now my life 
began to be fo eafy, that I began to fay. to myfelf, that . 
could J but have been fafe from more favages, J cared not 
if I was never to remove from the place while I lived. • - 
After I had been two or three days returned to my caf- 
tle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from his 
horrid way of feeding, and from the reliih of a cannibal^s 
ftomach, I ought to lethin\tafte other flefli; fo I took 
him out with me one morning to the woods ; I went in- • 
deed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and» 
bring it home and drefs it ; but as I was going, I favv a 
(he-goat lying down in the (liade, and two young kids 
fitting byiier; I catched hold 'of Friday, hold, laid I, 
iland ftill ; and madefigns to him not to ftir ; immediately 
I prefented my piece, fliot and killed One of the kids. The 
poor creature, who had at a diftance, indeed, feen me kill 
the favage his enemy, but did not know, norcould ima«-.. 
gtne, how it was .done, was feniiblyfurprifed, trembled; 
and fliook, and looked lb amazed, that I thought he . 
would have funk down : he did not fee the kid 1 had ^ 
fbot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waill- 
coat to feel if he was not wounded ^ and, as I found, i>rc- 
fcntly thought I was refolved to kill him ; for he came and 
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, faid a 
great many things I did not underftand, but 1 could ealily - 
fee, that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him. 

I foon found a way to convince him, that 1 would do : 
him no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed., 
at him, and, pointing to the kid which I had killed, 
beckoned to him to run and fetcl^it, which he did ; and . 
while he was wondering and looking to fee how the 
creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by-arid- . 
bye I fawa great fowl, like a hawk, fit upon a tree with-* . 
in ihot ; fo, to let Friday understand a little what I would 
flo, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl,-which 
was indeed a parrot, though 1 thought it had been a* 
liawk ; I fay, pointing to tlie jiarrot and to my gun, and 
to'the ground under the parrot, to let him lee 1 would, 
make him fall, 1 made him underftand that I would ftiopt 
and kill that bird ; accordingly 1 fired, and bid him look, 
and imracdiatciy he faw the parrot fall : he ilood like ,

one frighted again, notwithilanding all thatlhadfaid 
to him ; and I found he was the more amazed, becaufe 
he did not fee me put any thing into the gun ; but thought 
there mull be fonie wonderful fund of death and dellruc- 
tion in that thing, able to kill man, beaft, bird, or any 
thing near or far off; for the adonifhment thb created in 
him, was fuch as Could not wear off for a long time; 
and I beliere, if I would have let him, he would have 
"worihipped me a^d my gun ; as for the gun itfelf, he 
would not fo much as touch it for fcveral days after ; but 
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had anfwercd 
him, when he was by himfelf ; which^ as I afterwards 
learned of him, was to deiire it not to kill him. 

Well : after his alloniihment was a little ov/sr at this, 

I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird J had (hot 

which he did, but fiajd fome time ; for the parrot, not 

being quite dead, was fluttered a good way off from the 

pkce where fhe fell ; however he found her, took her up, 

and brought her to me ; and, as I had .perceived his ig<- 

norance about the gun before, 1 took this advantage to 

charge the gun again, and not let him fee me do it, that 

I might be ready for any other mark that might prefent; 

but nothing more offered at that time ; fo I brought home 

the kid; and thefame evening 1 took the fkin off, and 

cut it cut as well as I co\ild, and having a pot. for that 

purpose, I boiled or ftewed fome of the flefli, and made 

fome. very good broth ; after I had begun to eat fome, I 

gave fome to my man, who feemed very glad of it, and 

liked it vcfy well ; but that which was Arangcft to hini, 

was to fee me eat fait with it. He made a fign to me, 

that^h^ fait was not goo^ to eat, and putting a little into 

hi^ own mouth, he feemed to naufeate it, and would fpit 

and fputter at it,vwaiiiing"his mouth with frefh water 

after it ; on the other hand, I took fome meat in my 

mouth without fah, and I pretended to fpit and fputter 

for want of fait, as fail as, he had done at the fait ; but 

3t would not do, he would never care for fait with meat^ 

or in. his l^roth ; at leail not for a great while, and then 

hut^a^rery little; 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I

I lis I, efpecia^Iy after he had feen what the meaning 
t was^ and that it was to make bread of ; for after 
I let nim fee me make my bread, and bake it too ; 
in a little time Friday was able to do all the work 
me, as well as I could do it myfelf.

as for corn to make more bread, becaufe he was now

ever to love any thing before. \hw( 

I had a mind once to try if Tie had any hankering incVi- §^y0 
nation to his own country again ; aBd having learned him 
Knglifh fo well, that he could anfwer me almoft any quef- 
tion; I afked him, whether the nation that he belonged 
to never conquered in battle. At which he fmiled, and 
faid, yes, yes, we al\^ays fight the better; that is, he 
meant, always g^ the better in fight, and fo we began 
the following difcourfe. You always fight the better, 
faid I; how came you to be taken prifoner then, Friday? 

Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 

Matter. How beat^ if your nation beat theth, how 
came you to be taken ? / 

Friday. They more than my nation in the place where 
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation 
over- beat them in yonder place, where me no was; 
there my nation take one, two, great thoufand. 

Alafter. But why did not your fide recover you from 
the hands of your enemies then ? , 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and' me, and make 
go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Mafter. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do 
with the men they take ? Do they carry thefii away, and 
cat them as thefe did? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mens too, eat all up. 

Mafter. Where do they carry thf^m? 

Friday* Go to othei* place where they think. 

Mafter. Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other place. 

Matter. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. Yes, 1 been here [Points to the N. W. fide 
of the ifland, which, it feems, was their fide]. 
'. By this I underflood, that my Knan"Friday had formerly 
been among the lavages, who ufed to come on fhore,on the 
' farther part of the ifiand, on the faid men-eating occafions 
that he was brought for; and fomc time after, when 
1 took the courage to carry him to that fide, being the 
fame I formerly mentioned, h(i perfectly knew the place, 
and told me be was there once when they eat up twenty 
men, two women, and one child. He could not telltwenty 
in Enghih, but he numbered them by laying. fo nfuiny 
ilones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this paflage, becaufe it introduces what fol- 
lows rthat after I had had this difcourfe with him, I afked 
him how far it was from our iflnnd to the ih ore, and 
whether die canoes were not often loft. He told me there 
Was no danger, no canoes ever loft; but that after a little 
way out to lea, there was a current, and a wind always 
one way in the morning the other in the afternoon. 
' This I underftood to be no more than the fets of the 
Tide as going out or coming in;' but I afterwards un- 
derftood it was occaiioned by the great draught and re- 
flux of the mighty river OroonoqUe ; in the mouth of 
which river, as I thought afterwards, our iftand lay; 
and that this land, which I perceived to the W. and 
N. W. was the great ifland Irinidad, oii the north 
point of the mouth of the river: I aflced Friday a thou- 
fand queftions about the country, the inhabitants, the 
fea, the coaft, and what nations were near; -he told rne 
all he knew, with the greateft opennefs imaginable ; 
I afked him the names of the fe^'cral nations of his fort 
of people, but could get no other name than Caribs; 
from whence I eaiily underftoo^T, ■ that thefe were the 
Caribees, which our maps placfe' on that part of Ame- 
rica which reaches from the mouth'of the river Oroono- 
que to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha; he told me 
that up a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond 
the fetting of the moon, which muft be VV. from thtit 
country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and 
pointed to my great whi(kers, which 1 'mentkitied before; 
and that they had killed much mans, fhat was his word; 
by which I underftood he meant th« Spaniards, whofe 
cruelties in America had been fpreatl'^jv^r the whol^ 
countries, and were remembered by -all^ the nations froni 
father to fo», ' ' 

I enquired if he could tell me how I nniight come front 
this idand, and get among thofe white-men; he told mei 
Yes, yes, i might go in two canoe;'^I tould not under- 
fland what he meant by two cahote; till at laft, with 
great difficulty, I found he meant^" that R muft be' in a 
large great boat ns big as two canoes. ""• ' 

This part of Friday's difcourfe *began to Telifti witH

luaitj to make myercape from this place, and that t\us 
poor favagc migl^t be 'a means to help me to do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been wtb 
me, and ;that l^e began to fpeak to me and underftand 
me, I lyas not wanting to lay a foundation of religious 
knowledge in 'his mind, particularly,! aiked him one 
tinif, who made him? The poor <jfeature did not un^ 
ijerftapd me at all, but thox^ght I bad a^ed who was his 
father; bi^tJ took, it by anotb^r b^dle, ^nd afked hirl^ 
iif}io4Tia4e the fea, the .groufifl l^c w;ilk©d on, apd the 
•bflls ^d woods? He tp)d:me,.it wasoneoldBenat^uckee 
thik lived beyond, all: lie could defcri be nothing of this 
great perfon, but that be was very old ; much older, he 
faidy thap the fea, or the land, than the moon or the 
flars : I alked him then, if this old perCon had made all 
things, why djd not all rthings worihip him? He looked 
very grave, and with a perfedl look of innocence faid, 
all things faid O to him : 1 afked him, if the people who 
died in his country, went away anywhere: he faid, yes, 
they all went to Benarauckee : then I afked him, whether 
thofc they eat up went tliither too? He faid, yes. 

From thefe things J began to inftru<^ him in the l^no^-^ 
jedge of the true God. 1 tgld him, that ^t^ great maker 
of all things lived there, pointing up towards heaven : 
that he governs the world by the f^nie rjyow.^f and prp-

and then c^mc back, and told them what Benamuckee 
faid : by this I obferved, that there is prieftcraft even 
amongft the moft blinded ignorant Pagans in the world ; 
-and the policy of making a fecret religion, in order to 
preferve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not 
only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps amongiall. re- 
ligions in the world, even among the moil brutifh and 
barbarous favnges, 

I endeavoured to clear v^p this fraiid to my man Friday] 
and told him, that the pretence of their old men going up 
to the niountains to fay O to their god Benamuckee* was 
a cheat ; and their bringing word from thence what he 
faid, was much more fo ; that if they met with any an- 
fwer, or fpoke with any one there, it muft be with an 
evil fpirit : and then I entered into a long difcourie with 
him about the devil, the onginal of him, his rebellion 
againft God, his enmity to man, 'the reaibn of it, his fet« 
ting liimfelf up in the dark parts of the world to be 
worftipped inilead of God, and as God, and the many 
Aratagems ht made ufe of to delude mankind to their 
ruin ; how he^ had a fecret accefs to onr paiHons, and to 
our afFe^ions, to adapt his fnares fo to our inclinations, 
as to caufe us even to be our own tenipters, and to run 
upon our own deftrudlion by our own choice. 

I found it was not fo eafy to imprint right notions in 

his mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a 

God i nature affiled all my arguments to evidence to 

. him even the neceffity of a great firft caufe, and ovcr- 

rulihg governing power, a lecret dire<^ng Providence, 

and of the equity and iudice of paying homage to him 

that made us, and the like ; but there appeared nothing 

of all this in the notion of an evil fpirit, of his original, 

his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to 

do evil, and to draw us in to do fo too : and the ^poor 

creature puzzled me once in fuch a manner, by a quef- 

tion merely natural and innocent, that I fcarce knew 

what to fay to him* 1 had been talking a great deal to 

bifQ of the power of God, his omnipotence^ his dreadful 

aiveriion to un, his being a confuming fire to the workers^ 

of iniquity ; how, as he had made us all, he could deHroy 

^, and all the worM, in a moment ; and he liliened with 

great ferioufnefs to me all the while,

After this, I had been teHing him how the devil wa» i| 
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and ufed all his ma' ^^ 
lice and (kill to defeat the good defigns of Providence^ 
and to ruin the kingdom of Chriil in the world, and the 
like: Well, fays Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong, 
fo great, is he not much flrong, much might, as the de- 
vil ? Yes, yes, faid I, Friday, God is ftronger than the 
devil, God is above the devil, and thcFelbre we jKay to 
God to tread him under biir feet, and enable us to refill 
his temptations, and quench his -fiery darts. But, fays he 
again, if God much ftrong, much might, as the devil, 
why God not kill the devil, fo make him no more wicked ? 

1 was ftrangely furprifed at his quefiion, and after all, 
though I was now an old man^ yet I was but a young 
do&or, and ill enough qualiiied for a eafulft, or a folver 
of difficulties : and, at firft, I could not tell what to fay ;: 
fo I pretended not to hear him, and afked him what he 
faid : but he was too earneft for an anfwer to forget his' 
quefiion ;' lb. that he repeated it in the very fame broken' 
words, as above, Btit this time I had recovered myfelf a 
little, and I faid, God will at laft punifh him feverely, he 
is. referved for the judgment, and is to be cail into the. 
bottomleCs pit, t* dwell with evcrlafting fire: this did 
not fatisfy Friday ; but he returns upon me repeating my 
words^ Keferve at laft, me no underfland : bbt why not 
kill the devil now, not kill great ago ? You may as well' 
&ik me, faid 1, why God does not kill you and me, when 
we do wicked things here that offend him : we are pre- 
ferved to repent and be pardoned. He raufes a while at 
this ; Well, well, fay she, mighty affectionately, that well,, 
fo you, I, (ievil, ^Jl wicked, all prcferve, repent, God. 
pardon all : here I was run dowii again by him to the 
laft degree, and it was a teflimony to me, how the -mere 
notions of nature, though they will guide reafonable 
creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a worfhip^^ 
or homage due to the fupreme being of God, as the 
confequence of our mature; yet nothing but divine re- 
velation can form the knowledge of Jefus .Chrift, and of 
a redemption p.urchafed for us: of aniediator ; of anew 
covenant ; and of an interceflbr at the footftool of God's

form thefe in the fcul , and that therefore the Gofpel of

I then explained to him, as well as 1 could, why our '

me thither, but was now to be made an inllrument, under 
Providence, to fave the life, and, for aught 1 know, the 
foul, of ^poorfavage^ and bring him to the true know- 
ledge^of religion, and of the ChrilHan dodtrine, that he

thought the mofl dreadful of all afHi^ions that could 
*poflibly have befallen mc. 
- In this thankful frame 1 continued all the remainder 
of my time, and the converfation which employed ifce 
hours between Friday and me was fuch, as made the 
three years which we lived there together perfe^ly and 
completely happy, if any fuch thing as complete happi- 
nefs can be found in a fublunary ftate : the favage was 
now A good Chridian, a much better than I; though 1 
have rcafon to hop^, and blefs God for it, that we were

had here the Word of God to read, and no'farther off 
from his Spiritto inil'ru6t, that if we had been iti England. 
I always applied myfelf to reading the Ibripture, and

of the dodlrine of falvation by Chrift Jeius, is fo plainly

As to the difpates, wranglings, ilrife, and contention, 
•which have happened in the world about religion, whether 
niceties in dc^rines, or fchemes of church government^ 
they were all perfectly ufelefs to us, as, for aught I can 
yet' fee, they have been to all the reft in the world ; wc 
had the fure guide to heaven, vis, the Word of God ; 
and we had, bleflcd be God, comfortable views of the 
Spirit of God, teaching and inftrufting us by bis Word, 
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and 
obedient to the inftru6lion of his Word^ and I cannot fee 
the leaft ufe that the greateil knowledge c^ the difputed 
points in religion, which have made {u<ah confudons in 
the world, would have been to us, if we could have ob- 
tained it ; but [ mud go on with the hiflorical part of 
things, and take every part in its order. 

After Friday and 1 became more intimately acquainted, 
and that he could underfland almoft all 1 faid to hini) 
and fpeak fluently, though in broken EngliA, to me ; I 
acquainted him with my own ftory, or at leaft fo much 
of it a§ related tp my coming into they place, how I had 
lived there, and how long; I let him into the myftery 
(for fuch it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and 
taught him how to fhoot ; I gave him a knife, which he 
was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt 
with a frog hanging to it, fuch as in England we wear 
hangers in ; and in the frog, inftead of a hanger, I 
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a' 
weapon in fome cafes, but much more afefui upon many 
occafions. 

I defcribed to him the countries of Europe, and partiW 
cularly England, which I came from ; how we lived, 
how we worfhipped God, how we behaved to one an*» 
other, and how we traded in fhips ^o all parts of the 
world ; I gave him an account of the wreck which I had 
been on board of, and (hewed him, as near as I could, 
the place where ihe lay ; but fite was all beaten in pieees

upori? at- lad, fays he. Me fee fuch boat like com-e t<3 
place at my nation. 

I did not underftand him a.good while ; but at la/l, 
when I bad exan[iined further into it, 1 underftood by 
him, that a boat, fuch as that had been, came on fhore 
upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he explained 
it; was driven thither by ft rcfs of weather: I prefently 
imagined, that fome European (hip mud have been caft 
away upon their coaft, and the boat might get loofe, and 
drive afhorc ; but wasfo dull, that I never once thougjht 
of men making efcapefrpm a wreck thithpr, much lefs 
whence they might come ; fo I only enquired after a de- 
fciiption of the boat. 

Friday defcribed the bpat io me well enough ; but 
brought me better to underttand him, when he added, 
with fpme warmth, We favethe white mans from drown : 
Then I prefently afked him, i( there were any white mans^ 
^s he called them, in the boat V Yes, he faid, the boat full 
of white mans : lafked him, liow many ? he told upon 
hijj fingers feventeen : I afked him then what became of 
them"? he told m€. They live, they dwell at my nation. 

This put new thoughts into my head again ; for I 
prefently imagined, that thefe might be the men belong- 
ing to thfi«(hip that was call away in light of my ifland,. 
as I now call it ^ and who, after the fhip was ilruck on 
the rock, and they faw her inevitably .loft, had faved 
themfelves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild 
ftore among the favages. 

Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what was 
become .of them ; he alTured me they lived Hill there, 
that they had been there about four years, that the favages 
lit them alone, and gave them vidluals to live : 1 aiked 
him, how it came to pafs they did not kill them, and 
eat them ? He faid. No, they make brother with them : 
that is, as I underftood him, a truce : and then he add- 
ed,, They eat no mans but when make the war fight : 
that is to fay, they never eat any men, but fiich as come 
to fight with them, and are taken in battle. 

It .was after this, fome confiderable time, that being 
on the top of the hill, at the eaft fide of the ifland, 
from whence, as 1 have faid, Ihad in a clear day difco-

from him ; I afked hini what was the matter !0 joyj 
fays he, O glad ! there: fee my country, there my nation ! 

I obferved an extraordinary fenfe of pleafure appeared 
in his face, and his eyes fj>arkled, and "his countenance 
difcovered a ft range eagernefs, as if he had a mind to 
be in his own country again ; and this obfervation of 
mine put a great many thoughts into Trie, iwhich made 
me at firft not fo eafy abowt my new man Friday, a9 
I was before ; and I'made no doubt, but that if ttid^y 
could get bade to his Own nation again, he Would not 
only forget all his religion, but all Jiis .obligations to 
me; and would be forward .enough to give his country- 
men an account of me, and come back, perhaps with 
an hundred or two^of them, and make a feaft upon me, 
at which he might be as merry as he ufed to be with thofe 
uf his enemies, when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honeft creature very much, 
for which I "was very forry afterwards : however,, as my 
jcaloufy increafed^ and hekl me fome weeks, I was a> 
little more circumfpe6l, and not fo familiar and kind to- 
him as before ; in which I was certainly in the wron^ 
too, the honeft grateful creature having. -no thought 
about it, but what confi fled of the beft principles, bioth: 
as a religious Chriftian, and as a grateful friend, as «ip-' 
pcared after wards to my fuU fatisfadion, 

Whilft my jealouiy of him laded, you may be fiire I wa& 
everyday pumping nim to fee if he would difcover any 
of the new thoughts, whvch I fufpe<5led were in hini ; bitf 
I found every thing he (aid was lb honeft, and fo innocent, 
that I could find nothing to nourt(h n\y fufpicion : and, 
in fpite of all my uneafinefs, be made me at laft entirely 
his own again ; nor did he in the leaft perceive tbat I was 
uneafy ; and therefore I could not fufpe<ft him of deceit.

as YOU were before ? He looked nill of concern) afil, 
ihakiug his head, faid, No, no, Friday tell them to \vjt 
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread, 
fUiiltle-fleAi,- milk, no eat man again. Why then, (aid I to 
him, they mil kill you : he looked ^rav^ a/t that, and then 
faid. No, they no kill me, they willing love learn ; he 
meant hy ihis, they would be willing to learn ; he added, 
they learned much of the Warded mens that came in the 
lioat : then I a^d him, if he would go back to them ? 
He fmiled iit that, and told me he<:ould not fwim fo far ; 
I told him I would make it canoe for him ; he told me 
he would go if I would go with him. I go ! fsud I, 
why tiMy will eat me if I come there ; No, no, fay^ he, 
me make them no eat you, me make they much love you ; 
be meai^ he would tell them how I had killed bis ene- 
mies and faved hiSs life, and fo he would make them 
love me ; then he told me as well as he could, how kind 
they were to feventeen white men, or bearded men, as he 
called them, who came on ihore in dillrefs. 

From this time J confefs, I had a mind to venture 
wtfXy and fee if I could podibly join* with thefe bearded 
men, who ] made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu- 
giiefe; not doubtifng but, if I couM, we might find fome 
method to efcape irom thence, being upon the conti- 
neal, and a good company together, better than I could 
from an iiland forty miles off the (here, and alone with- 
out help : ^o^ aft^r fome days, I took Friday to work 
a^ain, by way of difcourfe ; and told him, I would give 
him ' a boat to go back lo his own nation ; and accord- 
ij9gly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other 
i)de ofthe idand ; and having cleared it or water (for I 
always kept it funk in the water) 1 brought It out, (hewed 
it him, and we both went into it. 

I found he was a moil dexterous fellow at managing 
i^, would make it go almoU as fwift and fad again as 1 
could ; fo when he was in, I faid to him. Well, now 
Friday, fhall we go to your nation ? He looked very

210 ADV1MTUB.es of ROBINSON CRUSOE. , 

Upon the whole, as I found by all hisJ difcourfe, z 
fettled afFedlion to me, and that nothing^ fhould part 
him ^rom me, fo I found all the foundation of his de- 
fire to go to his, own country, was laid in his ardent af- 
fection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them 
good ; a thing, which as I had no notion of rnyfelf, fo 
I had not the leaft thought, or intention, or defire of un- 
dertaking it ; but ftill I found a ftrong inclination to my 
attempting an efcape, as above, founded on the fuppofi- 
tion gathered from the former difcourfe: viz. that there 
were feventeen bearded men there; and therefore, with- 
out any delay, I went to work wiih Friday, toiind out 
a great tree, proper to fell, and make a large periagua 
or canoe, to undertake the Toyage : there were trees 
enough in the ifland to have built a little fleet, not of 
periaguas and canoes only, but even of good large vef- 
fels ; but the main thing 1 looked at^ was to get ohe fo 
near the water, that we might launch it when it was 
made, to avoid themiftake 1 committed atfitft. 

At laft, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he 
'knew much better than 1, what kind of wbod was fitteft 
for it; nor can I telllo this day, what wood to call the 
*tree we cut down, except that it was very like -the tree 
v^e call fuftick, ot between that ancl the Nicaragua 
wood, for it was much of the fame • ciolour and Jmell : 
Friday was for bvfrning the hoHow^ or cavity of this 
tree out, to make it into ^ boat : but I fhewed him how 
Tather to cut it out with tools, which after lihcwedhim 
how to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a month's 
hard labour we finifhed it, and made it very hand- 
fome, efpecially when with our axes, which 1 (hewed 
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outfide into 
the trueihape of a boat ; after this, however, it cofl us 
near *a fortnight '^s time to get her along, as it were inch 
by inch, upon great rollers into the water : but when ^ 
Ihe was in, flic would have carried twenty meii 'with great 
•cafe. • ' 

When fhe was in the water, and though fhc was fo big, 
it amazed' me to fee with what dexterity and how fwtft 
my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and pad- 
idle her along ; fo I afked him if he would, arid if "wc 
might venture over in her ; Yes, he faid, he venture over

in her very well, though great blow wind ; however, I hard 
a farther deiign that ne knew nothing of, and that wds 
to make a mall "and fail, and to fit her with an anchoi^ 
and cable : as to a maft, that was eafy enough to get ; 
fo I pitched upon a flrait young cedar-tree, which I 
found-near the-place, and which there was a great plenty 
of in the illand : and I fet Friday to work to cut it 
down, and gave him diredtions how to fhape and order 
it : but as to the fail, that was my particular care ; 
I knew I had old fails, or rather pieces of ol(i fails 
enough ; but as I had them now twenty-fix years by 
me, and had not been very careful to prefen'C them,' 
not imaginincr tbat I {hould ever have this kind of ufe 
for them, I did not doubt but they wer6 all rotten ; and 
indeed mod of them were fo; however, I found two 
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with thefe I 
went to work, and vvith a great deal of paints, and awk- 
ward tedious ditching (yoii may be furej for want of 
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing", 
-Jike what we call in England a (houMer of mutton fail^ 
to go with a boom at bottom, aiYd a little fliort fprit at 
the top^fuch as ufualty-our (hips' lohg*boats fail with, 
andfuch as I knew betl how to manage ; becaufe it was 
fuch a one as I ufed in thcf boat in \yhich I made my efcape 
from Barbary, as related in the firil part of my ftory. - 

I was near two months performing this laft work ; 
viz. rigging and fitting my maft and fails ; for I finifhed 
them very complete, making a fmal^l day, and a fail or 
forefail to it, to aflift, if \te ihould turn lb windward; 
and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the 
Hern of her, to fleer with ; and- though I was but a 
bungling ihipwright, yet as I knew the ufefulncfe, and 
even neccffity of luch a thing, I applied myfelf with fo 
much pains to do it, that at laft 1 brought it-to pafs^ 
,though confidering the many dull coiitrivatices I had for 
it that failed, I thi&k it coil me aliiioft as much .labour as 
making the boat. 

After all this was* done, I had my rtifein Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to' the navigation of rtiy boat ; 
for though he knew very Well how to paddle the canoe, 
he knew nothing wh^t belonged to a fail and a rivdder, 
and was the moft amazed when he faw me work the

ufe, I made all thefe things familiar to him, and he be- 
came an expert failor, ej^c^pt that as to the eompafs,:! 
.could make him underhand veiy little of that : on the 
.other hand, as there was ^treiy little cloudy weather, and 
feldom or never any fogs in thofe parts, thiere was the lefs 
•occafion for a compafs, feeing the fiars were always to he 
feen by night, a^d the ihore by day, except in the 
rainy ieafons ; and then nobody cared to ilir abroad, 
either by land or iea« 

I was now entered on the feven-and-twentieth year of 
my captivity in this place ; though the three lall years 
that I bad this creature with me, ought rather to be 
left out of the account, my habitation being qnhe of 
another kind than in all the rell of my time. I kept 
the anniverfary of my landing here with the fatae tbank" 
fulnefs to God for His mercies as at fidl ; and if I had 
fuch cau(e of acknowledgment at fird, I had much more 
ib now, having fucb additional teftimonies of theeare of 
f rovidence over me. and the gre9t hopes i had of being 
clfe^ually and fpeedily deliyepcd ; for I had An invincible 
impreffion upon my thoughts,, that ray^ delivefance^wtt 
at hand, and that lihottld flot-be another year in this 
place : however, I went on witbiray huibandry, digglx^, 
planting, £^cing, as ufual ^ I gathered and cured mj

The rainy feafon was in the jBean time upon me,

tbatched as a houfe ; and thus we waited for the months 
of November and December, in which I defigned ta(* 
make my adventure. 

When the fettled fcafon began to come in, as the 
thought of my deiign returned with the fair weath^r^ 
I was preparing daily for the voyage ; and the firll thing 
I did wa^ tolay up a ciertain quantity of provifion, being 
the fiore for the voyage ; and intended, in a week or k 
fortnight's time, to open th^ dock, and launch out our 
boat. I was bufy one mbrning upon fomething of this 
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the fea- 
ihore, and fee if he could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing 
which we generally got once a week, for the fake of the 
eggs, as well as the htOi, Friday had not been long gone, 
when he came running back, and flew over niy outward 
wall, or fence, lik^ one that felt not the ground, or the 
fleps he fet his feet on ; and before I had time to fpeak 
to him, he cried out to me, O mailer ! O mailer ! O for« 
row! O bad! What's the matter, Friday ? faidl. O 
yonder there, fays be, one, two, three, canoe ! one, two, 
three! By this way offpeakingi concluded there were 
Gx> but on enquiry I found there were but three. WelJ, 
Friday, faid- 1, do not be frighted ; fo I heartened him pp 
as well as I could. However, 1 faw the poor fellow mo& 
terribly feared ; for nothing ran in his head but that they, 
were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, 
afid eat him. The poor fellow trembled fo, that I fcarce 
knew vfhdf. to do with him. I comforted himr as well as 
I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, 
and that they would eat me as well as him. But, faid I, 
Friday, we rauil ref<4ve to fight them. Can- you fight, 
Friday;^ Me.ihoot, fays he, but there come many great 
number. No matter for that, faid I^^gain; our guns 
will fright them that we do not kill . So I ' aiked him, 
whether, if I refolved to defend him, he would defend me, 
and iland by me^ and do juft as I bade* him ? He laid, 
me die, when you bid die^ mailer ; fo I went and fetched 
a ^ood dram of rum, and gave him ; for I had been fo 
eood a hulband of my rum, that I had a* great deal left. 
When he had drank it, I made him i$kt the two fowl- 
ing pieces which we always carried, and load them with 
large fwaaihot, Mbig* asimaU^iiilol-lHittets ; th^n-I took*

four mufkets, and loaded tbem. with two ilugs, and five 
fmall bullets each ; and my two pi(lol5 I loaded with 2^ ■. 
brace of bullets each. Ihung my great fword, as ufual, 
naked by my fide, and gave 1* riday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myielf, 1 took my perfpec- 
tive glafs, and went up to the lide of the hill, to fee what 
I could difcover; and I found quickly, by my glafs, that 
there were one-and-twenty favages, three priibners, and 
three canoes : and that their whole bufmefs fecmed to be 
the triumphant banquet upon thei'e three human bodies; 
a barbarous fead indeed, but nothing more than as I had 
obferv'ed was ufual with them. 

I obferved alfo, that they were landed, not where they 
had done when Friday made his efcape, but nearer to my 
creek, where the ihore was low, and where a thick wood 
came clofe almoil down to the fea. This, with the ab- 
horrence of the inhuman errand thefe wretches came 
about, fo- filled me with indignation, that I came down 
again to Friday, and told him 1 was refoJved to go down 
to them, and kill them all, and afked him if he would 
fland by me. He was now gotten over his fright ; and 
his fpirits being a little raifed with the dram I had given 
him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as before, he 
would die when I bid die.. 

In this -fit of fury, 1 took firft and divided the arms 
which I had charged, as before, between us. I gave Fri- 
day one piftol to ftick in his girdle, and three guns upon 
hisfhoulder, and I took one pliiol, and the other three 
, myfelf, and in this pofture we marched out. 1 took a 
fraall bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a 
large bag with more powder and bullet ; and as to or- 
ders, I charged him to keep dole behind me, and not to 
llir,^iho6t, or do any thing till I bid him; and in the 
mean time, not to (peak a- word. In this pofture I fetched 
a compafs to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get 
over the creek as to get into the wood ; fb that I might 
come within (hot of them before I could be difcovered, 
which I had feen by my glafs it was eafy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts 
returning, 1 began tp abate my. rcfolution. I do not mean 
that I entertained any fear of their numbier ; for as they 
were naked, unani>ed wretphes, 'tis certain I was fuperior

to them ; nay, though I had been alone- But it occurred 
to my thoughts, what call, what occafion, much lefs 
^ ■ what neceffity I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, 
to attack people who had neither done or intended me any 
'F Wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whole barba* 
rous cuiloms were their own difafter, being in them a 
token indeed of God's having left them, with the other 
^ nations of that part of the world, to fuch ftupidity and 
^^ to fuch inhuman courfes; but did not call me to take 
^Q upon mc to be a judge of their adkions, much lefs an exe- 
^ cutionerof his juftice; that whenever he thought fit, ha 
would take the caufe into his own hands, and by nation- 
al al vengean^, puni(h them for national crimes ; but that 
^ in the mean time it was none of my bufinefs. That it 
^ waS true, Friday might j uftify it , becaufe he was a declared 
^1 enemy, and in a flate of war with thole very particular 
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them ; but I 
could not fay the fame with rcfpe6t to me, Thefc things 
were fo warmly prefled upon my thoughts all the way as 
I went, that I refolved I would only go place myfelf near 
them, that I might obferve their barbarous fead, and 
that I would a<5l then as God Ihould direct ; but that un- 
lefs fomething offered that was more a call to me than 
yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them, 

-With this refolution I entered the wood, and with 

all poilible warinefs and fiience (Friday following dole 

at my heels), I marched till I came to the fkirt of the 

wood, on the fide which was next to them ; only that 

one corner of the wood lay between me and them.— - 

Here 1 palled foftly to Friday, and ihewing him a great 

tree, which wasjuft at the corner of the wood, I bade 

him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could fee 

there plainly what they were doing. He did fo, and 

came immediately back to me, and told me they might 

be plainly viewed there ; that they were all about the 

fire, eating the flefh of one of their prifoners ; and that 

another lay bound upon the fund, a little from them, 

whom he faid they would kill next, and which fired the 

very foul within me. He told me it was not one of their 

nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told 

mc of, who came to their country in the boat. I was 

^led with horror at the very naming the white-bearded 

man.

rfiaii, and, goifag to the ttcc, I faw plainly, by my glai$> 
a white man, who lay upon the beach of the fea, wkhhw 
hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rufhes, and 
that he was an European, and had clothes on. 
' There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond itf 
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I 
was, which, by going a little way about, I faw I might 
come at undifcovdred, an i that then I fhould be within 
half {hot of them ; fo I with-held my pailion, though I 
was indeed enraged to the highefl degree ; and going back 
about twenty paces^ I got behind fome buihes, which 
held all the way till 1 came to the other tree, and then I 
came to a little rifing ground, which gave me a full vievr 
. of them, at the diilance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lofe ; for nineteeii of thfi' 
dreadful wretches fat upon the ground all clo(e huddled 
tbgether, and had juft fent the other two to butcher the 
poor^Chriflian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to 
their fire, and they were lloop^ down to untie the bands 
at hisfeet« I turned to Friday. Now, Friday, (aid 1, do 
as Ibidthee^. Friday faid he Would. Then Friday^ faid I, 
tlo exa^ly as you fee me do ; fail in nothing. So I fet 
down one of the'mufkets and the fowling-piece ppon the' 
ground, and Friday did the lik-e by his ; and with the othet 
mufket I took- my aim at the faTages, bidding hrm do the 
like. Then alking hin^ if he was ready, he fat<l yes. Then 
fire* at them, faid I,.and the fame moment 1 fired alfo. 

Friday' took his 'aim (6 much better than I, that on the 
fide thaC he (hot, he killed two of them, and wounded 
three more; and on my fide* I kilkd one, and wbunded 
two. They were, you n>ay be^ furc, in a dreadftti cotafter-

upon thfeir ftet immediately, but did not know which way 
to run, or whk;h AVay to look, for they knew not from 
whenoe thdr deftfuft'ion came. Friday kept his eyes 
clof<l upon me^ that as I ha<l bid him, he might obferye 
what I did ; fo asfoon as th<e fiHl (hot was made, I threw 
down the piece, and took' up the fowling-piece^ and

fc did Friday ; and as our pieces were now Ipacjen with 
"What I called Iwan-fhol, or fmall piflol bullets, we found ' 
only two drop ; but fo many were wounded, that they 
i"an about yelling and fcreaming like mad creatures, all 
bloody and miferably wounded, mod of them ; whereof 
Aree more fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

Now, Friday, faidi, laying down the difcharged pieces, 
and taking up the mulket, which was yet loaden, follow 
me, faid I, which he did, with a deal of courage ; upon, 
which I rufliedout of the wood, and (hewed myfelf, and 
Friday, clofe at my foot. As foon as I perceived they fa w 
me, I ihouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do fp 
too; and running as fall as I could, which, by th6 way, 
was not very fall, being loaded with arms as 1 was, I made 
diredkly towards the poor vi6lim, who was, as 1 faid, ly- 
ing upon the beach, or fhore, between the place where 
they fat and the fea. The two butchers, who were juft 
going to wt)rk with him, had left him, at the furprife of ' 
our firft fire, and fled in a terrible; fright to the fea-fide, and 
had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the reft made 
the lame way : I turned to Friday, and bade him ftep 
forwards, and fire at them. He underllood me immedi*- 
ately, and, running ^bout forty yards to be near them, he : 
fhot at them ; as I thought, he had killed them all ; for I 
faw them all fall oh an heap into the boat ; though I faw 
•two of them up again quickly. However, he killed two 
of them, and wounded the third, fo that he lay down iu 
the bottom of the boat, ks if he had been dead. 

While my man P'riday fired at them, I pulled out my 
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor vidlim ; and 
looiing his hands and feet, I lifted hiih up, and afked him, 
in the Portuguefe tongue, what be was ? He anfwered, 
in Latin, Chriftianus ; but was fo weak and faint, that 
he could fcarce (land or fpeak. I took my bottle out of 
my pocket, and gave it him, making figns that he (hould 
drink, which he ' did ; and I gave him a piece of breads 
which he eat. Then I alked him what countryn^an he 
was? and he faid Efpagnole ; and, being a little re- 
covered, let me know, by all the fi^ns he could pollibiy 
make, how much he was in debt for his deliverance.-*-

sto (boner kad he the arii» is his hands, but, as if thef

xniiint : iat the tr«th is, as the whc^e was a furprife to 
them, fo the poor rrcatures were (b much frighted with 
the noiie of oar pieces, that thcj fell down for mere 
amazement and £rac, and bad no moie power to attempt 
^eir own efi»pe than their fielh had to refift our (hot; 
.and that was the cafe of thofe five that Fdday (hot in the 
boat : for as three of them fell with the hurt they f ^T 
xeived, fo die other two fell with the firight. 

I kept my piece in my hand lull, without firing, being 
filing to keep my charge ready » becaufc I had given tbc

^ade him nm op to the lA^^e from whence we £r(l fired,

charged, which he did with great fwiftneis ; and then 
giving him my mufk^, I (at down myfelf to load all the 
reti ag»n, and bade them come to me when the^ wanted. 
While I was loading thefe pieces, there happened a iiercc 
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the favages, 
ivho made at him with one of their sn^at wooden fwords, 
the fame weapon that was to have kilkd him before, if i 
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold 
and as brave as could be Imagined, though weak, had 
fought this Ilidian a good while, and had cut him two 
great wounds on his head ; but the favage, being a itout 
lufty fellow, cloiiDg in with him, had thrown him down, 
being faint, auid was wringing my fword out of his hand, 
^Hrhen the Spaniard, though undermoft, wifely quitting 
his fword, drew .the piftol from his girdle, (hot the favage 
through the body, and killed him npon the fpot, before 
I, who was runnmgtQ help, could come near him. 

Friday, being now left at his liberty, purfued the flying 
^jTTctches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; 
and with that he difpatched thofe three, who, as I iaid 
^)ef0re, were wounded at firil and fallen,' and all the reit 
lie -could come up with ; and the Spaniard coming td 
«ne for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with

^20 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I immediately cut the twifled flags, or ruflies, wWdk 

itbey had bound him with, and would have helped him up^ 

but he could not (land, or fpeak,but groaned mod pite- 

oufly, believing, it feems ftill, that he was only unbound 

in order to be killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to him, 
^nd tell him of his deliverance ; and piiiling out my bot- 
<le, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with 
'the news of his being delivered, revived iiim, and he fat 
.up in the boat ; but when Friday came tp hear him fpeak, 
-and looked in his face, it would have moved any one to 
dears,/ to have ieen how Friday kiffed him, embraced him, 
bugged him, jcried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, 
danced, fung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat 
bis own face and head, and then fung and jumped about 
-again, like a xiiftradled creature. I was a good while 
before 1 could make him fpea:k to me, ^or tdl me what 
was the matter ; but when he came a little to himfelf, 
Jie told me that it was his father •^ 

It was not eafy for me to cxprefs how it moved me, to 
fee what cj^tacy and filial afFedlion had worked in this 
poor favagc at the fight of his father, and of his being 
delivered from death ; nor indeed can I defcribe half the 
pxtrjivagancics of bis afFcdion after this; for he went 
into the boat and out of the boat a great many times.— 
'\yhen he went into him, he would fit down hy him, 
open his breaft, and hold his father's head clofe to his 
bofom, half an hour together, to nouvifii it. Then he 
took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and ftiiF 
with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
bands; and J, perceiving what the cafe was, gave him 
fome rum out of my bottle to rnb them with, which did 
them a great deal of good. 

This a6lioji put an end to our purfuit of the canoe 
nvith the other lavages, who were now gotten alrooilout 
of fight ; and it was happy for us that we did not, for 
Jt blew fo hard within two honrs after, aild before they 
^ould begotten a quarter of their way, and continued 
blowing fo hard ali night, and that from the north-

ther, thiat I could not find in my heart to take him off for 
fome time ; but after I thought he could leave him a lit-*^ 
tie, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laugh'-' 
iii<r,- and pleafed to the highell extreme. Then I a{ked him 
if he had given his father any bread ? He ihook hi» heady- 
tfnd faid, non^; ugly dog eat all up felf : fo I gave him^ 
St cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on pufpofe* 
I aUb gave him a dram for hirafelf, but he would not tafle 
it, but carried it to his father. 1 had in my pocket alfo 
two or three bunches of my raifins, fo I gave him a hand- 
tul of them for his father: He had no fooner given his 
father thefe raifins, but I faw him come out ©f the boat 
and run away as if he had been bewitched. He ran at fuch 
' a rate (for he was the fwifteft fellow of his feet that ever 
I law) , 1 fay, he ran at fudh a rate, that he wais out of fight 
as it were in an inftant ; and though I called andhallooed 
too after him, it was all one ; away he went, and in a 
quarter of an hour I faw him come' back again, though 
not fo fail as he went ; and as he came nearer, I foupd his 
pace was flacker, becaufe he had fomething in his hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite 
home for an earthen jug, ot pot, to bring his father fon^e 
frefli water ; and that He had got two more cakes or 
loaves of bread. The bread he gave mie, but the water 
he carried to his father. However, as I was very thirfty 
too, I took a little fup of it. This water revived his fa- 
ther more than all the rum or fpirits' I bad giveix him, 
for he was juft fainting with thirft. 
• When his father had drank, I called hirnr, tb know if 
there was any water left, , He faid yes ; arid I bade him.

his head about, to fee if his father was in the fame place

To remedy this^ I went to work in my thought, and 
calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the bank 
while he came to me, I foon made a kind of hand- 
l)arrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them 
up both together upon it between us ; but when we got

\aeni to the outiide of our wall or fortification, we were 
at a worfe lofs than before ; for it was impoffible to get 
them over ; and I was refolved , not to break it down ; 
^fo I fet to work again ; ax^d Friday and I, in about two 
iiours time, made a very handfome tent, covered" with 
old fails, and above that with bough#of trees, being itt* 
the fpace without our outward fence, and between -that 
and the grove of young wood which I had planted ; ^nd 
here we made two betls of fuch things as 1 had, viz, of 
^ood rice-ft raw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and 
another to cover them on each bed. 

My iflknd was now peopled, and I thought myfelf 
irery rich in fubjefts ; and it was a merry refle&on which 
1 frequently made, how like a king I looked, Firft, of 
, all the whole country was my own mere property j fo 
that I had an undoubted ri^ht of dominion. Secondly, 
. my people were perfeftly fubjcited. I was abfolute lord 
and lawgiver ; they all owed their lives to me, and were 
ready to lay down their Hves, if there had been occaiion 
for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three 
fubje<5ts, and they were of three different religions. My 
tnan Friday was a pro^eftant ; his father a pagan and a 
cannibal ; and the iSpaniard was a papift. However, I 
allowed liberty of confcience througjiout my donainions^ 
but this by ihe way. 

Asfoon as I had fecured my two weak rcfcned prifon-^ 
crs, and given them flielter, and a place to reft them 
Tjpon, I l>egan to think of making fome provifion for them : 
andthefirllthing I did, I ordered Friday to take a year- 
ling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular 
Hock, to be killed ; thenl cut off the hinder quarter, and, 
.chopping it into fmali pieces, I fet Friday to work, to 
boiling and ftcwing, and made them a very good difh, 1 
afTure you, of flem arid broth ; having put fomc bar- 
ley and rice alfo into the broth, an^ as 1 cooked it with- 
out doors, for I made n6 fire within my inner wall, fo 1 
carried it all into the new tent ; and having fet a table 
there for them, I fat down and eat my dinner alfo with 
them ; a!nd, as well as I could, cheered them and en- 
couraged them, Friday being my interpreter, efpecially 
to his father, . and indeed to the Spaniard too ; for the 
Spaniard fpoke the language of the favages pretty well.

&24 ADVENTURIS OF ROBIKSON GRUSOE. 

After we had dined, or rather fupped, I ordered Friday 
to tajke one of the canoes, an,d go and fetch our mufquets 
and other fire arms, which for want of time we had left 
upon the place of battle ; and the next day I ordered him 
to go and bury the dead bodies of the favages, which lay 
open to the fun, a^id would prefently be offenlive ; and J[ 
alfo ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their 
barbarous feaft, which I knew were pretty much- 
imd which I could not think of doing rayfelf; nay, I 
could not bear to fee them, if I went that way : all 
tvhich he punftually performed, and defaced the very ap- 
pearance of the favages being there ; fo that when 1 went 
again, I could fcarce If now where it was, other wife thaa 
by the corner of the wood pointing to the place. 

J then began to enter into a little converfa.1^on with 
my two new fubjedts ; and firll 1 let Friday to enquire of 
his father, what he thought of the efcape of the favages 
in that canoe, and whether he might expert a return t)f 
them with a power too great for us to refift ? His firft 
opinion was, that the favages in the boat never could live 
out the ftorm, which blew that night they went off,, but 
mull of neceffity be drowned or driven fouth to thofe 
other fhores, wnere they were as fure to be devoured, as 
they were to be drowned if they were call away ; but as 
to what they would do if they came fafe on ihore, he 
f^id, he knew, not ; but it was his opinion, that they were 
fo dreadfully frighted with the manner of being attacked^ 
the noifc and the fire, that he believed they would tell 
their people they were all killed by thunder and light- 
ning, and not by the hand of man ; and that the two 
which appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly ^ 
fpirits or furies come down to deftroy them, and not men 
with weapons. This, he faid, he knew, becaufe ha 
heard them all cry out fo in their language to one ano- 
ther ; for it was impoflible to them to conceive that a man 
fhould dart fire,, and fpeak thunder, and kill at a dif- 
tance, without hfting up the |i and, as was done now. 
And this old favage was in the right, for, as I underftood 
iince by other hands,* the favages of that part never at- 
tempted to go over to ,the ifland afterwards. They were 
fo terrified with the accounts given by thofe four nricu . 
(for it feems they did efcape the f(?a) that they believed^,

!^&^yed with fire from the gpds, • 

t xhis, however; I knew not, and therefore was under- 
continual apprehenfions for~a gopd whil^, and kept al-* 
ways upon my guard, I and air my; army ; for as lya 
were nowfourof us, I would have ventured upon- aa* 
hundred of them fairly in the open field at any time* 

In aHttletimej however, no more canoes appearing^ 
the fear of their cotaing wore off, and I began to take 
my former thongbts of a voyage to the main iiito con(i-» 
tleration, being likewife afilired by Friday's father, that 
I might depend upon good ufage. from their nation on his 
account, if Lwould go.' 

Butnvy thoughts Were a littlie fufpended, when I had 
a ferious difcourle with the Spaniard^ and when I under- 
Itood, that there were fixteen more of his country mea 
and*PoFtuguefe, who having ibeen call away, and 
made their elcape to that fide> lived tb^re at peace in^ 
deed- with> the favages, but u?ere very, fore put to it fot 
neceflaries, and indeed for life: I afked him alltbepar-* 
ticulars of their voy^age, and fouijd they Were ^a Spaniih 
lliip, bound from the Rip de la Plata, to th^ hUv^nna, 
being dire^d to leave ;their loading, there, -which wa$ 
chiefiy hides and iilver, and to bring bapk what Euro- 
pean goods they could meet with there ; that they ha;i 
five Pbrtuguefe feamen' on board, whom they took out of 
another wreck ; that five of their own meji were drowned 
when firft the fhip was lofl ; and that 'thefe efcaped « 
through infinite dangers and hazards, ai>d ariiived almoft 
ftcirved on the, Cannibal coaft, where tbey.^xpe6ted t^ 
hive been devoured, every^ moment. • 
. Hetoldmei 4hey had^fome atins with them, but they 
.were perfedily ufelefs, for that they had neitheri powder > 
nor ball, the w^fhing.-of the fea having fpoiled all their 
powder but a little which they u fed at their firft linding ; 
to provide tbemielves fome food. . 

I afked him what he, thought would becom6 of then*

ffcape ? He iaid^ theyhadhad matiy confultations about

man, nor did «ien always fquare their dealings by the 
«bligalti<aid they loiad receiired, % much as they did by 
the advantages they texpedbetf : I toM him, it would be 
very hard that I fliouid be the inflrument of their deli- 
verance, and that they 'fiiould afterwards n^ake me their 
prifoner in new Spain, where an Engtiihman was certain 
to be made a facrifice, what neceffity, or what accident, 
foever, brought him thither : and that I had rather be 
delivered up to the lavages, and be devoured alive, .than 
fall into the 'mercilefs claws of the priefls, and be carried 
into the inquisition* I added, that otherwife I wks per-' 
fuaded, tf they were all here, we mighty withfo many 
bands, build a bark large endugh to caiVy us all away: 
either to the Brazils f^Htthward, of to the iflands or Spa-^ 
tiifh coail northward^: but that if in requital they fiiould, 
when I had put weapons iiito their hands^ carry me by 
force among their own people, I might be ill ufed for 
my kindnefs to iiiem, and makp my caCe worf<^ than it 
^as before. 

He anfwer^d with a great deal of candour an3 inge- 
nuity, that their condition was fo miferable, and they 
werefo ienfible of it, that he believed they \^ould abhor 
%he thbught of u(ing any nian. unkindly that fhould cbn- 
tribitte to their deliverance ; and that, if Ipleafed, he 
would go to theKi with the old man, and difcourfe with 
them about it, and rtftuiFn again, and bring me their an- 
swer : that he would make conditions with them upoxi 
their folemn oath, thcit they would be abfolutely Under 
Hiy leading, as their commander and captain; and that 
they fhould fwear upon the holy facramente and gofpel 
to be true to me, and go to ftich Chriftian country as I 
ihould agree to, and no Other, and to bediredled whblly 
and abfolutely by my orders till, they ^ere landed fafely 
lip fuch country, as I intended \ and that he would bring a 
jTontra^t frotn them under their hand$ for that purpofe. 
Then he told me^ he would firfl fwear vU) me^-hknfelf^ 

^ . ; $ '■ ^ that 



tliat be would never Hirfroin me €ls lon£ ^s lie lived, ttilt 
I gave him order ; and that he would taKe my iidcto the 
lad drop of blood, if there fhould happen the leaft 
breach of faith among his countrymei\. 

He told me, they were all of them yeiy civil honeft 
men, and they were under the greateft dilicefs imagine * 
able, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, 
but at the mercy and dilcretion of the favages .; out of 
all hopes of ever returning to their own country .; and 
that he was fare, if I would undertake their relief, they 
^would live and die by me. 

Upon thefe aflurances, I refolved to venture to Felieve ' 
them, if poffible, and to fend the old favage and this ^ 
Spaniard over to them to treat : but when he had gottea 
all tilings in readinefs to go, the Spaniard himielf Sarted 
an objecUon, which had fo much prudence in it on one ' 
hand, and fo much fincerity on tjie oth^r band, that I 
could not but be very well fatisficd in it ; and, by big ^ 
advice, put of}^* the deliverance of his con^rades for at lealt. - 
half a year. The .cafe was thus : • 

He had been with us now about a month ; during . 
which time I had let him fee in what manner I had pro« - 
vrded, with the affiflance of Providence, for my fupport ; • 
and he faw evidently what ilock of com and rice i had ^ 
lain up; which, as it was more than (ufHcieiit for my- 
felf^ fo it was not fufficient, at lead, without good huf*- 
b^ndry, for my family, now it was increafed to number 
four : but much lefs wottld it be fufficieitt, if his coun<« 
trymen, who were, as he faid, fourteen ftill alive, 
fliould come over ; and leail of all would it be fufHcient - 
to vidtual our veffel, if we ihould build one, for a voyage 
to any of the ChriHian colonies of America. So he tolc) 
me, he thought.it would be more advifeable, t^ let hin% • 
and the other two dig and cultivate fome more land, as 
much as I could fpare feed to low \ and that we ihould ' 
wait another harveli, that we might, have a fupply of 
corn for his countrymen^ when they ihould con^e; for 
want might be a temptation-to them to difagree, or not 
to think themfehcs delivered, otherwife than out of one 
difficulty into another : jqor know, fays he, the children

His caution was fo ftafonabl^, and his advice fo good,. 
that I could not but be very well pleafed with his propo- 
fel, as well as^I was fatisfied with his fidelity : fo we fell 
to digging, all four of us*, as well as the wooden tools we ' 
were furni^ed with, permitted ; and in about a month's 
tlmfc, by the end of which it was feted time, we had got-

either of them but upon urgent occaiiom 

This was a chearful work, being the iirft meafures 
tifed by me in view of my deliverance for now 27 years

ibey came back, at a diltance, before they came on (hore. 
They went away with a fair gale on the day that the

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perfpef^ive 
glafs, to fee what I could make of them ; and havin«j 
taken the ladder out, I crrmbed up to the top of the hill, 
as I ufed to do when I wa» apprehenfivc of any thing, 
«nd to take my -view the plainer without being dif- 
covcred% 

I had fcarce fet my foot on the Irill, when my eye 
plainly difcovered a fhip lying at an anchor, jft aboat 
two leagues and a half *s diftance from me, S. S. E. buft 
not above a league and an half from the ihore. By my 
obfervatibn it appeared plainly to be an Engliih ibip^ 
and the 43oat appeared to be an EngHlh long-boat. 

I cannot exprefs the confufion 1 was in, though the 
joy of feeing a Ihip, and one whom i had reafon to 
believe was manned by my own countrymen, ami confe-r 
quently friends, wasXuch as I cannot delcribe ; but yet 
3 had fome fecret doubts hung about n>e, 1 cannot tell 
from whence' they came, bidding me keep u|K)n my 
guard. Jn the firil place, it occurred to me to confidcr 
"what bufinds ai^ EngUfh (hip could have in that part of 
the world ; iince it was not the way to or from any 
:pdn of the world where the EngUfh b-ad any traffick ; 
and I knew there had been no ftorms to drive them in 
there, as iii diilrels ; and that, if tbey were.really Engliih, 
it wasroofl probable,. that they were here upon no good 
■defign; and that I had better continue as 1 was, than fait 
into the hancb of thieves and murderers* 

Let no man defptfe the fecret hints and notices of 
^^dangcr, which lometinws are given him when he mjvy 
*hink there is no poflibility of its being real. That fuch. 
Jbints and notices are given us, I believe few thdt 
•have m^e any obfervations^ of things can deny ; that 
they are certain difcovepies of an invifibfe world, antl 
•» converfe of fpirits, we cannot doubt ; and if the 
tendency of them feeras to be to warn tts^ of dan- 
ger, why iltbuld we npt fuppoCe they are from fome 
friendly agent (whether fupreme, or inferior and fubor- 
idinate, is not the queftion), ami that they are given for 
our good f 

The prefent tjueftion abundantly confirn» me in the 
juilice of this reafoning"; for had 1 not been made cai^ 
Jtious . b^ this fecret admonition> come from^ whence it 






^vill, I had been undone inevitably; and in a fai"i^rfe' 
condition tban before, as you will (ee prefently.' 

I had not kept myfclf long in thrs pofture, but I faW 
the boat draw near the ihore, as if they looked for a 
creek to tbrtift in- at for the convenience of landing ; "how* 
ever, as they did not come guite far enough, they did 
not lee the little inlet where Iformerly landed my rafts, 
but run their boat on ihore upon the beach, at about 
half a mije from me; which was very happy for me; 
for otherwife they would have landed juft^ as I majr 
fay, at my door, and would have foon beaten me out 
of my caftle, and, perha|isy have plundered me of all 
Iliad. 

When they were- on* fhore, I was fuHy fatisfied t1icy 
Mrcre Engliftjmen, at lead nioftof them ; one or 'two I 
thought were Dutch, but it did hot prove fo: there 
were in all eleven meUf whereof three of ithem I found 
were unarmed, and (as -I thought) bound; and when the 
iirfl: four-^or five of them were jumped on ihore, tbey 
took thofe three out of the boat-Tas prifoners t one of the 
three I could perceive ufing the mott paffionate geftures 
of intreaty^ afHf6lion, and defpairy even to a kind of 
extravagance; thet>ther two, I could perceive, lifted up 
their hands fometimes, and appeared^ concerned indeed^ 
but not to fucfa a degree as the firft; 

1 was pcrfedtly confounded at the fi^htj'and knew not 
what the meaning of it (hould-be. Friday called out to 
me in Engli^, as well as he couid, C^ natafter ; you fee 
Ehgliih Jmans eat prifoners as well as^favage mans.-^ 
,Why, faid I, Friday, do you thinkthey are going to eat 
them then ? Yes, fays Friday, they will eat them. No, no, 
Vaid I, Friday ; I am afraid they will .murder thcra in*- 
decd ; but you may befure they/ will not eat them. 

All this while 1 had no thought of what the maUcf 
really was i but flood trembling with the horror of the 
fight, expecting every. moment when the three prifoners 
iliould be kilkd ; nay, once I faAA^ one of the viilaiBS 
lift up his» arm with a great cutlafs( as. the feamen call 
it) or fword, to (Irike one of the poor men; and I 
expe^ed to fee -him fall every momenti at which all the 
bk)od in iny body feonoed to run ^hill in my veins.

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23S 

i wi(hed heartily now for our Spaniard, and the faxage . 
that was gone with him ; or that I had any way , to have 
come undilcovered within (hot of them, that 1 might have 
rercuec} the three men ; for I faw no fire-arms they had 
among them ; but it fell out to my mind another way. 

After 1 had obterved the outrageous ufage of the three 
men by the infolent feamen, I obferved the fellows ran 
fcattering about the land, as if they wanted to fee ther 
country : I obferved alfp, that the three other men had ' 
liberty to go where they pleafed ; but they fat down all 
three upon ttic ground very penlive, and looked like mea 
in defpair. 

'ITiis put me in mind of <hc firft time when I came 
onlhorc, and oegan to look aDout me ; now i gave my- 
lelt' over for lolc, how wildly 1 looked round me, what 
dreadful apprehenfions I had, and how 1 lodged in the 
tree all night for fear of liein^ devoured by wild bealts* 

As I knew nothing that night of the fupply 1 was to 
receive by the providential driving of the fnip nearer the 
land by the (lorms and tides, by which 1 have lines 
been fo long nouriihed and fupported, fo thefe ihnt 
pdor defolate men knew nothing how certain ot deliver- 
'^ncc andlupply they were, how near it was to them, and 
how effedtually and really they were in a condition of 
i^tety, at the iame time they thought themfelves loft, and- 
their cafe defperate. 

So little do wfi fee before us in the world, and fo much 
rcafon ^have we to depend chearfuUy upon the great 
maker of the world, that he does not leave his creatures 
fo abfolutely deftitute, but that in the worft circumftances- 
they have always \ fomething/ to be thankful for, and- 
fometimes are nearer their deliveranc^ than they imagine ; 
naj^ are even brought to their deliverance by the 
means by which they feem to^be brought to their de- 
ftru(5lion. ' * 

It was juft at the top of high- water when thefe 
people came on fhore, and while partly they v flood 
parleying with the prifoners they brought^ and partly 
"while they rambled about to fee what kind of place they 
"vvere in, they had careiefly flaid till the tide was fpeht, 
and, the water had ebbed confiderably away^ leaving; 
their boat aground.^ * They,

234 ADVENTURED OF ROBINSON CRUSOt.^ 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I foQw! 
afterwards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell 
afleep ; however, one of them waking fooner than thjr 
other, and finding the boat .too faft aground for him to 
ftir it, hallooed for the reft who were ftraggling about, 
upon which they all foon came to the boat ; but it was 
pad all their llrength to launch her, the boat being Ycry 
heavy, and the (hore on that fide being a foft oufy iaadf 
almoil like a quickfand. 

In this condition, like true featnea, who >re, perhap<> 
the leafi of all mankind given to forethought, they gave 
it over, and away they Itrolled about the country again; 
and I heard one of them fay aloud to another (calling 
them off from the boat), Why let her alone. Jack, can't 
ye ? fhc'lliioat next tide : by which 1 wa^fuUy confirmed, 
in the main enquirjf, of wnat countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myfelf clofe, not once daring to 
ftir out of my caftle, any farther than to my place of 
obfervation, near the top of the hill ; and very glad 
I was, to think how well it was fortified : I knew it was 
no lefs than ten hours before .the boat could be on^oat 
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might 
be more at liberty 4o lee their motions, and to hear tncir 
tlifcourfe, if they had any. ^ 

In the rnean time Ifitted myfelf up for a battle, as be-. 
fore, tho' with more caution, k-nowing 1 had to do with 
another kind of ^nemy than I had at firft ; 1 ordered Fri- 
- dzy alfo, whom ] had made an excellent raarkfman with- 
his gun', td load himfelf with arms : I took myfelf two 
' fowling-pieces > and I gave him three raufquets ; my figure^ 
indeed,, was very fierce ; 1 had my formidable goat-ikiff 
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked fwordr. 
two plftols in my belt, and a gun upon each fhoulder. 

It was my delign, as I faid above, not to have made 
any attempt till it was dark ; but about two o'clockf- 
being the heat of the day, 1 found that in (hort they 
"Were all gone ftragslingr into the woods, and,- as t 
thought, were all laid down to fieep ; the three poof 
(^illreired men, too anxious for their condition to get; 
any llecp, were however fet down under the Ihelter ot 
a ^reat tree, at about a quartet of a mile from me^ ac^ 
a» i thought^ out of fight of any of the refl*^

Upon this I refolvedto difdover myfelfto them, and learn 
ipn^thing of their condition : imnaediately I marcjied in 
the figure above, my man Friday at a good diltance be* 
liind me, as forn\idablc' for his arms as I,, but not snak- 
ing quite fo flaring a fpe<5^re-Uke figure as I did. 

1 came as near them undifcovered as I could, and then j 
before any of them faw me, I called aloud to them la 
Spaniih, What are ye. Gentlemen ? 

They flarted up at the noifc, but were ten times more 
confounded when they faw me> and the uncouth figure 
that I made r they made no anfwcr at all, but 1 thought 
I perceived them juft going to fly from me, when I fpoke 
to them in Englifh, Gentlemen, faid 1, do not be i'urprifed 
at me; perhaps you may have a friend near you when- 
you did not expedl it : he muft be fent dire<5lly from 
heaven then, faid one of them very gravely to me, and 
pulling off his hat at the fame time, for our condition is 
pad the help of man. All help is from heaven. Sir, 
faid I : but can you put a llranger in the way how to 
help you ? For you feem to me to be in fomc great dlf-- 
trels : I faw you when you landed ; and when you 
fcemed to make application to the brutes that^came with 
you, I faw one of them lift up his fword to kill you. 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one aftonifhed, returned. Am 
I talking to God or man ? Is it a real man, or an angel ? 
Be in no fe^r about that, Sir, faid I : if God had fent 
an angel to relieve you, he would have come better 
clothed, and armed after another manner, than you fee 
me in : pray lay afide your fears ; I am a m.n, an Eng- 
lifhman, and difpofed to afllA you, you l*ee ; .1 have one 
fervant only ; we have arms and ammunition ? Tell u» 
freely, can we ferve you ? What Is your cafe ?

you know where they are gdne ? There they are, fir, falf 
he, pointing to a thicket of tr^es ; my heart trembles far 
fear they have feen us, and heard you fpeak; if they have, 
they will certainly murder us all. 

Have they any fire-arms ? faid I : he anfwered th&y 
had only two pieces, and one which they left in the boat. 
Well then, faid I, leave the reft to me ; I fee they are all 
afleep ; it is an eafy thing to kill them all ; but ihall we" 
rather take them, prifoners? He told me there were two 
defperate villains among them, that it was.fcarce fafe to 
(hew any mercy too ; but if they werefecured, he believ- 
ed all the reft would return to tiitir duty, 1 afked him, 
which ihey were .'' He told me, he could not at thatdif- 
tancc defcnbe them ; but he would obey my orders in 
any thing I would diredl. Well, faid I, let us retreat out 
of their view or hearing, left they awake, and we will 
* refolve farther : fo they willingly went back with me, till 
the woods covered us from them. 

Look you, fir, faid I, if I venture'upon your delive- 
rance, are you willing to make two conditions with me ? 
'He anticipoted my propofals by telling me, that both 
he and the (hip, if recovered^ fh.ould, be wholly diredled 
and commanded by me in every thing; and if the ftiip 
was not recovered, he would live and die with me Jn-- 
what part of the world foeyer 1 would fend him ; and'' 
the other two men faid the fame. 

Well, faid I, my conditions are but two : T. That 
while you ftay on this ifland with me, you*will not pre- 
tend tp any authority here'; and if I put arms into your 
hands, you will upon all occafions give them up to me, 
and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this ifland, 
Hid in the mean time to be governed by my orders, 

2, That if the (hip is or may be recovered, you wilt 
carry me and my man to England, paflage free; 

He gave me all the aflurance that the invention and 
faith oi a man could devife, that he would comply with 
thefe mofl reafonable demands, and beiides would owe 
his lif^ to me, and acknowledge* it upoavall occaiions aS' 
long as- he lived. -

latitude that he was able ; but offered to be wholly- 
guided by me : I told him I thought it was hard ven- ^ 
turing any thing, but the bell met^iod I cotild think of, 
was to fire upon them at once, as they lay ; and if any 
Were riot killed at the fird volley, and offered to fubmit, 
we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon God's 
providence to dired: the (hot. 

, He faid very modeftly that he was loth to kill them, 
if be could help it ; but that thofe two were incorrigible 
villains, and had been the . authors of all the mutiny in 
the fhip ; and if they efcaped we fhould be undone Hill ; 
for they would go on board, and b(ing the whole fhip's 
H^ompany, and deflroy us all'; well then, faid 1, neceffity 
legitimates my advice ; for it ^s the only way to fave our 
lives. However feeinjj him ftill cautious of fheddins: 
blood, I told him they (hould go themfelves, and jna- 
Jiage as they found convenient. 

Jn the middle of this difcourfe we heard fome of them 
awake', andfoon after we fawtwo of them on their feet : 
I afked him if either of them were the men who he had 
faid were the heads of the mutiny? He faid, no. WeH 
then, laid I, you may let them efcape, and Providence 
feems to have wakened them on purpofe to fave them^ 
felves : now, faid I, if therell efcape you, it is your fault. 

Animated with this, he took the mufquct I had given 
him in his hand, and piftol in his belt, and his two 
•comrades with himj with each man a piece in bis hand. 
The two men, who were with him going firft, made fomc 
noife, at which one of the leamen, who was awake,, 
turned about, and feeing them coming, cried out to the 
relt, but it was too late then; for the moment he cried 
out^ they fired, 1 mean the two men, the captain, wifely 
referving his own piece.; they had fo well aimed their 
fiiot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed 
on the ipot, and the other very much wounded ; but not 
being dead, he ftarted up on hfs feet, and called eagerly 
for help to the other ; but the captain, ftepping to him, 
told him it was too late to cry for help; he fhould call 
upon God tp forgive his villany ; and with that word 
knocked him down with the itock of his mufquet, fo 
that he never fpoke more : there were three more in the 
company, and one. of them was alio llightly wounded. 



^38 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOC* 

By this time I was come ^ and when they faw their dan* 
ger, and that it was in vain to reiift, they begged for 
mercy: the captain told tlieni, he would fpare their 
lives, if they would give him any affurance of their ab- 
horrence of the treacheryf^hey had been guilty of, and 
would f\year to be faithful to him in recovering the ihip^ 
tmd afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from 
whence they came : they gave him all the proteftations 
of their fincerity that could be detired, and he was wik 
ling to believe them, and fpift-e their lives which I was 
not againft ; only I obliged them to keep thenoi bound 
hand and foot while they were upon the illand. 

While this was doing, I fent Friday with the captain's 
mate to the boat, with orders to fccure her, and bring 
away the oars and fail, which they did ; and by and by, 
three ftragglingmen, that were (happily for them) part- 
ed from tne reft, came back upon bearing the guns 
fired; and feeing their captain, who before was their 
prifoner, now their conqueror, they fubmitted to be 
bound alfo, and fo our vidlory was complete. 

It now reniained, that the captain and I ihould enquire 
into one another's circumftances. 1 began firft, and told 
him my whole hiftory, which he heard with an attention 
€ven to amarement, and particularly at the wonderful 
manner of my being furni&ed with provilions and am-- 
-munition; and indeed, as my ftory is a whole coUediion 
of wonders, it affedled him deeply; but when he reficdted 
from thence updnhimfelf, and how I feeraed to have been! 
preferved there on purpofe to fave his life, the tears ran 
^own his face, and he could not fpeak a woixi more. 

After this communication was at an end, I carried 
trim and his two men into my apartments, leading thend 
,in jull where I came out, vizT at the top of the houfe ; 
where I refreihed them with Aich provilions as 1 had,^ 
and (hewed them all the contrivances I had made during 
my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All 1 fhewed them, all I faid to them, was pcrfedlljr 
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my forr 
ttfication, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat 
with a grove of trees, which having now been- planted 
near twenty years, and the trees growing much fader 
than in England, was become a little wood, and fo 

thick

tliick, that it was unpafTable in any part of it, but at 
ihat one iide where I had referved my little Winding 
^aflage into it : this I told him was my caftle, and my 
Tefidence ; but that I had a feat in the country^ as molt 
princes have, whither I could retreat upon occalion, an4 
I would ihew him that too another time ; but at prelent 
«ur bufinefs was to confi ler how to recover the fhip : 
he agreed with me as to that ; but told m^, he was per- * 
•fcdlly at a lols what meafure to take ; for that there 
were ilill dx and twenty hands on board, whq^ having 
entered into a curfed confpiracy, by which they had all 
forfeited fheir lives to the law, would be hardened in it 
jiow by defperation ; and would carry it on, knowing 
that if they were reduced, they {hould be brought to the 

fallows as foon as they came to England, or to any of the 
Inglifii colonies; and that therefoie there would be no 
attacking them with fo fmall a number as we were. 

I raufed for fomc time upon what he had faid, and 
found it was a very rational conclufion, and that there- 
"fore fomethiilg was to be refolved on very fpeedily, as * 
well to draw the men on board into fome Ihare for their 
furprize, as to prevent their landing upon us, and de- 
ftroying us : upon this it prefen^ly occurred to me, that 
in a little while, the (hip's crew, wondering what was 
become of their comrades and of the bo^J, would cer- 
tainly come on ihore in their other boat to fee for them ; 
and that then perhaps they might; come armed, and be too _ 
4irong for. us : this he allowed was rational. 

Upon this I told him, the firft thing we had to do, 

^wal to llave the boat, which lay upon the beach, fo that 

they might not carry her oft*; and, taking every thing 

put of her, leave her fo far ufelefs as not to be fit to fwim^ 

accordingly v/e went on board, took the arms "which 

were left on board out of her, ^nd whatever clfe we found 

there, which was a-bottle ofbsiindy, and another of rum, 

'a few bifcuit cakes, ar^horn of powder, and a great lu^np 

of fugar in a piece of canvas : the fugar was five or lix 

pounds ; all which was very welcome to me, efpecially 

the ^randy and fugar, of which I had had none left foy 

many 5'ears. 

" When we had carried all thefe things on ihore, (the 

oars, mait^ fail, and rudder of the boat, were carried 

^ away

away before, as above), we knocked a gireat hole In bef 
bottom, that if they had come ftrong enough to mailer 
us, yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indee^ it was not much jn my thoughts that we 
could be capable to recover the (hip , but my view was, 
that if they went away without the boat, 1 did not much 
oueftion to make her fit again to carry us away to the 
Leeward iflands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards 
in my wa,y, fori had them ftill in my thoughts. 

/While we were thus preparing our defigns, and had 
firft, by main ftrength, heaved the boat up upon the 
beach .fo high that the tide would not float her off at 
high-water mark, and, befides, had broken an hole in 
her bottom, too big to be quickly Hopped, and were fat 
down mufing what we fhould do, we heard the fhip fire 
a gun, and faw her make a waft with her ancjent, as a lig- 
nal for the boat to come on board ; but no boat flirred, and 
they fired feveral times, making other fignals for the boat. 

At laft, when all their fignals and firings proved fruit- 
lefs, and they found the boat did not ftir, we faw them 
(by the help of our glaffes) hoift another boat out, and 
row towards the fhore ; and we found as they approached, 
that there were no lefs than ten men in her, and that 
they had fire-arms with them. 

As the (hip lay almoft two leagues from the fhore, 
•we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain 
light of the rnen, even of their faces ; becaufe the tide 
having fet them a little to the eaft of the other boat, they 
l-owc 1 up under (here, to- come to the fame place where 
the olher had landed, and where the boat lay. / 

By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them, 
tind the captain kneW the perfons and charadlers of all the 
men in the boat ; of whom, he faid, there were three very 
honed fellows, w^ho, he was fure, were led into this con- 
ipiracy by the rell, being overpowered and frighted. 

But that for the boatfwain, who, it feems, was the 
chief oflrcer amongftthem, and all the reft, they were as 
outrageous as any of the fhip*s crew ; and were, no 
-doubt, made defperate in their new enterprife ; and ter- 
ribly apprehcnfive he was, that they would be too power- 
ful for us,

I fmiled at him, and told, him, that me^i in our cir-» 
cumftances were paft the operations of feau/f that feeing 
almoft every condition that could be was better than that 
we were fuppofed to be in, we ought to expecfl that the con-- 
fequence, whether death or life, would be fure to be a d©- 
liverance. I afked him what he thought of the circuniftan- 
cesofmy life, and whether a deliverance were not worth 
venturing for. And where, lir, faid I, is your belief qf ray 
being prelerved here on purpofe to favc your life, which 
elevated you a little while ago ? For my part, faid I,, there 
feems to be but one thing amifs in all the profpeft of it. 
What's that ? fays he. Why, faid I, 'tis that, as you fay, 
there are three or four honefi fellows among them, which 
(hould be fpared ; had they been all of the wicked part of 
tlie crew, I fhould have thought God's providence had 
Angled them out to deliver them into your hands ; for 
<lepend upon it, every man of them that comes aihore, 
are our own, andfliall die or aye, as they behave to us. 

As I fpoke this with a raifed voice and chearful coun- 
tenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; fo we fet 
vigoroufly to our bufmefs : we had, upon the firft ap- 
pearance of the boat's coming from the (hip, qoniidered 
of feparating our prifoners, and had indeed fecured t,hem 
cfFedually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was lefs aflured than 
ordinary, 1 lent with Friday, and one of the three delivered 
men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and 
out of danger of being heard or difcovered, or of finding 
their way out of the woods, if they could have delivered 
themfelves : here they left 'em bound, but gave 'emprovi- 
fions, and promifed 'em, if they continuiid there quietly, 
to give 'em their liberty in a day or two ; but that, if they 
attempted their efcape, they fliould be put to death with- 
out mercy. They pramifed faithfully to bear their con- 
finement with patience, and were very thankful that they 
liad fuch good ufage as tg have prpviiions, and a light left * 
cm ; for Friday gave 'em candles (fuch as we madeour- 
fclves) for their comfort ; and they did not know but that 
he ftood centinel over 'em at the entrance. 

The other prifoners had better ui'age : two of, them 

^ere kept pinioned indeed, becaufe the Captain was not 

^ce to truft them ; but the other t^o were taken into my

fen'ice upoi^ their captain's recommendation, and upon 
<heir folemmy engaging to live and die with us ; fo 
\vith them and the three honed men, we were feven men 
vireU armed ; and I made no doubt we fliould be able to 
deal well enough with the ten that were a coming, con- 
fidering that the captain had faid, there were three or four 
toneft men among them alfo. 

^ As foon as they got to the placfe where their other 
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came 
iall on fliore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was 
gla4 to fee ; for 1 was aff aid they would rather have left 
the bo^t at an anchor, fome diftance from the (here, 
"With fome hands in her to guard her ; and fo we Ciould 
not be able to fei^e the boat. 

' Being on ihbre, the firft thing they did, they ran ail 
to the other boat ; and it was eafy to fee they were under 
a great furprifc, to find her ftrippeid, as above, of all that 
was In her, and a great hole in her bottom. $ 

After they had muled awjiile upon this, they fet up two 
or three great (houts, hallooing with all their might, to 
try if they could make their companions hear ; but all was 
to. no purpofe J they then came all clofe in a ring, and 
fired a volley of their fmall arms, 'which indeed we 
heard, and the echoes made the woods ring ; but it was 
all one ; thofe in th(i cave we were fure could not hear ; 
and thofe in our keeping, though they heard it well 
ienough, yet durft give no anfvver to them. 

They were fo allonifhed at the furprife of this, that, as 
they told us afterwards, they refolved to go all on board 
again to their (hip, and let them know there that the 
men were all murdered, ,and the' long-b.oat ftaved ; ac- 
cordingly, they immediately launched the boat again, 
iindgot all of them on board. 

Tne captain was terribly amazed, and even confound- 
ed at this, believing they would go on board the ihip 
again, and fet fail, giving t^eir comrades for loft, and 
fo he fhould ftill lofe the fhip, which he was in hopes 
we (hould have recovered; but he was quickly as much 
frighted the other way. 

I'hey had not been long put off with the boat, but we 
perceived them all coming ci^ fhore again ; but with this 
»cw meafure in their condudt, which, it fccms, they con-

tultttl together upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat j 
and the reft to go on Ihorc, and go up into the country 
to look for their fellows. 

This was a great difappointment to* us ; for now we 
were at a iofs What to do ? for our feizing thofe feven 
meri on {hor^ would be no advantas:e to us if we let the 
boat efcape, becaufe they would then row away to the 
Ihip ;* and then the reft of them would be lure to weigh, 
and fet fail, and fo our recovering the (hip would be loft. 

However, wc had no remedy but to wait and fee what 
theilTue of things might prefent: the feven men came 
on fhore, and the three who remained in the boat put 
her off to a good diftance from the ftiorc, and came t<i . 
an anchor to wait for them, fo that it was impoffible for 
us to come at thepn in the boat. 

Thofe that came on fhore kept clofe together, march- 
ing towards the top of the little hill, under which my 
habitation lay ; and we could fee them plainly, though 
they could not perceive us : we could have been very 
glad they would have come nearer to us^ fothat w6 might 
have fired at them ; or that they would have gone farthef 
off, that we might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of t hie hill, 
where they could fee a great way in the valley and 
woods, which lay towards the north-eaft part, and 
where the ifland lay loweft, they fhout-ed and hallooed till 
they were weary ; and not caring, it feems, to ven- 
ture far from the (hore, nor far from one another; they 
fat down together undet a tree, to conlider of it : had 
they thought fit to have gone to ileep there, as the other 
party of them had done, they had done the job for^us^; 
but they were too full of apprehenfions of danger, to 
denture to go to fleep, though they could liot tell what 
the danger was they had to fear neither. ' • 

.The captain made a very jutl propofal to me upon 
this conlultation of theirs; viz, that perhaps they 
Would all tire a volley again, to endeavour to make 
their fellows hear, and that W6 flioiild all fally upon 
them, juft at the jundture when their pieces v^ere all

again. 



But this event did not happen, and we lay ftill a lonsf 
time, very irrefolufe what courfe to take ; at length I 
told them, there would , be nothing to be done in my 
opinion till night; and then, if they did not return to 
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between 
them and the (hore, and fo might ufe fome ftratagem with 
them in the boat, to get them on fliore. 

We waited a great while, though very iippatient, for 
their removing, and were very uneafy : when, after long 
conftiltations, we faw them all ilart up, and march down 
towards the lea : it feems, they had fuch dreadful appre-i- 
tenfions^upon them of the danger of the place, that they 
refolvedto^o on board the fhip again, give their compa-* 
nions over for loft, a:nd fo go on with their iijtended voyage 
with the fhip. 

As foon as I perceived them go towards the fhore, I 
Imaglped it to be as it really was ; that they had given 
Over the fearch, and were for going back again ; and the 
paptain, as foon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to 
fink at the apprchenfion' of it ; but 1 prefently thought of 
a firatagem to fetch them back again, and which an- 
iTwered my'end to atittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over 
^he little cieek weft ward, towards the place where the 
favages came on fhore when Friday was refcued ; and as 
foon as they came to a little rifing ground, at about half 
a mile's diftance, I bade them halloo as loud as thev 
could, and wait till they foundthefeamen heard them ; that 
as foon as ever they heard the feamen anfwer them, they 
ihould return it again, and then keeping out of fight, take 
a round, always anfwering when the other ha)looed, to 
draw them as far into theifland, and amonsj the woods, as 

foffible, and then wheel about again to me, by I'uch ways 
direded. * 

They were juft going into the boat, when Friday and 
the mate hallooed, and they prefently heard them, and 
anfwering, run along the fhore wettward, towards the 
the '^oice ihey heard, when they were prefently (topped 
by the creek, where, the water being up, they could not 
get over, and called for the boat to come upj and fet 
mem over^ as indeed 1 expedted. When

When they had fet themfelves over, I obferved that the 
boat being gone up a good way up into the creek, and as 
it were in an harbour within the land, they took one of 
the three men out of her to go along with them, and left 
only two in the boat, having fattened her to the ftump of 
a little tree on the (hore. 

This was what I. wi(hed for, and immediately leaving 
Friday and the captain's mate to their buiinels, I took 
the reft with me, and, croffing the creek out of their 
fight, we furprifcd the two men before they w<ire aware, 
one of them lying on {hore, and the other being in the 
boat ; the fellow on fhore was between ileeping and 
waking, and going to ftart up : the captain, who was 
foremoit, ran in upon l^im, and knocked him down, and 
then called oiit to him \n the boat to yield, or he was a 
<lead man. ' 

There needed very few arguments to perfUadc a (ingle 
man to yield, when he ,fawfive men upon him, and his 
^mrade knocked down; bciidcs, this was, it feeins, one 
of the three who were not fo hearty in the mutiny as the 
Teft of the crew, and therefore was ealily perfuaded not 
only to yield, but afterwards to join very uncerely with r^s. 

in the mean time, Friday and the captain S'tnate^ 
well managed their bulinefs with the reil, that they drew 
them, by hallooing and anfwering, from one' hill to art- 
other, and from one wood to another, till they not only 
heartily tired them, but left them where they were very 
fure'they could uot reach Jjack to the boat before it was 
dark ;, and indeed tHey were heartily tired themfelves alfo 
by tlie time they came back to us> 

We had nothing now to do but to watcK for them in 
the dark, and to fail ttpDn them, fo as to make fure work 
with them. 

It was feveral hours after Fri<lay came back to me 
i^efore they came back to their boat ; and we could hear 
•he foremoft of them, long before they came quite up, 
•calling to thofe behind to' come along, and could alfo 
hear them anfwer, and complain how lame and tired 
they were, and not being able to come any fafter, which 
was very welcome new» to us. 

At length they came op to the boat ; but it is impoiTible 
to exprefs theix confofion when they found the boat \M\

a ground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their 
two men gone ; we could hear them call to one another 
in the moil lamentable manner, telling one another they 
were gotten into an enchanted iiland ; that either there were 
inhabitants in it, and they fhould all be murdered, or elfe 
there were devils or fpirits in it, and they Ihould all be 
carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades 
by their names a great many times, but no anfwer ; after 
fome time we could^fee them, by the little light there 
was, runabout wringing their hands, like menindefpair; 
and that fometimes they would go and fit down in the 
boat to reft thcrafelves, then come a(hore, and walk 
about again, and Co the fame thing over again. 

My men would fain have had me given them leave tc^ 
fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to 
take them at fome advantage, fo to fpare them, and kill 
as few of them as I could ; and efpecially I was un- 
willins^ to hazard the killing of any of our nien, knowing 
the others were very wdl armed : I refolved to wait to feci 
if they did not feparate ; and therefore, to make fure of 
them, Idrew my ambufcade nearer ; and ordered Friday, 
^lUad the captain to creep upon their hands and ^et as 
clofe to the ground as they could, that they might not be 
difcovered, and get as. near them as they poflibly could, 
before they offered to fire. 

Theyiiad not been long in that poUure, but that the 
boatfwain,, who was the principal ringleader of the mu-^ 
tiny, and had now (hewn himfelf the moft dejeded and 
difpirited of all the reft, came walking towards them with 
two more of the crew ; the captain was fo eager, at 
having the principal rogue fo much in his power, that he 
could hardly have patience to let him come fo near as to 
be fure of him ; for they only heard his tongue before : * 
but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday^ 
flarting up on their feet, let ily at them. « 

The bqatfwain was killed upon the fpot ; the next man 
■was ijiot in the body, and fell juft by him, though he did 
not die till an hour or two after ; and the third run for ic.

Captain and his two men, and the three prifoners of war, 
whom he had tnifted with arras. 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, fo that they * 
could not fee our number ; and I made^the man they haci 
left in the boat, who was now pne of us, to call them by 
name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and fo 
might perhaps reduce them to terms ; which fell out juft 
as we defircd : for indeed it was eafy to think, as their 
condition then was, they would be very willing to capitu- 
late ; fo he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tojn Smith anfwered imme- 
diately. Who's that ? Robinfon ! For it feeais he knew 
his voice. The other anfwered, Ay, ay ; for God's fake, 
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yield, or you 
are all dead men this moment. ^ , 

Who mult we yield to ? Where are they ? fays Smith 
again. Here they are, fays he; here is our captain and 
fifty men with him, have been hunting thefe two hours,; 
the boatfwain is killed ; Will Frye is wounded, and 1 am ' 
a prifoner ; and if you do not yield, you are all 

loft. A , 

Will they give us quarter then ? fays Tom Smith, and 
we will yield. 1*11 go and afk, if you promife to yield;, 
fays Robinfon. So he afked the captain, and the cajv 
tain himfelf then calls out, .You, Smith, you know my 
voice, if you lay down your arms immediately, and fut^" 
mit; you (hall have your lives, all but Will AtkinsS. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out. For God's fake, caQr 
tain, give me quarter: what have 1 done ? they have bee^fi - 
all as bad as i ; which by the way was not true, neither .; 
for it feems this Will Atkins was the firft man that laid 
hold of the captain when they firft mutined, and ufed h|cp 
barbaroufly, in tying his hands, and giving him inju- 
rious language : however, the captain told him he muft 
lay down his arms at difcretion, and truft to the gover- 
nor's mer«y, by which he meant me, for they all called 
me governor. - , 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged 
their lives ; and i fent the man that had parlied with 
them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then my 
great army of fifty men, which, particularly with thol'e 
three, were all but eight, came up^nd fei2ied upon them

all, and upon their boat, only that I kept myfclf and one 
more out of ficrht, for reafons of ftate. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think 
of leizirig th^ fhip ; and as for the captain, now he had 
leifnre to parley with them, he expoftulated with them 
upon the viHany of their pra^ices with him, and at 
length, upon the farther wickednefs of their defign ; and 
how certainly it muit bring them to milery and diftrefs 
in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for 
their lives : as for that, he told them they were none of 
hi:s prifoners, but the commander's of the ifland ; that 
they thought they had fet him on fhore in a barren unin- 
habited ifland ; but it had pleafefd God foto dircdthem, 
that the illand was inhabited, and that the governor was 
»n EngHlhraan ; that he might hang them all there if be 
pleafed ; but as he had given them all quarter, hefup- 
pofed he would fend them to England, to be dealt with 
there as juftice required, except Atkins, whom he was 
commanded by the governor to advife to prepare for 
tieath ; for that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this wa4 all a fi^ion of his ojvn, yet it had 
its deHred e£Pe<9: : Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the 
captain to intercede with the governor for his life ; and 
all the reft becTged him for God*s fake, that they might 
loot be fcnt to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our delivef- 
•nce was come, and that it would be a moll eafy thing 
to bring thefe fellow? in to be hearty in getting poflelfion 
■of the (hip ; fo I retired in the dark from them, that they 
wight not fee what kind of a governor they had) and 
called the captain to me ; when-1 called, as at a good 
diftance, one ofthe men was ordered to fpeak again, and 
fay to the captain, Captain, the commander calls fo'^ 
you : and prefently the captain replied. Tell his excel- 
lency I am juft a boming. This more perfedlly amuied 
them ; and they all believed, that the commander was 
jull by, with his tjfty men. 

Upon the captain^s coming to me, 1 told him my pro- 

jed for feizing the {hip, whiph he liked wondertuHy 

well, and relblved to put it in execution the next morning* 

But in order to execute it with more art, and to be 

fecurc 



ADVti^ttrRfes or KOBtK^ii crusoe. 249 

fecurc of fuGcefs, I told him we muft divide the prifon- 
ers, and that beihould go and take Atkins, ^nd two more 
of the worft of them, and fend them pinioned to the cave 
where the others lay : this was committed to Friday, and 
the two men who came on fhore with the captain. ^ 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prifoh ; and 
it was indeed a difmal place, efpecially to men in their 
condition. 

The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of 
which 1 have given a full defcription ; and as it was 
fenced in> and tlxey pinioned, the place wa« fecure enough, 
■couiidering they were upon their behaviour^ 

To thefe. in the morning 1 fent the captaip, who was 
to enter into a f»arley with them ; in a^Vord, to try them, 
^nd tell me, whether he thought they might be trufted 
or no, to go on board, and furprife the (hip : he talked 
to them of the injury done him^ of the condition they 
Were brought to, and that though the governor had 
given them quarter for their lives, as to the prefent action, 
yet if they were fent to England^ they would all be 
Jianged in chains to be fure; but that if they would join 
*n fuchan attempt as to recover the fhip, he would have 
the governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guefs how readily fuch a proposal would 
he accepted by men in their condition : ' they fell down 
On their knees to the captain, and promifed with the 
dcepeft imprecations, thajt they would be faithful to him 
to the lalt drop, and that they fhould owe their lives to 
hira, awd wp^uld go with him all over the world ; that 
they would own him for a father to them as long as they 
^ived. 

Well, fays the captain, I muft go and tell the gover- 
nor what you fay, and fee what I can do to bring him U* 
<:onfentto it< £0 he brought me an account of the temper 
he found them in : and that he verily believed they 
Av6uld be falthfuL 

' However, that we might be very fecure, I told him he 
^ould go back again, and choot'e out five of them, and 
tell them, that they fhould lee that they did not want men ; 
l)ut that he would take out 01 thofe five to\e his affift*- 
^nts, and that ihe governor would keep the other twoj

cave) as hoftajxes, for the fidelity of thofe five ; and that 
if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hof- 
tagcs (hould be hanged in chains alive upon the fhore. 

This looked fevcre, and*convinced them, that the <yo- 
vernor was in earned ; however, they had- no way left 
them but to accept it ; and it was now the bufinefs of \he 
prifoners, as much as that of the captain, to perfuade the 
other five to do their duty. 

Our firengthwas now thus ordered for the expedition : 
1. The captain, his mate, and paflenger* 2. Then the" 
two prifoners of the firll gang, to whom, having their 
.charadlers from the captain,! had given their liberty, ^nd 
"trufted them with arms. 3. The other two whom I 
kept in my bower till now pinioned, but,, upon the cap- 
tain's motion, had now releafed. 4. Thefe five relealed 
at laft ; fo that they were twelve in all, befides fiw^ we 
kept prifoners in the cave for hoftages^ 

I alked the captain if he was willing to venture with 
thefe hands on board the Ihip : for, as to rne, and my 
man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to Itir, 
having feven men left behind ; and it was emploj-ment 
enough for us to keep them afunder, and fupply them. 
with victuals. > 

As to the ^ve. in the cave, I refolved to keep tbcra 
faft ; but Friday went twice a day to them, to fupply 
them with ' necelTaries ; and I made the other two carry 
proviijons to a certain diflance, where Friday was to 
take it. 

When I (liewed myfelf to the . two hoftages, it was- 
with the captain, who told them^ 1 was the perfon the 
governor had ordeied to look after them, ^,nd that it 
was the governor's pleafure that they (hould not ilir any 
where but by my direction ; that if they did, they (houkr 
be fetched into the caille, and be laid in irons ; fo that 
as we never fuffered them to fee me. as governor, fo I 
now appeared to another perfon, and fpoke of the go- 
vernor, the garrifon, the caltle, and the like, upon alL 
occafions. 

The captain had now no difficulty before him,, but 
to fumifli his two boats, flop the breach of one, and 
and man them : he made his paiTenger captain of one, with 
four other men ; and himfelf, and his mate, and ^va 

morc^

more, weat in the other : and they contrived their buii- 
nefs very well ; for they came up to the fhip about mid- 
night : as foon as they came within call of the ihip, he 
made Robiiifon hail them, and tell them he had brought 
off the men and the boat, but that it was a lone time be«» 
• fore they had found them, and the like ; holding them 
in a chat, till they came to the fhip's iide ; when the 
captain and the mate, entering firft with their arms, im- 
mediately knocked down the. fecond mate and carpenter 
with th€ butt end of their muiliets, being very faithfully 
feconded by their men ; they lecured all the rell that 
were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to 
failen the hatches to keep them down who were below, 
when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore- 
chains, fecured the forecaille oi the Ihip, and the (kuttle 
which went down into the cook-room, u>aking three men 
they found there prifoners. / 

When this was done, arul all fate upon the deck, the 
captain ordered the mate with three men to break into the 
round-houfe, where the new rebel captain lay, and, 
having taken. the alarm, was gotten up, and with two 
men and a boy had gotten fire-arms in their hands ; and 
i/cthenthe mate with a crow fplit open the door, the new 
captain 'and his men fired boldly among them, and 
wounded the mate with a muiket ball, which broke his 
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed 
nobodJ% 

'I'he mute calling for help, rufhed, however, into the 
round-houfe, wounded as he was, and with his pillol lliot 
the new captain through* the head, the bullets entering at 
his mou^h, and came out again behind one of his ears ;• * 
(b that he never fpoke a word ; upon which the rcil 
yielded, and the (hip was taken cfFeciually, without any 
more lives loft. 

As foon as the (hip was thiis fecured, the captain or- 
dered feven guns to be fired, which was the fignal agreed 
upon with me, to give me notice of his fuccels ; which 
you may be fure 1 was very glad to hear, having fat 
watching upon the fhore for it, till, near two of the clock 
in the morning. , 

Having thus heard the fignal plainly, I laid me down ;

very found, till 1 was Ibmething furprifed with the noii^* 
of a gun ; and prefcntly flatting up, I heard a tnan cai! 
inc by the name of governor, governor; and ^prefcntly 
I knew the captain's voice, w^hen climbing up to the top 
of the hill, there he ftood ; and pointing to the Ibip, he 
embraced me in his atms. My dear friend and deliverer, 
fays he, there's your Ihip, for (he is all your's, andfoaic 
we, and all that belong to her. I cail my eyes to tfie 
(hip, and there ihe rode within a little more than half a 
mile of the ihore ; for they had weighed her anchor as 
foon as they were maftcrs of her ; and the weather being 
fair, had brought her to an anchor juil againft the mouth 
of a little creek, and the tide being up, the captain had 
brought the pinnace in nearthe place where I fitft landed 
my ratts, and 'io landed juii at my door. * 

I was, at fird, ready to fink down with the furprife : 
for I (aw my deliverance indeed vifibly put into my hands, 
all things eafy, and a large fhip juft ready to carry me 
away whifhef I pleafed to go : at firft, for fome time, I 
was not able to anfwer one word ; but as he had takeli 
me in his arms, I held faft by him, oj I fhould have 
fallen to the ground. 

He perceived the furprife, and imrnediately pulled a 
bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial^ 
which he had brought on purpofe for me : after Idrank 
it, I fat down upon th€ ground, and though it brought 
me to myfelf, yet it was a good while before i could 
fpeak a^ word ta hiin> 

All this while the poor man was in as great an ec- 
ftafy as Ij only not under any furprife, as 1 was; and he 
faid a thoufand kind tender things to nle, to compofe 
and bring me to myfelf ; but fuch was the flood of joy 
in my bread, that it put all ray fpirits into confuiicm ; at 
lait it broke into tears, and in a little while after i re* 
covered my fpeech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my de* 
liverer, and we rejoiced together. 1 told him 1 looked 
upon him as a man fent from heaven to deliver me, 
and that the whole tranfa<5bion feemed to be a chain 
of wonders ; that fuch things, as thefe_ were the tel* 
iimonies we had 'of a fecret hand of rrovidcnce go- 
Ycrning the world, and an evidence that th<^ eyes t>f

tffi infinite power could fearch into the remotefj corner 
of the world, and fend help to the miferablc whenever 
he pleafed. 

I forgot not to lift tip my heart in thankfulnefs to 
heaven ; and what heart could forbear to blefs hinn, 
>vho had not only in a miraculous manner provided for 
one in fuch a wildernefs, and in fuch a defolate condi- 
tion, but from whom every deliverance muft always be 
acknowledged to proceed ? 

When we bad talked awhile, the captain told me he 
had brought me fome little refrefliments, fuch as the 
ihip afforded, and fuch as the wretches, who had been 
(o long his m afters, had not plundered him of : upon 
this he called aloud to the boat, and bid bis men bring 
the things aihore that were for the governor ; and indeed 
it was a prefent, as if I had been one, not that was to be 
carried alongr with them, but as if £ had been to dwell 
upon the iiland itill, and thfcy were to go withtout me. 

Firft, he had brought me a cafe of bottles full of ex-*. 
«ellent cordial waters^ iix large bottles of Madeira wine : 
the bottles held two quarts a-piece ; two pounds of ex- 
cellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the Ihip's 
beef, and {\x. pieces of pork, with a bag of pcafe, and 
about an hundred weight of bifcuit. 

He brought me alfo a box offugar,.a box of flour, a 
bag full ot lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice^ and 
abundance of other things : but befides tliefe, and what 
was a thoufand times more ufeful to me, he brought me 
^x clean new Ihirts, fix very good neckcloths, two pair 
of gloves, one pair oflhoes, an hat, and one pair of. 
ftockings, and a very good fuit of clothes of his own, 
which had been worn but very little ; in a word, he 
clothed me from head to foot, 

Jt was a very kind and agreeable prefent, as any one 
may imagine, to one in my circumftances ; but never was; 
any thing in the world of that kind fo unpleafant, awk- 
ward, and uneafy, as it was to me to wear fuch clothes at 
• their firft putting on. 

After thefe ceremonies pail, and after all his good 
things were brought into my little apartment, we began 
to confult whkt was to be done with the prifoners wxs

venture to take them away with us or no, efpccially two 
of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and refrac- 
tory to the laft degree ; and the captain faid he knew 
they were fuch rogues, that there was no obliging them ', 
and if he did carry them away, it mud be in irons, as 
malefadlors, to be delivered over to juftlce at the firit 
• Englifh colony he could come at; and I found that the 
captain himfelf was very anxious about it. 

Upon this, I told him, that if hedcfired it, I durft under- 
take to bring the two men he fpoke of, to make it their own 
xequeft that he ihould leave them upon the ifland : 1 fhould 
be very glad of that, fays the captain, with all my heart. ' 

Well, faid J, I will lend for them, and talk with thera 
for you: fo 1 can fed Friday and the two hoftages, for 
they were now difcharged, their comrades having per- 
formed their proraife ; 1 fay, 1 caufed them to go to the 
cave and bring up tl>e five men, pinioned as they were, 
to the bower, and keep them there till I came. 

After fome time, I came thither dreffed in my new^ 
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being alt 
met, and the captain with me, i caufed the men to be 
brought before me, and I told them I had had a full ac- 
coHi^t of their vlllanous beha%^iour to the captain, and 
how they had run uway with the fhip, and were prepar- 
ing to commit farther robberies ; but that providence 
had enfnared them in their own ways, anxl that they were 
fillen into the pit which they had digged for others. 

I let them know, that by ray diredion the fhip had 
been feized, that (he lay now in the road, and th^y might 
fee by and by that their new captain had received the 
reward of his villaiby ; for that they might fee hinv 
hanging at the yard-arm. 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to 
fay why I (hould not execute them as parties taken in 
the fadt, as by my commiilion they could not doubt I 
had authority to do. 

One of them anfwered in the name of the reft, that 
they had nothing to fay hut this. That when they were ' 
taken, the captain promifed them their livesy and they 
humbly implored ray mercy ; but 1 told theqi I knew 
not what mercy to (hew them ; for,, as for myfelf, I had

for the captain, he could not carry them to En;gland, 

other than as prifoners in irons to be tried for mutiny,. 

and running away with the iliip ; the confequcnce of 

which, they mull needs know, would be the gallows ; 

fo that I could not tell which was bed for them, unlefs 

they had a mind to take their fate in the ifland, if they 

d.dired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it ; 

1 had Ibme inclination to give them their lives, if they 

thought they could fhift on iliore. They feemed very> 

thankful for it, faid they would much rather venture to 

ftay there than to be carried to England to be hanged ; 

fo I left it on that iffue* 

- However, the captain feemed to make fome difficulty* 
of it, as if he durft not leave them there: upon this, 1 
feemed a little angry with the captain, and told him 
that they were my prifoners, not his ; and that feeing I 
had offered them fo much favour, 1 would be as good as 
iny word ; and that if he did not think fit to Confent to 
it,- 1 would fet them at liberty as I found them ; and if 
he did not like that,, he might take them again, if he 
could catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac- 
cordingly fet them at liberty, and bade them retire into 
the woods, to the place whence they came, and 1 would' 
leave them fome fire-arms, fome ammunition, and fomc 
directions how they fhould live very \yell, if they 
thought fit. 

Upon this, I prepared to go onhoajd the ihip, but told 
tbe captain, that 1 would itay that night to prepare my 
things, and aefired him to go on board in the meantime, 
and keep all right in the fhip, and fend the boat on fhore 
the next day for me ; ordermg him, in the meantime, tO' 
caufe the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at 
the yard-arm, that the fe men might fee him, 
. ' When the captain was gone, 1 fent for the men up ta 
me to my apartment, and entered- ferioully into difcourfe 
with them of their circumiVances : I told them I thought 
they had made a right choice ; and if the captain earned 
them awTiy, they would certainly be hanged, I fhewed 
them their captam hanging at the yard-arm of the.ihip,^ 
aad told them they had aothing lefs to expetft,.

I left thcit^ my tirf-arm«, vi*. five mufquets, three 
R^wlu"):; ;>ieccsi» a«d three Iwords. I had about a barrel 
of powder leit ; for after the firit year or two 1 ufed but

way 1 mana^^od the |gv>ats, and dire<^ons to milk and 
fatten thcm% to make both butter aadcheefe. ^ 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own ftory ; 
and told them^ 1 would pi'evai) with the captain to leavq

feed, w*hioh 1 told them the bag of jieas which the cap- 
t,un had brought me to eat, and bade them be lure to 
fow an<l iijcreafe them% 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and 
went on board the (hip ; we prepared immediately to fail, 
but did not weigh that night : the next morning, early, 
two of the live men came fwimming to the (hip's fide^ 
and, making a moft lamentable complaint of the other 
three, begged to be taken into the fhip, for God*s fake, 
for they diould be murdered ; and begged the captain to 
take them on board, tho* he hanged them immediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power with- 
out me;- but afier fomc difficulty, and after their folemn 
promise of amendment, they were taken on board, and 
were fome time after foundly whipped and pickled ; after 
which they proved very honed and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, I went with the boat on (ho re,

telling them, that if it lay in my way to fend a veffel to 
take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this illand, I carried on board 
for reliques the great goat's (kih cap I had made, my 
umbrella, and one of my parrots ; alfo I forgot not to 
take the money 1 formerly mentioned, which had lain 
by me fo long ufelefs, that it was grown rufty, or tar- 
niflied, and could hardly pafs for iilver, till it had been 
a little rubbed and handled ; and alfo the money I found 
in the wreck* of the Spaniih fhip. 

And thus I left the illand the nineteenth of December, 
as 1 found by the (hip's account, in the year 1686, after I 
had been upon it eight-arid-twenty years, two months, 
and nineteen days, being delivered from the fecond cap- 
tivity the fame day of the month that I firll made my 
tfcape in\. the Barco-lango, from among the Moors of 
Sallee. 

In this veffel, after a long voyage, I arrived in Eng?- 
land the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, havifig 
been thirty and five years abfent. 

When I came to England, I was a perfect ftranger to 
all the world, as if I had never beeii knowiL.there : my 
bencfador, and faithful fteward, whom 1 had left in 
truft with my nioney, was alive, hut had had great mil- 
fortunes in the world, was become a widow the fecond 
time, and very low in the world : I made her eafy as to 
what Ihe owed me, alTuring her I would give her no 
trouble-; but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her for- 
mer care and faithfulnefs to me, 1 relieved her as my 
little Hock would afford, which at that time would in- 
deed allow me to do but little for her; but I alTured her 
I would never forcret her former kindnefs to me : nor did 
1 forget her, when I had lufncient to help her, as ihall 
be obl'erved in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorklhire ; but my father 
was dead, and niy mother, and all the family extindl, 
except that I found two lifters, and two of the children 
of one of my brothers : and as 1 had lopg ago been given 
over for dead, there had been no provilion made for me, 
fo that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or affilt 
me ; and thtit little money 1 had, would not do fo much 
for me, as to fettling in the world. 

I met

2bB ADVENTUAES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did 
not expedl ; and this was, that the mafter of the ihip, 
whom I had fo happily delivered, and by the fanne means 
faved the (hip and cargo, having given a very handfome 
account to the owners of the manner how I had faved 
the lives of the men, and the ihip, they invited me to 
meet them, and fome other merchants concerned, and 
all together made me a very handfome compliment upon 
that fubjedl, and aprefent of almoft twp hundred pounds 
llerlinfj. 

But after making' feveral reflexions upon the circum- 
ilances of my life, and how little way this would go to- 
ward fettling me in the world, I refolved to go toLifbon, 
and fee if 1 might not come by fome information of the 
ttatc of my plantations in the Brafils, and what was be- 
come of my partner, who, I had reafon to fuppofe, had 
fome years now given me over for dead. 

With this view I took (hipping for Lifbon, where I ar- 
rived in April following, my man Friday accompanying , 
me very honeftly in all thefe ramblings, ^nd proving a 
mofl faithful fervant upon all occaiions. 

When I came to Lifbon, I found out by enquiry, and 
to my particular fatisfadlion, my old friend the captain 
of the fhip, who firft took me up at fea, off the fhore of 
Africa : he was now grown old, and had left off the 
fea, having put his fon, who was far from a young man, 
into bis (hip, and who ftill ufed the Brafil trade. The 
old man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly knew 
him; but I foon brought' my felf to his remembrance, 
when I told him who I ^yas. 

After fome paflionate expreilions of our old acquaint- 
ance, 1 enquired, you may be fure, after my plantation, 
and my partner : the old man told me he had not 
been in the Braiils for about nine years ; but that he 
could alfure me, that when .he came away, my partner 
was living ; but the ^ruftees whom I had joined with him 
to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that, 
however, he believed that I would have a very good 
account of the improvement of the plantation ; for 
that, upon the gerieral belief of my being caft away and 
drowned, my truftees had given m the account of the 
produce of my part of the plantation^ to the procurator

Fifcal ; who had appropriated it, in cafe I never canie to 

claim it, one third to the King, zxii two thirds to the 

raonaftery of St. Auguftine, to be expended for the benefit 

of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the 

Catholic faith ; but that if I -appeared, or any one for me, 

to claim the inheritance, it would be reftored; only that 

tKeinaprovement, or Annual production, being diftributed 

to charitable ufes, could not be reftored ; but he aflured 

me, that the lleward of the king's revenue (from lands J 

and the provedore, or fteward of the monaftry, had 

t;jlcen great care all along, that the incumbent,^ that is 

to fay, my partner, gave every yeJir a faithful account of 

the produce, Qf which they received duly my moiety, 

I aiked him, if he knew to what height of improve- 
ment he had brought the plantation ; and whether he 
thought it might be worth looking after : or whether, 
on my going thilher, I ihould meet with no obftruftion 
to my pofleffing my j lift right in the moiety* 
• He told me, h^ could not tell exa(5ily to what degree 
tlie plantation was impr6ved : but this he knew, that my 
partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but 
one half of it ; and that, to the belt of his remenfibrance 
lie had heard, that the king's third of my part, which 
^as, it feems, granted away to forae other monaftry, 
or religious houfe, amounted to above two hundred 
nioidores a year ; that, as to my being reftored to a 
qwiet pofteuion of it, there was no queftion to be made 
ot that, my partner being alive to witnefs my title, and 
niy name being alfo inrolled in the regifter of the country. 
Alfo he told me, that the furvivors of my two truftecs 
were very fair honeft people, and very wedt4iy, and he 
believed 1 would not only have their aiTiftance for put- 
tmg me in poffeffion, but would find a very coniiderable 
f«m of money in their hands, for my account, being the 
producfe of the farm, while their fathers held the truft 
and before it was given up, as above, which, as he re- 
membered, was. about twelve yeai"s. 

1 Ihewed myfelf a little cbnceraed and uneafy at this 
account, and enquired of the old captain, how it came 
to pafs, ^hat the truftets fhould thus difpole of my effects, 
"^hen he knew, that I had made my will, had made 
liim, the Portuguefe captain, my uiiiverlal heir, &c.

He told me, that was true ; but that, as there was nO 
proof of my beinof.dead, he could not a<5l as executor, 
until fome certain account (hould come of my death ; 
and that, befides, he was not willing to intermeddle with 
a thing fo remote : that it was true, he had regiftercd my 
will, and put in his claim ; and could he have given 
any account of my being dead or alive, he would have 
adtcd by procuration, and taken pofleffion of the ingenio, 
(fo they called the fugar-houfe) and had given hisfon, 
^vho was now at the Brafils, order to do it. 

But, fays the old man, I have one piece of news to 
tell you, which perhaps may not be fo acceptable to you 
as the reft ; and that is, that believing you were loil, and 
all the world believing fo alfo, your partner and trulteej 
did offer to account to me in your name, for fix or eight 
of the firft years of profit, which I received ; but there 
being at that time, fays he, great difburiements for in- 
creafmg the works, bujlding an ingenio, and \)Mying 
Haves, it did not amduxjtto near fo much as afterward* 
it produced: however, fays the old man,- I fiiall gi^P 
ou a true accouilt of what I have received in all, and 
ow I have difppfed Of it. 

After a few days farther conference with this ^niitnt 
friend, he brought me art account of the fix fiift years 
Jncomc of my plantation, figned by my partner, and th^ 
jnerchant'« truftees, being always delivered in goods, 
viz. tobacco in roll, and fugar in chefts, befides rum, 
melafl!es, &c. which is the confequence of a fugar-work; 
and I found ty this account, that evefy year the income 
confideraWj: iiicreafed : but, as above, the difburlement 
being large, the fum at firft was fmall : however, the 
old man let me fee, that he was debtor to me 470 moi- 
<lores of gold, befides 90 chefis of fugar, and 15 double 
rolls of tobacco, which were ioft in his fiiip, he hav- 
ing been fhipwrecked coming home to Lifbon, about 
eleven years after my leaving the place. 
- The good man then began to complain of his misfor* 
tunes, and how he had been obliged to make ufe of m^ 
money to recover his lofles, and buy him a ihare in a 
new fiiip: ho\yever, ray old friend, fays he, you mail

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me two 
hundred Portugal moidores in gold ; and giving me the 
writings of his title to the (hip which his fon was gone to 
the Brafils in, of which he was a quarter part owner, ^nd 
bis Ton another, he put them both in my hands for lecu-* 
ritj of the reft. 

1 was too much moved with the honefty and kindncfs 
of the poor man to be able to bear this ; and remem- 
bering what he had done for me, how he had taken me* 
up at fea, and how generoudy he had ufed me on all oc- 
cafions, and particularly how (incere a friend he was 
now to me, 1 caiild hardly refrain weeping at what htf 
faid to me : Therefore firft I afked him if his circum- 
ftances admitted him to fpare fo much, money at that 
time, and if it would not ftreighten him ? He told me 
he could not fay but it might ftreighten him a little; 
but, however, it was my money, and I might want it 
more than he. 

Every thing the good man faid was full of afFedlion, 
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he fpoke. Jn 
ihort, I took one hundred of the moidores, and called for 
a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them; then I 
returned him the refl, and told him, if ever I had poffeflion 
of the plantation, I would return the other to him alfo,, 
as indeed 1 afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of 
fale of his part in his fon's (hip, I would not take it by 
any means ; but that if 1 wanted the money, 1 tbuud he 
Was honeft enough to pay me ; and if I did not, but 
came to receive what he gave me reafon to exped, I would 
never have a penny more from him. 

When this was pafled, the old man began to afk me, 
if he (hould put me in a method to make my claim to 
my plantation. I told him, I thought to go over to it 
niyfelf I He faid I might do fo if I pleafed ; but that if I 
did not, there were ways enough to fecure my right, 
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my ufe; and 
as ther6 were ihips in the riverof Lifbon, juft ready to go 
away to Brafd, he made me enter my name in a public 
Tegifter, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that 
I was alive, and that I was the fame perfon who 
took up the land for the planting of the faid plantation

piovidence of heaven, which difpofes all things, it was 
owing to him ; and that it now lay on m^ to reward him, 
which I would do an hundred fold : So I iirft returned to 
him the hundred moidores 1 had received of him; then 
1 fent for a notary, and caufcd him to draw up a gene- 
ral releafe or difcharge for the 470 moidores, which he 
had acknowledged he owed me, in the fulleft and iirmeft 
manner poffible ; after which, i caufed a procuration to 
be drawn, impowering him to be my receiver of the 
annual profits of my, plantation, and appointing my 
partner to account to him, and make the returns by 
the ufual fleets to him in my name ; and a claufe in 
the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to hii^ ' 
during his life, out of the effects ; and 6o moidores a 
year to his'fon after him, for his life ; and thus I re- 
quited my old man. 

£ was now to coniider which way to fleer my courfe 
ijext, and what to do with the ellate that Providence 
had thus put into my hands ; and, indeed, I had more 
care upon my head now than 1 had in my filent ftate 
of life in the ifland, where 1 wanted nothirig but what 
I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ; whereas I 
had now a great charge upon me, and my bufineik was 
how to fecure it : 1 had never cave to hide my money 
in, nor a place w^here it might lie without lock or ktf 
tiH it grew mouldy and tarnifhed before any body would 
meddle with it : on the contrary, I knevir not , where to 
put it, or whom to trull with it ; my old patron, the 
captain, indeed, was honefl, and that was the only rC' 
fu^e I had. 

in the next place,' my intereft in the Bralils feemed to 
fummon me thither; but now I could not tell how to 
think of going thither till I had fettled my affairs, and 
left my effects in fomefafe hands behind me : at firft I 
thought of my old friend, the widow, who I knew was 
l^onell, and would be jull to me; but then (he was in 
years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be 
ip debt ; fo that, in a word, I had no way but to go back 
to Englan^ myfelf, and take my effedls with me.

dealings, and the offer of the 872 moidores, which was 
undifpofed of, which I delired might be given, 600 to 
the monaftery, and 3/2 to the poor, as the prior fhould 
cUre6t, defiring the good Padres prayers for me, and the 
like. 

Iwrotenext a letter of thanks to my two truftfees, 
with all the acknowledgment thatfo much juftice and^ 
iionefty called for ; as for fending them any prefent, 
they were far above having any occafion for it. ^ 

La-itly, I wrote to ray, partner, acknowledging his in-* 
duftry m th© improving the plantation, and his inte- 
grity in increafing the (lock oF the works, giving hiim 
inltrudlions for his future government of my part, ac-' 
cording to the powers I had left with my old patron, to- 
whom I deiired him to fend whatever become due to 
me, till he ihould hear from me more particularly ; al* 
Turing him, that it was my intention, not only to come 
to him, but to fettle myfelf there for the remainder- of 
my life : To this I added a very handfome prefent of 
lome Italian filks for his wife and tw'o daughters, for 
fuch the captain's fon informed me he had; with two 
pieces of fine Engliili broad-cloth, the bell I could get 
in Liibon, five pieces of black bays, a^d fome Flanders 
lace of a good value. 

tlaving thus fettled my affairs, fold my cargo, and 
turn'd all my efiedls in good bills of exchange, my 
nex^ dtfiiculty was,, which way to go to England : I had 
been va ecu domed enough to the fea, and yet I had a 
ftr^inge averl\pn to go to England by lea^^ that time i 
and, though Pcould give no reafon for it, ytt , the diffi- 
culty increafed upon me lb much, that though I had 
once fhipp'd my baggage in_order to go, y^t I alter'd 
my mind, ar^d that not once, but two or three times. 

.It is true, I had been very unfortunate by fea, and 
this might be one of the reafons: But let lio man

the captain ; I fay, two of thefe ililps mifcarried ; viz. 
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cad 
away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people 
<irowned excfept three ; fo that in either of thefe vefTels I 
had been made miferable, and in which mod, it was^ 
hard to fay. 

Having been thus harrafTed in ray thoughts, ray old 
pilot, to whom 1 communicated every thing, prefTei:! me 
cameftly not to go to fea ; but either tp go by land to 
the Groyne, and crofe over the bay of Bifcay to Rochelle, 
from whence it vvas but an eafy and fafe journey by land 
to Paris, and fo to Calais and Dover ; or to go up tot 
Madrid, and fo all the way by land through France. 

In a word, 1 was fo prepoifeffed againft ray going by 
fea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that 1 refolved 
to travel all the way by land; wh'rch, as I was not in 
hafte, and did not value the charge, was by much the 
pieafanter way; and to make it more fo, my old captain 
hrouglu an Engliih gentleman, the fon of a merchant' 
iti Litbon, who was willing to travel with me : after 
which, we picked up two who were Englifh and mer- 
chants aHo, and two young Portuguefe gentlemen, the ' 
laft goiqg to Paris only ; fo that we Were in all fix of us> 
and five fervants, the two merchants, and the two l^ortu- 
guefe, contenting themfelves with one fervant between 
two, to fave the charge; and as for me, I go^ an Eng- 
lifh failor to travel with me as a -fervant, beSdes my man 
Friday, who was too much a ftranger to be capable o£* 
Hipplying the place of a fervant upon the road. 

In this manner I fet out for Liiboti : and our compa- 
jiy being all very well mounted and armed, we made a 
little tropp, whereof they did me the honour to call ma # 
captain, as well becaufe I was the oldeft man, as be-

of the whole journey.

but it being the latter part of the fummer» we hadendS" 
awaj, and fet out from Madrid about the middle of Oc- 
tober : but when we came to the edge of Navarre, wc 
wear alarmed at fcveral towns on the way, with an ac- 
count that fo much fnow was fallen on the French iide of 
the mountains, that feveral travellers were obliged to 
come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an 
extreme hazard, to pafs on. 

When we came to Pameluna itfelf, we found it fo in- 
deed ; and to me that had been always ufed to an hot 
climate, and indeed to countries where we could fcarce 
bear any clothes on, the cold wap unftifFerable ; nor, 
indeed, was it more plentiful than it was furpriiing, to 
come but ten days before out of the Old Callile, where 
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and im- 
mediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains, 
. fo very keen, fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, and 
to endanger benumbing and perifhing of our fingers and 
toes, was very ftrahge. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the 
mountains all covered with fnow, and felt cold weather, 
, which he had never feen or felt before in his life. 

To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna, 
it continued fnowing with fo much violence, and fo long, 
that the people faid winter was come before its time, 
and the roads which were difficult before, were now 
quite impaiTable : in a word, the Ihow lay in fome 
places too thick for us to travel ; and being not hard 
frozen, as is^th^ cai'e in northern countries, there was no 
going without being in danger of being buried alive 
every fiep : we fiaid no Icfs thati twenty days at Pampc* 
luna; when (feeing the winter coming on, and no like- 
lihood of its being better, for it was theTevereil winter 
vH over Europe that had been known in many years) . 
J propofed that we (hould all j?o away to Fontarabia, 
and there taking (hipping for Sourdeaux, which was a 
very little voyage. 

JBut while we were coniidering this, there came in 
four French gentlemen, who, having been flopped on the 
French fide of the pafles, as we were on the Spanifh, had 
found out a guide, who, traverfing the country near the 

bead 






ABVXKTOIIES OF HQBIKSON CRUSOE; 269 

liead of Languedoc, had brought them over the moun- 
tains by fuch ways, that they were not much incommoded 
with the fnow ; and where they met with inow in any 
quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to bear 
them and their horfes. 

We fent for this guide, who told us, he would under- 
take to carry us the fame way^ with no hazard from the 
fnow, provided we were armed fufficiently -to protedt us 
from wild bea(^s; for, he faid, upon thele great fnows, 
it was frequent for fome wolves to ihew themfelves at the 
foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of 
food, the ground being covered with fnow : we told him 
we were well eliough prepared for fuch creatures as they 
were, if he would infure us from a kind of two legged 
wolves, which we were told we were in mod danger 
from, efpecially on the French (ide of the mountains. 

He fatisfi'ed us there was no dangler of that kind in the 
way that we were to go ; fo we readily agreed to follow 
him, as'did alfo twelve other gentlemen, with their 
fervants,! Ibme French, fome Spanifli, who, as i faid, 
had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back 

again- 

Accordingly we all fet ou^from Pampeluna, with our 
guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed, I 
"Uras furprifcd, when, inftead of going forward, he came 
dire<^ly back with us, oa the fame road that we came 
from Madrid, above twenty miles ; when having pafled 
two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found 
ourfelves in a warm climate again, where the country was 
pleafant, and no fnow to be feen ; but on a fudden, turn- 
ing to the left, he approached the mountains another 
way ; and though it is true, the hills and the precipices 
looKed dreadfully, yet he made fo many tours, fuch 
meanders, and led us by fuch winding ways, we infen- 
fibly pafled the height of the mountains, without being 
much incumb<^red with the fnow ; and all on a fudden 
he fliewed us the pleafant fruitful provinces of Langue- 
doc and GafccMgne, all green and fiourifiiing ; though 
indeed they were at a great didance, and we had fome 
rough way to pafs yet. 

We were a little uneafy however, when we found it 
ihowed one whole day and a nighty fo idA, that we 

» 3 ' <:«viJA 



2/0 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CR)CSOZ» 

could not travel ; but he bid us be eafy, we (hould fooxi 
be pad it all ; we found, indeed, that we began <o de^ 
fcend every day, and to come more north than before; 
end fo, depenxling upon our gu^Ie, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when our guide 
being fomething before us, and not juft in fight, out 
rufhed three nx>n(lrous wolves, and after them a bear, 
out of an hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood ; two of 
the wolves flew upon the gujde, and had he been half a 
mile before us, he had been devoured indeed, before/wc 
could have helped him : one of them faftened upon hi* 
' horf-, and the other attacked the man with that violence', ^ 
that he had not time, or not prefence of mind enough, 
to draw his piftol, but hallooed and cried out to us mod 
lullily : my man Friday being next to me, I bade him ride 
up, and fee what was' the matter : asfoo'n asP'rlday came 
in fight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O 
matter ! O mafter I But like a bold fellow, rode directly 
up to the man, and with his piftol ihot the wolf tjiat at- 
tacked him into the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man 
Friday ; for he, having been ufed to that kind of crea- 
ture in his country, had no fear upon him, but went 
clofe up to him, and (hot him, as above; whereas any 
of us would have fired, at a farther diilance, and have 
perhaps either miffed the Wolf> or endangered fiiooting 

the man. . 

But it was enough to have terrified a bokler man than 
J, an<l indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with 
the noil'e of Friday's piltol, we heard on both (ides the 
dirmalletl bowlings of wolves, apd the noife redoubled 
by the echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there 
had been a prodigious muhitude 'of them; and perhaps 
indeed there was not fuch a few, as that we had nacauie 
of apprehenfions. ' 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, 
that had fattened upon the horfe^ left him immediately, 
and fled,, having happily fafiened upon his head, where 
the boffes of the bridle had ftiick iu his teeth,, fo that 
he had not done him mCich hurt : the man, indeed^ was 
mod hurt : for the raging creature had bit him twice, 
once on the arm, and the other time a little above hi)

tne'e ; and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the 
diforder of the horl'e, when Friday came up, and {hot 
the wolf. ^ 

It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the noife of Friday's pif- 
tol we all mended our pace, and' rid up as fait as the 
way (which was very difficult) would give us leave, to 
fee what was the matter : as foon as we came clear of the 
trees, which blinded us before, we faw plainly what had 
been the cafe, and how Friday had difengaged the poor 
guide ; though we did not prefently difcern what kind of 
creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed fo hardily, and in fuch 
a furprifing manner, as that which followed between 
Friday and the 'bear,, which gave us all (though at fir ft 
we were furprifed and afraid for him) the greatell di- 
vcriion imaginable: as the bear is an heavy, clumly 
creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, which is 
fwift and light, fo he has two particular qualities, which 
geticrally are the rule of his a6tions ; firft, as to men, 
•who are not his proper prey, 1 fay not his proper prey, 
-becaufe, though J cannot fay what exceflive hunger might 
do, which was now their cafe, the grotmd being all co- 
vered with fnow ; yet as to men, he does not ufually at- 
tempt them, unlefs they firft attack. him : on the contra- 
.ry, if you metit.hi'm in the woods, if you do not meddle 
with him, he won't ine^dle with you ; yet then you muft 
take care to be very civil to him, and give hinj the road ;

for the man was both hart and frighted, and indeed the 
Jail more than the firft; when, on a fuddcn i>ire efpied 
the bear come otit of the wood, and a very moniirous one 
it was,, the biggeft by far that ever I faw : we were all 
a little furprifed when wi faw him ; but when P>idajr 
faw him, it was eafy to fee joy and courage in the fel- 
low's countenance : O ! O ! O ! fays Friday, three times, 
pointing to him, O maftey I you give me te leave, mc 
ihakee te hand with him*, mfc.makee you good laugh. 

I was furprifed to fee the fellow fo pleafcd : You fool, 
you, faid I, he will cat you up, Eatee me up ! eatec mc 
up ! fays Friday, twice over again ; me eatee him up ; 
me makee you good laugh : you all llay here, me ihew 
you good laugh : fo down he ilts, and gets his boots off 
in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we call 
the flat ihoes they wear) and which he had in his poc- 
ket, gives my other fervant his horfe, and, with his gun, 
away he flew, fwift like the wind. 

The bear was walking foftly on, and offered to meddle 
with' nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to 
him, as if the bear could underlland him : Hark ye ! harfc 
ye ! fays Friday, me fpeakee wit you. We followed at a 
djftance ; for now being come down to the Galcoignefidc 
of the mountains, we were eijtered a vail great forcfl, ^ 
where the country was plain, and pretty oj>en, though 
many trees in it fcatte red here and there. 

FViday, who had, as we fay, the heels of the beaf, 
came up w^th him quickly, and ta|cet up. a great ftone, 
and throws at him, and hit him ju^ on th^ head ; but 
did hiqci no more harm than if he had thrown it againft 
a wall;»but it anfwered Friday's end; for the rogue 
was fo void of fear, that he did^i^ purely to m^ce 
tb^ bear follow him» and ihew us ^me laugh^ as he 
tailed it. y '

kttA takes his ^ourfe, as if he iran^ towards us^or help; 
fo we all refolved to fire at once upon the bear, and de- 
liver my man ; though I was angry at him heartily for 
bringing the bear bad^ upon uSj when he was going 
' . about 



ADVENTURtS OF EQUINSON CRUSOE. 275 

about his own buimcfs another way ; and efpecially I 
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then 
run away; and 1 called out, ^ou dog, laid I, is this 
your making us laugh ? Come ^way, and take y9ui; 
norfe, that we may fhoot the creature. He hears me, 
and cries out, No flioot, no (hoot, ftand ftill, you get 
much laugh : and as the nimble creature ran two feet 
for the beaft's one, he turned on a I'udden on one fide 
of us, and feeing a great oak-tree, fit for his purpofe, 
he beckoned^ us to follow, and, doubling his pace, he 
gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the 
grounil, at about five or lix yards from the bottpm of 
the tree. 

The bear foon came to the tree, and we followed at 
a diflance ; the firil thing he did., he ftopt at the gun, 
fmelt to it, but let it lie, and up he fcrambles into the 
tree, climbing like a cat, though fo monftrous heavy : 
I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man^ 
and could not for my life fee any tning to laugh at yet, 
till feeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer 
to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out 
to the fmall of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got 
about half way to him : as foop as the bear got out to 
that part where the limb of the tree wa& weaker. Ha, 
fays he to us, now you fee me teachee the bear dance ; 
fo be falls a juipping, and fhaking the bough, at which 
t|ie bear began to totter, but flood flill, and began to look 
behind h^m, to fee how he fhould get back ; then indeed 
vfc did laugh heartily : bi^t Friday had not done with him 
l^y ^ great deal ; when he fees him fland fiill, he calls. 
9^1 to him again, as if he had fuppofed the bear coul4 
{peak EngUm, What, you come no farther? Pray you 
9omc farther ! So he left jumping and ihaking the 
bough ; and the bea^, jufl; as if he underflood what h^ 
isud, did con^e a little farther; then he Ml a jiimping 
9gain, and the bear flopped again. ^ 

We thought^ now wa^ a good ti^ to koock him Qn 
the head, and called to Friday to fland flill, and we 
WQU14 ihpot the bear ; but he cried out earneflly, O pray I 
O p«ay ! Qo ihopt, m^ fhoot, by aud then ; he would hav^

danced (6 much, and the bear ftood fo ticklifh, that we 
had laughinjx cnouorh indeed,' but dill could not ima£ine 
what the fellow would do ; for ndt we thought he de- 
pended upon (haking the bear off; and we found the 
bear was too cunning for that too ; for he would not get 
out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fad with 
bis great broad claws and feet, fo that we could riot ima- 
gine what would be the end of it, and ^where the jeft 
would be at hift. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for feeing the 
bear cling fall to the bough, apd that he would not be 
l)erfuaded to come any farther ; Well, well, faid* Friday ;, 
you no come farther, me go, me go ; yoa no come to 
me, me come to yon : and upon this he goes out to the 
^fmalleilendof'the bough where k would bend with his 
weight, and gently lets himfelf down by it, diding down 
the bough, till he came near enough to jump down on- 
his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up and 
Hands fiHI. 

Well, faid I to him, Friday, what will you do now? 
Why do not you (hoot him ? No (hoot, fays Friday, no 
yet, me ihoot now me no kill ; me ftay, give you one 
more laugh ; and indeed fo be did, as you will fee pre- 
iently ; for when the bear faw his enemy gone, he comes 
back from the bough where he ftood, but did it mighty, 
leifurely, looking behind him every ftep, and coming 
backward till he got into the body of the tree : then,, 
with the fame hinder end foreraoft, he came down the 
tree, grafprng it with his claws, and moving one foot at 
a time very leifurely ; at this juniflure, and juft before he 
could fet his hind feet upon the ground, Friday' ftepped' 
clofe to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his 
ear, and (hot him as dead as a fione. 

Then the rogue turned about, to fee |f we did" not 
laugh ; and when he faw we were plealed by our looks,, 
he falld^ a laughing himfelf very loud : fo we kill bear in 
our country, fays Friday. So you kill them faid 1, ^hy 
you have no guns i No, fays he, no guns, but ihpot great 
much long arrow. \ ' 

This was, indeed, a good diveriion to us ; but we 
■were Hill in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt^ 
and What to do we hardly knew ; the bowling of wolves

ran much in my head ; and indeed, except the noife I 
once heard on the ihore of Africa; bf which I have faid 
fomething already, I never heard any thing^ that filled 
me with fo much horror. 

Thefe things, and the approach of night, called ui 
ofF, or elfe, as Friday 'would li^ve h^, us we ihould cer- 
tainly have takeri the fkiri of this monftrous creatur^ 
oWy which was worth faving; but we had three leagues 
to go ; and our guide haflened^us^ fo we left him, and 
•went forward on our journey. - , 

The ground was ftili eotered with fhdw, though not 
fo deep and dangerous as oh the mountains ; and the ra- 
venorSs creatures, as we heard afterwards, were! come 
down into 'the foreft, and plain country, prefTcd by 
hunger, to ^ttk for food ; and had done a great deal of 
mifchief in the villages, where they furprrfed the coun>- 
jtry people, killed a great many of their fheep and horfcs, 
and fome people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pafs, of 'vvhich our 
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the 
country, we fhould find them there ; and this was a 
fmall plain, furrounded with woods on every ^^^ and 
a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to pafs to 
get through the wood, and then we fhould come to the 
village where we were to lodge. 

If was within half an hour of fun-fet when we en- 
tered the firft wood ; and a little after fan-fct when we 
came into the plain. We met with nothing rn the firft 
wood, except that, in a little plain within the wood,^ 
which was not above two furlongs over, we faw five 
great wolves crofs the road, full ipeed one after ano- 
ther, as if they had been in chafe of fome prey, and 
had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were 
gone, and out of fight, in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched 
faint-hearted fellow, baSiftus keep in a ready pofture; for 
he believed there were more wolves a coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; 
but we faw no more wolves till we came through that 
wood, which was near half a league, and entered the 
plain; as foon as we came into the plain » we had oc- 
caiion enough to look about us. The iirfl objeA we met

U'hich the wolves had killed, and at lead a dozen of

picking of his bones rather ; for they had eaten up all 
the fiem belbre. . 

. We did not think fit to difturb them at their feaft, 
neither did they take much notice of us ; Friday would 
b^ve let fly at them, but I woul4 not fuff'er him by any 
mean^; for -I found we were like to have more buiinefs 
upon our hands than we were aware of. . We were 
po^ l^alf gone over the plain, but we began to hear the 
i^olve^ howl in the woods, on our left, in a frightful 
m^nneif; and prefently after we faw about an hundred 
f oming pn directly towards us» all in a body, and moft 
of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up 
by experienced ofHcers : I Icarce Jcnew in what manr 
neif to receive 'them ; but foimd, to draw ourfelves 
in a clofe line, was the only way : fo we formed in 
^ ipomept : but, that yft nught not have too much 
j^nteryal, I ordered, that only every other man. fhpuld 
fir^; ai;id that the others, whp.had not fired, fhould 
fiand res^dy to give them a fecond volley immediately,

This gave us leifurc to charge our pieces again, and 
that we might lofe no time, we kept doing; but we 
had but little more than loaded our fuiils, and put our- 
felves into rcadinefs, when we heard a terrible noife 
in the fame wood, on our left ; only that it was farther 
onward the fame way we were to go. 

The night was .coming on, and the night began to 
be dufky, which made it the worfe on our lide ; butf 
the noife increa(ing, we could ealily perceive, that it 
*was the howling and yelling *of thoie . helliih creatures; 
and, on a fudden, we perceived two or three troops of 
"wolves, on our left, one behind us, and one on our 
front ; fo that we feemed to b^ furrounded with them ; 
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept o\ir 
-vrsLj forward, as fail as we could make our horfes go^ 
which, the way being very rough, was only a good 
large trot ; and in this manner we only came in view 
of the entrance of the wood, through which we were 
to pa,% at the farther iide of the plain ; but we wei:e 
greatly furprifed, when, coming near the lane, or pafs, 
w^e faw a confafed number of wolves Handing jufl at 
<the entrance. 

On a fudden, at another opening of the wood, we 
heard' the noiie of a gun ; and looking that way, out 
ruihed an horfe, with a faddle and a bridle on him, ily« 
ing like the wind, and i^xteen or~fcventeen wolves after 
bim full fpeed ;^ indeed the horfe had the heels of them ; 
but as we fuppofe, that he could not hold it at that rate^ 
we doubted not but they would get up with him at lad; 
-and no queftion but they did. ' 

Here we had a moft horrible iight ; for, riding up to 
^he entrance where the horfe came out, we found the 
- carcafe of another horCe, and of two men devoured \>V 
tbefe ravenous creatures, and of one the man was no . 
^oubt the fame whom we heard fire a gun ; for there 
lay a gun juft by hipi fired off*, but^ as to the man, his

entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, thertf 
lay Ibme large tiniber-trees, which had been cut dowa 
the fummer before, and I fuppofc lay there for carriage : 
I^ drew my little troop in among thcfe trees, and pla- 
cing ourfelves in a line behind one long tree, I advHed 
them all to alight, and, Iceeping that tree before ufe, for 
a bread- work, to (land in a triangle, or three fronts^ 
inclofiDg our horfes in the centre. 

We did fo, and it was well we did ; for never was a 
more furious charge than .the creatures made upon us in 
this place : they came on us with a growling kind of a 
noife^ and mounted the piece of timber ( which, as I 
faid, was our bread- work, ) as if, they were only rufhing, 
upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs, it feems, was 
principally occafioned by their feeing our horfes behind 
us, which was the prey they aimed at : - 1 ordered our 
men to fire as before, every other man ; and they took 
their aim fo fure, that indeed they killed feveral of the 
wolves at the fird volley ; but tnere was a necefiity to 
keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils^ 
thofe behind pu(hing on thofe before. 

When we had fired our fecond volley of our fufik^ 
we thought they flopped a little, and I hoped they would' 
have gone otf, but it was but a momei^t, for others came 
forward again; fo we fired our volleys of our pidols, 
.and I beUeve, in thefe four firings, we killed feventeen 
or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many ; yet tkey

reft were fo frighted with the light, which the night, 
for now it was very near daric, made more terribfle, 
that they drew back a little. 

Upon whjch I ordered our laft piftols to be fired off ia 
one volley, and after that we gave a (bout ; upon this, 
the wo lyes turned tail, and we fallkd immediately upon 
near twenty lame ones, which we found ftruggling on 
the ground, and fell a cutting them with our fwords, 
-which ^anfwered our expedtation ; for the crying and 
howling they made were better underftood by their fel- 
lows ; fo that they fled, and left us* 

We had, firft and laft, killed about threefcore of 
them ; and had it been day-light, we had killed niany 
more: the field of battle being thus cleared, we madte 
forward again ; for wc had ftiH near a league to goi: 
•we heard the ravenous creatures howl. and yell in the 
•woods as we went, feveral times; and fometimes-.we 
fancied we faw fome of them, but the fjoQW dazzling 
our eyes, wc were not certain; fo in about an ho.ur 
more, we came to the town, where we were to lodge, 
'which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms ; for 
it feems, that, the >ni^ht before, the wolves and fome 
"bears bad broken into that viUage, and put them ib » 
terrible fright ; and tbey were obliged to keep guard 
nig-ht and day, but efpecially.in .the night to prefcn* 
their cattle, jand indeed their people. 
. The next morning our guide was fo ill, and his limtp 
fo fwelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that bt 
^ould go no farthcj ; fo weiiyere obliged to take a nejir 
.gui<le there, and go Jo ^Tholotjfe, where wc fouiKj-^ 
warm climate, a fruitful, pl^afant country, and no fpovvt 
no wolves, or any. thing like them : but when we tQltf 
;oujr ftory at Th9loufe, they told us it was nothing -but 
•what, was ordinary in the-gijeat Ibreft at the foot of thf^ 
fountain s,jefpeci4lly yvhca the fnow lay on the ground i 
but they inquired much what kind of a guide we 'Jiai

but we had hQ^ ^jl ]^eli'ro^e4i for it wa^ ,th(|, fight of 

the; 



,the hoffes that made the wolves ^o furious, feeing their 
J>rey ; and that at other limes they are really afraid of a 
gun ; but they being exceflive hungry, and raging on 
<that account, the cagernefe to come at the horfes had 
4nade them fenfelefs of danger; and that if we had not 
by the continued fire, and it laft by the ftratagem of 
«the train of powder, mailered them, it had been great 
eOdds but that we had been torn to pieces : whereas, had 
we been content to have, fat ftill on horfeback, and fired 
as horfemen; they would not have taken the horfes 
fo much for their own, vfhen men were on their 
backs, as otfaerwife ; and withal they told us, that at' 
lall, if we had ftood altogether, and left our horfes, 
they would have been fb eager to have devoured them, 
ihiit we might have come off fafe, efpetiaUy having 
Aur fire-arms in our hands, and being fo many in 
suaber* 

For my part, I was never fo fenfible of danger in my 
life ; for ieeing above three hundred deviU come roar- 
ing and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing 
to ihelter us, or retreat to, I gave myfelf over for loft ; 
and as it was, I believe, I ihall never care to crofs thoie 
mountains again ; 1 think I would much rather go a 
4houfand leagues, by iea, though I were fure to meet 
^th a ilorm once a week. 

I have nothing unconm;ion to take notice of, in my 
paflage through France ; nothing but what our travel- 
jeri have given an account of, with much more advantage 
than I can : I travelled from Tholoufe to Paris, and 
without any con(iderable ftay came to Calais^ an<f landed 
iafe at Dover, the fourteenth of January, after having 
liad a fevere cold feafon^ to travel in, ^ 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had 
in a little time all my new diicoyered efiate fate about 
•me, the bills of exchange, which i brought with m^ 
having been very currently paid. 

My piincipal guide, and privy counfellor, was my 

r>od antient widtow, who, in gratitude for the money 
had fent her, thought no pains too much, or care too 
great, to employ for me ; and I tnifted her fo entirely 
with every thin^, that I was perfe^ly eafy as to Ike fe* 
curity of my eftefts ; and indeed I was very happy from 

^ my 



AOV-EkTU&Ef OP ftOBINSOM C&USaC« ^t 

my begiAning, and now to tht end, jn the uni^dtted in« 
tegrity of this good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my cfie^ with 

this woman, and fetting out for Lifbon, and fo tO' the 

Braiik : but now another fcrople came in the way, and 

that was religion : for as I had entertained fome doubts 

afbout the Roman religion, even While I was abroad^ 

efpecially in my ilate of folitude, fo I knew there was 

DO going to the Brafils for me, much leis going to fettle 

there, unlefs I refolved to embrace the Roman Catholic 

religion, without any refenre ; except on the other hand 

I refolved to be a facrifice to ray principles, be a martyr 

for religion, and die in the inquiiition ; fo I reiblved to 

ftay at home, and, if I could fmd means for it, to difpofe 

of my plantation* 

To this purpofe I wrote to my friend at Lifbon,- 
who in return gave me notice, that he could eaiily dif- 
pofe of it there ; but that if 1 thought fit to give him 
leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the 
furvivors of my truilees who lived in the Braiils, who 
muft fully underiland the value of it^ who livccr jufl upon 
the fpot, and who I knew to be very rich, fo that he bcr 
lieved they would be fond of buying it; he did not 
doubt, but 1 ihould make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the 
more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it to 
them, and he did fo ; and, in about eight months more» 
the ihip being then returned, he fent me an account, that 
they had accepted the offer, and had remitted 33,000 
pieces of eight to a correfpondent of theirs at Liibon, to 
pay for it. 

In return, I figged the inftrument of fale in the fontt 
which they fent from Lifbon, and fent it to my old man^* 
who fent me the bills of exchange for 33,300 pieces 
of eight for the eftate; referving the payment of 100 
moidores a year, to him, the old man, during his life,^ 
and 50 moidores aflerwards to his fon for his life, which 
1 had promifed them ; and which the plantation was to' 
make good as a rent'charge. And thus I have given 
the firil part of a life of fortune and adventure, a' 
life of providence's chequer-woik^ and of a variety 

4 ' which

-which the world will feldom be able to ihew the llktf ' 
off: beginning fool iflily, but clofing much more happily 
than any part of it ever gave me leave fo much as ^o 
hope for. . 

Any one would think, that in this ftatc, of complicated 
good fortune, I <was paii running any more hazards ; 
and fo indeed I had been, if other circumftances bad 
concurred ; but I was inured to a wandering life, had no 
femily, nor many relations ; nor, however rich, had I 
€ontra6led much acquaintance ; and though I had fold 
my eftate in the Braiils, yet 1 could not keep that country 
out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the 
wing again ; efpecially 1 could not reiift the ftrong in- 
clination 1 had to fee ray ifland, and toknow^f thepoor 
Spaniards were in being there ; and how the rogues I 
left there had ufed them. 

My true friend, the widow, earneftly diffuaded me 
from it, and' fo far prevailed with rhe, that artmoft for 
fcveii years (he prevented my running abroad ; during 
which time I took my two nephews, the children of 
one of my brothers, into my care : the eldeft, having 
Ibmething of his own, 1 bred up as a gentleman, and 
gave him a fettlement of fome addition to his eftate, 
after my deceafe ; the other I put out to a captain of a 
ihip ; and after five years, finding him a fenfible, bold, 
coterprifing young fellow, I put him into a good ihip, 
and fent him to fea, and this young fellow afterwards 
drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adyenture my- 
fclf. 

In the mean time, I in part fettled myfelf here ; for, 
'firft of all I married, and that not eithei; to my difad- 
vantage or diffatisfadtion ; and had three children, two 
fpns^ and one daughter : but my wife flying, and my 
nephew coming home with good fuccefs from a voyage 
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his import U- 
i^ty, prevailed and engaged me to go • in his ihip as a 
private trader -to the Eall-indies : this was in the year 
1694. _ ' .. . 

In. this voyage I vitited mynew colony in the ifland, 
fa XV cny fuccelfors the Spaniards, had the whole ftory of 
their lives, and of the villainsl left there ;>' how at firii 

^ 'they.

ey infulted the poor Spaniards, how they afterwards 

greed, difagreed, united, feparated, and how at laft the 

p'^niards were obliged to ufe violence with them ; how 

hiy were fubjei^ed to the Spaniards ; how honellly the 

Spaniards ufedthem ; an hiftory, if it were entered into, 

as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own 

part ; particularly alfo as to their battles with the Carrb-, 

beans, who landed feveral times upon the illand, and as 

to the improvement they made upon the illand itfelf ; 

■and how five of them made an attempt upon the main 

land, and brought away eleven men and, five women 

prifoners ; by which, at my coming, I found about 

twenty young children on the ifland. 

Here 1 ftdyed about twenty days; left them-fupplies 
of all necefTary things, and particularly of arms, poV- 
der, /hot, clothes, tools, and two 'workmen, which I 
brought from England with me ; viz. a carpenter, ^nd 
^ fmith. 

Befides this, I fhared the land into parts with them, 
refeived to myfelf the property of the whole, but gave 
them fuch parts, rerpe<S:ively, as they agreed on ; and, 
having fettled all things with them, and enojaojed them 
not to leav^ the place, I left them there. 

From thence 1 touched at the Brafils, from whence I 
fent a bark, which I bought there, with more people, to 
the ifland ; and in it, beiides other fupplies, I lent feven 
1 women, being fuch as I found proper for fervice, or for 
: wives to fuch as would take them : as to the Englifhmen, , 
|1 piromiied them to lend them Ibme women from Eng- 
I [land, with a good cargo ofnecelTaries, if they would ap- 
ply themfelves to planting which 1 afterwards could not « 
j^erform : the fellows proved very honeft and diligent, 
after they were mallered, and had their properties let 
apart for them. 1 fent them alio from the Brafils five 
cows, three of them being big with calf, fome fheep, 
and lome hogs, which, when 1 came again, were con- 
liderably increafed.
