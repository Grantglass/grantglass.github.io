H E Success the former Part of this
Work has met with in the world,has yet been no other, than is ac-
knowiegd to be due to the surprising
Variety of the Subject,and to the a-
greeable Manner of the Performance.
All the Endeavours ofenvious People to re-
proach it with being a Romance, to search it for
Errors in Geography, Inconsistency in the Relation,
and Contradictions in the Faff, have proved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
The just Application of every Incident, the reli-
gious and useful Inferences drawn from every
Part, are so many Testimonies to the good designof making it public,and must legitimate all the
Part that may be call'd Invention, or Parable in
the Story.
The Second Part, if the ^Editor's Opinion may

The Preface.
every wayas entertaining as the First, contains
as strange and surprising Incidents, and as great
a Variety of them; nor if the Application less se-
rious, or suitable ; and doubtless will, to the sober,
as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as pro-
fitable and diverting } and this makes the abridg-
ing this Work, as scandalous, as it is knavish
and ridiculous; feeing, while to shorten the Book,
t that they may femto reduce the Value, they
strip it of all those Reflections, as well religious as
moral, which are not only the greatest Beauty of
the Work, but are calculated for the infinite Ad-
vantage of the Reader.
By this they leave the Work naked of its brigh-
test Ornaments; and if they would, at the fame
Time pretend, that the Author has supply d the
Story out of his Invention, they take from it the
Improvement, which alone recommends that In-
vention to wife and good Men.
The Injury these Men do,the Proprietor of this
Work, is a Practice all honest Men abhor; and
he believes he may challenge them to shew the
Difference between that and Robbing on the High-
way, or Breaking open a House.
If they can't showany Difference in the Crime,
they will find it'hard to showwhy there should be
any Difference in the Punishment: And he will
answer for it, that nothing shall be wanting on
his part,to do them Justice.

Robinson Crusoe, &c<

HAT homely Proverb used on so
many occasions in England, viz.'that what is bred in the Bone -will not

verify'd, than in the Story of my
Life. Any one would think, that

the native Propensity to rambling, which I gave an
Account of in my first Setting out into the World,
to have been so predominate in my Thoughts,
should be worn out, the volatile Part be fully evacu-
ated, or at least conbens'd, and I might attfi Years
of Age have been a little incin'd to stay at Home,
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more. A 3 •. •• -JWaJ

Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Ad-
ventures was taken away in me; for I had no For-
tune to make, I had nothing to seek: If I had gain'd
ten thousand Pound, I had been no richer; foa: I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to
leave it to; and that I had was visibly encreasing;
for having no great Family, I could not spend the
Income of what I had, unless I would set up for
an expensive Way of Living, such as a great Family,
Servants, Equipage, Gayety, and the like, which
were Things I lj£d no Notion of, or Inclination
.to; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit
still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and fee it in-
crease daily upon my Hands.
Yet all these Things had no Effect upon me, or
at least, not enough to resist the strong Inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like
a chronical Distemper; particularly the Desire of seeing my new Plantation in the Island, and the Co-
lony I left there, run in my Head continually. I
dream'd of it all Night, and my Imagination run
upon it all Day; it was uppermost in all my
Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep;
in short, nothing could remove it out of my Mind-;
it even broke so violently into all my Discos
that it made my Conversation tiresome; for I
talk of nothing else, all my Discourse run into? ven to Impertinence, and I saw it my self.
I have often heard persons of good Judgment say,
That all the Stir People make in the World about
Ghosts and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength
of Imagination, and the powerful Operation of Far- cy in their Minds; that there is no such Thing as5 a
Spirit appearing, or a Ghost walking, and the like :*
That Peoples poring affectionately upon the past
Conversation ot their deceas'd Friends, so realizes
it to them, that they are capable of fancying upon
some extraordinary Circumstances, that they fee
them;
[7]:
them; talk tb them, and are answered by them,
when, in Truth, there is nothing but Shadow and
Vapour in the Thing; and they really know nothing
of the Matter;
For my Parr, I know not to this Hour, whether
there are any such Things as real Apparitions, Spe-
ctres, or walking of people after they are dead, or
whether there is any Thing in the Stories they tell
us of that kind, more than the product of Vapours,
sick Minds, and wandring Fancies ', But. this Iknow^
that my Imagination work'd up to such a Height,
and brought me into such Excess of Vapours, or -"
what else I may call it, that I actually suppos'd my
self, oftentimes upon the Spot, at my old Castle be-
hind the Trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's Fa-
ther, and the reprobate Sailors I left upon the I-
sland i nay, I sancy'd I talk'd with them, andlook'd
at them lo steadily, tho' I was broad awake, as at
persons just before me; and this I did till I often
frighted my self with the Images my Fancy represen-
ted to me: One Time in my Sleep I had the Villa-
ny of the three Pyrate Sailors, so lively related to
me by the first Spaniard and Friday's Father, that it
was surprizing; they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that
they let Fire to the provisions they had laid up; on purpose to distress and starve them ; Things that
I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them
true in Fact : And it was so warm in my Imagination,
and so realiz'd to me, that to the Hour I saw them,
I could not be persuaded, but that it was or would
be true; also how I resented it, when the Spaniard
complain'd to me, and how I brought them to Ju-
stice, try'd them before me, and order'd them all
three to be hang'd: What there was really in this, -
(hall be seen in its Place: For however, I came to
form such Things in my Dream, and what secret
Converse of Spirits injected it, yet there was, I fay,
very much of it true. I own, that this Dream had
A 4 &o«
[8]
nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the
general Part was so true, the bascAvi]Ianipus Beha-
viour of these three harden'd Rogues was such, and
had been so much worse than all I can describe, that
the Dream had too much Similitude of the Fact, and'
as I would afterwards have punished them severely;
so if I had hang'd them all, I had been much in the
Right, and should ha' been justified both by the
Laws of God and Man.
But to return to my story ; in this Kind of Tem-
per I had hVd some Years, I had no Enjoyment of
my Life, no pleasant Hours, no agreeable Diversion,
but what had some Thing or other of this in it: so
that my Wife, who saw my Mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one Night, That she
,believe a there was some secret powerful impulse of
Providence upon me, which had determir/d me to
thither again; and that she found nothing hindred
my going, but my being engag'd to a Wise and
Children. She told me, that it was true, shecould
not think of parting with me; but as (he was as-
sur'd, that if she was dead, it would be the first
Thing I would do: So as it seemed to her, that
the Thing was determined above, she would not be
the only Obstruction: For if I thought fit, and re- solv'd to go here she found me very intent upon
her Words,- and that I look'd very earnestly at her;
so that it a little disorders her, and she stopped. I
ask'd her, Why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say? But I perceiv'd her Heart
was to full, and some Tears stood in her Eyes; Speak
out my Dear, said I, Are you willing I should go?
No, saysjbe, very affeElionately, I am far from willing:
But if you are resolved to go, says she, and rather
than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with
you; for tho' I think it a most preposterous, Thing
for one of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if
it must be, said she again weeping, I won't leave
you i for if it be of Heaven, you must do it There
[ 9 ]
is no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your Duty
to go, he will also make it mine to go with you, Dr otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought
me a little out of the Vapours, and I began to con-
sider what I was a doing; I corrected my wandring
Fancy, and began to argue with my self sedately,
what Business I had after threescore Years, and af-
ter such a Life of tedious Sufferings and Disasters,
and closed in so happy and easy a Manner, I say,
what Business ; I had to rush into new Hazards, and
put my felt upon Adventures, sic only for Youth and
Poverty to run into.
With those Thoughts, I considered my new En-
gagement, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and
my Wife then great with Child of another; that I
had all the World could give me, and had no Need
to seek Hazards for Gain; that I was declining in
Years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I
had gain'd, than of seeking to increase it; that as to
what my Wife had said, of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my Duty to go,
I had no Notion of that; so after many of. these Co-
gitations, I struggled with the Power of my Ima-
gination, reafon'd my self out of it, as I believe Peo-
ple may always do in like Cafes, if they will; and, in a
Word, I conquer'dit; compos'd my self with such
Arguments as occur'd to my Thoughts, and which
my present Condition furnim d me plentifully with,
and particularly, as the most effectual Method, I re solved to divert my self with other Things, and to
engage in some Business that might effectually tye me
up from any more Excursions of this Kind; for I
found that Thing return'd upon me chiefly when I
was idle, had nothing to do, or any Thing of Mo-
ment immediately before me.
To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the
County of Bedford, and resolv'd to remove my self
thither. I had a little convenient House upon it,
and
r io]
and the Land about it I found was capable of great
Improvement, and that it was many Ways suited
to my Inclination, which delighted in Cultivating,
- Managing, Plantings and Improving of Land; and
particularly, being an Inland Country, I was remov'd
from conversing among Ships, Sailors, and Things
relating to the remote Part,of the World.
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, settled my
Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Wa-
gon, Horses, Cows, Sheep; and setting seriously to
Work, became in one half Year, a meer Country
Gentleman; my Thoughts were intirely taken up in
managing my Servants, cultivating the Ground, En-
closing, Planting, Oc. and I liv'd, as I thought, the
most agreeable Life that Nature was capable of di-
recting, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes
was capable of being retreated to.
I farm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay, was limited by no Articles; I could pull up or
cut down as I pleased: What I planted, was for my
self, and what I improved, was for my Family; and
(l, having thus left of, the Thoughts of Wandering, I
had not the least Discomfort in any Part of Life, as
to this World. Now I thought indeed, that I en-
joy'd that middle State of Life, which my Father
so earnestly recommended to me: A kind of heavenly
. Life, something like what is described by the Poet
upon the Subject of a Country Life.
Free from Vices, free from Care,
Age has no Pain, and Youth no Snare.
But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow
from unseen Providence unhing'd me at once; and
not only made a Breach upon me inevitable, and in-
curable; but drove me, by its Consequence, upon a
deep Relapse into the wandring Disposition, which,
as I may say, being born in my very Blood soon re-
covers is hold of me, and like the Returns of a vio'-'
til]
lent Distemper, came on with an irresistible Force
upon me , so that nothing could make any more
Impression upon me. This Blow was the Loss of my
Wife.
It is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon
my Wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the
Stay of all my Afsair, the Center of all my Enter-
prizes; the Engine, that by her Prudence reduc'd me
to that happy Compass I was in, from the most ex-
travagant and ruinous Project that fluttered in my
Head, as above; and did more to guide my ram-
bling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's In-
structions, a Friend's Counsel, or all my own reason-
ing Powers could do. I was happy in listening to
her Tears, and in being moved by her Entreaties,
and to the last Degree desolate and dislocated in the
World by the Loss of her.
When she was gone, the World look'd aukwardly
round me; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my
Thoughts, as I was in the Brajils, when I went first
on Shore there , and as much alone, except as to the
Assistance of Servants, as I was in my Island. I knew
neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the
World busy round me, one Part labouring for Bread,
and the other Part squand'ring it, in vile Excesses or
empty Pleasures, equally miserable, because the End
they propos'd still sled from them; for the Men of
Pleasure every Day surfeited of their Vice, and
heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance ; and
the Men of Labour spent their Strength in daily
Smugglings for Bread to maintain the vital Strength
they labour'd with; so living in a daily Circulation
of Sorrow, living but to work, and working but to
live, as if daily Bread where the only End of wea-
risome Life, and a wearisome Life the only Occasion
of daily Bread.
This
This put me in Mind of the Lifel lived in my
Kingdom, the Island; where I suffered no more
Corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred
no more Goats, because I had no more use for
them: Where the Money lay in the Drawer 'till it
grew ill,dew'd, and had scarce the Favour to be
look'd upon in 20 Years.
All these Things, had I imprOv'd them as I ought
to have done, and as Reason and Religion had dicta-
ted to me, would have taught me to search farther than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that
there was something which certainly was the Reason
and End of Life, superiour to all these Things, and
which was either to be possess'd, or at least hop'd
for on this Side the Grave.
But my Sage Counsellor was gone; I was like a
Ship without a Pilots that could only run afore the
Wind: My Thoughts run all away again into the
old Afsair; my Head was quite turn'd with the
Whimlies of foreign Adventures, and all the plea-
sant innocent Amusements of my Farm, and my
Garden* my Cattle; and my Family, which before
entirely possest me, were nothing to mehad no
Relish, and were like Musick to one that has no Ear,
or Food to one that has no Taste: In a Word, I
resolv'dto ieave oss House-keeping, lett my Farm,
and return to London; and in a few Months after, I
did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I
was before; I had no Relish to the Place, no Employ-
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like
an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is per-
fectly useless in God's Creation, and it is not one
Farthing Matter to the rest of his Kind, whether
he be dead or alive. This also was the Thing, which
of all Circumstances of Life was the most my Aver-
sion, who had been all my Days used to an active
Life; and I would often say to my self, A State of
Idleness isthe very Dregs of Life; and indeed I thought
I was
t !J 3
I was much more suitably employ'd, when I was
16 Days a making me a Deal Board.
It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693, when
my Nephew, who as I have observedbefore, I had
brought up to the Sea, and had made him Comman-
der of a Ship, was come Home from a short Voyage
to Bilbao,being the first he had made : He came to
me, and told me, that some Merchants of his Ac-
quaintance had been proposing to him%to go a Voy- 5'
age for them to the East-IndieslandtoChina,a.s private .
Traders : And now JJncle, fays he, if you will go to
Sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon your old Habi-
tation in the Island, for we are to touch at the Brafils.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a fu-
ture State, and of the Existence of an invisible World,
than the Concurrence of second C.ufes, with the
Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, per-
fectly reserv'd, and not communicated to any in the
World.
My Nephew knew nothing how far my Distem-
per of wandering was return'd upon me, and I knew. /
nothing of what he had in his Thoughts to say, ...
when that very Morning before he came to me, I''
had in a great deal of confusion of Thought, and
revolving every Part of my Circumstances in my
Mind, come to this Resolution, viz.. That I would
go to Lisbon, and consult with my old Sea-Captain;
and so if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and fee the Island again, and fee what was be-
come of my people there. I had pleas'd my self :,
with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and car-
rying Inhabitants from hence, getting a Patent for
the Possession, and I know not what ; when in the
Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have
said, with his Project of carrying me thither, in his
Way to the East-Indies.
I paus'd a while at his Words, and looking steadi-
ly at him, What Devil, "said I, sent you of this unlucky
Errand i My Nephew startled as if he had been
frighted
[ 14]
frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much
displeased with the Proposal, he recover'd himself,
I hope it may not be an unlucky Proposal, Sir, says
he, I dare say you would be pleas'd to fee your new
Colony there, where you once reigned with more
Felicity, than most of your Brother Monarchs in the
World.
In a Word, the Scheme hit so exactly with my
Temper, that is to say, with the Prepossession I was
under, and of which I have said so much, that I told
him in few Words, if he agreed with the Merchants,
I would go with him: But I told him, I would not
promise to go any farther than my own Island. Why,Sir, says he, you don't want to be left there again, I hopeI
Why, said I, can you not take me up again in your Re-
turn? He told me, it could not be possible co do so,
that the Merchants would never allow him to come
that Way with a loaden Ship of such Value, it being
a Month's Sail out of his Way, and might be three
or four: Besides, Sir, if I fiould miscarry, said he,
and not return at all, then you wouldbe just reduced to
the Condition you were in before. This was very rational; but we both found out a
Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on
board the Ship, which being taken in Pieces, and
fhipp'd on board the Ship, might by the Help of some
Carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us, be set
up again in che Island, and finiuVd, fit to go to Sea in
a few Days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the Importu-
nities of my Nephew join'd in, so effectually with my
Inclination, that nothing could oppose me: On the
other hand, my Wife being dead, I had no Body.con-
cern'd themselves so much for me, as to persuade me
one way or other, except my ancient good Friend the
Widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consi-
der my Years, my easy Circumstances, and the need-
less Hazards of a long Voyage; and above all r*y
young Children : But it was all to no Purpose, I had
an
irresistible Desire to the Voyage; and I told her,
I thought there was something so uncommon in the
Impressions I had upon my Mind for the Voyage,
that it would be a kind or relisting Providence, if I
should attempt to stay at Home; after which, (he
ceas'd her Expostulations, and join'd with me, not
only in making Provision for my Voyage, but also
in fettling my Family Affairs for my Absence, and
providing for the Education of my Children.
In Order to this, I made my Will, and fettled the
Estate I had, in such a Manner for my Children, and
placed in such Hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfy'd they would have Justice done them, what-
ever might befal me; and for their Education, I
left it wholly to my Widow, with a sufficient Main-
tenance to herself for her Care : All which she richly
deserved ; for no Mother could have taken more Care
in their Education, or understood it better; and as
she liv'd 'till I came Home, I also liv'd to thank her
for it.
My Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning
of January 169^-5, and I with my Man Friday went
on board in the Downs the 8th, having besides that
Sloop which I mention'd above, a very considerable
Cargo of all Kinds of necessary Things for my Co-
lony, which if I did not find in good Condition, I
resolv'd to leave so.
First, I carry'd with me some Servants, who I pur-
pos'd to place there, as Inhabitants, or at least to
set on Work there upon my own Account while I
stay'd, and either to leave them there, or carry them
forward as they should appear willing; particularly,
I carry'd two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy
ingenious Fellow, who was a Cooper by Trade but
was also a general Mechanick; for he was dextrous
at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn,
was a good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker; he
also made any Thing that was proper to make of
Earth, or of Wood; in a Word, we call'd him Our
Jack 0} all Trades. With
With these I carry'd a Taylor, who had offered himself to go Passenger to the East-Indies with my
Nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our
New Plantation, and prov'd a most neceslary handy
Fellow, as could be desired, in many other Businesses,
besides^ besides that of this Trade; for as I observ'd
formerly, Necessity arms us for all Employments.
My Cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept an Account of Particulars, consisted of a suffi-
cient Quantity of Linnen, and some thin English Stuffs
fpr cloaking the Spaniards that I expected to find : there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation
might comfortably supply them for seven Years; if
I remember right, the Materials which I carry'd
forcloathing them, with Gloves, Hats, Shoes, Stock-
ings, and all such Things as they could want for
wearing, amounted to above 200 Pounds, including
some Beds, Bedding, and Housliold-Stuff, particu-
larly Kitchen-Utensils, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter,
Brass, &C4 besides, near a hundred Pounds more in
Iron Work, Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples,
Hooks Hinges, and every necessary Thing I could
think of.
I carry'd also an hundred spare Arms,Muskets, and
Fuzees, besides some Pistols , a considerable Quan-
tity of Shot of all Sizes three or four Ton of Lead,
and two Pieces of Brass Cannon; and because I knew
not what Time, ,and what Extremities I was provi-
ding for, I carry'd an hundred Barrels of Powder,
besides Swords, and Cutlasses, and the Iron Part of
some Pikes, and Halberts, so that in short, we had
a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores; and I made
my Nephew carry two small Quarter-Deck Guns
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind,
if there was occasion ; that when we came there,
we might build a Fort, and man it against all Sorts of
Enemies : And indeed, I at first thought there would
be Need enough for it all, and much more, if we
hop'd to maintain our possession of the Island, as shall be
be seen in the Course of that Story. I had
I had not such bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had
been used to meet with; and therefore shall have the
less occasion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps
may be impatient to hear how Matters went with
my Colony; yet some odd Accidents, cross Winds,
and bad Weather happen'd, on this first setting out,
which made the Voyage longer than I expected it at first ; and I who had never made but one Voyage,
(viz..) my first Voyage to Guinea, in which I might be
said to come back again, as the voyage was at first
delign'd, began to think the same ill Fare still attend-
ed me; and that I was born to be never contented
with my own Shore, and yet to be always unfortu-
nate at Sea.
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and
we were oblig'd to put in at Galway in Ireland, where
we lay Wind-bound two and twenty Days; but we
had this Satissaction with the Disaster, that Provi-
sions Where here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost
Plenty i so that while we Jay here, we never touch'd
the Ship's Stores, but rather added to them; here
also I took several live Hogs, and two Cows with
their Calves, which I resolved, if I had a good Pas*
sage, to put orsShore in my island, but we found
Occasion to dispose otherwise ot them.
We set out the 5 th of February from Ireland and
had a very fair Gale of Wind for some Days; as I
remember, is might be about the 20th of February in
the Evening late, when the Mate having the watch, came into the Round-house, and told us, he saw a
Flash of Fire, and heard a Gunfir'd, and while he
was telling us of it, a Boy came in, and told us the
Eoatfwain heard another. This made us all run out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a while we heard
nothing, but in a few Minutes we saw a very great
Light, and found that there was some very terrible
Fire at a Distance; immediately we had recourse to
our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there
could be no Land that Way, in which the Fire
B file w '4
stew'd it self, no not for 500 Leagues, for it appear'd
at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded, it must be
some Ship on Fire at Sea; and as by our hearing the
Noise of Guns just before, we concluded it could not
be far off: We stood directly towards it, and were
presently satisfy'd we should discover it, because the
farther we sail'd, rhe greater the Light appear'd tho'
the Weather being haizy, we could not perceive any
, Thing but the Light for a while ;, in about half an
Hour's Sailing, the Wind being sait for us, tho' not
much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little, we
could plainly discern that it was a great Ship on fire
in the Middle of the Sea.
I was most sensibly touch'd with this "Disaster tho'
not at all acquainted with the Persons engag'd in it;
I presently recollected my former Circumstances, in
what Condition I was in, when taken up by the
Portugal Captain; and how much more deplorable the
Crcumstances of the poor Creatures belonging to this
Ship must be, if they had no other Ship in Company
with them: Upon this, I immediately order'd, that
five Guns should be fir'd, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give Notice to them, that
there was Help for them at hand, and that they
in ght endeavour to save themselves in their Boat;
for tho' we could see.the Flame of the Ship, yet they,
it being Night, could fee nothing of us.
We lay by some Time upon this, only driving as
the burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-light;
when on a sudden, to our great Terror, though we
had Reason to expect it, the Ship blew up in the
Air; and immediately, that is to say, in a tew Mi-
nutes, all the Fire was out, that is to say, the rest
of the Ship funk: This was a Terrible, and indeed
an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of the poor Men,
who, I concluded, must be either all destroy'd in the
Ship, or be in the utmost Distress in their Boat,in the
Middle of the Ocean, which at present, by Reason
it was dark, I could not fee However, to direct
them
them as well as I could, I caused Lights to be hung
out it all the Parts of the ship where we could, and
which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Gi ns
all the Night long, letting them know by this, that
there was a Ship not far off.
About 8,Clock in the Morning we discover'd the
Ship's Boats by the Help of our Perspective Glasses,
found there were two of them, both throng'd with
People, and deep in the Water: We perceived they
row'd, the Wind being against them, that they saw
our Ship, and did the utmost to make us fee them.
We immediately spread our Antient to let them
know we saw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal
for them to come on Board, and then made more
Sail, standing directly to them. In little more than
half an Hour we came up with them, and in a word,
took them all in, being no less than sixty four Men,
Women, and Children; for there were a great many
passengers. Upon the whole, we found it was a French Mer-
chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from Que-
beck, in the River of Canada. The Master gave us
a long Account of the Distress of his Ship, how the
Fire began in the Steerage by the Negligence, of the
Steersman \ but on his crying out for Help, was, as
every Body thought, entirely put out: But they
soon found, that some Sparks of the first Fire had
gotten into some Part of the Ship, so difficult to
come at, that they could not effectually quench it;
and afterwardAgetting in between the Timbers, and
within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the
Hold, and mastered all the Skill, and all the Appli-
cation they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then, but to get into
their Boats, which to their great Comfort were pret-
ty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great Shal-
loup, besides a small Skiff which was of no great
Service to them, other than to get some fresh Water
and Provisions into her, after they had secured their
B 2 "Liv§?
Lives from the Fire. They had indeed small Hope
of their Lives by getting into to these Boats at
that Distance from any Land, only.as they said well,
that they were efcap'd from the Fire, and had a Pos-
sibility that some Ship might happen to be at Sea,
and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars,
and a Compass, and were preparing to make the best
of their Way back to Newfound-land, the Wind
blo wing pretty fair, for it blew an easy Gale at S. E.
by E. They had as much Provisions and Water, as
witti sparing it so as to be next door to starving,
might support them about ii Days; in which, if
they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds,
theCapiai, laid, he hop'd he might get the Banks of
Newsvund-land, and might perhaps take lome Fish to
sustain them till they might go on Shore. But there
were so many Chances against them in all these cases ;
such as Storms to overset and founder them; Rains
and Cold to benumb and perish their Limbs; contra-
ry Winds to keep them out and starve them; that it
must have been next to miraculous if they had efcap'd.
In the midst of their Consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the Captain with
Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a sudden
snrpriz'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and
after that four more; these were the five Guns, which
I caused to be fired at first seeing the Light : this
revived their Hearts, and gave them the Notice,
which, as above, I desir'd it should, (viz.)that there
was a Ship at hand for their Help.
It was upon the hearing these Guns, that they
took down their Masts and Sails ;, the Sound coming
from the Windward, they resolv'd to lie by till Morn-
ing. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns,
they fir'd three Muskets, one a considerable While
after another; but these, the Wind being contrary,
we never heard.
Some Time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surpriz'd with seeing our Lights, and hear-
ing
t«]
ing the Guns, which as I have said, I caus'd to be
fir'd all the rest of the Night; this set them to work
with their Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at least,
that we might the sooner come up with them ; and
at last, to their inexpressible Joy, they found we
saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several Ge-
stures, the strange Extasies, the Variety of Postures
which these poor deliver'd People run into, to ex-
press the Joy of their Souls at so unexpected a Deli-
verance; Grief and Fear are easily described ; Sighs,
Tears, Groans, and a very few Motions of the
Head and Hands made up the Sum of its Variety
But an Excess of Joy, a Surpize of Joy has a Thou-
sand Extravagancies in it; there were some in Tears;
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest Agonies of Sorrow; some stark-
raving and down-right Lunatick; some ran about
the Ship stamping with their Feet, others wringing
their Hands; some were dancing, some singing,
some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a Word; others sick and vomiting, se-
veral swooning, and ready to faint ; and a few, were
Crossing themselves, and giving God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither ; there might be
many that were thankful afterward, but the passion was too strong for them at first, and they were not
able to master it, they were thrown into Extasies and
a kind of Frenzy, and so, it was but a very few that -
were compos'd and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps also the Cafe may have some Addition to
it, from the particular Circumstance of that Nation t
they belong'd to, I mean the French; whose Temper
is allow'd to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in
other Nations. I am not a Philosopher enough to
determine the cause, but nothing I had ever seen be-
fore came up to it: The Extasies poor Friday,my
trusty Savage, was in when he found his Father in rhc
B j Boat,
Boat, came the nearest to it, and the Surprize of the
Master and his two Companions, who I delivered
from the Villains that set them on Shore in the island, came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to
compare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any
where else in my Life.
Ic is further observable, that these Extravagan-
cies did not shew themselves in that different Manner
I have mention'd, in different persons only ,\ But all
the Variety would appear in a short succession of
Moments in one and the same Person. A Man that
we saw this Minute dumb, and as it were stupid
and confounded, should the next Minute be dancing
and hallowing like an Antick; and the next Moment
be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces,
and stamping them under his Feet, like a mad Man;
a few Moments after that, we should have him all in
Tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not imme-
diate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more
have been dead; and thus it was not with one or
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest Part of
them; and if I remember right, our Surgeon was ob-
lig'd to let above thirty of them Blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old
Man, and the other a young Man ; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest Man was the worst.
As soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropt down stone-dead, to all Ap-
pearance, not the least Sign of Life could be per-
ceiv'd in him; our Surgeon immediatly apply'd proper
Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in
the Ship that believ'd he was not dead; at length he
opened a Vein in his Arm, having first chaffd and
rubb'd the Part so as to warm it as much as possible;
Upon this the BloodAwhich only dropped at first,
slow'd something freely; in three Minutes after, the
Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour
after that he spoke, grew better, and in a little
Time
Time quite well; after the Blood was stopp'd he
walk'd about, told us he was perfectly well, took a
Dram of Cordial which the surgeon gave him, and
was what we call'd, Come to bimselj; about a quarter
of an Hour after this, they came running into the
Cabin to the Surgeon, who was bleeding a French
Woman, that had fainted; and told him, the priest was gone stark-mad; it seems he had begun to re-
volve the Change of his Circumstance in his Mind,
and this put him into an Extafy of Joy, his Spirits
whirl'd about faster than the Vessels could convey
them; the Blood grew hot and feverish, and the
Man was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that e-
ver was in it: The Surgeon would not bleed him
again in that Condition, but gave him something to
dole and put him to sleep, which after some Time
operated upon him, and he wak'dthe next Morning
perfectly compos'd, and well.
The younger Priest behav'd with great Command
of his Passion, and was really an Example of a se-
rious well-govern'd Mind; at his first coming on
board the Ship, he threw himself flat on his Face,
prostrating himself in Thankfulness for his Deliver-
ance sin which I unhappily and unseasonably disturb'd
him, really thinking he had been in a Swoon; but he
spoke calmly, thank'd me; told me, he was giving
God Thanks for his Deliverance; begg'd me to leave
him a few Moments, and that, next to his Maker, he
would give me Thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also; he continued in that posture about three Mi-
nutes, or little more, after I left him, then came toa me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal of
seriousness and affection, but with Tears in his Eyes
thank'd me that had,under God, given him and so -
many miserable creatures their Lives: I told him, I
had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather
than me: For I had seen that he had done that already:
B 4 But
But I added, That it Was nothing but what Reason
and Humanity dictated to all Men, and that we had
as much Reason as he to give Thanks to God, who
had blessed us so far as to make us the Instruments of
his Mercy to so many of his Creatures.
After this, the young Priest apply'd himself to his
Country-Folks, laboUr'd to compose them; perswad-
ed, entreated,argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost to keep them within the Exercise of their Rea-
son; and with some he had success, tho' others were
for a Time out of all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writjng,as perhaps
it may be useful to those into whose Hands it may fall, in the guiding themselves in all the Extravagances of
their passions ; for if an Excess of Joy can carry Men
out to such a Length beyond the Reach of their Rea-
son, what will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage,
and a provok'd Mind carry us to? and indeed here I
saw Reason for keeping an exceeding Watch over our
Passions of every Kind, as well those of Joy and Satis-
faction, as those of Sorrow and Anger.
7 We were something disordered by these Extravagan-
ces among our new Guests for the first Pay; but when
they had been retir'd, Lodgings provided for them as
well as our Ship would allow, and they had slept hear-
tily, as most of them did, being sateagu'd and frighted
they were quite another Sort ofPeople the next Day.
Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledg-
ments for the Kindness stiewn them was wanting; the
French, 'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed
that Way : The Captain and one of the Priest,came to
me the next Day, and desiring to speak with me and my
Kephew, the Commander, began to consult with us
what should be done with them; and first they told us,
that as we had saved their Lives, so all they had was
little enough for a Return to us for that kindness re-
ceived. The Captain said, they had laved some Mo-
ney and some Things of Value in their Boats, catch'd
(hastily out of the Flames, and ifwe would accept it.
they were ordered to make an Offer it all to us ; they
only desired to be set on Snore some where in our
Way,where if possible they might gee Passage to France.
My Nephew was for accepting their Mony at first
Word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards; but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for I knew
what it was to be set on Shore in a strange Country;
and if the Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea
had serv'd me so, and took all I had for my Deliver-
ance, I must have starved, or have been as much a
Slave at the Brajih^s I had been in Barbary, the Le- -
ing sold to a Mahometan only excepted; and perhaps
a Portuguese is not much a better Master than a Turk, if not in some Cafes a much worse.
I therefore told the French Captain that we had ta-
ken them up in their Distress, it was true; but that
it was our Duty to do so.as we were Fellow-Crea- .
tures, and as we would desire to be so delivered if
we were in the like or any other Extremity; that we
had done nothing for them but what we believed they
would have done for us, if we had been in their
Cafe, and they in ours; but that we took them up
to save them, not to plunder them ; and it would
be a most barbarous Thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the Fire, and then
set them on Shore and leave them ; that this would
be first to save them from Death, and then kill them
our selves; save them from drowning, and abandon
them to starving; and therefore I would not let the
least thing be taken from them: As to letting them
on Shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding
Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the
East Indies; and tho' we were driven out of our
Course to the Westward a very great Way, and per-
haps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their De-
liverance, yet ic was impossible for us wilfully to
change our Voyage on this particular Account ; nor
could my Nephew, the Captain, answer it to the
.Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-Party
I
[ztf]
to pursue his Voyage by the Way of Brafil, and all I
knew we could do for them, was to put our selves
in the Way of meeting with other Ships homeward
bound from the West Indies, and get them Passage, if
poffib!e, to England or Frame.
The first Part of the Proposal was so so generous
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for
it, but they were in a very great Consternation, es-
pecially the passengers, at the Notion of being car-
ry 'd away to the East-Indies; they then in treated me,
that seeing I was driven so far to the westward, be-
fore I met with them, I would at least keep on the
same course to the Banks of Newfound-Land,
where it was probable I might meet with some Ship
or Sloop that they might hire to carry them back
to Canada, from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable Request on
their Part, and therefore I inclin'd to agree to it;
for indeed Iconsider'd, that to carry this whole Com-
pany to the EaB-Indies, would not only be an into-
lerable Severity upon the poor People, but would be
ruining our whole Voyage by devouring all our Pro-
visions; sol thought it no Breach of Charter-Party,
but what an unforeseen Accident made absolutely
necessary to us, and in which no one could say we
were to blame ; for the Laws of God and Nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up
two Boats full of People in such a distress'd Condi-
tion, and the Nature of the Thing as well respect-
ing our selves as the poor People, obliged us to set
them on Shore some where or other, for their Deli-
verance; so I consented that we would carry them
to Newfound-Land, if Wind and Weather would per-
mit, and if not, that I would carry them to Marti-
nico in the Wefl-Indies.
The Wind continued fresh Easterly, but the Wea-
ther pretty good, and as it had blowed continually
in the Points between N. E. and S. E. a long time,
we missed several Opportunities of sending them to
France;
France; for we met several Ships bound to Europe,
whereof two were French from St. Christopher's, but
they had been so long beating up against the Wind,
that they durst take in no Passengers for fear of
wanting Provisions for the Voyage, as well for
themselves as for those stthey should take in ; so we
were obliged to go on. It was about a Week after
this that we made the Banks of Newfound-Land,
where, to shorten my Story, we put all our French
People on Board a Bark, which they hir'd at Sea
there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards to car-
ry them to France, if they could get Provision to vi-
ctual themselves with : When, I say, all the French
went on Shore, I should remember that the young
priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East-
Indies, desired to go the Voyage with us, and to be
set on Shore on the Coast of Coromandel: I readily
agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd the Man, and
had very good Reason, as will appear afterwards ; -
also four of the Seamen entered themselves on our
Ship, and proved very useful Fellows.
From hence, we directed our course for the West-
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 20
Days together, sometimes little or no Wind at all,
when we met with another subject for our Humanity
to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes
N. and the 19 th Day of March 1694-5, when we
'spy'd a Sail, our Course S. E. and by S. We soon
perceiv'd it was a large vessel, and that she bore up
to us, but could not at first know what to make of
her, till after coming a little nearer, we found she
had lost her Main top-mast. Fore-mast and Boltsprit,
and presently she fired a Gun as a Signal of Distress;
the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N.N. W. a
fresh Gale, and we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a Ship of Bristol,bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the Road at
Barbados: a few Days before she was ready to sail, by
a ter-
a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and Chief-
Mate were both gone on Shore; so that, beside the
Terror of the Storm, they were but in an indifferent
Case tor good Artists to bring the Ship home : They
had been already nine Weeks at Sea, and had met
with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was
over, which had blow them quite out of their
Knowledge to the Westward, and in which they lost
their Masts, as above; they told us they expected to
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven
away again to the South-East by a strong Gale of
Wind at N. N. W. the same that blew now, and ha-
ving no Sails to work the Ship with, but a Main-
Course, and a kind of square Sail upon a Jury-Fore-
Mast, which they had set up, they could not lye
near the Wind, but were endeavouring to stand away
for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they
were almost starved for want of Pavilions, besides the
Fatigues they had undergone; their Bread and Flesh
was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the
Ship, and had none for 11 Days; the only Relief
they had, was, their Water was not all spent, and
they had about half a Barrel of Flower left; they had
Sugar enough ; some Succadcs or Sweet-meats they
had at first, but they were devour'd, and they had
seven Casks of Rum. There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-
Servant on Board, who were going Passengers, and
thinking the Ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on Board the Evening before the Hurricane began,
and having no Provisions of their own left, they
were in a more deplorable Condition than the rest,
for the Seamen, being reduced to such an extreme
Necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be
sure, for the poor passengers, and they were indeed in
a Condition that their Misery is very hard to describe.
I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curio-
sity had not led me, the Weather being fair and the
Wind
[19 3
Wind abated, to go on Board the Ship :The Second
Mate who upon this occasion commanded the Ship,
had been on Board our Ship, and he told me indeed,
that they had three passengers in the great Cabin,
that they were in a deplorable Condition; nay,
fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard
nothing of them for above two Days; and I was a-
fraid to enquire after them, said he, for I had no-
thing to relieve them with.
We immediately apply'd our selves to give them
what Relief he could spare; and indeed I had so
far over-ruled Things with my Nephew, that I
would have victuall'd them, tho' we had gone away
to Virginia, or any Part of the Coast of America, to
have supply'd our selves; but there was no Nece-
ssity for that.
But now they were in a new Danger; for they
were afraid of eating to^much, even of that little
we gave them; the Mate or Commander brought
six Men with him in his Boat, but these poor
Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and were so weak,
they could hardly sit to their Oars: The Mate
himself was very ill, and half starved; for he declar'd
he had reserved nothing from theMen, and went Share
and Share alike with them, in every Bit they eat.
I caution'd him to eat sparingly, but a Meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three
Mouthfuls before he began to be Sick, and out of
Order; so he stop'd a while, and our Surgeon mix'd
him up something with some Broath, which he said
would be to him both Food and Physick; and after
he had taken it, he grew better: In the mean Time,
I forgot not the Men; I order'd Victuals to be gi-
ven them, and the poor Creatures rather devour'd
than eat it; they were so exceeding hungry, that
they were in a kind ravenous and had no Com-
mand of themselves; and two of them eat with so
much greediness* that they were in Danger of their
Lives the next Morning.
no]
The Sight of these People^ Distress was Very mov*
ing to me, and brought to Mind what I had a ter-
rible prospect of at my first coming on Shore in my
'1 Island, where I had never the least Mouthful of Food,
or any Prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly
Appreheniion I had of being made the Food of other
Creatures: But all the while the Mate was thus re-
lating to me the miserable Condition of the Ship's
Company, I could not put out of my Thought the
Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in
the Great Cabin, (viz..) the Mother, her Son, and
the Maid-servant, who he had heard nothing of for
two or three Days; and who he seem'd to confess they
had wholly neglected, their own Extremities being
so great; by which I understood, that they had real-
ly given them no Food at all, and that, therefore they
must be perish'd, and be all lying dead perhaps on
the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
As I therefore kept the Mate, who we then called
Captain, on board with his Men to refresh them,
so I also forgot not the starving Crew that were left
on board, but order'd my own Boat to go on board
the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to car-
ry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of
Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd the Men to
cause the Meat to be boil'd while they flay'd, and
to keep Guard in the Cook-Room, to prevent the
Men taking it, to eat raw, or taking it out of the
Pot before it was well boil'd, and then to give every
Man but a very little at a Time; and by this Cauti-
on he preserved the Men, who would otherwise ha
killed themselves, with that very Food that was gr ven them on purpose to save their Lives.
At the same Time, I ordered the Mate to go into
the Great Cabin, and fee what- Condition the poor
passengers were in, and if they were alive, to com-
fort them, and give them what Refreshment was pro-
per; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with
some of the prepared Broth which he had given the
Mate that was on Board, and which he did not
Question would restore them gradually.
J I was notsatisfy'd with this, butAas I said above,,
having a great Mind to see the the Scene of Misery»
which I knew the Ship itself would present me with,
in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Re-
port, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now cal-
l'd him, with me, and went myself a little after in
their Boat, I found the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult
to get the Victuals out of the Boyler before it was ;/
ready: But my Mate observ'd his Order, and kept
a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the
Man he plac'd there, after using all possible Perfwa- ''-,'
sion to have Patience, kept them off by Force:
However, he caused some Bisket Cakes to be dip-
p'd in the Pot, and soften'd with the Lipuor of the
Meat, which they call Brews, and gave" them eve- c/ry one; One, to stay their Stomachs, and told them
it was for their own Safety that he was oblig'd to
give them but a little at a Time: But it was all in .'
vain, and had I not come on board, and their own
Commander and Officers with me, and with good
Words, and some Threats also of giving them no
more, I believe they would have broke into the
Cook-Room by Force, and tore the Meat out of the
Furnace: For Words are indeed of very small Force
to a hungry Belly : However we pacify'd them, and
fed them gradually and cautiously for the first Time,
and the next Time gave them more, and at last
fill'd their Bellies, and the Men did well enough.
Bur the Misery of the poor passengers in the Ca-
bin* was of another Nature, and far beyond the rest;
for as first, the Ship's Company had so little for
themselves, it was but too true that they had at first
kept them very low, and at last totally neg-
lected them i so that for six or seven Days, it might
be said, they had really had no Food at ah, Gd for several Days before, very little. The poor Mo-
ther,
[ V- 1
ther,who as the first Men reported, was a Woman of
good Sence and good Breeding, had spar'd all (he
could get% so affectionately' for her Son, that at last
the entirely sunk under it: And when the Mate of
our Ship went in, she sat upon the Floor or Deck,
with her Back up against the Sides, between two
Chairs, which were lafh'd fall, and her Head funk
in between her Shoulders, like a Corpse, tho' not
quite dead. My Mate said all he could to revive
and encourage her, and with a Spoon put some Broth
into her Mouth; she open'd her Lips, and lifted up
one Hand, but could not speak; yet she understood
what he said, and made Signs to him, intimating,
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her Child,
as if she would have said, they should take Care of
him.
However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd
with the Sight, endeavour'd to get some of the Broth
into her Mouth , and as he said, got two or three
Spoonfuls down, tho* I question whether he could
be sure of it or not: But it was to late, and she dy'd
the same Night,
Ti e Youth who was preserved at the Price of his
most affectionate Mother's Life, was not so far gone,
yet he lay in a Cabin bed as one stretch'd out, with
hardly any Life left in him, he had a Piece, of an
old Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the" rest of
it; however, being young, and having more Strength
than his Mother, the Mate got something down
his Throat, and he began sensibly to revive, tho'
by giving him some Time after but two or three
Spoonfuis extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought
it up again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid, she lay
all along upon the Deck hard by' her Mistress* and
just like one that had fallen down with an Apoplexy,
and struggled for Life: Her Limbs were distorted,
one of her Hands was clasped round the Frame of a
Chair, and she gnp'd it so hard, that we could not
ea%
* ,"\ '~
easily make her let go; her other Arm lay over htt
Head, and her Feet lay both together^set fast against ,1
the Frame of the Cabin Table; in short, flie lay just ^c.
like one in the last Agonies of Death ; and yet she
was alive too.
The poor Creature was not only starv'd with Hun-
ger, and terrify 5d with the Thoughts of Death, but, v' as the Men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted
for her Mistress, who she saw dying for two or three
Days before, and who she lov'd most tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for
when our Surgeon, who was a Man of very great
Knowledge and Experience, had with great Appli-
cation recover'd henas to Life; he had her upon his •,]
Hand as to her senses, for she was little less than di-
stracted for a considerable Time after, as shall appear
presently. ,.,
Whoever shall read these Memorandums must be de-
sir'd to consider, that Visits at Sea are not like a Jour-
ney into the Country, where sometimes People stay a
Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Business was
to relieve this distrefled Ship's Crew, but not to lie
by for them; and tho' they were willing to steer the
fame Course with us for some Days yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had no
Masts; however, as their Captain begg'd of us to
help him to setup a Main-Top-Mast, and a kind of
a Top Mast to his Jury Fore-Mast. We did, as it x

fore at Beybadoes- He begg'd of the Surgeon to'
speak to me, to take him out of the Ship, for he
said the cruel Fellows had murcher'd his Mother;
and indeed so they had, that is to say passively; for
they might ha' spar'd a small Sustenance to the poor
helpless Widow, that might have preserved her Life, though it had been but just to keep her alive. But
Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no Justice,
no Right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable
of no Compassion.
The Surgeon told him how far we were going,
and how it would carry him away from all his Friends,
and put him perhaps in as bad Circumstances almost
as those we found him in; that is to say, starving in
the World. He said he matter'd not whether he went,
if he was but deliver'd from the terrible Crew, that
he was among: That the Captain ( by which he
meant me, for he could know nothing of my Ne-
phew) had sav'd his Life, and he was sure would not
hurt him ; and as for the Maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let
us carry them where we would. The Surgeon repre-
sented the Case so affectionately to me, that I yielded,
and we took them both on board with all their
Goods, except eleven Hogsheads of Sugar, which
could not be removed or come at, and as the Youth
had a Bill of Lad ng for them, I made his Com-
mander sign a Writing, obliging himself to go as
loon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rcgers a Mer-
chant there, to whom the Youth said he was related,
and to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and
all the Goods he had belonging to the deceased Wi-
dow; which I suppose was not done, for I could ne-
ver learn that the Ship came to Bristol, but was, as
is most probable, lost at Sea, being in so disabled a
Condition, and so far from any Land, that I am of
Opinion, the first Storm she met with afterwards,
she might founder in the Sea, for she was leaky, and
had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
i was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 3 2 Min.and
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather,
though at first the Winds had been contrary. I shall
trouble no Body with the little Incidents of Wind,
Weather, Currents, &c. on the rest of our Voyage;
but shortening my Story for the sake of what is to
follow, shall observe that I came to my old Habita-
tion, the Island, on theiothof April 169$. It was
with no small Difficulty that I found the Place; for
as I came to it, and went from it before, on the
South and East Side of the Island, as coming from the
Brajils, lo now coming in between the Main and the
Island, and having no Chart for the Coast, nor any
Land-Mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or
know whether I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on Shore
on several islands in the Mouth of the great River Oro-
nooque, but none for my purpose. Only this I learned by my Coasting the Shore, that I was under one
great Mistake before, viz,, that the Continent which
I thought I saw, from the Island Iliv'd in, was real-
ly no Continent, but a long island, or rather a Ridge
of Islands, reaching from one to the other Side of
the extended Mouth of that great River, and that: the Savages who came to my Island, were not pro-
perly those which we call Cariibees, but Islanders
and other Barbarians of the same Kind, who inhabi-
ted something nearer to our Side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of these Islands to no
Purpose; some I found were inhabited, and some
were not. On one of them I found some Spaniards
and thought they had liv'd there, but speaking with them, found they had a Sloop lay in a small Creek
hard by, and they came thither to make Salt, and to
catch some Pearl Mussels if they could, but that they
belong'd to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay sarther
North in the Latitude of 10 and 11 Degrees.
Thus coasting from one island to another, some-
times with the Ship, sometimes with the French Man's
C a Shal:

and therefore kept her with their very good Will,0 at'
lengthlcamesairontheSouthsideofmy Island, and
I presently knew the very countenance of the Place;
so I brought the Ship safe to an Anchor, Broadside
with the little Creek where was my old Habitation.
As soon as I saw the Place, I call'd for Friday, and
ask'd him if he knew where he was? He looked about
. a little, and presently,, clapping his Hands, cry'dO
yes, 6 there, O yes, 0 there,, pointing to our old Ha-
bitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad
Fellow, and I had much ado to keep him from jump-
ing into the Sea, to swim ashore, to the Place.
Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find any
Body here or no; And what do you think, shall we
see your Father? The Fellow stood mute as a Stock a good while, but when I nam'd his Father, the poor
affectionate Creature looked dejected, and I could fee
the Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What
is the Matter, Friday, says I ? Are you troubled be-
cause you may fee your Father? No, no, fays he,
sliaking his Head, no fee him more, no ever more fee
again; why so, said I, Friday, how do you know that \?
O no, O no, says Friday, he long ago die, long ago;
he much old Man. Well, well, says I, Friday, you
'don't know; but shall we fee any one else then? The
Fellow, it seems, had better Eyes than I, and he
points just to the Hill above my old House ; and
-- . tho' we lay half a League off, he cries out, we fee t
we feel yes, yes, we fee much Man there, and there,
/.. and there. I looked, but I could fee no Body, no
not with a Perspective Glass; which was, I suppose,
because I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was
right, as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and
there was five or six Men altogether, stood to look
at the Ship, not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw People, I
caus'd the English Antient to be spread, and fir'd
three Guns, to give them Notice we were Friends,
and
and in about half a Quarter of an Hour after, we
perceiv'd a Smoke rises from the side of the Creek, so
I immediately order'da Boat out, taking Friday with
me, and hanging out a white Flag, orAFlag or Truce, an' .
I went directly on Shore, taking with me the young
Fryer I mention'd, to whom I had told the whole
Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and
every Particular both of my self, and those that I left
there; and who was on that Account extremely de-
sirous to go with me. We had besides about lixteen
Men very well arra'd, if we had found any new
Guests there which we did not know of} but we had
no Need of Weapons.
As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood,
near high Water, we row'd directly into the Creek,
and the first Man.I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Spa- -
niard whose Life I had sav'd, and who I knew by his
Face perfectly well; as to his Habit I mall describe
it afterwards. I order'd no body to go;pn Shore at first but my self, but there was no keeping Friday in.
the Boat; for the affectionate Creature had spy'd
his Father at a Distance, a good Way off of the Spa-
niards, where indeed I saw nothing of him; and if
they had not let him go on Shore, he would have
jump'd into the Sea. He was no sooner on Shore,
but he flew away to his Father like an Arrow
out "of a Bow. It would have made any Man have
shed Tears in Spight of the firmest Resolution, to
have seen the first Transports of this poor Fellow's
Joy when he came to his Father; how he embrac'd
him, kissed him, stroked his Face, took him up in his
Arms, set him down upon a Tree, and lay down by
him; then stood and look'd at him, as any one would
look at a strange PictureAfor a Quarter of an Hour .
together; then lye down on the Ground, and stroke
his Legs, and kiss them, and then get up again, and
stare at him ; one would ha' thought the Fellow be-
witch'd: But it would have made a Dog laugh to
fee how the next Day his Passion run out another
C 3 Way;
[?8 ]- -
Way: In the Morning he walk'd along the Shore,
to and again, with his Father several Hours, always
leading him by the hand, as if he had been a La-
dy ; and every now and then would come to fetch
something or other for him to the Boat, either a
Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Bisket Cake, or some-
thing or other that was good In the Afternoon his
Frolicks run another Way; for then he would set the
old Man down upon the Ground, and dance about
him, and made a Thousand antick Postures and Ge-
stures; and all the while he did this, he would be
talking to him, and tell ng him one Story or another *
of his Travels, and of what had happened to him
Abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial
Affection was to be found in Christians to their Pa-r
rents, in our Part,of the World, one would be
tempted to say, there would hardly ha' been any
Need of the fifth Commandment.
But this is a Digression; I return to my Landing,
It would be endless to take Notice of all the Cere-
monies and Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me
with. The first Spaniard, who, as I said, I knew
very well, was he whose Life I had sav'd ; he came
towards the Boat, attended by one more, carrying
a Flag of Truce also; and he did not only not
know me at first, but he had no Thoughts, no No-
tion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to
him: Seignior, said I^in Portuguese, Do you not
know me? At which he spoke not a Word j but gi-
ving his Musket to the Man that was with him,
threw his Arms abroad, and saying something in
Spanish, that I did not perfectly hear, come forward,
and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable, not
to know that Face again, that he had once seen, as
of an Angel from Heaven, sent to save his Life: He
said Abundance of very handsome Things, as a well
bred Spaniard always knows how; and then beckon-
ing to the Person that attended him, bad him go and
call out his Comrades. He then ask'd me, if I
would ,would walk to my old Habitation, where he would
give me possession of my own House again, and
where I should see there had been but mean Improve-
ments; so I walk'd along with him ; but alas I could ,
no more find the Place again, than if I had never
been there; for they had planted k> many Trees, and
plac'd them in such a posture, so thick and close to
one another; and in ten Years Time they were grown'
so big, that in (bort the Place was inaccessible, ex-
cept by such Windings and blind Ways, as they them-
selves only, who made them, could find.
I ask'd them what put them upon all these Forti-
fications? He told me, I would say there was need
enough of it, when they had given me an Account
how they had passed their Time lince their Arriving
in the Island, especially after they had the Misfor-
tune to find that I was gone: He told me, he could
not but have some Satissaction in my good Fortune,
when he heard that I was gone in a good Ship, and
to my Satissaction; and that he had oftentimes a
strong Perswasion, that one Time or other he should i
see me again : But nothing that ever befel him in his
Life, he said, was so surprizing and afflicting to
him at first, as the Disappointment he was under
when he came back to the Island, and found I was
not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
Story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought them-
selves much better among the Savages, only that
their Number was so small. And, says he, had
they been strong enough, we had been all long ago in
Purgatory; and with that he crossed himself on
the Breast: But Sir, says he, I hope you will not be
displeased, when I shall tell you howjorc'd by Ne- ,,
cessity,we were oblig'd, for our own Preservation to
disarm them, and making them our Subjects, who
would not be content with being moderately out
Masters, but would be our Murtherers. I answer'd,
C 4 I was
I was heartily afraid of it when I left them there;
and nothing troubled me at my parting from the
Island, but that they were not come back, that I
might have put them in possession of every Thing
first, and left the other in a State of Subjection, as
they deserv'd: But if they had reduced them to it,
I was very glad, and should be very far from finding
any Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of
refractory, ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any
Manner of Mischief.
While I was saying this, came the Man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven Men more: In
the Dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
3' M what Nation they were of: But he made all clear
both to them and to me. First he turn'd to me, and
pointing to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the
t Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you ; and then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was; upon which they all came up one
by one, not as if they had been Sailors and ordinary
Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had
been Ambassadors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or
A great Conqueror ; their Behaviour was to the last
Degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with
a Manly, Majestick Gravity, which very well be-
came them; and in short, they had so much more Man-
ners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
Civilities, much less how to return them in Kind.
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in
the Island, after my going away, is so very remarka-
ble, and has so many incidents, which the former
Part of my Relation will help to understand, and
which will.in most of the Particulars, refer to that
Account I have already given, that I cannot but
commit them with great Delight to the reading of
those that come after me. *
I shall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation
in the first person, which will put me to the Expence
pf ten Thousand said fs, and said his, and he told mes
^ *,» and
andlw/i hints, and the like, but I shall collect the
Facts Historically, as near as I can gather them out
of my Memory from what they related to me, and
from what I met with in my conversing with them
and with the Place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly
as I can,I must go back to the Circumstance in which
I left the Island, and ih: which the persons were, of
whom I am to speak. And first it is necessary to
repeat, that I had sent away Friday's Father and the
Spaniard, the two whose Lives I had rescued from the
Savages; I fay, I had sent them away in a large Ca-
noe to the Main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's Companions who he had left behind
him in order to save them from the like Calamity that
he had been in; and in order to succour them for the
present, and that if possible, we might together find
some Way for our Deliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible Appear-
ance of, or the least Room to hope for my own De-
liverance any more than I had twenty Year before,
much less had I any Fore-knowledge of what after-
ward happened, I mean of an English Ship coming
on Shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but
be a very great Surprize to them when they came
back, not only to find that I was goneAbut to
to find three Stra/ngers left on the Spot, possess'd of
all that I had left behind me, which would other-
wise have been their own.
The first Thing, however, which I enquir'd into,
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own
Part; and I desired he would give me a particular
Account of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with
the Boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He
told me there was little Variety in that Part, for no-
thing remarkable happen'd to them on the Way, they
having very calm Weather, and a smooth Sea; for
his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he said,
but that they were overjoy'd to see him :It seems he
was
was the principle Man among them, the Captain of
the vessel they had been sbipwreck'd inA having been
.dead some Time) they were, he said, the more sur-
prized to see him, because they knew that he wasTal-
len into the Hands of the Savages, who, they were
satisfy'd, would devour him as they did all the rest
of the prisoners, that when they told them the
Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner he
was furnisli'd for carrying them away, it was like
a Dream to them; and their Astonishment, they said,
was something like that of Joseph's Brethren, when
he told them who he was, and told them the Story
of his Exaltation in Pharoah's Court: But when he
defied them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and
the provisions that he brought them for their Jour-
ney or Voyage, they were restored to themselves,
took a just Share of the Joy of their Deliverance,
and immediately prepar'd to come away with him.
Their first Business was to get Canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the ho-
nest Part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly
Savages, and to borrow two large Canoes or Peria-
gua's, on pretence of going out a Fisliing, or for
Pleasure.
In these they came away the next Morning , it
seems they wanted no Time to get themselves ready;
tor they had no Baggage, neither Clothes or Provisi-
ons, or any Thing in the World, but what they had
on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which they used
to make their Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absent, and in that
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occasion ofter'd
for my Escape, as I mention'd in my other Part, and
to get off from the Island, leaving three of the most
impudent, harden'd, ungover'd, disagreeable Vil-
lains behind me, that any Man could desire to meet
with, to the poor Spaniards great Grief and Disap--
pointment, you may be sure.
The
The only just Thing the Rogues did, was, That
when the Spaniards came on Shore, they gave my Let-
ter to them, and gave them provisions and other Re-
lief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave
them the long Paper of Directions which I had left
with them, containing the Particular Methods which
I took for managing every Part«ofmy Life there, the
Way how I baked my Bread, bred up, tame Goats, r,^
and planted my Corn, how Icur'dmy Grapes, made
my Pots, and, in a Word, every Thing I did, all this
being written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two
of whom understand English well enough; nor did X
they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any
Thing else, for they agreed very well for some Time »
they gave them an equal Admission into the House,
or Cave, and they began to live very sociable, and nji-j. m
the Head Spaniard, who had seen pretty mucrsofmy ''
Method, and Friday's Father together, manag'd all
their Affairs; for, as for the EnglishMen, they did
nothing but ramble about the Island, shoot Parrots,
and catch Tortoises, and when they came Home
at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers for
them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfy'd with this,
would the other but have let Iran alone, which,
however, they could not find in their Hearts to do
long; but, like the Dog in the Manger, they would
not eat themselves, and would not let others eat nei-
ther: The Differences, nevertheless, were at first
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating; but
at last it broke out into(an open War, and it begun
with all the Rudeness and insolence that can be ima-
gin'd, without Reason, without Provocation, con-
trary to Nature, and indeed, to common Sense ; and
tho' it is true the first Relation of it came from the
Spaniards themselves, who I may call the Accuiers,
yet when I came to examine the Fellows, they could
not deny a Word of it, i
But: But before I come to the Particulars of this Part,
I must supply a Defect in my former Relation, and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that just as we were weighing the Anchor to set Sail,
there happened a little Quarrel on board our Ship,
which I was afraid once would have turned to a se-
cond Mutiny i nor was it appeas'd, till the Captain
rouzing up his Courage, and taking us all to his As-
sistance, parted them by Force, and making two of
the most resactory Fellows Prisoners, he laid them in
Irons, and as they had been active in the former Dis-
orders, and let fall some ugly dangerous Words the
second Time, he threatn'd to carry them in Irons to
England, and have them hang'd there for Mutiny,
and running away with the Ship.
This, it seems, tho' the Captain did not intend to
do it, frighted some other Men in the Ship, and some
of them had put it into the Heads of the rest, that
the Captain only gave them good Words for the pre-
sent, till they would come to some EnglishPort, and
that then they should be all put into jayl, and try'd
for their Lives.
The Mate got Intelligence of this,' and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was desir'd, that I, who
still passed for a great Man among them, should go
down with the Mate, and satisfy the Men, and tell
them, that they might be assur'd, if they behav'd well
the rest of the Voyage, all they had done for the Time
past should be pardon'd. So I went, and after passing
my Honour's Word to them, they appear'd easy ; and
the more so, when I caused the two Men, who were
in Irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for
that Night, the Wind also falling calm, next Morning
we found, that our two Men who had been laid in
Irons, had stole each of them a Musket, and some o-
ther Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we
know not > and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which
was
was not yet hal'd up, and ran away with her to their
Companions in Rogury on Shore.
As soon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat
on Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and a-
way they went to seek the Rogues, but they could nei-
ther find them, or any of the rest ; for they all fled in-
to the Woods when they saw the Boat coming on
Shore. The Mate was once refolv'd in Justice to
their Rogery, to have destroyed their Plantations,
burnt all their Houshold-Stuffand Furniture, andlefc
them to (hist without it; but having no Order, he
let it all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board with-
out them.
These two Men made their Number five, but the
other three Villains were so much wickeder than these,
that after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they
turned their two New-Comers out of Doors to shift
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with
them, nor could they for a good while be persuaded
to give them any Food; as for the Spaniards they
were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on Shore, the Busi-
ness began to go' forward; the Spaniards would have
persuaded the three Englt(h Brutes to have taken in
their two Country*men again, that, as they said, they
might be all one Family 5 but they would not hear of
it: So the two poor Fellows liv'd by themselves, and
finding nothing but Industry and Application would
make them live comfortably, they pitch'd their
Tents on the North Shore of the Island, but a little
more to the West,to be out of the Danger of the Sa-
vages, who always landed on the East Parts of the
Island. Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in,
and the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores
. in, and the Spaniards having given them some Corn
for Seed, and especially some of the Peas which I
had left them, they dug and planted, and enclosed,
after
after the Pattern I had set for them all, and begin td
live pretty well; their first Crop of Corn was on the
Ground, and tho' it was but a little Bit of Land
which they had dug up at first, having had but a
little Time, yet it was enought to relieve them, and
find them with Bread and other Eatables; and one
of the Fallows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship,
was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and such
other Preparations, as the Rice, and the Milk, and
such little Flesh as they got, furnish'd him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving Posture,
when the three unatural Rogues, their own Country
men too, in meer Humour, and to insult them, came
and bully'd them, and told them, the island was
theirs, that the Governour, meaning me, had given
them Possession of it, and no Body else had any right
to it, and damn 'em* they should build no Houses
upon their Ground, unless they would pay them Rent
for them.
The two Men thought they had jested at first,
ask'd them to come in and sit down, and fee what
fine Houses they were,that they had built* and tell
them what Rent they demanded, and one of them
merrily toid them, if they were Ground-Landlords,
he hoped, if they built Tenements upon their Land,
and made Improvements, they would, according to
the Custom of, Landlords, grant them a long Lease*
and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Wri-
tings. One of the three damning and raging, told
them, they should fee they were not in Jest, and go-
ing to a little Place at a Distance, where the honest
Men had made a Fire to dresstheir Victuals, he takes
a Fire-brand, and claps it to the Out side of their
Hut, and very sairly set it on Fire, and it would
have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one
of the two had not run to the Fe.ow, thrust him a-
way, and trod the Fire out with his Feet, and that
not without some difficulty too.
Thq
The Fellow was in such a Rage at the honest Man's
thrusting him away, that he turn'd upon him with a
Pole he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoid-
ed the Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he
had ended his Days at once; his Comrade seeing
the Danger they were both in, run in after him, and
immediately they came both out with their Muskets, and the Man that was first struck at with the Pole,
knock'd the Fellow down that begun the Quarrel,
with the Stock of his Musket, and that before the
other two could come to help him, and then seeing
the rest come at them, they stood together, and pre-
senting the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad
them stand off. The other had Fire-Arms with them too, but
one of the two honest Men, bolder than his Com^-
rade, and made desperate by his Danger, told them,
if they offer'd to move Hand or Foot they were dead
Men,'and boldly commanded them to lay down theit
Arms. They did not indeed lay down their Arms,
but seeing himrso resolute, it brought them to a Par-
ley, and they consented to take their wounded Man
with them, and be gone; and indeed it seems the
Fellow was wounded sufficiently with the Blow;
however, they were much in the wrong, since they
had the Advantage, that they did not disarm them
effectually, as they might have done, and have gone
immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an Ac-
count how the Rogues had treated them; for the
three Villains studied nothing but Revenge, and
every Day gave them some intimation that they
did so.
But not to crow'd this Part with an Account of
the lesser Part of their Rogueries, such as treading
down their Corn, shooting three young Kids, and a
She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed up
Tame for their Store; and, in a Word, plaguing
them Night and Day in this Manner, it forced the
two Men to such a Desperation, that they resolv'd
to
148 ]
to fight them all three the first Time they had a sait
Opportunity; in order to this they resolved to go to
the Castle, as they called it, that was my old Dwel-
ling where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all
liv'd together, at that Time; intending to have a
fair Battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to
fee Fair Play ; so they got up in the Morning before
Day, and came to the Place, and call'd the EnglishMen by their Names, telling a Spaniard that answer'd,
that they wanted to speak with them.
It happen'd that the Day before two of the Spa-
niards having been in the Woods, had seen one of the
two English Men, who, for Distinction, I call the
Honest Men ,- and he had made a sad Complaint to
the Spaniards, of the Barbarous Usage they had met with from their three Countrymen, and how they
hadruin'd their Plantation, and destroy'd their Corn,
that they had labour'd so hard to bring forward3 and
kill'd the Miltch-Goar, and their three Kids, which
was all they had provided for their Sustenance, and
that if he and his Friends meaning the Spaniards, did
not assist them again, they should be starved. When
the Spaniards came Home at Night, and they were
all at supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the
three English Men, tho' in very gentle and mannerly
Terms, and as'd them, How they could be so cruel,
they being harmless inoffensive Fellows, and that
they were putting themselves in a Way to subsist by
their Labour, and that it had cost them a great deal
of Pains to bring Things to such . Perfection as they
had?
One of the Engli/h^Men return'd very briskly,
what had they to do there ? That they came on Shore
without Leave, and they should not Plant or Build
upon the Island, it was none of their Ground. Why,
says the Spaniard very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they
must not starve? The English Man reply'd like a true
rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they might Starve and be
Damned, they should not Plant nor Build in that
Place.
Place- But what must they do then, Seignor, says
the Spaniard?Another of the Brutes return'd, do!
D..... m/em, they should be Servants and work for
them. But how can you expect that of them, lays
they Spaniards they are not bought with your Mo-
ney; you have no Right to make them Servants?
The English Men anfwer'd, the Island was theirs, the
Govcrnour had given it to them, and no Man had a-
ny thing to do there but themselves; and with that
swore by his Maker, that they would go and burn ail
their new Huts, they should build none upon their Land. . . • ,
. Why, Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same Rule we must be your Servants too? Ay, says the
bold Dog, and so youshasltoo, before we have done
with you, mixing two or three G-d Damme's in the
proper Intervales or his Speech; the Spaniard only
finis d at that, and made him no Answer: However>
this little Discourse had heated them, and starting up,
one says to the other, I think it was he they call'd
tVM. Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and have the t'o-
ther Brush with them ; we'll demolish their Castle,
I'll warrant you; they shall plant no Colony in out
Dominions.
Upon this, they went, all Trooping away, with
every Man a Gun, a Pistol, and a SwordAand
muttcr'd some insolent Things among themselvesAof
what they would do to the Spaniards top, when Op-
portunity, orfer'd; but the Spaniardsfeems^did not;
so perfectly understand them, as to know all the Parti-
culars, only, that in general, they threatned them
hard for taking the two EnglishMens Parr. . , ,
Whether they went or how they bestowed their time
that Evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know;
but it seems they wandered about the Country, Part
is the Night, and then lyingdownin the Piace which
I used to call my Bower, they were weary, and over-
slept themselves. The Cafe was this, they had re solved to stay till Mid-Night, and so to take the poor
D Men
Men when they were asleep, and as they acknow-
ledged it afterwards, intended to fix Fire to their
Huts while they were in them, and either burn them
in them, or murder them as they came out: and as
Malice seldom sleeps very found, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon
them, as I have said, tho' a much fairer one than
that of Burning and Murthering, it happen'd, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone
abroad, before the bloody-minded Rogues came to
their Huts.
When they came there and found the Men gone,
Atkins, who it seems was the forwarded Man, call'd
out to his comrades, ha' Jack, here's the Nest, but
D.... n'em, the Birds are slown: They mused a
while to think what should be the Occasion of their
being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently
that the Spaniards had given them Notice of it, and
with that they shook Hands, and swore to one ano-
ther that they would bereveng'd of the Spaniards. As
soon as they had made this bloody Bargain they fell
to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did
not set Fire indeed to any Thing, but they pull'd
down both their Houses, and pull'd them so Limb
from Limb, that they left not the least Stick standing*
or scarce any Sign on the Ground where they stood;
they tore all their little collected Houshold stuff in
Pieces, and threw every Thing about in such a Man-
ner, that the poor Men found afterwards some of
their Things a Mile off from their Habitation.
Whey they had done this they pull'd up all the
the young Trees which the poor Men had planted;
pull'd up the Enclosure they had made to secure their
Cattle and their Corn; and,in a Word, sack'd and
plunder'd every thing, as compleatly as a Hoord of
Tartars would have done.
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them whereever
they
they had been, tho' they were but two to three : Sd
that had they met, there certainly would have been
Blood shed among them, for they were all very stout
resolute Fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more Care to keep them as under, then they themselves could do to meet; foil as if they had dogg'd one another, when the three
were gone thither, the two were here ; and afterwards
when the two went back to find them, and three were
Come to the old Habitation again; we stall fee their
differing Conduct presently. When the three came
back, like furious Creatures slush'd with the Rage
which the Work they had been about put them into,
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what
they had done, by way of Scoff and Bravado; and
one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as
if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold
of his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a
Twirl about, sleeping in his Face, says he to him,
And you, Seignior, Jack Spaniard, (hall have the fame
Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners : The Spaniard,
who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as brave, as a Man
could be delired to be, and withal a strong well-made
Man, looked steadily at him for a good while, and
then, having no Weapon in his Hand, stept gravely
upto him, and with one Blow of his Fist knock'd
him down; as an Ox is felled with a Pole-Axe; at
which one of the Rogues, insolent at the first, fir'd
his Pistol at the Spaniard immediately; he miss'd his
Body indeed, for the Bullets went thro' his Hair, but
one of them touch'd the tip of his Ear, and he bled
pretty much. The Blood made the Spaniard believe,
he was more hurt then he really was, and that put him into some Heat, for before, he acted all in a
perfect Calm; but now resolving to go thro'with his
Work, he stooped and took the Fellow's Musket who, he had knock'd down, and was just going to (hoot the
Man who had fir'd at him, when the rest of the Spa-
niards being in the Cave came out, and calling to
D 2 i him
him not to shoot, they slept in, secured the other
two, and took their Arms from them.
When they wete thus disarm'd, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well
as their own Countrymen, they began to cool, and
giving the Spaniards better Words, would have had
their Arms again ; but the Spaniards considering the
Feud that was between them and the other two Eng-
lish Men, and that it would be the best Method they
could take, to keep them from one another, told
them, they would do them no harm, and if would
live peacibly, they would be very willing to assist
and sociate with them, as they did before; but that
they could not think of giving them their Arms
again, while they appear'd so refolv'd to do Mischief
with them to their own Countrymen, and had even
threatned them all, to make them their Servants.
The Rogues were now more capable to hear
Reason, than to act Reason, but being refus'd their
Arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad
Men, threatning what they would do, tho'they had
no Fire-Arms: But the Spaniards despising their
Threatning, told them they should take Care how
they offered any injury to their Plantation or Cattle^
for if they did, they would shoot them as they would
do ravenous Beasts, wherever they found them; and
if they fell into their Hands alive, they should certain-
ly be hang'd. However, this was far from cooling
them, but away they went raging and swearing like
Furies of Hell. As soon as they were gone, came
back the two Men in Passion and rage enough also,
tho' of another Kind ? for having been at their Plan-
tation, and finding it all demolished and destroy'd as above, it will easily be supposed they had Provocation
enough; they could scarce have Room to tell their
Tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs>
and it was strange enough to find that three Men
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punish-
ment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especial-
ly having thus disarmed them, made light of all their
Threatnings; but the two English Men resolv'd to
have their Remedy against them, what Pains soe-
ver it cost to find them out.
But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told
them, that as they were already disarmed, they could
not consent that they (the Two) should pursue them
with Fire-Arms and perhaps kill them; but said
the grave Spaniard,. who was their Governour, we
will endeavour to make them do you Justice, if you
will leave it to us; for as there is no doubt but they
will come to us again when their Passion is over, being
notable to subsist without our Assistance; we promise
you to make no Peace with them, without having a
full Satisfaction for you; and upon this Condition we
hope you will promise, to use no Violence with
them, other than in your own Defence.
The two English Men yielded to this veryawkard-
ly, and with great Reluctance, but the Spaniards
protested, they did it only to keep them from Blood-
shed, and to make all easy at last; for said they, we
are not so many of us, here is Room enough for us
all, and it is great pity we should not be all good
Friends; at length they did consent, and waited for
thelflue of the Thing, living for some Days with the
Spaniards, for their own Habitation was destroyed.
In about five Days Time the three Vagrants, tir'd
with Wandring, and almost starv'd with Hunger,
having chiefly liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while,
came back to the Grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the Governour, and two
more with him walking by the Side of the Creek;
they came up in a very submissive humble Manner,
and begg'd to be received again into the Family.
The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them, they
had acted so unnaturally by their Countrymen, and
so very grossly by them (the Spaniards) that they
D could
I could not come to any Conclusion, without con suiting the two English Men and the rest; but how-
ever, they would go to them and discourse about it,
and they should know in half an Hour. It may be
guessed, that they were very hard put to it, for it
seems, as they were to wait this half Hour for an
Answer, they begg'd he would send them out some
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and sent
them at the same Time a large Piece of Goats Flesh,
and a boil'd Parrot, which they eat very heartily,
for they were hungry enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were call'd
in, and a long Debate had among them, their two
Countrymen charging them with the Ruin of all their
Labour, and a Design to murther them,- all which
they own'd before, and therefore could not deny
now; upon the whole, the Spaniard, acted the Mode-
rator, between them, and as they had oblig'd the two
English Men not to hurt the three while they were
naked and unarmed, so they now oblig'd the three
to go and rebuild their Fellows two Huts, one to
be of the same Dimensions, and the other larger
than they were before ; also to fence their Ground
again wherelhey had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room of those pull'd up, dig up the Land again
for planting Corn, where they had spoiled it; and
in a Word, to restore every Thing in the same State
as they found it, as nearas they could, for entirely it
could not be, the Season for the Corn, and the
Growth of the Trees, and Hedges, not being'possi-
ble to be recovered.
Well, they submitted to all this; and as they
had Plenty of Provisions given them all the while,
they grew very orderly, and the whole Society be -
gan to live pleasantly, and agreeably together again;
only that these three Fellows could never be perfwad-
ed to work, I mean hot for themselves, except now
and then a little, ;ust as they pleased; however, the
Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but
live sociably and friendly together, and study in the
whole the Good of the Plantation, they would be
content to work for them, and let them , walk about
and be as idle as they pleas'd; and thus having liv'd
pretty well together for a Month or two, the Spa-
niards gave them Arms again, and give them Liberty
to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a Week after they had these
Arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful Crea-
tures began to be as insolent and troublesome as be-
fore; but however, an Accident happening present-
ly upon this, which endangered the Safety of them
all, they were oblig'd to lay by all private Resent-
ments, and look to the Preservation of their Lives.
It happen'd one Night, that the Spaniard Go-
vernour, as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard
whose Life Ihad sav'd, who was now the Captain,
or Leader, or Governour of the rest, found himself
very uneasy in the Night, and could by no Means
get any Sleep :. He' was perfectly well in Body, as
he told me the Story, only found his Thoughts tu-
multuous; his Mind run upon Men fighting, and
killing of one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any Means get any Sleep; in short,
he lay a great while, but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolv'd to rise; As they lay, (being so
many of them, upon Goat-skins, laid thick upon
such Couches, and Pads, as they made for them-
selves; and not in Hammocks and Ship-Beds, as I
did, who was but one, so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rife, but to get up upon
their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, such as it
was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going
any Way that their Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out, but being
dark, he could fee little or nothing, and besides, the
Trees which I had planted, as in my former Ac:
count is described, and which were now grown taj|
intercepted his Sight, so that he could only look up,
D 4 and
and see that it was a clear,Star-light Night, and hears . ing no~ Noise, he returned and laid him down again;
but it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to any Thing like Rest, but his
Thoughts were to the last Degree uneasy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some Noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them
wak'd, and calling, ask'd, who it was that was up?
The Governour told him, how it had been with
him: Say you so, says the other Spaniard, such Things
are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certain-
ly some Mischief working, says he, near us, and pre-
sently he asked him, where are the EnglishMen?
They are all in their Huts, says he, safe enough. It
seems, the Spaniards had kept Possession of the main
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the three
English Men, since their last Mutiny, always quar-
ters by themselves, and could not come at the rest.
Well, says the Spaniard, there is something in it, I
am persuaded from my own Experience; I am
satisfy'd our Spirits embodied have a Converse with,
and receive Intelligence from , the Spirits unem-
bodied, and inhabiting the invisible World, and this
friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we
know how to make use of it. Come, fays he, let
us go out and look abroad, and if we find nothing
at all in it to justify the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story
to the Purpose,that shall convince you of the Justice
of my proposing it.
In a Word,' they went out to go to the Top of the
Hill, where I us'd to go, but they being strong and
in geed Company, not alone, as I was, used none of
my Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pul-
ling it up after them, to go up a second Stage to the
Top, but were going round through the Grove un-
concerned and unweary, when they were surpriz'd
with seeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little Way
off from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, not
of one, or two, but of a greater Number.
In all the Discoveries I had made of the Savages,
landing on the Island, it was my constant Care to prevent them making the least Discovery of there
being any Inhabitant upon the Place; and when by
any Necessity they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away, were scarce able
to give any Account of it, for we disappeared as soon
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me, escape
to tell any one else, except it was the three Savages
in our last Encounter, who jump'd into the Boat, of
whom I mention'd, that I was afraid they should go
Home and bring more Help.
Whether it was the consequence of the Escape of
those Men, that so great a Number came now toge-
ther; or whether they came ignorantly and by Acer
dent on their usual bloody Errand, the Spaniards
could not it seems understand ', but whatever it was,
it had been their Business, either to have conceal'd
themselves, or not to have seen them at all; much
Jess to have let the Savages have seen that there were
any Inhabitants in the Place: But to have fallen up-
on them so effectually, as that not a Man of them
should have escap'd, which could only have been
by getting in between them and their Boats; but
this Presence of Mind was wanting to them, which
was the Ruin of their Tranquility for a great while.
We need not doubt, but that the Governour and
the Man with him, surpriz'd with this Sight, run
back immediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving
them an Account of the imminent Danger they were
all in; and they again as readily took the Alarm, but
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close with-
in where they were, but that they must run all out to
see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had Opportunity enough for some Hours to
view them by the Light of three Fires they had
made made at a Distance from one another; what they
were doing they knew not, and what to do them-
selves they knew not. For, first, the Enemy were
too many; and secondly, they did not keep together,
but were divided into several Parties, and where on
Shore in several Places.
The Spaniards were in no small Consternation at
this Sight ; and as they found that the Fellows ran
straggling all over the Shore, they made no Doubt,
but first or last, some ofthem would chop in upon
their Habitation, or upon some other Place, where
they would see the Token, of Inhabitants, and they
were in great Perplexity also for fear of their
Flock of Goats, which would have been little less
than starving them, if they would have been de-
stroy'd ; so the first Thing they resolv'd upon, was to
diipatch three Men away before it was light, viz.. two.
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the Goats
away to the great Valley where the Cave was, and
if Need were, to drive them into the very Cave itself. Could they have seen the Savages all together in
one Body, and at any Distance from their canoes, they resolv'd, if they had been an hundred of them,
to have atrack'd them; but that could not be ob-
tains, for they were some of them two Miles off
from the other, and.as it appear'd afterwards, were
of two different Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course
they should take, and beaten their Brains in consider-
ing their present Circumstances; they resolv'd at
last,-while it was dark, to fend the old Savage, a/y/'-
iday's Father* out as a Spy, to learn, if possible, some-
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and
what they intended to do, and the like; the old Man
readily undertook it, and stripping himself quite
naked, as most of the Savages were, away he went:
After he had been gone an Hour or two, he brings
Word, that he had been among them undiscovered,
that
that he found they were two Parties, and of two se-
veral Nations who had War with one another, and
had had a great Battle in their own Country, and
that both Sides having had several Prisoners taken in
theTight, they were by meer Chance landed
all in the same Island, for the devouring their Priso-
ners, and making merry; but their coming so by
Chance to the same Place had spoiled all their
Mirth; that they were in a great Rage at one
another, and that so near, that he believ'd
they would fight again, as soon as Day-light began
to appear; but he did not perceive that they had
any Notion of any Body's being on the Island but
themselves. He had hardly made an End of telling
his Story, when they could perceive, by the unusual
Noise they made, that the two little Armies were
engaged in a bloody Fight.
Friday's Father used all the Arguments he could
to persuade our People to lie close, and not be seen;
he told them their Safety consisted in it, and that they
had nothing to do butjie still, and the Savages
would kill one another to their Hands, and the rest
would go away ; and it was so to a Tittle. But it
was impossible to prevail, especially upon the En-
glishmen; their curiosity was so importunate upon
their Prudentials, that they must run out and fee the
the Battle: However, they used some Caution too.
(via.)they did not go openly, just by their own
Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods, and
plac'd themselves to Advantage, where they might
securely see them manage the Fight, and, as they
thought, not to be seen by them; but it seems the
Savages did fee them, as we shall find hereafter.
The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe
the Englishmen,one of them said, he could perceive,
that some of them were Men of great Bravery, of
invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the
Fight. The Battle, they said, held two Hours, be-
fore they could guess which Party would be beaten;
but then that Party which was nearest our People's
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some
Time more, some of them began to fly ; and this
put our Men again into a great Consternation, least
any of those that fled should run into the Grove, be-
fore their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby invo-
luntarily discover the Place; and that by Conse-
quence the Pursuers should do the like in Search for
them.' Upon this they resolved that they would
stand arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came into
the Grove, they should sally out over the Wall and
kill them; so that, if possible, not one should return
to give an Account of it; they ordered also, that it
should be done with their Swords, or by knocking
them down with the Stock of the Musket, but not
by shooting them, for fear of raising an Alarm by the
Noise.
As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed
Army fled for Life, and, crossing the Creek, ran di-
rectly into the Place, not in the least knowing whe-
ther they went, but running as into a thick Wood
for Shelter; the Scout they kept to'look Abroad,
gave Notice of this within, with this Addition, to
our Mens great Satissaction, (viz. ) That the
Conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which
Way they were gone; upon this, the Spaniard Go-
ternour, a Man of Humanity , would not suffer them
to kill the three Fugitives, but sending three Men
put by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go
round and come in behind them, surprize and take
Prisoners, which was done; the Residue of thecon-
quer'd People fled to their Canoes and got off to Sea;
the Victors retir'd, and made no pursuit or very lit-
tle, but drawing themselves into a Body together,
gave two great skreaming Shouts, which they sup-
pos'd was by way of Triumph, and so: tneFight ended: And the same Day, about three a Clock in
the Afternoon, they also marched to their Canoes.
And thus the Spaniards had their island again free to
therf\-
themselves, their Fright was over, and they saw no
Savages in several Years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out
of their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they
found about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot;
some were kill'd with great long Arrows, some of
which were found sticking in their Bodies; but most
of them were kill'd with their great wooden swords; sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the Field
of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great many
Arrows : These Swords were strange great unwcaldy
Things, and they must be very strong Men that used
them: Most of those Men that were killed with
them, had their Heads mash'd to Pieces, as we may
say, or as we call it in English, their Brains knock'd
out, and several their Arms and Legs broken; so
that 'tis evident they fight with inexpressible Rage
and Fury. We found not one wounded Man that was not stone dead; for either they stay by their E nemy till they have quite kill'd him, or they carry all
the wounded Men, that are not quite dead, away
with them: This Deliverance tam'd our Englishmen for a great
while; the Sight had f 1 I'd them with Horror, and
the Consequences appear'd terrible to the last Degree,
especially upon supposing that some Time or other
they should fall into the Hands of those Creatures,
who would not only kill them as Enemies, but kill
them for food, as we kill our Cattle. And they
professed to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten
up like Beef or Mutton, though it was hippos'd
it was not to be till they were dead, had something
in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very Sto-
machs, made them sick when they thought of it,
and filed their Minds with such unusual Terror, that
they were not themselves for some Weeks after.
This,as I laid, tamed even the three English Brutes,
t have been speaking of; and for a great while after,
they were very tractable, and went about their com-
mon Business of their whole Society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturaliz'd
to the Country, But sometime after this, they fell all
into such simple Measures again as brought them
into a great deal of Trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed, and these three being lusty stout young Fellows, they
made them servants, and taught them to work for
them; and, as Slaves, they did well enough; but
they did not take their Measures with them as I did
by my yi&nFriday, viz.. to begin with them upon the
Principle of having saved their Lives, and then in-
struct them in the rational Principles of Life, much
less of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by
kind Usage and affectionate Arguings; but as they
gave them their Food every Day, so they gave them
their Work too, and kept them fully employ'd in
Drudgery enough; but they failed in this, by it,'
that they never had them to assist them and fight for
them, as I had my Man Friday, who was as true to
me as the very Flesh upon my Bones.
But to come to the Family Part, being all now
good Friends; for common Danger, as I said above,
had effectually reconcil'd them, they began to consi-
der their general Circumstances; and the first Thing
that came under their Consideration was, Whether,
seeing the Savages particularly haunted that Side of
the Island, and that there were more remote and
retir'd Parrs of it equally adapted to their Way of
Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they
should not rather remove their Habitation, and plant
in some more proper Place for their Safety, and es-
pecially for the Security of their Cattle and Corn?
I Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded
That they would not remove their Habitation; be-
cause that some Time or other, they thought they
might hear from their Governour again, meaning mei
and if I should send any one to seek them, I should
be sure to direct them to that Side, where if they
should
t <*? ]
should find the Place demolisli'd, they would con-
clude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go too.
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the Valley where my Cave was,
where the Land was as proper for both, and where
indeed there was Land enough: However, upon
second Thoughts, they alter'd one Part of their Re-
solution too, and resolved only to remove Part of their Cattel thither, and plant Part of their Corn
there ; and so if one Part was destroy'd the other
might be saved : and one Part of Prudence they used*
which it was very well they did, viz.. That they ne-
ver trusted those three Savages, which they had,Pri-
loners, with knowing any thing of the Plantation
they had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they
had there; much less of the Cave there, which they
kept, in Cafe of Necessity, as a safe Retreat, and
thither they carried also the two Barrels of Pow-
der, which I had sent them at my comming away.
But however they resolv'd not to change their Ha-
bitation, yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co-
ver'd it first with a WalJ or Fortification, and then
with a Grove of Trees; so, seeing their Safety con-
sisted entirely in their being conceal'd, of which they
were now fully convine'd; they set to Work to co-
ver and conceal the Place yet more effectually than
before: To this purpose, as I had planted Trees,
(or rather thrust in Stakes, which in Time all grew
up to be Trees) for some good Distance before the
Entrance into my Apartment, they went on in the
same Manner, and fill'd up the rest of that whole
Space of Ground, from the Trees I had set, quite
down to the Side of the Creek, where as I said, I
landed my Floats,! and even into the very Ouze where
the Tide slow'd, (not so much as leaving any Place
to land, or any Sign that there had been any Land-
ing thereabout: These Stakes also, being of a Wood
*ery forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they
took
t*4 3
took Care to have generally very much larger and
./ taller than those which I had planted , them so
very thick and close together, that when they had
been three or four Years grown, there was no pierc-
ing with the Eye any considerable Way into the
Plantation- And as for that Part which I had plan-
ted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's
Thigh; and among them they placed so many other
short ones, and so thick, that, in a Word, it stood
like a Pallisado, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it
was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with i
little Army to tut it all down; for a little Dog could
hardly get between the Trees, they stood so close,
v.'" But this was not all? for they did the same by
all the Ground to the right Hand, and to the Left,
and round even to Top of the Hill ; leaving no Way,
not so much as for themselves to come out, but by
the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and
then lifted up, and placed again from the first Stage
up to the Top; which Ladder, when it was taken
down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft
to assist it, could come at them;
This was excellently well contriv'd: Nor was it
less than what they afterwards found occasion for;
which served to convince me, that as human
Prudence has Authority of Providence to justify it,
so it has, doubtless, the Direction of Providence to
set it to work ; and would we listen carefully to the
Voice of it, lam fully persuaded we might prevent
many of the Disasters which our Lives are now, by
our own Negligence, subjected to. But this by the
Way.
I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after
this in perfect Retirement, and had no more visits from the Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm gi-
ven them one Morning which put them into a great
Consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out
early one Morning on the West Side, or rather the
End of the Island, which, by the Way, was that End
were"
Where I never went, for fear of being difcover'd, they
were surpriz'd with feeing above twenty Canoes of
Indians, just coming on Shore.
They made the best of their Way Home, in Hur-
ry enough; and giving the Alarm to their Comrades,
they kept close all that Day and the next, going out
only at Nightv to make observation: But they had
the good Luck to be mistaken; for, wherever the
Savages went, they did not Land at that Time on
the Island, but pursued some other Design.
And now they had another Broil with the three
Englishmen; one of which, a most turbulent Fellow;
being in a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which
I mentioned they had taken, because the Fey low had not done something right wh en he bid him
do, and seemed a little untractable in his showing
him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog Belt, in which
he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savagej
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the
Spaniard.^ who was by, feeing him give the Fellow a
barbarous Cut with the Hatchet, which he aim'd at his Head, but struck into his Shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor Creature's Armors, ran
to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor
Man, claptih between him and the Savage, to pre-
vent the Mischief.
The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, stiuck
at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and swore he'
would serve him as he intended to serve the Savage;
which the Spaniard perceiving; avoided the Blow;
and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (for
they were all working in the Field about their Corn*
Land) knocked the Brute down: Another of the Eng-
Itfomen running at the same Time to help his Com-
rade, knock'd the Spaniard down; and then two
Spaniards more came in to help their Man, and a
third Englishmanfell in upon them. They had none
of them any Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but
Hatchets and other Tools, except this third English-£ men;
than; he had one of my old rusty Cutlashes, with
which he made at the two last Spaniards, and wound- ed them both. This Fray set the whole Family in
an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they took the
three Englishmen Prisoners. The next Question was,
What should be done with them, they had been so
often "mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate,
and so idle withal, that they knew not what course to take with them, for they were mischievous to
the highest Degree, and valued not what Hurt they
did any Man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to
live with them.
The Spaniard, who was Governour, told them in
so many Words, That if they had been of his own
Country he would have hang'd them; for all Laws
and all Governours were to preserve Society 5 and
those who were dangerous to the Society, ought to
be expell'dout of it; but as they were Englishmen t
and that it was to the generous kindness of an English-
man that they all ow'd their Preservation anJDehver-
ance, he would use them with all possible Lenity, and
would leave them to the Judgment of the other two
Englishmen,who were their Countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmenstood up, and
said, they desired it might not be left to them ; for,
says he, I am sure we ought, to sentence them to the
Gallows; and with that gives an Account how Will,Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the
five Englijhmen join together, and murder all the Spa-
niards when they were in their Sleep.
When the SpanishGovernour, this, he calls to
William Atkins, How, Seignior Atkins, says he,
would you murder us all? What have you to say
to that? That hardened Villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and
G-d d—mr him they would do it still before they
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins,
says the Spaniard, What have we done to you,
that
that you will kill us? And what would you get
by killing us? And what must we do to prevent your
killing us? Must we kill you, or you will kill us?
Why will you put us to the Necessity of this, Seig*
nior Atkins} says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spa-
niard's making a jest of it, that had he not been
held by three Men, and withal had no Weapons
with him, it was thought he would have attempt-
ed, to have kill'd the Spaniard in the Middle of all
the Company*
This hair-brain'd Carriage oblig'd them to consi-
der seriously what was to be done. The two Eng-
lijlmen and the Spaniard who sav'd the poor Savage, was of the Opinion, that they should hang one of
the three for an Example to the rest, and that, par-
ticularly, it should be he that had twice attemp-
ted to commit Murder with his Hatchet; and in-
deed there was some Reason to believe he had done it,
for the poor Savage was in such a miserable Condi-
tion with the Wound he had received, that it was
thought he could not live.
But the Governor Spaniard still said No: it Was
an Englishmanthat had saved all their Lives, and he
would never consent to put a Englishman to Death,
tho' he had murdered half of them; nay, he laid, if he had been kill'd himself by an Englijhman, and
had Time left to speak, it should be, that they
should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Gover-
nor Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it? and
as merciful Councils are most apt to prevail where
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it;
but then it was to be considered, what should be
done to keep them from doing the Mischief they de-
sign'd; for all agreed, Governor and all, that Means
were to be used for preserving the Soc ety from Dan-
ger i after a long Debate it was agreed, First, That
E a they
they should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either Gun, or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any
Weapon, and should be turn'd out of the Society,
and left to live where they would, and how they
would by themselves; but that none of the rest, ei-
ther Spaniards or English,should converse with them,
speak with them, or have any Thing to do with
them; that they would be forbid to come within
a certain Distance of the Place where the rest dwelt;
and that if they oslser'd to commit any Disorder, so
as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the Corn,
Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging
to the Society, that they should dye without Mercy,
and they would shoot them where-ever they could find
them.
The Governour, a Man of great Humanity, mu-
sing upon the Sentence, considered a little upon it,
and turning to the two honest Englishmen said, Hold;
you must respect, that it will be long e'er they can
raise Corn and Cattle of their own, and they must
not starve; We must therefore allow them Provi-
sions, so he caus'd to be added, That they should
have a Proportion of Corn given them to last them
eight Months, and for seed to sow, by which
Time they might be suppos'd to raised some of their
own; that they should have six Mi'ch-Goats, four
He-Goats, and six Kids given them, as well for
present Subsistence, as for a Store; and that they
should have Tools given them for their Work in the
Fields ; such as, six Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and
the like: But they should have none of these: Tools or Provisions, unless they would swear solemn-
ly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the
Spaniards with them, or of their Fellow Englishmen.
Thus they disinis'd them the Society, and turned them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go away,
or to stay; but, as there was no Remedy, they
went, pretending to go and choose a Place where
they
they would settle themselves to plant and live by
themselves; and some Provision were given them, but
no Weapons,
About four or five Days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the Governour an Account
where they had pitch'd their Tents, and mark'd
themselves out an Habitation and Plantation; and it
was a very convenient Place indeed, on the remotest
Part of the Island, N. E. much about the Place
where I providentially landed in my first Voyage,
when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord alone knows
whether, in my foolish Attempt to surround the
Wand.
Here they built themselves two handsome Huts,
and contriv'd them, in a Manner, like my first Ha-
bitation, being close under the Side of a Hill, ha-
ving some Trees growing already on the three Sides
of it, so that by planting others, it would be very
easily cover'd from the Sight, unless narrowly search'd
for; they desir'd some dry'd Goats-skins for Beds and
Covering, which were given them; and upon giving
their Words, that they would net disturb the rest,
or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them
Hatchets and what other Tools they could spare;
some Peas, Barley, and Rice, 'for sowing, and, in a
Word, any Thing they wanted, but Arms and Am-
munition.
They liv'd in this separate Condition about six
Months, and had gotten in their first Harvest, tho'
the Quantity was but small, the Parcel of Land they
had planted being but little; for indeed, having all
their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of
Work upon their Hands; and when they came to
make Boards, and Pots, and such Things, they
were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Season came on,
for want of a Cave in the Earth, they could not
keep their Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of
spoiling! And this humbled them much; so they
E 3 came
came and begg'd the Spaniards to help them, which
they very readily did, and in four Days work'd a
great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them, big
enough to secure their Corn, and other Things from
the Rain; but it was but a poor place, at best, com-
pared to mine; and especially as mine was then, for
the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made seve-
ral new Apartments in it.
About three Quarters of a Year after this Separa-
tion, a new Frolick took these Rogues, which, to-
gether with the former Villany they had committed,
brought Mischief enough upon them, and had very
near been the Ruin of.the whole Colony: The three
new Socrates began, it seems to be weary of the
laborious Life they led, and that without Hope of
bettering their Circumstances; and a Whim took
them, that they would make a Voyage to the Con-
tinent from whence the savages came, and would
try if they could not seize upon some Prisoners a mong the Natives there, and bring them Home, so
to make them do the laborious Part of their Work for
them,
The Project was not so preposterous, if they had
gone no farther ; but they did nothing, and propos'd
nothing, but had either Mischief in the Design, or
Mischief in the Event: And if I may give my Opi-
nion, they seemed to be under a Blast from Heaven;
for if we will not allow a visible Curse to pursue visi-
ble Crimes, how (shall we reconcile the Events of
Things with the Divine Justice It was certainly an
apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and
Piracy, that brought them to the State they were
in; and as they sliew'd not the least Remorse for
the Crime, but added new Viilanies to it, such as,
particularly, the piece of monstrous Cruelty of
wounding a poor slave, because he did not, or per-
haps could not, understand to do what he was di-
directed ; 'and to wound him in such a Manner, as,
too Question, made him a Cripple all his Life; and in
a Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be had
for his Cure; and what was still worse, the murde-
rous Intent, or, to do Justice to the Crime, the in-
tentional Murder, for such, to be sure it was, as
was afterwards the form'd Design they all laid, to
murder the Spaniards in cold Blood, and in their
Sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the Story:
The three Fellows comes down to the Spaniards one
Morning, and in very humble Terms desir'd 'to be
admitted to speak with them: The Spaniards very
readily heard what they had'ro say, which was this,
That they were tir'd of living in the Manner they
did; that they were not handy enough to make the
Necessaries they wanted; and that having no Help,
they found they should be starv'd : But if the Spa-
niards would give them Leave to take one of the Ca-
noes which they came over in, and give them Arms
and Ammunition, proportions for their Defence,
they would go over to the Main, and seek their For-
tune, and so deliver them from the Trouble of supply-
ing them with any other Provisions,
The Spaniards were glad enough to be tid of them,"
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
Destruction they were running into , told them, they
had susser'd such Hardships upon that very Spot, that
they could, without any Spirit of Prophesy, tell them,
that they would be starved, or be murder'd, and bad
them consider of it,
The Men reply'd audaciously, they should be
starved if they stayed here, for they could not work,
and would not work; and they could but be starv'd
Abroad, and if they were murdered, there was an
End of them, they had no Wives or Children to
cry after them; and in short, insisted importu-
nately upon their Demand, declaring, that they
would go, whether they would give them any Arms
or no.
E 4 The
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved to go, they should not go
like naked Men, and be in no Condition to defend
themselves; and that though they could ill spare
their Fire-Arms, having not enough for them-
selves, yet they would let . them have two Mus-
kets, a Pistol, and a Cutlash, and each Man a Hatches,
which they thought was sufficient for them.
In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having
baked them Bread enough to serve them a Month,
and given them as much Goats-Flesti as they could
eat while it was sweet, and a great Basket full of
dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of fresh Water, and a
young Kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a Ca-
noe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was at
least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men; and, there-
fore, was rather too big for them to manage: But
as they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with
them, they did well enough: They had made a
Mast of a long Pole, and a Sail of four large Goat-
Skins dry'd, which they had sow'dorlac'd together;
and away they went merily enough; the Spaniards
called after them, Bon Veyajo; and no Man ever
thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englijh Men who remain'd behind,
how quietly and comfortably they liv'd now those
three turbulent Fellows were gone; as for their ever
coming again, that was the remotest Thing from
their Thoughts that could be imagin'd; when be-
hold, after two and twenty Days Absence, one of
the EnglishMen being abroad upon his Planting-
Work, fees three strange Men coming toward him at
a Distance, .with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englijh. Man, as if he was be-
witch'd, comes frighted and amaz'd to the Go-
yernour Spaniard; and tells him they were all un-
done^
done, for there were Strangers landed upon the I-
Hand, he could not tell who : The Spaniard, pau-
sing a while, says to him, How do you mean, you
cannot tell who? They are the Savages to be sure,
No, no, says the Englishman,they are Men in Cloaths
with Arms: Nay, then, says the Spaniard, why are
you concern'd? If they are not Savages they must be
Friends, for there is no Christian Nation upon Earth
but will do us Good rather than Harm,
While they were debating thus, comes the three
Englishmen, and standing without the Wood, which
was new planted, hallo'd to them; they presently
knew their voices, and so all the Wonder of that
kind ceas'd. But now the Admiration was turn'd
upon another Question, (viz.) what could be the
Matter, and what made them come back again?
it was not long before they brought the Men in,
and enquiring where they had been, and what they
had been doing, they gave them a full Account of
their Voyage in a few Words, (via.) That they
reach'd the Land in two Days, or something less,
but finding the People alarm'd at their coming, and
preparing with Bows and Arrows to fight them,
they durst not go on Shore, but sailed on to the
Northward six or seven Hours, till they came to a
great Opening, by which they perceiv'd; that the
Land they saw from our Island was not the Main,
but an Island; that entring that Opening of the Sea;
they saw another island on the Righthand North, and
several more West; and being resolved to land some-
where, they put over to one of the islands which
lay West, and went boldly on Shore; that they
found the People very courteous and friendly to
them, and that they gave them several Roots and
some dry'd Fish, and appear'd very sociable; and
the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward
to supply them with any thing they could get for
them to ear, and brought it to them a great Way
upon their Heads.
They
They continued here four Days, and enquir'd, ai
well as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations
were, this Way, and that Way; and were told of
several fierce and terrible People that liv'd almost eve-
ry Way ;who, as they made known by Signs to
them, used to eat Men; but as for themselves, they
said, that they never eat Men or Women, except one. ly such as they took in the Wars,and then they own'd
that they made a great Feast, and eat their Priso-
ners.
The English Men enquir'd when they had a Feast
of that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago,
pointing to the Moon, and then to two Fingers;
and that their great King had two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his War ; and they
were feeding them to make them sat, for the next
Feast. The EnglishMen seem'd mighty desirous to
fee those Prisoners, but the other mistaking them,
thought they were desirous to have some of them, to
carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd
to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun, and
then to the rising, which was to signify, that the
next Morning at Sun-rising they would bring some
for them ; and accordingly the next Morning they
brought down five Women and eleven Men, and gave
them to the English Men, to carry with them on
their Voyage, just as we would bring so many Cows
and Oxen down to a Sea-Port Town, to victual a
Ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were
at home, their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and
they did not know what to do ; to refuse the Priso-
ners, would have been the highest Affront to the sa-
vage Gentry that offer'd'them; and what to do with
them, they knew not; however, upon some Debates,
they resolved to accept of them, and in Return, they
gave the Savages) that brought them one of their
Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and six or seven of
their Bullets, which though they did not understand,
they feenvd extreamly pleased with: And then ty-
ing the poor Creatutes Hands behind them.they (the
People) dragg'd the Prisoners into the Boat for our Men.
The EnglishMen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble Present, would certainly have expected
that they should have gone tp work with them, have
killed two or three of them" the next Morning, and
perhaps have invited the Donors to Dinner.
But having taken their Leave with all the Re-
spects, and Thanks that could well pass between
People, where on either Side they understood not
one Word they could say, they put off with their
Boat, and came back towards the first island ; where
when they arriv'd, they set eight of their Prisoners
at Liberty, there being too many of them for their
Occasion,
In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have some
Communication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any Thing; No-
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do
for them, but was look'd upon as going about to
murder them. They first of all unbound them, but
the poor Creatures skream'd at that, especially the
Women, as if they had just felt the Kife at their
Throats ; for they immediately concluded, they
were unbound on purpose to be kill'd.
If they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the
same Thing ; then they concluded it was for Fear
they should sink in Flesh, and so not be fat enough
to kill. If they looked at one of them more particu-
larly, the Party presently concluded, it was to see
whether he or she was sattest", and fittest to kill first.
Nay, after they had brought them quite over, and
began to life them kindly, and treat them well, still
they expected every Day, to make a Dinner or a
Supper for their new Masters.
When
When the three Wanderers had given this unac-
countable History, or Journal of their Voyage, the
Spaniard ask'd them, Where their new Family was?
and being told that they had brought them on Shore,
and put them into one of their Huts, and were
come up to beg some Victuals for them; they (the
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to
say, the whole Colony, resolv'd to go all down to the
Place and fee them, and did so, and Friday $ Father
with them.
When they came into the Hut, there they fate all
bound; for when they had brought them on Shore,
they bound their Hands that they might not take
the Boat and make their escape. There, I say, they
sate, all of them stark naked; First, There were three
Men, lusty comely Fellows, well shaped, strait and
fair Limbs, about thirty to thirty five Years of Age;
and five Women, whereof two might be from thirty
to forty, two more not above four or five and twenty,
and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about sixteen or se-
venteen: The Women were well savoured agreeable
persons both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and
two of them, had they been perfect White, would have
pafs/dfor very handsome Women,even in London itself ,
having pleasant agreeable Countenances and of a very
modest Behaviour, especially when they came af-
terwards to be cloath'd, and dress'd, as they eall'd
it, tho' that Dress was very indifferent it must be con-
fess'd; of which hereafter.
The Sight, you may be sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a
just Character) Men of the best Behaviour; of the
most calm, sedate Tempers, and perfect Good-hu-
mour that ever I met with; and in particular, of
the most Modesty, as will presently appear: I say,
the Sight was - £ry uncouth, to fee two naked Men
and five naked Women, all together bound, and in.
a most miserable Circumstances that Human Nature
could be supposed to be, wV to be expecting every
Momeut
Moment to be dragg'd out, and have their Brains
knock'd out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf
that is kili'd for a Dainty.
The first Thing they did, was to cause the old
Indian, Fridays Father, to go in and fee first if he
knew any of them, and then if he understood any of
their Speech: As soon as the old Man came in, he
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them;
neither could any of them understand a Word he
said, or a Sign he could make, except one of the
Women.
However, this was enough to answer the End,
which was to satisfy them, that the Men into whose
Hands they were fallen, were Christians; that they
abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and that they
might be sure they would -not be kili'd: As soon as
they were asl'ur'd of this, they discovered such a Joy,
and by such aukward, and several Ways, as is hard to
describe; for it seems they were of several Nations-
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was
bid in the next Place to ask them, if they were wil-
ling to be Servants, and to Work for the Men who
had brought them away, to save their Lives; at
which they all fell a Dancing; and presently one
fell to taking up this, and another that, any Thing
that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, to inti-
mate that they were willing to Work.
TheGovernour, who found, that the having Wo-
men among them would presently be attended with
some Inconvenience, and might occasion some Strife,
and perhaps Blood; ask'd the three Men, what they
intended to do with these Women, and how they
intended to use them; whether as Servants, or as
Women? One of the Englishmen answer'd very bold-
ly and readily, That they would use them as- both.
To which the Governour said, -I am not a going to
restrain you from it, you are your own Masters as
to that: But this I think is but just, for avoiding Dis-
orders and Quarrels among you; and I desire it of
you,
you, for that Reason only, vit. That you will all
engage, that if any of you take any of these Women,
as a Woman or Wife, that he shall take but one ; and
that having taken one, none else should touch her;
for tho' we cannot marry any of you, yet 'tis but rea-
sonable, that while you stay here, the Women any
of you takes, should be maintained by the Man that
takes her, and should be his Wife; I mean, fays
he, while he continues here, and that none else (shall have any Thing to do with her: All this appear'd
io Just, that every one agreed to it without any Di-
fficulty.
Then the Englijhmen ask*d the Spaniards, if they
design'd to take any of them ? But every one answer-
ed N O : Some of them said, they had Wives in Spain,
, and the others did not like Women that were not
Christians; and all together declar'd, that they
would not touch one of them; which was an
Instance of such Virtue, as I have not met with
in all my Travils. On the other Hand, to be
short, the five Englishmen took them every one a Wife,
that is to say, a temporary Wife j and so they
set up a new Form of Living; for the Spaniards and
Fridays Father liv'd in my old Habitation, which
they had enlarg'd exceedingly within. The three Ser-
vants which we taken in the late Battle of the Sa-*
vages, lived with them; and these carry'd on the
main Part of the Colony, supplying all the rest with
Food, and assisting them in any Thing as they could,
or as they found Necessity requir'd.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such
refractory ill match'd Fellows should agree about
these Women, and that two of them should not pitch
upon the same Woman, especially seeing two or three
of them were, without comparison, more agreea-
ble than the other: But they took a good Way enough
to prevent quarreling among themselves; for they set
the five Women by themselves in one of their Huts,
and they wentali into the ether Hut, and drew Lots
among them, who should chuse first. He
He that drew to chuse first, went away by him-
self to the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were,
and fetch'd out her he chose 1 and it was worth ob-
serving, that he that chose first took her that was reck-
on'd the homeliest, and the oldest of the five, which
made mirth enough among the rest; and even the
Spaniards laugh'd at it: but the Fellow conlider'd
better than any of them, that , was Application and
Business that they were to expect Assistance in, as
much as any Thing else ; and (he prov'd the best wife of all the Parcel.
When the poor Women saw themselves set in a Row
thus, and fetch'd out one by one, the Terrors of their
Condition return'd upon them again, and they firmly
believ'd that they were now a going to be devour'd;
accordingly, when the English Sailor came in a fetch'd
. out one of them; the rest set up a most lamentable
Cry, and hung about her, and took their Leave of
her with such Agonies and such Affection, as would
have griev'd the hardest Heart in the World; nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them, that
were not to be immediately murder'd, 'till they
fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father, who imme-
diately let them know that the five Men, who had
fetch'd them out one by one, had chosen them for
their Wives.
When they had done, and the Fright the Women
were in was a little over, the Men went to work, and
the Spaniards came and help'd them; and in a few
Hours they had built them every one anew Hut or
Tent for their Lodging apart; for those they had al-
ready, were crowded with theit Tools, Household- Stuff, and Provision. The three wicked Ones had
pitch'd farthest off, and the two honest Ones nearer,
but both on the North Shore of the Island, so that
they continu'd separate as before: And thus my
island was peopled in three Places; and as I might
fay, three Towns were begun to be planted.
And

And here *tis very well worth observing, That
as it often happens in the World (what the wife Ends
of God's Providence are in such a Disposition of
Things, I cannot say) the two honest Fellows had the
two worst Wives, and the three Reprobates, that
was scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves Good, or
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and
ingenious Wives; not that the two first were ill
Wives, as to their Temper or Humour; for all the
five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives ; but my
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat: Another observation I must make, to the Ho-
nour of a diligent Application on one Hand, and to
the Disgrace of a slotkful, negligent, idle Temper,
on the other, that when I came to the Place, and
viewed the several Improvements, Plantings, and
Management of the several little Colonies; the two
Men had so far out-gone the three, that there was
no Comparison; they had indeed both of them as
much Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted j
and the Reason was, because, according to my Rule,
Nature dictated, that it was to no purpose to sow
more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of
the Cultivation, of the Planting, of the Fences, and
indeed of every Thing else was easy to be seen at
first View.
The two Men had innumerable young Trees:
planted about their Huts, that when you came to
the Place, nothing was to be seen but a Wood, and
tho'they had twice had their Plantation demoliuYdj
once by their own Countrymen, and once by the
Enemy, as shall be sliewn in its Place; yet they had
restored all again, and every Thing was thriving and
'slourisliing about them; they had Grapes planted in
Order and manag'd like a Vineyard, tho' they had
themselves never seen any Thing of that Kind; and
by
by their good ordering their Vines, their Grapes
were as good again as any of the others. They had
also found themselves out a Retreat in the thickest
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a
natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made one
with inceisant Labour of their Hands, and where
when'the Mischief which follow'd happen'd, they
secured their Wives and Children, so as they could
never be found; they having by sticking innumerable
Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which as I said*
grew so easily; made the Grove unpayable, except
in(some Places, where they climb'd up to get over
the outside Part; and then went on by Ways of their own leaving.
As to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them;
tho' they were much civiliz'd by their new Settle-
ment, compared to what they were before, and were
not so quarrelsome, having not the same Opportu-
nity; yet one of the certain Companions of a pro-
sligate Mind never left them, and that was their
Idleness. It is true, they planted Corn, and made
Fences; but Solomon's Words were never better ve-
rified than in them : I-went by the Vineyard of the Sloth-
ful, and it -was all overgrownwith Thorns; for when
the Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could
not fee it in some Places for Weeds; the Hedge had
several Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had got-
ten in, and eaten up the Corn; perhaps, here and
there, a dead Bush was cramm'd in, to'stop them
out for the present, but it was only shutting the Sta-
ble-door after the Steed was stolen. Whereas, when
they looked on the Colony of the other two, there
was the very Face of Industry and Success upon all
they did; there was not a Weed to be seen in all
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And
they on the other Hand verify'd Solomon's words in
another Places That the diligent Hand makes rich; for
every Thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty
within and without i they had no more^tame Cattle
F j* than
than the other, more Utensils and Necessaries with-
in Doors, and yet more Pleasure and Diversion too.
It is true, the Wives of the three, were very han-
dy and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the
EngHJb Ways of Dressing and Cooking from one of
the other English Men, who, as I said, was Cook's mate on board the Ship, they dressed their Husbands
Victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the other
could not be brought to understand it; but then the
Husband, who, as I said, had been Cook's mate, did
it himself; but as for the Husbands of three Wives,
they loyter'd about, fetch'd Turtles Eggs, and caught
Fish and Birds; in a Word any Thing but Labour,
and they fared accordingly. The Diligent liv'd well
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and
beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is
all over the World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that
had happen'd before, either to them, or to me; and
the Original of the Story was this:
Early one Morning there came on Shore five or six
Canoes of Indians, or Savages, call them which you
please? and there is no room to doubt that they
came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their
Slaves: But that Part was now so familiar to the
Spaniards, and to our Men too, that they did not
concern themselves about it, as I did; but having
been made sensible by their Experience, that their
only Business was to lie conceal'd, and that if they
were not seen by any of the Savages, they would go
off again quietly when their Business was done, ha-
ving as yet not the least Notion of there being any
Inhabitants in the Island; I say, having been made
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give
Notice to all the three Plantations, to keep within
Doors, and not shew themselves, only placing a Scout
in a proper Place, to give Notice when the Boats

This
This was without doubt very right; but a Disaster
spoil'd all these Measures, and made it known
among the Savages, that there were Inhabitants
there, which was in the End the Desolation of al-
most the whole Colony ; after the canoes with the
Savages were gone off, the Spaniards peep'd abroad
again, and some of them had the curiosity to go to
the Place where they had been, to see what they
had been doing: Here, to their great Surprize,
they found three Savages left behind, and lying fall asleep upon the Ground; it wassuppos'd, they had
either been so gorg'd with their inhuman Feast,
that, like Beasts, they were asleep, and would not
stir when the others went, or they were wander'd
into the Woods, and did not come back in time to
be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surpriz'd at this Sight*
and perfectly at a Loss what to do; the Spa-
niard Governour, as it happen'd, was with them*
and his Advice was ask'd, but he professed he knew
not what to do; as for slaves, they had enough al-
ready, and as to killing them, they were none
of them inclin'd to that; the Spaniard Governouc
told me, they could not think of shedding innocent
Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done
them no Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and
they thought they had no just Quarrel against them*
to take away their Lives;
And here I must, in J 'stice to these Spaniards,
observe, that let the Accou ;.s of SpanishCruelty
in Mexico and Peru, be what they will. 1 :icver met
with seventeen Men of any Nation whatsoever, in
any foreign Country, who were so universally Mo-
dest, Temperate, Virtuous, so very Good-hu- /
mour'd, and so Courteous as these Spaniards; and
as to Cruelty they had nothing of it in their very
Nature ; no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outra-
gious Passions, and yet all of them Men of great
Courage and Spirit.
F % Their
Their Temper and Calmness had appear'd, in
their bearing the unsufferable Usage of the three
Englishmen; and their Justice and Humanity ap-
pear'd now in the Case of the Savages, as above. After some Consultation} they resolv'd upon this,
that they would lie still a while longer, 'till, if pos-
sible, these three Men might be gone j but then the
Governour Spaniard recollected, that the three Sa-
vages had no Boat, and that if they were left to
rove about the Island, they would certainly discover
that there were Inhabitants in it> and so they should
be undone that Way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay
the Fellows fall asleep still, so they resolv'd to wa-
ken them, and take them prisoners, and they did
so; the poor Fellows were strangely frighted
when they were feiz'd upon and bound, and a-
fraid, like the Women, that they should be mur-
der'd and eaten ; for it seems those People think all
the World does as they do, eating Mens Flesh; but
they were soon made easy as to that, and away they
earry'd them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry
them Home to their Castle. I mean to my Palace un-
der the Hill; but they earry'd them first to the
Bower, where was the chief of their Country-work,
such as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn,
&c. and afterwards, they carried them to the Habi-
tation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, tho'it was notmveh
they had for them to do; and whether it was by
Negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the Fellows could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of them run away, and taking into the
Woods, they could never hear of him more.
They had good Reason to believe he got Home
again soon after, in some other Boats or Canoes
of Savages, who came on Shore three or four
Weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their Re-
vels
vcls as usual, went off again in two Days time:
This Thought terrify'd them exceedingly; for they
concluded, and that not without good Cause indeed,
that is if this Fellow came safe Home among his
Comrades, he would certainly give them an Account
that there were People in the Island, as also how
few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I ob-
served before, had never been told, and it was very
happy he had not, how many they were, or where
they liv'd; nor had he evft seen or heard the
Fire of any of their Guns, much less had they
shown him any of their other retir'd Places such as the
Cave in the Valley, or the new Retreat which the
two Englishmen had made, and the like.
The first Testimony they had that this Fellow
had given Intelligence of them, was, that about
two Months after this, six Canoes of Savages, with
about seven, or eight, or ten Men in a Canoe,
came rowing along the North-Side of the Island,
where they never used to come before, and landed
about an Hour after Sun-rise, at a convenient Place
about a Mile from the Habitation of the two Eng-
lijhmen, where this efcap'd Man had been kept:
As the Spaniard Governour said, had they been
all there, the Damage would not have been so
much, for not a Man of them would have escaped;
but the Case diffcr'd now very much, for two Men
to fifty was too much odds : The two Men had
the Happiness to discover them about a League
off, so that it was above an Hour before they
landed, and as they landed a Mile from their
Huts, it was some time before they could come
at them: Now having great Reason to believe
that they were betray'd, the first Thing they did,
was to bind the fitwoj Slaves which were left, and
cause two of the three Men, who they brought
with the Women, who it seems prov'd very faith-
ful to them, to lead them with their two wives, F 3 and
and what ever they could carry away with them, to.
their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have spo-
ken of above, and there to bind the two Fellows
Hand and Foot 'till they heard farther. In the next Place, seeing the Savages were all come
on Shore, and that they bent their course directly
that Way, they open'd the Fences where their Milch-
Goats were kept, and drove them all out, leaving
their Goats to straggle into the Wood, whither they
pleased, that the Savages might think they were all
bred wild; but the Rogue who came with them
was too cunning for that, and gave them an Account
of it all; for they went directly to the Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had secured their
Wives and Goods, they sent the other Slave they had
of the three, who came with the Women, and who
was at their Place by Accident, away to the Spani-
ards, with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and
desire speedy Help; and in the mean Time they took
their Arms, and what Ammunition they had, and re-
treated rbwards the Place in the Wood, where their
Wives were sent, jeeping at a Distance, yet so that
they might see, if possible, which way the Savages
took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising
Ground, they could see the little Army of their Ene-
mies dome on directly to their Habitation, and in a
Moment more, could fee all their Huts and Housliold-
Stust' slaming up together, to their great Grief and
Mortification; for they had a very great koss,,to
them irretrievable, at least for some Time. They
kept their Station for a while, 'till they found the
Savages, like wild Beasts, spread themselves all over
t <e Place, rumaging every Way, and every Place
they could think of, in search for Prey, and in par-
ticular for the People, of whom it now plainly ap-
pear'd they had Intelligence.
The
The two Englijhmen seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, because as it
was likely some of the wild People might come that
Way, so they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another Retreat about half a
Mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happen'd,
that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be
together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very
thick grown Part of the Woods, and where an old
Trunk of a Tree stood, which was hollow and vastly
large; and in this Tree they both took their stand-
ing, resolving to see there what might offer.
Ihey had not stood there long, but two of the
Savages appear'd running directly that Way, as if
they had already had Notice where they stood, and
were coming up to attack them ; and a little Way
farther, they spy'd three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same
Way; besides which, they saw seven or eight
more at a Distance, running another Way; for in a
Word, they ran every way like Sportsmen beating
for their Game.
The poor Men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand and keep their Posture, or fly: But after a very short Debate with themselves, they
considered, that if the Savages rang'd the Country
thus before Help came, they might perhaps find out
their Retreat in the Woods, and then all would be
lost ; so they resolved to stand them there; and if
they were too many to deal with, then they would
get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they
doubted not to defend themselves, Fife excepted, as
long as their Ammunition lasted, though all the Sa-
vages that were landed, which was near fifty, were
to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next consider'd,
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait
for the three, and so take the middle Party, by
F 4 which
which the two and the five that fpllow'd would be
separated ; at length they resolved to let the two
first pass by, unless they should spy them in the
Tree, and come to attack them. The two first Sa-
vages also confirmed them in this Regulation, by
turning a little from them towards another Part of
the Wood ; but the three, and the five after them,
came forwards directly to the Tree, as if they had
known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they re-
solved to take them in a Line, as they came ; and as
they resolv'd to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the
first Shot might hit them all three ; to which pur-r
pose, the Man who was to fire, put three or four
Bullets into his Piece, and having a sair Loop-hole,
as it were, from a broken Hole in the Tree, he took
a sure Aim, without being seen, waiting till they
Mere within about thirty Yards of the Tree, so that
he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages
came on, they plainly saw, that one of the three
was the Run-away Savage that had escaped from
them, and they both knew him distinctly, and re- solved, that if possible, he should not escape, tho'
they should both fire; so the other stood ready with
his Piece, that if he did not drop at the first Shot,
he should be sure to have a second,
But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his
Aim; for as the Savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a Line ; in a Word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly: The foremost was kill'd
outright, being shot in the Head : The second, which
was the run-away Indian, was shot through the Bo <iy, and fell, but was not quite dead : And the
third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, perhaps by
the same Ball that went through the Body of the
second, and being dreadfully frighted, though not
much hurt, sat down upon the Ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.
The
The five that vtere behind,more frighted with the
Noise than sensible of the Danger, stood still at first ,.
for the Woods triads the Sound a thousand Times
bigger than it really \jtas; the Echo's rattling from
one Side to another, srpd the Fowls rising from all
Parts, streaming and'5making, every Sort, a seve-
ral Kind of Noise, according to their kind, just as
it was when I fir'd the'iirst Gun that perhaps was e yer(hot offin that Placesinceit was an island. However, all being silent again, and they not
knowing what the Matter was, came on uncon-
eern'd, 'cill they came tathe Place where their Com-
panions lay in a Condition miserable enough: And
here the poor ignorant Creatures, not sensible that
they were within Reach of the same Mischief, stood
all of a Huddle over the wounded Man, talking,
and, as may be supposed, enquiring of him, how he
came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis very rational to be-
lieve, told them, that a Flash of Fire first, and imme-
diately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had kil-
led those two, and wounded him: This I say, is ra-
tional ; for nothing is more certain than that, as they
saw no Man near them, so they had never heard a
Gun in all their Lives, or so much as heard of a Gun;
neither knew they any Thing of killing or wounding, at a Distance, with Fire and Bullets; if they had,
one might reasonably believe, they would not have
stood so unconcern'd, in viewing the Fate of their
Fellows, without some Apprehension of their own.
Our two Men, tho' as they confess'd to me, it
griev'd them to beoblig'd to kill so many poor Crea-
tures, who, at the same Time, had no Notion of
their Danger; yet having them all thus in the Power,
and the first having loaded his Piece again ; resolv'd
to let fly both together among them; and singling
out, by Agreement, which to aim at, they shot toge-
ther, and kill'd or very much wounded four of them;
the fifth, frighted even to. Death, tho' not hurt, sell
with the rest; so that our Men seeing them all sall to-
gether, thought they had kill'd them all.
The Belief that the Savages were all killed, made
our two Men come boldly out from the Tree before
they had charg'd their Guns again, which was a
wrong Step; and they were under some Surprize
when they came to the Place, and found no less than
four of the Men alive, and of them two very little
hurt, and one not at all: This oblig'd them to fall upon them with the ^Stocks of their Muskets; and
first they made sure of the run. away Savage, that
had been the cause of all the Mischief, and of anor
ther that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out of
their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at all,
came and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands
held up, and made piteous Moans to them by Ges-
tures and Signs, for his Lif e; but could not say one
Word to them that they could understand.
However, they signed to him to sit down at the
Foot of a Tree thereby; and one of the Englijhmen,
with a Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by
great Chance, in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet sast
together, and his two Hands behind him, and there
they left him, and, with what Speed they
could, made after the other two, which were gone
before; fearing they, or any more of them, would find the Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods,
where their Wives, and the few Goods they had left
lay. They came once in Sight of the two Men, but
it was at a great Distance; however, they had the
Satissaction to fee them cross over a Valley towards
the Sea, the quite contrary Way from that which
led to their Retreat, which they were"afraid of; and
being satisfy'd with that, they went back to the Tree,
where they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his Comrades; for he was gone,
and the two Pieces of Rope,-Yarne, with which they
had bound him, lay just at the Foot of the Tree.
They
They were now in as great a Concern as before,
not knowing what Course to take, or how near the
Enemy might be, or in what Numbers; so they
resolved to go away to the Place where their wives were, to fee if all was well there, and to make
them easy, who were in Fright enough to be sure;
for tho' the Savages were their own Country Folk,
yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and per-
haps the more, for the Knowledge they had of
them.
When they come there, they found the Savages; 3
had been in the Wood, and very near that Place,
but had not found it; for it was indeed inaccessible,
by the Trees standing so thick, as before, unless the
persons seeking it had been directed by those that
knew it, which these did not; they found there-
fore every Thing very safe, only the Women in a ter-
rible fright: While they were here, they had the
Comfort of seven ot the Spaniardscome to their AssiT
stance; the other ten, with their Servants, and old
Friday, I mean Friday's Father were gone in a Body
to defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle
that was kept there, in Cafe the Savages should have
rov'd over to that Side of the Country; but they did
not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came
one of the three Savages, who, as I said, were their
prisoners formerly; and with them also came the Sa*
vage, who the Englishmen had left bound Hand and
Foot at the Tree; for it seems they came that Way,
saw the Slaughter of the seven Men, and unbound
the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where
however, they were obliged to bind him again,
as they had the two others, who were left when the
third run away.
The Prisoners began now to be a Burden to them; 1'
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
were under an absolute Necessity to do so, for their
own Preservation: However, the Spaniard Govec-
nor would not consent to it, but order'd for the
pre-
present, that they should be sent out of the Way, to my
old Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with two
Spaniards to guard them, and give them Food for
their Subsistence!, which was done; and they were
bound there Hand and Foot for that Night.
When the Spaniards came, the two English Men
were so encourag'd, that they could not satisfy them-
selves to stay any longer there; but taking five of the
Spaniards, and themselves, with four Muskets and a
pistol among them, and two stout Quarter-Staves,
away they went in Quest of the Savages. And first
they came to the Tree where the Men lay that had
been killed ; but it was easy to see, that some more
of the Savages had been there; for they had attempt-
ed to carry their dead Men away, and had dragged two of them a good Way, but had given it over.
From thence theyadvane'd to the first rising Ground,
where they had stood, and seen their Camp destroy-
ed, and where they had the Mortification still to
fee some of the Smoak ; but neither could , here Tee
any ofthe Savages : They then resolv'd, tho' with" all
possible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd
Plantation: But a little before they came thither,
coming in Sight of the Sea Shore, they saw plainly
the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in
order to be gone.
They seenvd sorry at first that there was no Way
to come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But
upon the whole, were very well satisfyed to be rid
of them.
The poor English Men being now twice ruin'd,
and all their Improvements destroy'd, the rest all a-
greed to come and help them rebuild, and to assist
them with needful Supplies. Their three Country-
men, who were not yet noted for having the least In-
clination to do any Good, yet as soon as they heard
of it (for they living remote Eastward, knew nothing
of the Matter 'till all was over) came and' ofjfer'd
their Help and Assistance, and did very friendly work for several Days, to restore their Habitation,
and make Necessaries for them: and thus, in a little
Time, they were set upon their Legs agartu
About two Days after this, they had the farther
Satisfaction of feeing three of the Savages Canoes
come driving on Shore, and at some Distance from
them, two drown'd Men; by which they had Rea-
son to believe, that they had met with a Storm at
Sea, and had overset some of them; for it had blown
very hard the very Night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the
other Hand enough of them escaped to inform the
rest, as well of what they had done, 'as of what had
happen'd to them; and to whet them on to another
Enterprize of the fame Nature, which they, it seems,
refolv'd to attempt, with sufficient Force to carry all
before them, for except what the first Man had told
them of Inhabitants, they could fay little to it of
their own Knowledge; for they never saw one Man,
and the Fellow being kill'd that had affirmed it,
they had no other witness to confirm it to;them.
It was five or six Months after this, before they
heard any more of the Savages; in which Time
our Men were in Hopes they had either forgot their
former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better;
when on a sudden they were invaded with a most
formidable Fleet, of no less than eight and twenty
canoes full of Savages, arm'd with Bows and Ar-
rows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and such like
Engines of War ; and they brought such Numbers
with them, that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost Consternation.
As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at
the Easter-most Side of the Island, our Men had that
Night to consult and consider what to do; and^ in
the firstPlace, knowing that their being entirely con-
eeal'd, was their only Safety before and would much
more be so now, while the Number of their Enemies
was so great, they therefore refolv'd first of all to take
down
the Huts which were built for the two English men, and drive away their Goats to the old Cave \ because
they supposed the Savages would go directly thither,
as soon as it was Day, to play the old Game over a-
gain, tho' they did not now land within two Leagues
of it.
In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I call'd it.which
belong'd to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little
Appearance of Inhabitants any where as was possible;
and the nextMorning early they posted themselves with
all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, wait-
ing for their Coming: As they guess'd, so it happen'd;
these new Invaders leaving their canoes at the East
End of thelsland, came ranging along the Shore direct-
ly towards the Place, to the Number of two hundred
and fifty, as near as our Men could judge; Our Army
was but small indeed; but that which was worse, they
had not Arms for all their Number neither: The
whole Account, it seems, stood thus: First, as to Men: 17 Spaniards.
$ English Men.
1 old Friday, or Friday's Father.
3 the three Slaves taken with the Women, who
prov'd very saithful.
3 other Slaves who liv'd with the Spaniards.
To Arm, these they had,
11 Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling-Pieces.
5 Muskets or Fowling-Pieces, which were ta-
ken by me from the mutinous Seamen, who
I reduc'd.
2 Swords, 3 old Halberds.
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket
or Fuzee, but they had every one a Halberd, or along Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of
Iron sasten'd into each End of it, and by his Side a
Hatchet; also every one of our Men had Hatchets i
Two
Two of the Women could not be prevail'd upon but
they would come into the Fight, and they had Bows
and Arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the
Savages, when the first Action happen'd, which I have
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another,
and the Women.Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governour, who I have describ'd sa
often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins,
who, tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickedness, was a
most daring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The
Savages came forward like Lyons, and our Men,
which was the worst of their Fate, had no Advan-
tage in their Situation; only that Will. Atkins, who
now prov'd a most useful Fellow, with six Men, was
planted just behind a small Thicket of Bushes, as an
advanc'd Guard, with Orders to let the first of them
pass by, and then fire into the Middle of them; and,
as soon as he had fir'd, to make his Retreat as nim-
bli as he could round a Part of the Wood, and so
come in behind the Spaniards where they stood, hav-
ing a Thicket of Trees all before them.
When the Savages came on, they run stragling a-
bout every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Or-
der, and W. Atkins let about fifty of them pass by
him, then fixing the rest come in a very thick Throng,
he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their
Musquets with six or seven Bullets apiece, about as
big as large Pistol Bullets. How many they kill'd or
wounded, they knew not, but the Consternation and
Surprize was inexpressible among the Savages; they
were frighted to the last Degree, to hear such a dread-
ful Noise, and see their Men killed, and others hurr,
but fee no Body that did it; when in the Middle of
their Fright, W. Atkins, and his other three, let fly again among the thickest of them; and in less than a
Minute the first three, being loaded again, gave them
a third Volley.
Had W' Atkins and his Men retir'd immediately, as
soon as they had fir'd, as they were ordered to do; or had
had the rest of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd
in their Shot continually, the Savages had been effec-
tually routed; for the Terror that was among them*
came principally from this, (viz.) That they were
killed by the Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and
could fee no Body that hurt them; but W.Atkins^
staying to load again, discover'd the Cheat. Some of
the Savages who were at a Distance, spying them, came upon them behind, and the'Atkins and his Men
fir'd at them also, two or three Times, and kill'd a-
bove twenty, retiring as sast as they could, yet they
wounded Atkins himself, and kjlljd one of his Fellow
Englishmen with their j^^o%S,'3S"they did afterwards
one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came t
with the Women; this Slave was a most gallant Fel-
low, and fought most desperately, killing five of them
with his.ownHand, having no Weapon, but one of
the arm'd Staves and a Hatchet.
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded: and two other Men kill'd, retreated to a rising Ground
in the Wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three
Vollies upon them retreated also; for their Number
was so great, and they were so desperate, that tho'
above fifty of them were kill'd, and more than so
many wounded, yet they came on in the Teeth of
our Men, fear less of Danger, and shot their Arrows
like a Cloud; and it was obferv'd, that their wounded
Men, who were not quite disabled, were made out-
rageous by their Wounds, and fought like Mad-men.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishmenthat was kill'd behind them; and
the Savages, when they came up to them, killed them
over again in a wretched Manner, breaking the Arms,
Legs, and Heads, with their Clubs and wooden
Swords, like true Savages :But finding our Men were
gone, they did not seem to persue them, but drew
themselves up in a kind of a Ring, which is, it seems,,
their Customs, and shouted twice in Token of their
(Victory: After which, they had the Mortification td
see several of their wounded Men fall, dying with the
meer Loss of Blood.
The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little
Body up together upon a rising Ground, Atkins, tho'
he was wounded, would ha' had him march'd and
charg'd them again altogether at once: But the Spa-
niards reply*d, Seignior Atkins, you fee how their wounded Men fight, let them alone till Morning; all
these wounded Men will be stiff and fore with their Wounds, and faint with the Loss of Blood; and so we
shall have the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good: But Will. Atkins reply'd
merrily, That's true, Seignior,and so shall I too;and
that's the Reason I would go on while I am warm*
Well, Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniards, you have
behav'd gallantly, and done your Part ; we will fight
for you, if you cannot come on, but I think it best to
stay 'till Morning; so they waited.
But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they
found the Savages in great Disorder about their dead
and wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noise a-
mong them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the Night, especially if they could
come to give them but one Volley before they were
discovered, which they had a fair Opportunity to do; . i),
for one of the two Englishmen, in whose Quarter it was
where the Fight began, led them round between the
Woods, and,Sea-side Westward, and then turning shore
South, they came so near where the thickest of them
lay, that before they were seen or heard,eight of them! y fir'd in among them, and did dreadful Execution up-
on them; in half a Minute More, eight others fir'd af-
ter them, pouring in their small Shot in such a Quan-
tity, that abundance were killed and wounded 3 and
all this while they were not able to see who hurt
them, or which Way to fly. The Spaniards charg'd again with the utmost Expe-
dition, and then divided themselves into three Bodies,
and resolv'd to fall in among them altogether: They
Q had
had in each Body eight persons, that is to say, 24,
whereof were 22 Men, and the 2 Women, who by
the way, fought desperately.
They divided the Fire-Arms equally in each Party,
and so of the Halberds and Staves : They would have
had the Women keep back, but they said they were
resolv'd^to die with their Husbands. Having thus
form'd their little Army, they march'd out from a-
mong the Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of
the Enemy, shouting and hollowing as loud as they
could; the Savages stood all together, but were in the
utmost confusion, hearing the Noise of our Men
shouting from three Quarters together; they would
have fought if they had seen us: And as soon as we
came near enough to be seen, some Arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not
dangerously: But our Men gave them no Time; but
running up to them, fir'd among them three W«tys,and
then fell in with the But-ends of their Muskets, their
Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about
them so well, that, in a Word, they set up a dismal
Skreaming and Howling, flying to lave their Lives
which way soever they could.
Our Men were tir'd with the Execution ;and kill'd
or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, about 180
of them; the rest, being frighted out of their Wits,
fcour'd through the Woods, and over the Hills, with
all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help
them to do; and as we did not trouble ourselves
much to pursue them, they got altogether to the Sea-
side, where they landed, and where their Canoes lay.
But their Disaster was not at an End yet; for it blew
a terrible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Sea-
ward, so that it was impossible for them to go off;
nay, the Storm continuing all Night, when the Tide
came up, their Canoes were most of tuem driven by
the Surge of the Sea so high upon the Shore, that it
tequirc1 infinite Toil to get them off; and some of
them
them were even dafh'd to Pieces against the Beach," or against one another.
Our Men, tho'glad of their Victory, yet'.got lit-
tle Rest that Night; but having refresh'd themselves
as well as they could, they resolved to march to that
Part of the Island where the Savages were fled, and
fee what posture they were in. This necessarily led
them over the Place where the Fight had been, and
where they found several of the poor Creatures not
quite dead, and yet past recovering Life; a Sight dis-
agreeable enough to generous Minds; for a truly
great Man, tho' obliged by the Law of Battle to de-
stroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Misery.
However, there was no Need to give any Orders
in this Cafe; for their own Savages, who were their
Servants, dispatch'd those poor Creatures with these
Hatchets.
At length they came in View of the Place where
the more miserable Remains of the Savages Army
lay, where there appear'd about an hundred still;
their Posture was generally sitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the
Head put between the two Hands, leaning down up-
on the Knees.
When our Men came within two Musket Shot of them, the Spaniard Governor order'd two Muskets to
be fir'd without Ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that
by their Countenance he might know what to expect,
viz,. Whether they were still in Heart to fight, or were
so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took; for, as soon as the Savages
heard the first Gun, and saw the Flash of the Second,
they started up upon their Feet in the greatest Con-
sternation imaginable; and as our Men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran skreaming and
yawlingaway, with a Kind of a howling Noise, which
our Men did not understand, and had never heard be-
fore; and thus they ran up the Hills into the Country.'
G a At
At first, our Men had much rather the Weather
had been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea:
But they did not then consider that this might pro-
bably have been the occasion of their coming again
in luch Multitudes, as not to be resisted, or, at least,
to come so many, and so often, as would quite deso-
late the Island, and starve them: Witt. Atkins there-
fore, who, notwithstanding his Wound, kept always
with them, prov'd the best Counsellor in this Cafe:
His Advice was, to take the Advantage that offer'd,
and clap in between them and their Boats, and so de-
prive them of the Capacity of ever returning any more
to plague the Island.
They consulted long about this, and some were a-
gainst it, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the
Woods, and live there desperate; and so they should
have them to hunt like wild Beasts, be afraid to stir
out about their Business, and have their Plantations
continually risled, all their tame Goats destroy'd, and,
in short, be reduced to a Life of continual Distress.
Witt. Atkins told them, they had better have to do
with a hundred Men, than with a hundred Nations:
That as they must destroy their Boats, so they must
destroy the Men, or be all of them destroyed them-
selves. In a Word, he Chew'd them the Necessity of
it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they went
to work immediately with the Boats, and getting
some dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they
try'd to set some of them on Fire, but they were so
wet, that they would not burn; however, the Fire
so burn'd the upper Part, that it soon made them
unfit for swimming in the Sea as Boats. When the
Indians saw what they were about, some of them
came running out of the Woods, and coming as
near as they could to our Men, kneefd down and
cry'd, Oa, Oa, Waramckoa, and some other
Words of their Language, which none of the others
understood any thing of; but as they made pitiful
Gestures, and strange Noises, is was easy to under-
stand
Hand, they begg'd to have their Boats spar'd, and
that they would be gone, and never come there again.
But our Men were now satisfied, that they had no
Way to preserve themselves, or to save their Colony,
but Effectually to prevent any of these People from
ever going Home again; depended upon this, that soulif ever so much as one of them got back into their s
Country to tell the Story, the Colony was undone;
so that letting them know that they should not have
any Mercy, they sell to work with their Canoes,
and destroyed them every one, that the Storm had
not destroyed before ; at the sight of which, the Sa-
vages rais'd a hideous Cry in the Woods, which our -
People heard plain enough; after which they ran a-
bout the Island like distracted Men; so that, in a
Word, our Men did not really know at first what to
do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider, that while they made those People thus de-
sperate, they ought to have kept good Guard at the
same Time upon their Plantations; for tho' it is
true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the
Indians did not find out their main Retreat, I mean
my old Castle at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Val-
ley, yet they found out my Plantation at the Bower,
and pulled it all to pieces, and all the Fences and
Planting about it; trode all the Corn under Foot;
tore up the Vines and Grapes, being just then al-
most ripe, and did to our Men in estimable Damage,
though to themselves not one Farthingworth of Ser-
vice.
Tho' our Men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they were in no Condition to pursue
them, or hurt them up and down; for as they were r
too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found
them single, so our Men durst not go about single, for
fear of being surrounded with theirNumbers. The best
was, they had no Weapons, for tho' they had Bows
they had no Arrows left nor any Materials to make
G 3 any,
any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or Weapon a-
mong them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reduced to
was great, and indeed deplorable; but at the same
Time, our Men were also brought to very bad Cir-
cumstances by them; for tho' their Retreats were
preserved, yet their Provision was destroyed, and
their Harvest spoiled, and what to do, or which
Way to turn themselves, they knew not: The only
Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they
had in the Valley by the Cave, and some little Corn <'
which grew there; and the three Englishmen, William
Atkins and his Comrades, who were now reduced to
two, one of them being kill'd by an Arrow which
struck him on the Side of his Head, just under the
Temple, so that he never spoke more; and it was
very remarkable, that this was the same barbarous
Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave with his
Hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have mur-
der'd the Spaniards.
I look'd upon their Cafe to have been worse at
this Time, than mine was at any Time, after I first
discovered the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into
the Method of planting and raising my Corn, and
my tame Cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a
hundred Wolves upon the Island, which would de-
vour every Thing they could come at, yet could
very hardly be come at themselves.;'
The first Thing they concluded, when they saw
what their Circumstances were, was,that they would,
if possible, drive them up to the farther Part of the
Island, Soutb-west, that if any more Savages came on
Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that:
they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as
many of them as they could come at, till they had
reduced their Number; and if they could at last
tame them and bring them to any Thing, they would
give them Corn, and teach them how to plant and
live upon their daily Labour*
In order to this, they so follow'd them, aud so terri-
fy 'd them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if
any of them fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not
hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear; and so
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out
of Sight farther and farther, till at last our Men fol-
lowing them,,and every Day almost killing and woundding some of them, they kept up in the Woods and
hollow Places so much, that it reduced them to the
utmost Misery for want of Food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the Woods, without any
Hurt, but meerly starved to Death.
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts
relent, and Pity mov'd them; especially the Spaniard
Governour, who was the most gentlemanly generous-
minded Man that ever I met with in my Life; and
he propos'd, if possible, to take one of them alive,and
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as
to be able to act as Interpreter, and to go among
them, and fee if they might be brought to some Con-
ditions, that might be depended upon, to save their
Lives, and to do us no Spoil.
It was some while before any of them could be
taken; but being weak and half starv'd, one of them
was at last surpriz'd and made a Prisoner i he was
sullen at first, and would neither eat or drink, but
finding himself kindly used, and Victuals given him,
and no Violence offered him, he at last grew tracta-
ble, and came to himself,
. They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the other would
be to them all; that they would not only save their
Lives, but would give them a Part of the Island to
live in, provided they would give Satissaction that
they would keep in their own Bounds, and not come
beyond it, to injure or prejudice others, and that
they should have Corn given them, to plant and
make it grow for their Bread, and some Bread given
them for their present Subsistence ; and old Friday bad
G 4 the
the Fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and fee what they said to it, assuring them, that if they
did qot agree immediately,they should be all destroyed. The poor Wretches, throughly humbled, and re-
sluc'd in Number to about thirty seven, clos'd with
the Proposal at the first Offer, and begg'd to have some Food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards, and two Englishmen well armed, and three;
Indian Slaves, and old Friday, marched to the Place
where they were;. three Indian Slaves carried them a
large Quantity of Bread; and some Rice boiled up
to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and three live Goats;
and they were ordered to go to the Side of a Hill,
where they sat down, eat the Provisions, very thank-
fully, and were the most faithful Fellows to their
'Words that could be thought of J for except when
they came to beg victuals and Directions, they ne-
ver came out of their Bounds; and there they lived
when I came to the Island, and I went to fee them.
They had taught them both to plant Corn, make
Bread, breed tame Coats, and milk them; they wanted
nothing but Wives, and they soon would have been
a Nation. They were confined to a Neck of Land,
surrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying
plain towards the Sea before them, on the South-East
Corner of the Island: They had Land enough, and it
was very good and fruitful; . they had a Piece of Land
about a Mile and half broad, three or four Mile in
Length.
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades,
such as I made for my self, and gave them among
them twelve Hatchets and three or four Knives;
and there they liv'd the most subjected innocent
Creatures, that ever were heard of.
After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tranqui-
lity with Respect to the Savages, till I came to re-
visit them, which was above two Years: plot, but
that mv> and then, some Canoes of Savages came
<pr; Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feasts, but
»:- *;'i, ^' '\ i ., * '.. - t: as
as they were of several Nations, and perhaps had
never heard of those that came before, or the Rea-
son of it, they did not make any Search or Enquiry
after their Countrymen; and if they had, it would
have been very hard-to have found them out.
- Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all
that happen'd to them, to my Return, at least that
was worth Notice. The Indians or Savages were
wonderfully civiliz'd by them, and they frequently
went among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death,
any one of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their Settlement betray'd again-
One Thing was very remarkable, viz,, that they
taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets;
but they soon out did their Masters; for they made
abundance of most ingenious Things in Wicker-
work; particularly, all Sorts of Baskets; Sieves,
Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, &c. as also Chairs to fit
on, Stools9 Beds, Couches, and abundance of other
Things, being very ingenious at such Work, when
they were once put in the Way of it.
, My coming was a particular Relief to these Peo-
ple, because we rurniuVd them with Knives, Scis-
sars, Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and all Things of
that Kind which they could want.
With the Help of these Tools they were so very
handy, that they came at last to build up their
Huts, or Houses, very handsomely; raddling or
working it up like Basket-work all the Way round,
which was a very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity,
and look'd very odd, but was an exceeding good
pence, as well against Heat, as against all Sorts of
Vermine; and our Men were so taken with it, that
they got the wild Savages to come and do the like
for them , so that when I came to fee the two Eng-
lishmen? Colonies, they look'd, at a Distance, as if
they liv'd all like Bees, in a Hive; and as for Will.
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious ne-
cessary and sober Fellow, he had made himself such
;-tt. , a Tent
a Tent of Basket-work, as I believe was never seen;
it was 120 Paces round in the Out-side, as I mea-
sur'd by my Steps; the walls were as close work'd
as a Basket in Pannels, or Squares of 32 in Number,
and very strong, standing about seven Foot high;
in the middle was another not above 22 Paces round,
but built stronger, being Eight-square in its Form,
and in the eight Corners stood eight very strong
Posts, round the Top of which he laid strong Pieces
pinn'd together with wooden Pins, from which
he raised a Piramid for the Roof of eight Rafters,
very handsome, I assure you, and join'd together ve-
ry well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few iron
Spikes, which he made himself too, out of the old
Iron that I had left there, and indeed this Fellow
Qiew'd abundance of Ingenuity in several Things,
, V1 f which he had no Knowledge of; he made him, a
Forge, with a Pair of wooden Bellows to blow the
Fire; he made himself Charcoal for his Work, and
he form'd out of one of the Iron-Crows, a mid-
dling good Anvil to hammer upon; in this Manner
he made many Things, but especially Hooks, Sta-
ples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges: But to return to
the House; after he had pitch d the Roof of his in-
nermost Tent, he worked it up between the Rafters
with Basket-work, so firm, and thatch'd that over
again so ingeniously with Rice-straw, and over that
a large Leaf of a Tree, which cover'd the Top,
that his House was as dry as if it had been til'd or
slated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the
Basket-work for him.
The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-too,
all round this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay
from the twoand thiry Angles to the top posts of the
inner House, being about twenty Foot Distant; so
that there was a Space like a Walk, within the outer
Wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty
Foot wide.
The
The inner Place he partition'd off with the same
Wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into
six Apartments, so that he had six Rooms on a
Floor; and out of every one of these there'was a
a Door, first into the Entry or Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into the Space or Walk.tKat
was round it; so that Walk was also divided into
six equal Parts, which served not only for Retreat,
but to store up any Necessaries which the Family had
Occasion for, These six Spaces not taking up the
whole Circumference, what other Apartments the
outer Circle had, were thus order'd: As soon as
you were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you
had a short Passage strait before you to the Door of
the inner House, but on either Side was a wicker Par-
tition, and a Door in it, by which you went, first,
into a large Room or Store-house, twenty Foot wide,
and about thirty Foot long, and thro'that into ano-
ther not quite so long , so that in the outer Circle
. was ten handsome* Rooms,-fix of which were only
to be come at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent,
and served as Closets, or retiring Rooms to the res-
pective Chambers of the inner Circle; and four large
warehouses or Barns, or %what you please to call
them, which went in thro'one another, two on ei-
ther Hand of the passage, that led thro' the outer
Door to the inner Tent.'
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was ne-
ver seen in the World; nor a House, or Tent, so
neatly contriv'd, much less, so built. In this great
Bee-hive liv'd the three Families, that is to fay,
Will. Atkins and his Companion; the. third wag kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with three Children;
for she was, it seems, big with Child when he dy'd,
and the other two were not at all backward to give
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean,
as to their Corn, Milk, Grapes, &c. and when they
kill'd a Kid, or found a Turtle on the Shore; so
that they all liv'd well enough, tho' it was true,
••• '.,.-.. they,

they were not so industrious as the other two, as
has been observed already.
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz,.
That as for Religion, I don't know that there was
any Thing of that Kind among them; they pretty
often indeed put one another in Mind that there was a God, by the very common Method of Seamen,
viz.. Swearing by his Name: Nor were their poor
ignorant Savage Wives much the better for having
been marry'd to Christians, as we must call them;
for as they knew very little of God themselves, so
they were utterly uncapable of entring into any
Discourse,with their Wives about a God, or to talk any
thing to them concerning Religion.
The utmost of all the Improvement which lean say
the Wives had made from them, was., that they had
taught them to speak Englishpretty well, and all the
Children they had, which was near 20 in all, were
taught to speak English too, from their first learning
to speak, tho'they at first spoke it in a very broken
Manner, like their Mothers. There were none of
these Children above six Years old when I came thi-
ther, for it was not much above seven Years that they
had fetch'd these five Savage Ladies over, but
they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had
all Children, more or less: I think the Cook's Mate's
Wife was big of her Sixth Child; and the Mothers
were all a good Sort of well-govern'd, quite, labo-
rious Women, modest and decent, helpful to one
another, mighty observant and subject to their Ma-
sters, I cannot call them Husbands; and wanted
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian Re-
ligion, and to be legally marry'd; both which were
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or,
at least, in consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in
general, and pretty much of my five Runagate Eng-
lijb, I must say something of the Spaniards, who were
the main Body of th? Family; and jn whose Stpry
'." !V 'there
there are some Incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many Discourses with them about
their Circumstances, when they were among the Sa-
vages: They told me readily, that they had no In-
stances to give of their Application or Ingenuity in
that Country; that they were a poor miserable de-
jected Handful of People; that if Means had been put
into their Hands, they had yet so abbndon'd them-
selves to Despare, and so sunk under the Weight of
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but
Starving: One of them, a grave and very sensible
Man, told me, he was convinced they were in the
wrong; that it was not the Part of Wise Men to give
up themselves to their Misery but always to take
Hold ofthe Helps which Reason ofkr'd, as well for present Support, as for future Deliverance. He told
me that Grief was the most senseless insignificant
Passion in the World vfor that it regarded only Things
past, which were generally impossible to be recalled or to be remedy'd, but had no View to Things to
come, and had no Share in any Thing that look'd
like Deliverance, but rather added to the Affliction,
than proposed a Remedy: And upon this, he repeat-
ed a Spanish Proverb; which tho' I cannot repeat in
just the fame Words that he spoke it, yet I remember
I made it into an English Proverb of my own, thus:
/* Trouble to be troubPd,
Is to have your ^trouble doubt'd.
He ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little
Improvements I had made in my Solitude; my un-
weary'd Application, as he call'dit, and howl had
made a Condition, which in its Circumstances, was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand Times
more happy than theirs was, even now, when they
were all together: He told me, it was remarkable,'
that Englishmen had a greater Presence of Mind in
their Distress, than any People that ever he met with;
that their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguese, were
the worst Men in the World to struggle with Mis-
fortunes; for that their first Step in Dangers, after
the common Efforts are over, was always to despair,
lie down under it, and die, without rousing their
Thoughts up to proper Remedies for Escape.
I told him, their Cafe and mine differ'd exceeding-
ly, that they were cast upon the Shore without Ne ceslaries, without Supply of Food, or of present Su-
stenance, 'till they could provide: That it is true,
I had this Disadvantage and Discomfort, that I was
alone; but then the Supplies I had providentally
thrown into my Hands, by the unexpected driving of
the Ship on Shore, was such a Help as would have en-
courag'd any Creature in the World to have apply'd
Jfimself as I have done, Seignior, says the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your Cafe, we should
never have gotten half those Things out of the Ship
as you did: Nay says he, we should never have found
Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to
have gotten a Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail;
and how much less should we have done, said he, if
any of us had been alone? Well, I desir'd him to a-
bate his Compliment, and go on with the History of
their coming on Shore, where they landed; he told
me, they unhappily landed at a Place where there
were People without Provisions; whereas had they
had the common Sense to have put off to Sea again,
and gone to another island a little farther, they had
found Provisions, tho' without People; there being
an Island that Way, as they have been told, where
there was Provisions, tho' no People; that is to say,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and had filled the island with Goats and Hogs
at several Times: where they have bred in such Mul-
titude?, and where Turtle and Sea-Fowls were in
such Plenty, that they could ha' been in no Want of
Flesh, tho they had found no Bread; whereas here,
they were only sustained with a few Roots and Herbs, which they understood not, and which had noSub-
stancG
fiance in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them
sparingly enough, and who could treat them no bet-
ter, unless they would turn Canibals, and eat Mens
Flesh, which was the great Dainty of their Country.
They gave me an Account how many Ways they
strove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to
teach them rational Customs in the ordinary Way of
Living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon
them, as unjust, that they who came there for Assi-
stance and Support, should attempt to set up for In-
structors of those that gave them Bread; intimating,
it seems, that none should set up for the Instructors of others, but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they were ma-
ny Days without any Food at all; the Island they
were upon being inhabited by a Sort of Savages
that lived more indolent, and for that Reason were
less supplied with the Necessaries of Life, than
they had Reason to believe others were* in the same
Part of the World; and yet they found, that these
Savages were less ravenous and voracious, than those
who had better Supplies of Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with
what Demonstrations of Wisdom and Goodness the
governing Providence of God directs the Event of
Things in the World; which, they said, appear'd
in their Circumstance; sot if pressed by the Hard-
ships they were under, and the Barrenness of the
Country where they were, they had scarch'd after a
better Place to live in; they had then been out of
the Way of the Relief that happen'd to them by my
Means.
Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages,"
who they liv'd among, expected them to go out with
them into their Wars : And it was true, that, as they
had Fire-Arms with them, had they not had the Di-
sastet to lose their Ammunition, they should not
have been serviceable only to their Friends, but have
made themselves terrible both to Friends and Ene-
mies; but being without Powder and Shot, and yet
in a Condition, that they could not in Reason deny
to go out with their Landlords to their Wars ; when
they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a
worse Condition than the Savages themselves; for
they neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they
use those the Savages gave them; so that they
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of
their Enemy; and then indeed the three Halbards
they had, were of use to them; and they would of-
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with those
Halbards and sliarpned Sticks put into the Muzzles
of their Muskets: But that for all this they were
sometimes surrounded with Multitudes, and in great
Danger from their Arrows; till at last they found the
Way to make themselves large Targets of Woodj
which they covered with Skins of wild Beasts, whose
Names they knew not ; and these covered them from
the Arrows of the Savages; that notwithstanding these,
they were sometimes in great Danger, and were once
five of them knock'd down together with the Clubs of
the Savages, which was the Time when one of them
was taken prisoner ; that is to say, the Spaniard,
whom f^had relieved, that at first they thought had:
been killed : But when afterwards they heard he was
taken prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventur'd
their Lives to have rescued him.
They told me, That when they were so knock'd
down, the rest of their Company rescued them, and
stood over them, fighting till they were come to them-
selves, all but him who they thought had been dead;
and then they made their Way with their Halbards
and Pieces, standing close together in a Line, thro' a
Body of above a thousand Savages, beating down all
that came in their Way,got the victory over their E-
nemies, but to their great Sorrow, because it was with
the loss of their Friend; who, the other party find-
ing him alive, carry'd off with some others, as I
gave an Account in my former.
They described most affectionately, how they were
surpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and
Companion in Misery, who they thought had been
devour'd by wild Beasts of the Worst Kind, (ws.)
by wild Men; and yet how more and more they
were surpriz'd with the Account he gave them
his Errand, and that there was a Christian in any .
Place near, much more one that was able, and had
Humanity enough to contribute to their Delive-
rance.
They described how they were astonished at the
Sight of the Relief I sent them, and at the Appea-
rance of Loves of Bread, Things they had not seen
since there coming to that miserable Place; how of- >"'
ten they crossed it, and blessed ic as Bread sent from .
Heaven; and what a reviving Cordial it was to
their Spirits to taste it; as also of the other Things
I had 'sent for their supply, and after all, they /4
would have told me something of the Joy they were
in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them
away to the Person and Place from whence all these
new Comforts came; but they toldAit was im-'"'"
possible to express it by words, for their excessive Joys naturally driving them to unbecoming Extravagan-
cies, they had no way to describe them, but by cel-
ling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no
Way to give Vent to their Passion* suitable to rhe
Sense that was upon them; that in some it 'worked
one Way, and in some another; and that jotsie of
them, thro' a Surprize of Joy, would burst^ out into
Tears; others be stark mad, and o hers inlmeuiarely
faint. This Discourse extreaml) affected me, and
call'dtomy mind Fridays Exracy, who he met his
Father, and the poor People's Lxtacy, when I cook them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire : The
Mace of the Ship's Joy, when tie found fcmself de- X
H livered
livered in the Place where he expected to perish ;
and my own Joy when after 28 Years Captivity, I
found a good Ship ready to carry me to my own
Country. All these Things made me more sensible
of the Relation of those poor Men, and more affe-
cted with it.
Having thus given a View of the State of Things,
as I found them, I must relate the Heads of what I
did for these People, and the Condition in which I
left them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that
they would be troubled no more with the Savages;
or that if they were, they would be able to cut
them off, if they were twice as many as before;
so they had no Concern about that. Then I en-
tred into a serious Discourse with the Spaniard
whom I call Governor, about their Stay in the
Island; for as I was not come to carry any of
them off, so it would not be just to carry off
some, and leave others, who perhaps would
be unwilling to stay, if their Strength was dimi-
nished.
On the other Hand, I told them, I came to esta-
blish them there, not to remove them; and then I
let them know, that I had brought with me Relief
of sundry Kinds for them; That I had been at a
great Charge to supply them with all Things neces-
Airy, as well for their Convenience, as their Defence;
and that I had such and such particular persons with
me, as well to encrease and recruit their Number, as
by the particular neceflary Employments which they
were bred to, being Artificers, to assist them in those
Things, in which, at present, they were to seek.
They were altogether when I talked thus to them %
and before I delivered to them the Stores I had
brought, I ask'd them one by one, If they had en-
tirely forgot, and burry'd the first Animosities that
had been among them, and should shake Hands with
one another, and engage in a strict Friendship and
Union
Union of Interest, that so there might be no more
Misunderstanding or Jealousies.
Will' Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and
good Humour, said, They had met with Afflic-
tions enough to make them all sober, and Enemies
enough to make them all Friends; that for his Part
he would live .'and die with them ; and was so far from designing any Thing against the Spaniards, that
he own'd they had done nothing to him, but what
his own mad Humour made necessary, and what he
would have done, and perhaps much worse in their
Case; and that he would ask them Pardon, if I de-
sired it, for the foolish and brutish Things he had
done to them; and was very willing and desirous of
living in Terms of entire Friendship and Union with
them; and would do any Thing that lay in his Pow-
er to convince them of it; and as for going to Eng~
land, he car'd not if he did not go thither these twen-
ty Years.
The Spaniards said, They had indeed at first dis-
arm'd and excluded Witt. Atkins and his two
Countrymen for their ill Conduct, as they had let
me know ; and they appeal'd to me, for the Near, ffity they were under to do so: But that Witt. Atkins WuU
had behav'd himself so bravely in the great Fight . *
they had with the Savages, and on several Occasions
since; and had shew'd himself so faithful to, and con-
cerns! for, the general interest of them all, that they
had forgotten all that was past, and thought he
merited as much to be trusted with Arms, and sup-
ply M with Necessaries as any of them; and that they
had testify'd their Satisfaction in him, by commit-
ting the Command to him, next to the Governout
himself. And as they had an entire Confidence in
him and all his Countrymen, so they acknowledge
they had merited that Confidence by all the Methods
that honest Men could merit to be valued, and trusted;
and they most heartily embrac'd the Occasion of
H a giving
giving me this Assurance, that they would never
have any Interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friend-
ship, we appointed the next Day to dine all together;
and indeed we made a splendid Feast: I caused the
Ships Cook and his Mate to come on Shore, and
dress our Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had
on Shore, assisted. We brought on Shore six Pieces
of good Beef, and four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's
Provision, with our Punch-Bowl, and Materials to
fill it; and in particular, I gave them ten Bottles of
French Claret, and ten Bottles of English Beer; Things
that neither the Spaniards, or the English Men had
tasted for many Years; and which, it may be suppo-
sed, they were exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids,
which the Cooks roasted; and three of them were
sent cover'd up close on Board the Ship, to the
Seamen, that they might Feast on fresh Meat from
on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on
Board.
After this Feast, at which we were very inno-
cently merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods,
wherein, that there might be on Dispute about di-
viding, I shew'd them there was sufficient for them
all; and desired that they might a;L:'take an equal
Quantity of the Goods that were for wearing; that
is to say, equal when made up; as first, I distribu-
ted Linnen sufficient to make every one of them four
Shirts ; and at the Spaniards Request afterwards, made
up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them,
having been what, as I may say, they had long since
forgot the Use of or what it was to wear them.
1 allocted the thin English Stuffs,,which I mention'd
before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock,
which I judged fittest for the Heat of the Season;
cool and loose, and order'd, that whenever they de-
cayed, they should make more, as they thought fit s
The
The like for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats,
&c.
I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satissaction,
sat upon 'the Countenances of all these poor Men,
when they saw the Care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them; they told me, I
was a Father to them, and that having such a Cor-
respondent as I was, in so remote a Part of the
World, it would make them forget that they were
left in a desolate Place ; and they all voluntarily en-
gaged to me not to leave the Place without my
consent. Then I presented to them the People I had brought
with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and
the two carpenters, all of them most necessary Peo-
ple; but above all, my general Artificer, than whom
they could not Name any Thing that was more use-
ful to them. And the Taylor, to shew his Concern
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my
Leave, made them every one a Shirt the first Thing
he did; and which was still more, he taught the Wo-
men, not only how to sew and stitch, and use the
Needle, but made them assist to make the Shirts for
their Husbands, and for all the rest.
As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention, how
useful they were,for they took in Pieces all my clumsy
unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient
Tables, Stools, Bedsteads, Cup-boards, Lockers?
Shelves, and every thing they wanted of that Kind'
But to let them fee how Nature made Artificers
at first, I carried the Carpenters to fee Will- Atkins's
Basket-house, as I call'd it, and they both own'd
they never saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity
before; nor any Thing so regular, and so handily
built, at least of its Kind: And one of them, when
he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about
to me, I am sure, says he, that Man has no need of
us, you need do nothing but give him Tools.
Then"
Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools,
and gave every Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and
a Rake, for we had no Harrows or Plows; and to
every separate Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad
Ax, and a Saw; always appointing, that as often
as any were broken, or worn out, they should be
supplyd without grudging, out of the general Stores
that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Ch'slels, Knives,
Scissors, and all forts of Tools, and Iron-work,
they had without Tale, as they requir'd, for no Man
would care to take more than they wanted, and he
must be a Fool that would waste or spoil them, on
any Account whatever; and for the Use of a Smith,
I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for a Supply.
My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I
brought them, was such, even to profusion, that
they could not but rejoice at them, for now they
could march as I used to do, with a Musket upon
each Shoulder, if there was occasion, and were able
to fight a Thousand Savages, if they had but some
little Advantages of Situation, which also they
could not miss of if they had Occasion.
I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, whose
Mother was starved to Death, and the Maid also;
the was a sober well educated religious young Wo-
man, and behav'd so inoffensively, that every one
gave her a good Word', she had indeed an unhappy
Life with us, there being no Woman in the Ship but
herself; but she bore it with patience. After a while
seeing Things so well order'd, and in so fine a Way of
thriving upon my island, and considering that they
had neither Business or Acquaintance in the East-In-
dies, or Reason for taking so long a Voyage: I say,
considering all this, both of' them came to me, and
desired I would give them leave to remain on the Island,
and beenter'd among my Family, as they call'd it.
1 apr.ed to it readily, and they had a little
Plat of Ground allotted to, them, where they had
three
three Tents or Houses set up, surrounded with a
Basket-work, Pallisado'd like Atkins's, A adjoining to , --
his Plantation: Their Tents were contriv'd, so that
they had each of them a Room apart to lodge in,
and a middle Tent like a great Store-house to lay
all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in; and now
the other two Englishmen remov'd their Habitation
to the fame Place, and so the island was divided in-
to three Colonies and no more, viz.. the Spaniards,with old Friday, and the first Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill; which was, in a Word,
the capital City; and where they had so enlarg'd
and extended their Works, as well under as on the
outside of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho' perfectly
conceal'd, yet full at large, Never was there such;
a little City in a Wood, and so hid, I believe, in a-
ny Part of the World ,• for I verily believe, a thou-
sand Men might have rang'd the Island a Month,
and if they had not known there was such a Thing,
and look'd on purpose for it, they would not have
found it; for the Trees stood so thick and so close,
and grew so fast mattered into one another, that ^;
nothing but cutting them down first ,could discover 4
the Place; except the only two narrow Entrances,
where they went in and out, could be found, which
was not very easy; one of them was just down at
the Waters Edge on the Side of the Creek, and
it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to the
Place; and the other was up the Ladder at twice,
as I have already formerly described it; and they
had a large Wood thick planted, also, on the
Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an Acre,
which grew apace, and cover'd the Place from all
Discovery there, with only one narrow Place be-
tween two 'freest not easy to be discover'd,to enter -
on that Side.
The other Colony was that of IViU. Atkins's,
where there were four Families of Englijh Men,
H 4 I mean
I mean those I had left there, with their Wives
and Children; three Savages that were Slaves ; the
Widow and Chi dren of the English Man that was
killed ; the young Man and the Maid ; and by the
Way, we made a Wife of her also, before two went
away : There were also the two Carpenters and the
Taylor, who I brought with me for them; also the
Smith, who was a very necessary Man to them, espe-
cially as a Gunsmith, to take care of their Arms;
and my other Man, who I call'd, Jack of all Trades;
who was in himself as good, almoslas 20 Men, for
he was not only a very ingenious Fellow, but a ve-
ry merry Fellow, and before I went away, we mar-
ried him to the honest Maid that came with the
Youth in the Ship,;I mention'd before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French Ecclesiastic
that I had brought with me out of the Ship's Crew,
who I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a
Roman, and perhaps it may give Offence to some here-
after, ifl leave any Thing extraordinary upon Record,
of a Man, who, before I begin, I must, (to set him
Out in just Colours) represent in Terms very much to
his Disadvantage, in the Account of Protestants; as
first, that he was a Papist ;.secondly, a popish priest J
and thirdly, a French popish Priest.
But Justice demands of me to give him a dueCha-
raster ; and I must say, he wasa grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person ; exact in his Life, extensive
in his Charity, and exemplar in almost every Thing he
did; what then can any one say, against my being ve-
ry sensible of the Value of such a Man, notwithstand-
ing his Prov ision? Tho'it may be my Opinion, per-
haps, as well as the Opinion of others, who shall read
this, that he was mistaken.
The first Hour that I began to converse with
him, after he had agreed to go with me to the
East-Indies, I found Reason to delight exceedingly
in
it} his Conversation; and he first began with me about
Religion in the most obliging Manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God, (and
at that he cross'd his Breast) sav'd my Life, but
you have admitted me to go this Voyage in your
Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me
into your Family, giving me an Opportunity of
free Conversation. Now Sir, says he, you fee by
my Habit, what my profession is, and I guess by
your Nation what yours is : I may think it is my
Duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost En-
deavours, on all Occasions, to bring all the souls I
can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to em-
brace the Catholick Doctrine; but as I am here
under your permission, and in your Family, I am
bound in Justice to your kindness, as well as in
Decency and good Manners, to be under your Go-
vernment; and therefore I shall not, without your
Leave, enter into any Debates on the Point of Re-
ligion, in which we may not agree, sarther than you
shall give me Leave-
I told him, his Carriage was so modest, that I
could not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we
were such People as they cali'd Hereticks; but that
he was not the first Carholick that I had convers'd
with, without falling into any Inconveniencies, or
carrying the Questions to any height in Debate:
That he should not find himself the worse us'd for
being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did
not converse without any Dislike on either Side up-
on that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours.
He reply'd, that he thought all our Conversation
might be easily separated from Disputes : That it
was not his Business to cap Principles with every
Man he discoursed with; and that he rather desired me to converse with him as a Gentleman, than as
a Religieuse; that if I would give him leave at any-
time to discourse upon religious Subjects, he would
readily comply with it; and that then, he did not
doubt
doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own
Opinions, as well as he could; but that without my
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any
such thing.
He told me further, that he would not cease to
do all that became him in his Office, as a Priest, as
well as a private Christian, to procure the Good of
the Ship, and the Safety of all that was in her;
and tho' perhaps we would not join with him, and
he could not pray withus, he hop'd he might pray
for us, which he would do upon all Occasions. In
this Manner we convers'd, and as he was of a most
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour; so he was, if I
may be allow'd to say so, a Man of good Sense, and
as I believe, of great Learning.
He gave me a most diverting Account of his
Life, and of the many extraordinary Events of it; of
many Adventures which had befallen him in the
few Years that he had been abroad in the World,
and particularly this was very remarkable, (viz.)That during the Voyage he was now engag'd in,
he had the Misfortune to be five times siiip'd
and unsliip'd, and never to go to the Place whither
any of the Ships, he was in, were at first design'd:
That his first Intent was to have gone to Martinico,
and that he went on board a Ship bound thither, at
St. Malo; but being forc'd into Lisbon, by bad Wea-
ther, the Ship receiv'd some Damage, by running
aground in the Mouth of the River Tagus, and was
oblig'd to unload her Cargo there; that finding a
Portuguese Ship there bound to the Maderas, and
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet
with a Vessel there bound to Martinico; he went on
board,in order to sail to the Maderas ; but the Master
of the Portuguese Ship being but an indifferent Mari-
ne^ had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove
to Fial; where, however he happen'd to find a very
good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and
therefore resolved not to go to the Maderas, but to
load Salt at the Isleof May, and to go away to New-
foundland: He had no Remedy in this Exigence, but
to go with the Ship, and had a pretry good Voy-
age as far as the Banks, so they call the Place
where they catch the fish, where meeting with a
French Ship, bound from France to Quebec,in the Ri-
ver of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry
provisions, he thought hesliould have an Opportunity
to compleat his first Design: But when he came to
Quebec,the Master of the Ship dy'd, and the Ship
proceeded no farther; so the next Voyage he ship a
himself for France, in the Ship that was burnt, when
we took them up at Sea, and then flipped them with us
for the East-Indies, as I have already said: Thus he
had been disappointed in five Voyages, all, as I
may call it, in one Voyage, besides what I shall
have occasion to mention farther of the fame Per-
son-
But, I shall not make Digressions into other Mens
Stories, which have no Relation to my own. I re-
turn to what concerns our Affair in the Island: He
came to me one Morning, for he lodg'd among us,
all the while we were upon the island ; and it hap-
pen'd to be just when I was going to visit the
English Men's Colony, at the farthest Part of
the Island; I fay, he came to me and told
me, with a very grave Countenance, that he had
for two or three Days desir'd an Opportunity of
some Discourse with me, which he hop'd should
not be displeasing to me, because he thought it
might in some measure correspond with my gene-
ral Design, which was the Prosperity of my new
Colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more
than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God's
Blessing.
I looked a little surpriz'd at the last Part of his
Discourse, and turning a little short, How Sir! said
I, tan it be said, that we are not in the Way of God's
Blessing, after such visible Assistances, and wonderful
Do*
Deliverances as we have seen here, and of whichI
have given you a large Account?
If you had pleas'd Sir, said he with a World of Mo-
desty, and yet with great Readiness, to have heard me,
you would have found no room to have been dis-
pleas'd, much less to think so hard of me, that I
should suggest, that you have not had wonderful
Assistances and Deliverances; and I hope, on your
Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's Blessing,
and your Design is exceeding good, and will pros-
per : But Sir, said he, tho' it were more so, than is
even possible to you, yet there may be some among
you that are not equally right in their Actions: And
you know, that in the Story of the Children of Is-
rael, one Achan in the Camp remov'd God's Blessing
from them, and turn'd his Hand so against them,
that six and thirty of them, tho' not concern'd in the
Crime, were the Object, of Divine Vengeance, and
bore the Weight of that punishment. I was sensibly touch'd with his Discourse, and
told him his Inference was so just, and the whole
Design seem'd so sincere, and was really so religious
in its own Nature, that I was very sorry I had in-
terrupted him, and begged him to go on; and in the
mean Time, because it seem'd, that what we had
both to say, might take up some Time, I told him,
I was going to the EnglishMens Plantations, and
ask'd him to go with me, and we might discourse
of it by the Way: He told me, he would more wil-
lingly wait on me thither, because there partly, the
Thing was acted, which he desired to speak to me
about; so we walk'd on; and I press'd him to be
free and plain with me, in what he had to say.
Why then Sir, says he, be pleased to give me
Leave to lay down a few Propositions, as the Foun-
dation of what I have to say, that we may not
differ in the general Principles, tho' we may be of
some differing opinions in the Practice of Particu-
lars. First, Sir, tho' we differ in some of the Do-
ctrinal
ctrinal Articles of Religion; and it is very unhappy
that it is so, especially in the Case before us, as I
stall stew afterwards: Yet there are some general
Principles in which we both agree, (viz.) first, That
there is a God; and that this God having given
us some stated general Rules for our Service and o- bedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to
offend him; either by neglecting to do what he has
commanded, or by doing what he has expressly for-
bidden: And let our different Religions be what
they will, this general Principle is readily own'd by
us all, That the Blessing of God does not ordinarily
follow a presumptuous finning against his Command;
and every good Christian will be affectionately con-
cerns to prevent any that are under his Care, li-
ving in a total Neglect of God and his Commands.
It is not your Men being Protestants, whatever my
Opinion may be of such, that discharges me from
being concern'd for their Souls, and from endeavour-
ing, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little Distance from and Enmity with their Maker,
as possible; especially if you give me Leave to med-
dle so far in your Circuit.
I could not yet imagine what he aim'd at, and
told him, I granted all he had said, and thank'd
him, that he would so far concern himself for us;
'j' and begged he would explain the Particulars of what
he had observ'd, that like Joshua, to take his own
ParableJ might put away the accursed Thing from us.
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the Liberty
you give me; and there are three Things, which,
if I am right, must stand in the Way of God's Bles-
sing upon your Endeavours here, and which I should rejoice for your Sake, and their own, to fee remov'd:
And, Sir, fays he, I promise myself, that you will
fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name
them ; especially because I stall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great Ease, and very
much to your Satisfaction, be remedy'd.
He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civili-
ties, but went on. First, Sir, says he, you have
here four Euglijh Men, who have fetch'd Women
from among the Savages, and have taken them as
their Wives, and have had many Chi dren by them
all, and yet are not marry'd to them after any sta-
ted legal Manner, as the Laws of God and Man
require; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both,
no less than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To
this, Sir, fays he, I know you will object; that there
was no Clergyman or Priest of any Kind, or of any
profession, to perform the Ceremony; nor any Pen
and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of
Marriage, and have it signed between them. And
I know also, Sir, what the Spaniard Governour has
told you; I mean of the Agreement that he obliged them to make, when they took these Women, (viz.)That they should chase them out by Consent, and
keep separately to them; which, by the way, is no-
thing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Wo-
men, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them-
selves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matri-
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the Parties to take
one another, as Man and Wife, but in the formal and
legal Obligation, that there is in the Contract, to
compel the Man and Woman at all Times, to own
and acknowledge each other . obliging the Man to
abstain from all other Women, to engage in no o-
ther Contract while these subsist; and on all Occa-
sions, as Ability allows, to provide honestly for
them and their Children; and to oblige the Woman
to the same, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on
their Side.
Now, Sir, fays he, these Men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
Women, disown their Children, leave them to perish,
and take other Women, and marry them whilst these
are
are living. And here he added, with some warmth,' How, Sir, is God honour'd in this unlawful Liber-
ty ? And how shall a Blessing succeed your Endea-
vours in this Place, However good in themselves, and
however sincere in your Design, while these Men, who
at present are your Subjects, under your absolute
Government and Dominion, are allow'd by you to
live in open Adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the Thing itself, but
much more with the convincing Arguments he sup-
ported it with; for it was certainly true, that tho'
they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal
Contract on both Sides, made before witnesses, and
confirm'd by any Token, which they had all agreed
to be bound by, tho' it had been but the breaking a
Stick between them, engaging the Men to own these
Women for their Wives, upon all Occasions; and
never to abandon them or their Children, and the
Women to the fame with their Husbands, and had
been an effectual, lawful Marriage in the Sight of
God; and it was a great Neglect that it was not
done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young
Priest, by telling him, that all that Part was done
when I was not here, and they had Jiv'd so many
Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it
was past Remedy, they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he,asking your Pardon for such Freedom,
you are right in this, that it being done in your
Absence, you could not be charg'd with that Part
of the Crime: But I beseech you, flatter not your
self, that you are not therefore under an Obligation
to do your utmost now, to put an End to it. How-
can you think, but that, let the Time past lie on
who it will, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie
entirely upon you? Because it is certainly in your
Power now to put an End to it, and in no Body's
Power but your's. x
\ I was
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
bir I imagin'd, that by 'putting an End to it, he
meant that I shodd part them, and not suffer them
to live together any longer; And I said to him, I
could not do that by any Means, for that it would
put the whole Islai.d into Confusion: He scem'd lur-
priz'd, that I should so tar mistake him. No, Sir,
say,he, I do not mean, that you should now seperate
them, i>lh legally and: ffictually marry them now;
and as. Sir, my way of marrying them may not be so ealy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effec-
tual, even by your own Laws, so your Way may be
as well before God, and as valid among Men; I
mean, by a written contract, signed by both Man
and Woman, and by all the Witnelles present, which
all the Laws of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amaz'd to lee so much true Piety, and so
much Sincerity of Zeal, besides the unusual Impar-
tially in his Discourse, as to his own Party or Church,
and such a true Warmth for the preserving People
that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; I
say, for preserving them from transgressing the Laws
of God; the like of which, I had indeed not met
with any where: But recollecting what he had said,
of marrying them by a written contract, which I
knew would stand too; I return'd it back upon him,
and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and on his Part very kind, that I would dis-
course with the Men upon the Point now, when I
came to them: And I knew no Reason why they
(hou'd scruple to let him marry them all, which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authen-
tick and valid in England, as if they were marry'd
by one of our own Clergymen. What was af-
terwards done in this Matter, I shall speak of it by
itself.
I then press'd him to tell me what was the second
Complaint which he had to make, acknowledging,
that I was very much his Debtor for the first, andT
thank'd
thank'd him heartily for it. He told me, he would
•use the same Freedom and Plainness in the second,
and hop'd I would take it as well : And this was,
that notwithstanding these English Subjects of mine,
as he calledthem, had lived with those Women for
almost seven Years, and had taught them to speak
English,and even to read it; and that they were, as he
perceiv'd, Women of totlerable Understanding, and
capable of Instruction; yet they had not to this
Hour taught them any thing of the Christian Reli-
gion; no, not so much as to know that there was a
God, or a Worlhip, or in what Manner God was
to be served, or that their own idolatry, and wor-
shipping they knew not who, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable Neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to Account
for, and perhaps at last take the Work out of their
Hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warm-
ly. I am perfwaded, fays he, had those Men lived
in the savage Country, whence their Wives came;
the Savages would have taken more Pains to have
brought them to be Idolaters, and to worship the
Devil, than any of these Men, so far as he couldsee,
had taken with them to teach them the Knowledge
of the true God. Now, Sir, said he, tho' I do noE
acknowledge your Religion, or you mine, yet we
should be glad to seethe Devil's Servants, and the
subjects of his Kingdom, taught to know the ge-
neral Principles of the Christian Religion; that they
might, at least, hear of God, and of a Redeemer,
and of the Resurrection, and of a future State9
Things which we all believe ,• they had at least been
so much nearer coming into the Bosom of the true
Church, than they are now in the publick Profession
of Idolatry and Devil-Worship*
I could hold no longer ; I took him in my Arms,
and embraced him with an Excess of Passion : How
jar, said I to him, have I been from understanding
I the
the most essential Part of a Christian, (viz,,) to love
the Interest of the Christian Church, and the good
of other Mens Souls? I scarce have known what be-
longs to being a Christian. O, Sir, do not say so, re-
ply d he, this Thing is not your Fault. No, says 1,
but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you?
'Tis not too late yet, said he, be not too forward to
condemn yourself: But what can be done now, said
i, you see I am going away? Will you give me leave,
said he, to talk with those poor Men about it? Yes,
with all my Heart, said 1, and will oblige them to
give heed to what you say, too: As to that, said he,
we must leave them to the Mercy of Christ; but
*cis our Business to assist them, encourage them, and
instruct them; and if you will give me Leave, and
God his Blessing, I do not doubt but the poor igno-
rant Souls shall be brought home into the great Cir-
cle of Christianity, if not into the particular Faith
that we all embrace, and that even while you stay
here: Upon this, I said, I shall not only give you
Leave, but give you a thousand Thanks for it.
Whae foliow'd on this Account, I shall mention also
again in its Place.
I now press'd him for the third Article, in which
we were to blame. Why really, says he, it is of the
same Nature, and I will proceed, asking your Leave,
with the same plainness as before; it is about your
poor Savages yonder, who are, as I may say, your
conquer'd Subjects It is a Maxim, Sir, that is,
or ought to be receiv'd among all Christians of
what Church, or pretended Church soever, (viz.)That Christian Knowledge ought to be propagated by all
possible Means, and on all possible occasions: 'Tis on
this Principle that our Church fends Missionaries into
Persia, India, and China, and that our Clergy, even
of the superior Sort, willingly engage in the most
hazardous Voyages, and the most dangerous Resi-
dence among Murderers and Barbarians* to teach
them
them the Knowledge of the true God, and to bring
them over to embrace the Christian Faith. Now,
Sir, you have such an Opportunity here, to have six
or seven and Thirty poor Savages brought over
from Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Ma-
ker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass
such an Occasion of doing Good, which is really
worth the Expence'of a Man's whole Life. I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
Word to say7 I had here ^ Spirit of true Christian
Zeal for God aud Religion before me, let his par-
ticular Principles be of what kind soever; as for me, I had not so much as entertain'd a Thought
of this in my Heart before, and I believe should not
have thought of it; for I looked upon these Sava-
ges as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work
for them to do, we would ha' used as such, or
would have been glad to have transported them to
any other Part of the World; for our Business was
to get rid of them, and we would all have been sa-
tisty'd, if they had been sent to any Country, so they
had never seen their own: But to the Case, I say, I
was confounded at his Discourse, and knew, not
what Answer to make him. He look'd earnestly at
me, seeing me in some Disorder j Sir, says he, I shall
be very sorry, if what I have said gives you any Of-
fence: No, No, fays I, I am offended with no Body
but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not on-
ly to think that I should never take any Notice of
this before, but with reflecting what Notice I am a-
ble to take of it now. You know, Sir, said I, what
Circumstances I am in, I am bound to the East-Indies,
in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to whom it
would be an unsufferab'e Piece of Injustice to detain
their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Vi-
ctuals and Wages upon the Owner's Account. It is
true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and
if I stay more, I must pay 3 /. Sterling per Diem
I a Des
Demorage, nor can I stay upon Demorage above eight
Days more, and I have been here thirteen Days al-
ready, so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this,
Work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind'
here again, in which case, if this single Ship should ©
miscarry in any Part of her Voyage, I should be
just in the same Condition that I was left in here at
first, and from which I have been so wonderfully de-
livered.
He own'd the Cafe was very hard upon me, as to
my Voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the Blessing of saving seven and thirty Souls,
was not worth my venturing all I had in the World
for? I was not so sensible of that as he -was, and I
return'd upon him thus; why, Sir, it is a valuable
Thing, indeed, to be an Instrument in God's Hand
to convert seven and thirty Heathens to the Know-
ledge of Christ but as you are an Ecclesiastic, and
are giving over to that Work, so that it seems na-
turally to fall into the Way of your profession ; how
is it then; that you do not rather offer yourself to
undertake it, than prels me to it?
Upon this he sae'd about, just before me, as we
walk d along, and putting me'to a full Stop, made
me a very low Bow; I most heartily thank God and
you, Sir, fays he, for giving me so evident a Call to
so blessed a Work; and if you think your self dis-
charg'd from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will
most readily do it, and think it a happy Reward
for all the Hazards and Difficulties of such a bro-
ken,disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that
I may dropt at last into so glorious a Work.
I difeover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while
he spoke this to me; his Eyes sparkl'd [like Fire, his
Face glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if
he had been falling into Fits; in a Word, he was
fir'd with the Joy of beingembark'd in such a Work.
Ipaus'd a considerable while, before I could tell what
to say to him, for I was really surpriz'd to find a
Man of such Sincerity and Zeal, and carry'd out in
his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not
of his profession only, but even of any Protection what-
soever. But after I had considered it a while, I asked: him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture on the single Consideration of an Attempt on
thole poor People, to beloc'd up in an unplanted I- '-;
stand for, perhaps, his Life 5 and at last might not
know whether he should be able to do them any
Good, or not?
He turned short upon me, and ask'd me what I cal-
l'd a Venture? Pray, Sir, said he, what do think I
consented to go in your Ship to the East-Indies for?
Nay,said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians: Doubtless it was/aid he; and do -
you think, if I can convert these seven and thirty
Men to the Faith of Christ, it is not worth my
time, tho' I should never be fetch'd off the island again? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth
to save so many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life
of twenty more of the same Profession? Yes, Sir,
fays he, I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin
Thanks all my Days, if I could be made the least
happy instrument of saving the Souls of these poor
Men, tho' I was never to set my Foot offiof this '.'
Island, or see my native Country any more. But .."
since you will honour me, says he, with putting
me into this Work, for which I will pray for you all
the Days of my life i I have one humble Petition to
you, didhe, besides. What is that, said I? Why,
says he, it is, that you will leave your Man Friday
with me, to be my Interpreter to them, aud to assist
me; for without some Help I cannot speak to them,
or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many Reasons; he had been the Companion
C ij* ]
of my Travels; he was not only faithful to me, but
sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had i.
resolv'd to do something considerable for him, if he
out liv'd me, as is was probable he would. Then r'' I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Prote-
stant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another profession ; and he would never,
while his Eyes were open, believe that his old Ma-
ster was an Heretick. and would be damn'd; and ,'
this might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Princi-
ples, and so turn him back again to his first Idola-
try.
However, a sudden Thought reliev'd me in this
Strait, and it was this; I told him, I could not
say that I was willing to part with Friday on any
Account whatever ; tho' a Work that to him was
of more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of
much more Value than the keeping or parting with
a Servant; But on the other hand, I was perstiad-'
ed that Friday would by no Means consent to part
with me, and I could not force him to it without
his consent, would ,manifest Injustice; because I had
promised I would never put him away, and he had
promis'd and engag'd to me that he would never leave
me, unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concern'd at it, for he had
no rational Access to these poor People, seeing he
did not understand one Word of their Language, nor
they one Word of his .- To remove this Difficulty, I
told him, Friday's Father had learn'd Spanish, which
I found he also understood, and he should serve him
for an Interpreter; so he was much better satisfied,
and nothing could persuade him but he would stay -
to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another, and"very happy,^ Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objecti-
ons. When we come to the EnglishMen, I sent
for them all together, and after some Account gi-
ven
ven them of what I had done for them, viz.. what
necessary Things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were sensible of,
and very thankful for; I began to talk to them of
the scandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already
taken of it, and arguing how unchristian and irre-
ligious a Life it was.; 1 first ask'd them if they were
married Men or Batchelors? They soon explain'd
their Condition to me, and shewed me that two of
them were Widowers, and the other three were sin-
gle Men or Batchelors. I ask'd them with what
Consciences they could take these Women and lie
with them, as they had done, call them their Wives,
and have so many Children by them, and not be
marry'd lawfully to them.
They all gave me the Answer that I expected, viz..
that there was no Body to marry them; that they
agreed before the Governor to keep them as their
Wives; and to keep them and own them as their
Wives; and they thought,as Things stood with
them, they were as legally married as if they had
been married by a Parson, and with all the Forma-
lities in the World.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in
the Sight of God, and were bound in Conscience
to keep them as their Wives, but that the Laws of
Men being otherwise, they might pretend they were
not married, and so desert the poor Women and
Children hereafter; and that their Wives being
poor desolate Women, friendless and moneyless,
would have no way to help themselves. I therefore
told them, that unless I was assured of their honest
Intent, I could do nothing for them ; but would
take Care that what I did should be for the Wo-
men and their Children without them; and that un-
less they would give some Assurances that they would
marry the women, I could not think it was conve-
I 4 nienc
[
nient they should coutinue together as Man and
Wife, for that it was both scandalous to Men, and
offensive to God, who they couldAthink would bless
them, if they went on thus.
All this went on as I expected, and they told me,
especially Will. Atkins, who seemed now to speak for
the rest, that they loved their Wives as well, as if
they had been born in their own Native Country,
and would not leave them upon any Account what-
ever; and they did verily believe their Wives were
as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost
of their Skill, as much for theirs and for their Chile dren, as any Women could possibly do, and they
would not part with them on any Account: And
Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any Man
would take him away, and offer to carry him home
to England, and make him Captain of the best Man
of War in the Navy\ he would not go with him, if
he might not carry his Wife and Children with
him; and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he
would be married to her now, with all his Heart.
This was just as I would have it; the Priest was
not with me at that Moment, but was not far off:
So to try him satther, I told him I had a Clergyman
with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next Morning, and bid him consider of
it, and talk with the rest; he said, as for himself,
he need not consider of it at all, for he was very
ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minister with
me, and he believ'd they would be all willing also.
I then told him, that my Friend the Minister was
it French Man, and could not speak Englijb, but that
I would act the Clerk between them : He never so
much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Pro-
testant, which was indeed what I was afraid of:
But, I say, they never enquired about it. So we
parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and WillAtkins went in to talk with his Companions, I de-
fir'd the French Gentleman not to say any thing
to them, till the Business was thorough ripe, and
I told him what Answer the Men had given me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they all came
to me, and told me, they had been considering what
I had said; that they were very glad to hear I had
a Clergyman in my Company, and they were ve-
ry willing to give me the Satissaction I defir'd,
and to be formally married as soon as I pleas'd,
for they were sar from desiring to part with their
Wives, and that they meant nothing but what
was very honest when they chose them; so I ap-
pointed them to meet me the next Morning, and
that in the mean time they should let their Wives
knew the meaning of the Marriage-Law; and that
it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but also
to oblige them, that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen.
The "Women were easily made sensible of the
Meaning of the Thing, and were very well satisfied
with it, as, indeed, they had Reason to be ; so they
sail'd not to attend all together at my Apartment x
the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergy-
man; and tho' he had not on a Minister's Gown,
after the Manner of England, or the Habit of a
Priest, after the Manner of France; yet having a
black Vest something like a cassock, with a Sasti
round it, he did not"look very unlike a Minister-,
and as for his Language, I was his Interpreter.
But the seriousness of his Behaviour to them,
and the scruples he made of marrying the Women,
because they were not baptiz'd, and professed Chri-
stians, gave them an exceeding Reverence for his
Person; and there was no need after that, to en-
quire whether he was a Clergyman or no.
Indeed, I- was afraid his Scruple would have
been carry'd so far, as that he would not have
marry'd them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I
was able to say to him, he resisted me, though
modestly, r
modestly, yet very steadily, and at last refused ab-
solutely to marry them, unless he had first talk'd
with the Men, and the Women too ; and though
at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I
agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the Sin-
cerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know, that
I had acquainted him with their Circumstances, and
with the present Design; That he was very willing
to perform that Part of his Function, and marry
them as I had desir'd -, but that before he could do
it, he must take the Liberty to talk with them.
He told them, That in the Sight of all indifferent
Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Society,
they had liv'd all this while in an open Adulte-
xj; and that it was true, that nothing but the
Consenting to marry, or effectually separating them
from one another now, could put an End to it; but
there was a Difficulty in it too, with respect to the
Laws of Christian Matrimony, which he was not
fully satisfy'd about, viz. That of marrying one
that is a professed Christian, to a Savage, an Ido-
later, and.a Heathen, one that is not baptized ; and
yet that he did not fee that there was Time left for
it to endeavour to persuade the Women to be bap-
tiz'd, or to profess the Name of Christ, whom they
had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without
which they could not be baptiz'd.
He told them, He doubted they were but indif-
ferent Christians themselves that they had but lit-
tle Knowledge of God, or of his Ways; and there-
fore he could not expect that they had said much
to their Til ives on that Head yet; but that unless they would promise him to use their Endeavours
with their Wives,to persuade them to become Chri-
stians, and would as well as they could instruct
them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that re-
deem'd them, he could not marry them; for he
would
would have no Hand in joyning Christians with
Savages; nor was it consistent with the Principles
of the Christian Religion; and was indeed expres-
ly forbidden in God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deli-
vers it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as
near his own Words as I could, only sometimes ad-
ding something of my own to convince them how
just it was, and how I was of his Mind; and I al-
ways very saithfully distinguish'd between what
I said from my self, and what were the Clergyman's
Words. They told me, it was very true, what the
Gentleman had said, that they were but very in-
different Christians themselves, and that they had
never talk'd to their Wives about Religion. Lori,
Sir I says Will. Atkins, How should we teach them
Religion> Why we know nothing cur selves; and
besides, Sir, said he, should we go to talk to them
of God, and Jesus Christ, and Heaven and Hell, 'twould
be to make them laugh at u.% and ask us, What
we believe our selves ? And if we should tell them
we believe all the Things that we speak of to them,
such as of good People going to Heaven, and wick-
ed People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where
we intended to go our selves, that believe all this,
and. are such wicked Fellows, as we indeed are >
Why, Sir, said Will, 'tis enough to give them a
Surfeit of Religion at first Hearing: Folks must
have some Religion themselves, before they pre-
tend to teach other People: Will Atkins, said I to
him-, though I am afraid what you say has too
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife
that she's in the wrong? That there is a God and
a Religion better than her own; that her Gods
are Idols, that they can neither hear nor speak
that there is a great Being that made all Things,
and that can destroy all that he had made; that
he rewards the Good, and punishes the Bad; and
that we are to be judged by him at last for all we
do here: You are not so ignorant, but even Na-
ture it self will teach you that all this is true, and
I am satisfy'd you know it all to be true, and be-
lieve it yourself.
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what Face
can I say any thing to my Wife of all this, when
{he will tell me immediately it cannot be true?
Not true I /saidI, What do you mean by that >
Why Sir, said he, She will tell me it cannot be
true, that this God I {hall tell her of, can be just,
or can punish, or reward, since I am not punilh'd,
and sent to the Devil, that have been such a
wicked Creature as she knows I have been, even
to her, and to every Body else; and that I should
be suffered to live, that have been always acting so
contrary to what I must tell her is Good, and to
what I ought to have^one,
Why, truly, Atkins,said T, I am afraid thou
fpeak'st too much Truth; and with that 1 let the
Clergyman know what Atkivs had said, for he was
impatient to know: 01 said the Priest; tell him
there is one Thing will make him the best Minister
in the World to his Wife, and that is, Repentance
for none teach Repentance lite true Penitents: He:
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualifv'd to instruct his Wife:;
He will be then able to tell her, that there is not
only a God, and that he is the just Rewarder of
Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being,
and with infinite Goodness and Long-suffering for-
bears to punish those that offend; waiting to be
gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner,
but rather that he should return and live; that
oftentimes suffers wicked Men to go on a long
Time, and even reserves Damnation to the gene-
ral- Day of Retribution; that it is a clear Evi-
dence of God, and of a future State, that righteous
Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men
their punishment, till they come into another
World i
World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife
the Doctrine of the Resurrection, and of the last
Judgment; let him but repent for himself, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his
Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who look'd very se-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily perceive,
was more than ordinarily affected with it : When be-
ing eager, and hardly suffering me to make an End,
I know all this, Master, says he, and a great deal more ,
but I han't the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife i
when God, and my own conscience knows, and my
Wife will be an undeniable Evidence against me,
that I haveliv'd, as if I had never heard of a God,
or,future State, or any Thing about it; and to talk';
of my repenting, ALAS! A And with that he fetch'd a r
deep Sigh; and I could fee, that Tears stood in his
Eyes; 'Tis past all that with me. Past it! AT- )
K I NS,said 1, What dost thou mean by that? I
know well enough what I mean, Sir, says he, I mean
*tis too late, and that is too true.
I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he
said; the poor zealous Priest (I must call him so; for,
be his Opinion what it will, he had certainly a most
singular affection for the Good of other Mens Souls >
and it would be hard to think he had not the like
for his own) I say, this zealous affectionate Man,
... could not refrain Tears also: But, recovering him-
self, he said to me, ask him but one Question, Is he
easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes
it were not so ? I put the Question sairly to Atkins,
and he answered with a great deal of passion, How
could any Man be easy in a Condition that certainly
must end in eternal Destruction? that he was far from
being easy, but that on the contrary, he believ'd it
would one Time or other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I, Why, he said
he believ'd he should, one Time or other, cut his
Throat to put an End to the Terror of it.
The
The Clergyman shook his Head with a great Con-
cern in his Face, when I told him all this: but turn-
ing quick to me upon it, says he, If that be his Cafe,
you may assure him it is not too late; Christ will
give him Repentance: But pray, fays he, explain
this to him, That as no Man is saved but by Christ
and the Merit of his Passion, procuring divine Mercy
for him, how can it be coo late for any Man to re-
ceive Mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond
the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy? Pray tell
him, there may be a Time when provok'd Mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear,jbut that 'tis never too late for Men to ask Mer-
cy ; and we that ace Christ's Servants are commanded
to preach Mercy at all times, in the Name of Jesus
Christ, to all those that sincerely repent; so that 'cis( ne-
ver too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
Earnestness; but it seemed as if he turn'doff the Dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me, he would go
and have some Talk with his Wife; so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest, I perceiv'd they
were all stupidly ignorant as to Matters of Religion;
much as I was when I went rambling away from my
Father; and yet that there were none of them back-
ward to hear what had been said; and all of them se-
riously promised that they would talk with their Wives
about it, and do their Endeavour to persuade them to
turn Christians.
The Clergyman smil'd upon me, when I reported
what Answer they gave, but said nothing a good
while; but, at last., (baking his Head, We that are
Christ's Servants, Ashe, can go on further s than to
exhort and instruct; and when Men comply, submit
to the Reproof, and promise what we ask 'tis all we
can do; we are bound to accept their good Words:
But believe me, Sir, said he, whatever you may have
known of the Life of that Man you call Will. Atkins,
I be-
I believe he is the only sincere Convert among them;
I take that Man to be a true Penitent; I wont despair
of the rest; but that Man is patiently struck with
the Sense of his past Life ; and I doubt not, but when
he comes to talk religion to his Wife, he will talk
himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach o-
thers, is sometimes the best way of teaching ourfelvesj
knew a Man, added he, who having nothing but a sum-
mary Notion of Religion himself, and being wicked
and profligate to the last Degree in his Life, made a
thorough Reformation in himself, by labouring to
convert a Jew^_ If that poor Atkins begins but once
to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his Wife, my Life
for it, he talks himself into a thorough Convert,
makes himself a Penitent:And who knows what may
follow?
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their Wives to
embrace Christianity, he marry'd the other three
Couple; but Will Atkins and his Wife were not yec
/ come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting a while,
was curious to know were Atkins was gone; and,
turning to me, sap he, I entreat you, Sir, let us walk
out of your Labyrinth here, and look; I dare say,
we snail find this poor Man somewhere or other,talk-
ing seriously to his Wife, and teaching her already
something of Religion- I began to be of the same
Mind; so we went out together, and I carry u him
a Way which none knew but my self, and where the
Trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to
lee thro' the Thicket of Leaves, and far harder to
see in, than to see out; when, coming to the Edgeof
the Wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny Savage
Wife sitting under the Shade of a Bush, very eager
in Discourse ; I stop'd short till my Clergymen came
up to me; and then having showed him where they
were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
good while.
We
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Heavens;
then down to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then
to himself, then to her, to the Woods, to the Trees,
Now, says my Clergyman, you fee my Words are
made good ; the Man preaches to her; mark him,
now he is telling her, that our God has made him,
and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, the
Woods, the Trees, etc.I believe he is, said I; im-
mediately we perceiv'd Willdtkins start up upon his
Feet, fall down on his Knees, and life up both his
Hands: We suppose he said something, but we
could not hear him, it was too far for that; he did
not continue kneeling half a Minute, but comes and
sits down again by his Wife, and talks to her again.
We perceiv'd then the Wom^n very attentive, but
whether she said any thing or no we could not tell,
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could
fee the Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's
Cheeks, and I could hardly forbear my self; but it
was a great Affliction to us both, that we were not
near enough to hear any Thing that pass'd between
them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear
of disturbing them, so we resolved to fee an End of
this Piece of still Conversation, and it spoke loud
enough to us, without the Help of Vo ce. He
sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and
talk'd again earnestly to her; and two or three
Times we could fee him embrace her most passio-
nately; another time we saw him take out his Hand-
kerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again,
with a kind of Transport very unusual; and after se-
veral of these Things we fee him, on a sudden, jump
up again and lend her his Hand to help her up,
when immediatly, leading her by the Hand a Step
or two, they both kneel'd down together, and conti-
nu'd so about two Minutes.
My
My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, St. P A UL St. PAUL! behold he prayeth;
I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I errtreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we
might see an End of the Scene, which to me, I
must confess, was the most affecting, and yet the
most agreeable that ever I saw in my Life: Well,
he strove with himself and contain'd himself for a
while, but was in such Raptures of Joy, to think that
the poor Heathen Woman was become a Christian,
that he was not able to contain himself; he wept se-
veral Times, then throwing up his Hands and crossing
his Breast, said over several Things Ejaculatory and
by way of giving God Thanks for so miraculous a
Testimony of the Success of our Endeavours; some
he spoke softly, and I could not well hear; others
audibly, some in Latin, some in French; then two or three Times the Tears of Joy would interrupt him*
that he could not speak at all: But I beg'd that he
would compose himself, and let us more narrowly and
fully observe what was before us, which he did
for a Time, and the Scene was not ended there
yet; for after the poor Man and his Wife were ri-
sen again from their Knees, we obscrv'd he stood
talking still eagerly to her; and we observ'd by her
Motion, that she was greatly affected with what
he said, by her frequent lifting up her Hands, lay-
ing her Hand to her Breast, and such other Pos-
tures, as usually express the greatest seriousness and Attention. This continu'd about half a Quar-
ter of an Hour, and then they walk'd away too s
so that we could fee no more of them in that Si-
tuation.
I took this interval to talk with my Clergyman:
And first, I told him, I was glad to fee the Parti-
culars we had both been witnesses to ; that tho' I
was hard enough of Belief in such Cases, yet
that I began to think it was all very sincere here,
K both
both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant
they might both be and I hop'dsuch a Beginning
would have a yet more happy End and who
knows, said I, but these two may in Time, by In-
struction and Example, work upon some of the
others > Some of them ! said he, turning quick upon
me, ay, upon all ofthem depend upon it, if those
two Savages, for he has been but little better, as
you relate it, mould embrace Jesus Christ, they
will never leave 'till they work upon all the rest;
for true Religion is naturally communicative, and
he that is once made a Christian, will never leave
a Pagan behind him, if he can help it. Iown'd;
it was a most Christian Principle to think so, and
a Testimony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous
Heart in him: But, my Friend, said I, will }rou
give me Leave to start one Difficulty here? I can-
not tell how to object the least Thing against that
affectionate Concern, which you show for the turn-
ing the poor People fom their Paganism to the
Christian Religion: But how does this comfort
you, while these People are in your Account out
of the. Pale of the Catholick Church, without
which you believe there is no Salvation ; so that
you esteem these but Hereticks, and for other
Reasons as effectually lost as the Pagans them-
selves.
, To this he answered with abundance of Candor
and Christian Charity thus :, Sir, I am a Catholick
of the Roman Church, and a Priest of the Order
of St. Benedict,and I embrace all the Principles of
the Roman Faith : But yet if you will believe me,
and that I do not speak in Compliment to you, or in
resped to my Circumstances and your Civilities; I
fay, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call
your selves reform'd, without some Charity: I
dare not say, tho' I know it is our Opinion in general ., I
say, I dare not say that you cannot be saved : I will
by no Means limit the Mercy of Christ so far, as
to think that he cannot receive you into the
Bosom of his Church in a Manner to us unpercei-
vable, and which it is limpoflible for us to know
and I hope you have the same Charity4br us; I
pray daily for your being all restor'd to Christ's
Church, by whatsoever Methods he, who is All-
wise, is pleas'd to direct; In the mean Time, sure
you will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman,
to distinguish far between a Protestant and a Pa-
gan; between one that calls on Jesus Christ, tho'
in a way which I do not think is according to the
true Faith : and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows
no God, no Christ, no Redeemer at all; and if
you are not within the Pale of the Catholick
Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to
it than those that know nothing at all, of God or
his Church: I rejoice therefore when I see this poor
Man, who you fay has been a Profligaf e, and al-
most a Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus
Christ, as we suppose he did, tho' not fully en-
lighten'd; believing that God, from whom every
such Work proceeds, will sensibly touch his Heart,
and bring him to the further Knowledge of the
Truth in his own Time and if God shall influence
this poor Man to convert and instruct the ignorant
Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he shall
be cast away himself h and have I not Reason then
to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, tho' they may not be brought quite
home into the Bosom of the Catholick Church,
just at the time when I may desire it? leaving it
to the Goodness of Christ to perfect his Work in
his own time, and his own Way : Certainly I would rejoice if all the Savages in America were brought
like this poor Woman to pray to God, tho' they
K 2 were
were to be all Protestants at first, rather than they
should continue Pagans and Heathens; firmly be-
lieving, that he that had bestow'd that first Light
to them, would further illuminate them with a
Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them in-
to the Pale of his Church when he should see
good.
I was astonished at the Sincerity and Temper of
this truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the Power of his Reasoning; and it presently
occur'd to my Thoughts, that if such a Temper
was universal, we might be all Catholick Christi-
ans, whatever Church or particular Profession we
join'd to, or join'd in; that a Spirit of Charity
would soon work us all up into right Principles
and in a Word, as he thought that the like Charity
would make us all Catholicks, so I told him I be liev'dj had all the Members of his Church the like
Moderation, they would soon be all Protestants,
And there we left that Part, for we never disputed
at all.
However, I talk'd to him another way, and takinghim by~ the Hani, my Friend, says I, I wish all
the Clergy of the Roman Church were blest with
such Moderation, and had an equal Share of your
Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion; but I
must tell you, that if you should preach such Do-
ctrine in Spain, or Italy, they would put you into
the Inquisition.
It may be lo, said he, I know not what they
might do in Spain or Italy, but I will not say they
would be the better Christians for that Severity,
for I am sure there is no heresy in too much Cha-
rity.
"Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our
Business there was over ; so we went back our own
Way; and when we came back, we found them
waiting
waiting to be called in: Observing this, I ask'd my
Clergyman if we should discover to him that we
had seen him under the Bush, or no; and it was
his Opinion we should not; but that we would talk to him first, and hear what he would say to
us; so we call'd him in alone, no Body being
in the Place but our selves; and I began with him
thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had
you > What was your Father?
W. A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir,
my Father was a Clergyman.
R. C. What Education did he give you >
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but
I despised all Education, Instruction, or Correction,
like a Beast as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon says, he that despises Re-
proof is brutijl),
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish, indeed, I murder'd .
my Father; for God's sake, Sir, talk no more about,
that, Sir, I murder'd my poor Father.
Pr. Ha! a Murderer !*
* Here the Priest started (for I interpreted every
Word as he spoke it) aid look'd pale, It seems .
he believ'd that Will had really killedhis own
Father,R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so;
Will Atkins, explain yourself, you did not kill your
Father, did you, with your own Hands >
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat; but I
cut theThread of all his Comforts, and stiorten'd his
Days; I broke his Heart by the most ungrateful un-
natural Return, for the most tender affectionate
Treatment that ever Father gave, or' Child could
receive.
K 3 R. C.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father
to extort this Confession; I pray God give you
Repentance for it, and forgive you that, and all
your other Sins; but I ask'd you, because I see,
that tho' you have not much Learning, yet you are
not so ignorant as some are, in Things that are
Good; that you have known more of Religion a
great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Con-
fession that I make about my Father, Conscience
does; and when ever we come to look back up*
on our Lives, the Sins against our indulgent Pa-
rents are certainly the first that touch, uslthe
Wounds they make lie deepest, and the Weight
they leave will lie heaviest upon the Mind, of
all the Sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for
me Atkins,I cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins every Shore, every Hill, nay,
I may say, every Tree in this Island is witness
to the Anguish of my Soul, for my Ingratitude
and base Usage of a good tender Father; a Father
much like yours, by your Description; and I mur-
der'd my Father as well as you, Will Atkins; but
think, for all that, my Repentar.ee is short of
yours too* by a great deal.
* I would have said more,if IconU have
rejlrain'd my Pajjions; but I thought this
poor Man's Repentance was so much smee^
rer than mine, that I was geivg to leave
ofthe Discourse and retire, for I was
surpriz'd with what he said . and thought,
that infead os my going about to teach
stwi piftruft him, the Man was made a
Teacher and InJlruR'er to we, in a most °-
surprizing and unexpeBed manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected with it, and said to
me, Did I not say, Sir, that when this Man was
converted, he would preach to us all > I tell you,
Sir, if this one Man be made a true penitent, here will be no need of me, he will make Chri-
stians of all in the Island. But having a little
compos'd my self, I renew'd my Discourse with
Witt. Atkins.
But WILL, said I, How comes the Sense of this
Matter to touch you just now?
IV. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has struck a Dart thro' my very Soul; I have
been talking about God and Religion to my
Wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian of her, and she has preach'd such a
Sermon to me, as I shall never forget while I
live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach'd
to you but when you were moving religious Ar-
guments to her, Conscience has flung them back
upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to
be resisted.
R. C. Pray Will, let us know what passed be-
tween you and your Wife, for I know something
of it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full
Account of it; I am too full to hold it, and yet
have no Tongue to express it; but let her have
said what she will, and tho' I cannot give you an
Account of it, this I can tell you of it, that I re-
solve to amend and reform my Life.
K 4 R. C.
R. C. But tell us some cf it. How did you be, gin Will? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe,
that's certain,, She has preach'd a Sermon, indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the Nature cf our
Laws about Marriage, and what the Reasons were,
that Men and Women were obliged to enter into
such compacts, as it was neither in the Power of
one or other to break; that otherwise, Order and
Justice could not be maintain'd, and Men would
run from their Wives, and abandon their Chil-
dren, mix confusedly with one another, and nei-
ther Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be
settled by legal Descent.
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will; could you
make her understand what you meant by Inheri-
tance and Families? they know no such Thing
among the Savages, but marry any how, without
regard to Relation, Consanguinity, or Family;
Brother and Sister; nay, as I have been told;
even the Father and Daughter, and, Son and the
Mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed, and
my Wife assures me of the contrary, and that they
abhor it; perhaps, for any sarther Relations they
may not be so exact as we are; but {he tells me
they never touch one another in the near Relations
you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say, to what you
told her.
W. A. She said, {he lik'd it very well, and it
was much better than in her Country.
R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage
was?
W. A. Ay, 'ay, there began all our Dialogue.
I ask'd her if {he would be marry'd to me our
Way I
Way > She ask'd me what way that was? I told
her/that Marriage was appointed of God; and here n '.:
we had a strange Talk together, indeed, as ever Man and Wife had I believe.
N. B. Tibs s Dialogtie between W. Atkins and
his Wife, as I took it down in writing,
just after he told it me, was as follows.
Wife: Appointed by your God! why have you
a God in your Country >
V. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Coun-
try.
Wife. No, your God in my Country my Coun- .
try have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you
who God is; God is in Heaven, and made the
Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in
them is. i.l0f-t^
Wife. No makee de Earth; no, you God make
Ear . n o make my Country, *
* W. A. laugheda little at her Exprejjion of
God not making her Country.
Wife. No Laugh, why Laugh me? This no
thing to laugh. +
t He was justly reprov'd by his Wife, forests
was more serious than heatfrst.
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any
more my Dear.
Wife. Why you fay, you God make all.
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole
World, and you, and I, and all Things for he
, &
is the only true God, there is no God but him,
he lives for ever in Heaven.
Wise. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed, but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to
acquaint thee with any Thing before, but have
lived without God in the World my self.
Wise. What have you de great God in you
Country, you no know' kno' him? No say O to him?
No do good Thing for him? That no Apossible!
W. A. It is too true, tho' for all that, we live
as if there was no God in Heaven, or that he had
no Power on Earth.
Wise. But why, God let you do so? Why he
no makee you good live.
W. A. It is all our own Fault.
Wise. But you say me, he is Great, much Great,
have much great Power; can makee kill, when he
will; why he no makee kill when you no serve
him? No say O to him? No be good Mans,
W. A. That is trueb he might strike me Dead,
and I ought to expect it, for I have been a wick-,
ed Wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and
does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wise. But then, do no you tell God Tankee
for that too.
W. A. No, indeed, I have not thank'd God
for his Mercy, any more than I have fear'd God
for his Power.
Wise. Then you God no God; me no think,
believe, he be such one, great much Power, Strong;
no makee kill you tho' you makee him much
Angry, W. A. What? Will my wicked Life hinder you
from believing in God! what a dreadful Creature
am Iand what a sad Truth is it, that the horrid
Lives of Christians hinders the Conversions of Hea-
thens?
* Wise.
Wise. How me tink you have great much God
t up there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting?
:4 can he tell? Sure he no tell what you do?
f She points up to Heaven.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things;
he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what
we think, tho' we do not speak.
Wife, What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great Damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
W. Where be then the muchee great Power
strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can fay for
it and this proves him to be the true God he is
God and not Man; and therefore we are not con-
sum'd. +
t Here Will Atkins toldus he was struck with
Horror, to think how he could tell his Wife so
clearly that God fees, and hears, and knows
the secret Thoughts of the Heart, and all that
we do; and yet that he had dar d to do all the
vile Things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! what you call that >
W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pi-
ties and spares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or
no great able.
W. A. Tes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and
sometimes to shew his Justice and Vengeance, he
lets fly his Anger to destroy Sinners, and make
Examples many are cut off in their Sins.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet, than he tell
you may be that he no make you kill, so you make
de Bargain with him, you do bad Thing, he no
be angry at you, when he be angry at other
Mans.
W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presump-
tions upon his Goodness; and. he would be infi-
nitely just if he destroyed me as he has done other
Men."
Wise. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead,
What you say to him for that, you no tell him
Tar kee for all that too?
W, A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog,
that's true.
Wise. Why he no makee yo u much good better,
you fay he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the World;
'tis I have deform'd my self, and abus'd his Good-
ness, and, made my self an abominable Wretch.
Wise. I wish you makee God know me, I no
makee him angry, I no do bad wicked thing.
Here Will Atkins said his Heart sttni within
him, to hear a poor untaught Creature de-'
sire to be taught to know God, and he such
a wicked wretch, that he could not say ore
word to her about God, but what the Re-
proach of'his own Carriage would make mojl
irrational to her to believe; nay, that al-
ready Jlxihad told him, that she could not
believe in God, because he that was so wick-
ed was not destroyed.W. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could
teach you to know God, not God to know you;
for he knows you already, and every Thought in
your Heart.
Wife.
Wise. Why then he know what I say to you now > He know me wish to know him; how shall
me know who makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach thee,' I
cannot teach thee -, I'll pray to him to teach thee
to know him, and to forgive me that I am un-
worthy to teaeh thee.
The poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her
desiringhim to makeher know God, and her
wtjhing to know him, that, he said, he sell
down on his kneesbefore her, and prayedto
God to enlighten her Mind with the saving
Knowledge ofJesus Christ, and to pardon his
Sins, and accept of his being the unworthy In-
strument of histruSing her in the Principles of
Religion; after which he fate down by her
again, and their Dialogue went on. N. B.
This was the Time when we saw him
kneel down, and lift up his Hands.
Wife. What you put down the Knee for? What you hold up the Hand for? What you say > Who
you speak to > What is that?
t£*z . W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of
my Submiflion to him that made me; I said O to
him, as you call it, and as you fay, your old Men
do to their Idol Benamuckee that is, I pray'd to
him.
Wife.What you say O to him for >
W. A. I prayed to him to open your Eyes, and
your Understanding, that you may know him, and
be accepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
. W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things.
Wife. But no he hear what you fay >
Wm At
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and pro-
mis'd to hear us.
Wife.Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he
bid you? What! you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak, but he has
revealed himself many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Loss to make her under-
stand, that God has reveal'd himself to us
by his Word, and what his Word was: But
at last he told it her thus.
W. A.,God has spoken to some good Men in
former Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words;
and God has inspired good Men by his Spirit;
and they have written all his Laws down in a
Book.
Wife. Me no understand that, where is Book f
W. A. Alas, my poor Creature, I have not this
Book; but I hope I stall one Time or other get it for you to read it.
Here he embracedher with great AffeEiion , but
with inexpressible Grief, that he had not a
Bible.
Wife But how you makee me know, that God
teachee them to write that Book?
W. A. By the same Rule that we know him to be
God.
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know.
W. A. Because he teaches and commands no-
thing but what is good, righteous, and holy ,
and pretends to make us perfectly good, as well as
per-
perfectly happyi and because he forbids and com-
mands us to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil
in it self, or evil in its Consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me sain
fee ; if he teachee all good Thing, forbid all wic-
ked Thing, he reward all good Thing, punish all
. wicked Thing, he make all Thing, he give all Thing,
he hear me when I say O to him, as you go do just
now; he makee me good, If I wish be good, he spare
me, no makee kill me, when I no be good; all this
you say he do; yes he be great God ; me take, think,
believe him be great God; me say O to him too
with you, my Dear.
Here the poor Man could forbear no longer; but
raising her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd
to God, aloud, to instruct her in the Knowledge of
himself by his Spirit, and that by some good Provi-
dence, if possible, she might sometime or other
come to have a Bible, that she might read the
Word of God, and be taught by it to know
him.
This was the Time that we saw him lift her up by
the Hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as a-
bove.
They had several other Discourses it seems after
this, too long to set down here; and particularly she made him promise, that since he confess his own i
Life had been a wicked abominable Course of Pro-
vacation against God, that he would reform it, and
not make God angry anymore, least he should make
him dead, as she call'd it, and then she should be
left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better; and least he should be miserable, as he
had told her wicked Men should be after Death.
This was a strange Account, and very affecting
to us both, but particularly to the young Clergy-
man; he was indeed wonderfully surpriz'd with it,
but
but under the greatest Affliction imaginable, that
he could not talk to her, that he could not speak
English to make her understand him ; and as she spoke
but very broken English, he could not understand her ,-
However he turn'd himself to me, and told me, that
he believed there must be more to do with this Wo-
man than to marry her: I did not understand him at
first, but at length he explain'd himself, (viz.) that
flie ought to be Baptiz'd.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was
for going about it presently No, no, hold Sir,said
he, tho' I would have her be Baptiz'd by all Means,
yet I must observe, that Will. Atkins, her Husband,
has indeed brought her in a wonderful Manner to be
willing to embrace a religious Life, and has given her
just Ideas of the Being of a God, of his Power, Ju-
stice, Mercy; yet I desire to know of him, if he had
said any Thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the Sal-
vation of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him,
and Redemption, by him; of the holy Spirit, the
Redirection, the Last Judgment, and a future
Stated
I call'd Witt. Atkins again, and as'd him; but the
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told
us he had said something to her of all those things,
but that he was himself so wicked a Creature, and
his own Conscience so reproach'd him with his hor-
rid ungodly Life, that he trembled at the Apprehen-
sions, that herKnowIedge of him, should lessen the At-
tention she should give to those Things, and make her
rather contemn Religion than receive it: But he was
assured he said that her Mind was so dispos'd to re-
ceive due Impressions of all those Things, that if
I would but discourse with her she would make it
appear to my Satissaction, that my Labour would
not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I call'd her in, and placing my self
as Interpreter between my religious priest and the
woman, I entreated him to begin with her j but sure such a Sermon was never preach'd by a popish
priest in these latter Ages of the World; and, as Itold him, 'I' thought he had all the Zeal, all the
Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Christian, without
the Error, of a Roman Catholick; and that I took
him to be sbch a Clergy man, as the Roman Bishops
were before the Church of Rome assum'd spiritual
Sovereignty over the Consciences of Men.
In a word, he brought the poor Woman to em-
brace the Knowledge of Christ, and of Redemption
by him, not with Wonder and Astonishment only,
as she did the first Notions of a God, but with
Joy and Faith, with an Affection and a surprising
Degree of Understanding, scarce to be imagin'd, ,
much less to express'd ; and at her own Request /
she was baptiz'd,
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreat-
ed him that he would perform that Office with
some Caution, that the Man might not perceive he
was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of
other ill Consequences which might attend a Dif-
ference among us in that very, Religion, which we
were instructing the other in: He told me, that as
he had no consecrated Chappel, no proper Things
for the Office, I should lee he would do it in a
Manner that I should not know by it, that he was
a Roman Catholick my self, if I had not known it
before: And so he did; for saying only some
Words over to himself in Latin, which I could not
understand, he pour'd a whole Dish-ful of Water
upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French,
very loud, MARY, which was the Name, her Hus-
band dejir'd me to give her; for Iwas her Godfather,
I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; so that none could
know any Thing by it, what Religion he was of:
L He *
He gave the Benediction afterwards in Latin ; but
either Witt. Atkins did not know but it was in French,
, or else did not take Notice of it, at that Time.
As soon as this was over we married themand
after the Marriage was over he turn'd himself to
Will. Atkins, and in a very Affectionate Manner ex-
horted him, not only to percevere in that good Di-
sposition he was in, but to support the Convictions
that were upon him by a Resolution to reform his
Life told him it was in vain to say he repented,
if he did not forsake his Crimes: Represented to
him, how God had honoured him with being the
Instrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge
of the Christian Religion, and that he should be
careful he did not dishonour the Grace of God, and
that if he did, he would see the Heathen a better
Christian than himself; the Savage converted, and
the Instrument cast away.
He said a great many good Things to them both,
tsiMi v^vvaand then recomending them in a few Words to
God's goodness, gave them the Benediction again, I
repeating every Thing to them in .English, and
thus ended the Ceremony : I think it was the most
pleasant agreeable Day to me that ever I passed in
my whole Life.
But my Clergy-man had not done yet; his
Thoughts hung continually upon the Conversion of
the seven and thirty Savages, and fain he would have
stay'd upon the Island to have undertaken it but I
convinced him, first, that his Undertaking was im-
practicable in it self; and secondly, that perhaps I
would put it into a Way of being done in this Ab-
sence to his Satissaction * of which, by and by.
~ Having thus brought the Affair of the Island to
a narrow Compass, I was preparing to go on board
the Ship, when the young Man who I had taken out
of the samish'd Ship's Company came to me, and
told me, he understood I had a Clergyjman with
me, and that I had caused the English Men to be
-"^ married
married to the Savages, whom they called Wives•
that he had a Match too, which he desired might be
finished before I went, between two Christians, which
he hop'd would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young Woman who was
his Mother's Servant, for there was no other Chri-
stian Woman on the Island; so I began to persuade
him not to do any Thing of that Kind rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary Circum-
stance: I represented to him that he had some con-
siderable Substance in the World and good Friends
as I understood, by himself, and by his Maid also;
that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant,
but was unequal to him, she being six or seven and
twenty years old, and he not above seventeen or
eighteen; that he might very probably, with my
Assistance, make a remove from this Wilderness^and
come into his own Country again, and that then it
would be . a thousand to one but he would repent
his choice ; and the Dislike of that Circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to
fay more but he interrupted me, smiling, and sold me, with a great deal of Modesty, that I mistook in
my Guesses, that he had nothing of that Kind in
his Thoughts, his present Circumstance being me-
lancholly and disconsolate enough ; and he was very
glad to hear that I had Thoughts of putting them
in a Way to fee their.Country again, and nothing
should have put him upon staying there, but that
the Voyage I was going was so exceeding long and
hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the
Reach of all his Friends; that he had nothing to
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little Property in the Island where he was, give him
a Servant or two and some few Necessaries, and he
would settle himself here like a Painter, Waiting
the good Time, when if ever I return'd to Ettglandt
I would redeem him, and hoped I would not be un-
mindful of him when I came into England 3 that he
L 2 would
would give me some Letters to his Friends in Lon-
don, to let them know how good I had been to him,
and in what Part of the World, and what Circum-
stance I had left him in ; that he promised me, that
when ever I redeemed him, the Plantation and all the
Improvements he had made upon it, let the Value
be what it would, should be wholly mine.
His Discourse was very prettily delivered, confi.
dering his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me,
because he told me positively the Match was not
for himself: I gave him all possible Assurances that
if I liv'd to come safe to England, I would deliver
his Letters and do his Business effectually, and that
he might depend I would never forget the Circum-
stance I had left him in; but still I was impatient
to know, who was the person to be married, upon
which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades, and
his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surpriz'd, when he nam'd
the Match, for indeed I thought it very suitable;
the Character of that Man I have given already; and
as for the Maid, she was a very honest, modest, so-
ber and religious young Woman, had a very good
Share of Sense, was agreeable enough in her Person,
spoke very handsomely and to the Purpose, always
with Decency and good Manners, and not backward
to speak when any Thing required it, or imperti-
nently forward to speak when it was not her Busi-
ness i very handy and housewifely in any Thing that
was before her; an excellent Manager, and fit in-
deed to have been Governess to the whole Island;
she knew very well how to behave, to all kind of
Folks she had about her, and to better, if she had
found any there.
The Match being proposed in this Manner, we
married them the same Day, and as I was Father at
the Altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I
gave her a Portion ; for 1 appointed her and her
Husband a handfom large Space of Ground for
their
their Plantation ; and indeed this Match and the
Proposal the young Gentleman made to me to give
him a smalls Property in the Island, put me upon par-
celling it out amongst them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their Situation.
This sharing out the Land to them, I left to WiU.
Athtts, who indeed was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing Fellow; perfectly reform'd, ex-
ceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I may be
allow'd to speak positively in such a Cafe, I verily
believe, was a true sincere Penitent.
He divided Things so justly, and ib much to eve-
ry one's Satissaction, that they only desired one ge-
neral Writing under my Hand for the whole, which
I caused to be drawn up and fign'd and sealtf to
them, setting out the Bounds and Situation of every
Man's Plantation, and testifying that I gave them,
thereby, severally a Right to the whole Possession
and Inheritance of the respective Plantations or
Farms, with their Improvements, to them and their
Heirs, reserving all the rest of the Island as my own
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular
Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from
me, or in my Name, came to demand it, produc-
ing an attested Copy of the same Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I
told them I was not capable of giving them better
Rules, than they were able to give themselves;
only made them promise me to live in Love and
good Neighbourhood with one another; and so I
prepared to leave them.
One Thing I must not omit, and this is, that
being now settled in a Kind of Common- Wealth
among themselves, and having much Business in
Hand, it was but odd to have seven aud thirty ^fc-
iians live in a Nook of the Island, independent,
and indeed un-employ'd; for excepting the pro-
viding themselves Food, which they had Difficulty
enough in too, sometimes, they had no manner
of Business or Property to manage: I propos'd
therefore to the Governour Spaniard, that he should
go to them with Friday's Father, and propose to
them to remove, and either plant for themselves, or
take them into their several Families as Servants to
be maintained for their Labour, but without being
absolute Slaves, for I would not admit them to
make them Slaves by Force, by any Means, because
they had their Liberty given them by Capitulation,
and as it were Articles of Surrender, which they
ought not to break.
They most willingly embrac'd the Proposal, and
came all very chearfully along with him; so we
allotted them Land, and Plantations, which
three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose
to be employ'd as Servants in the several Families
we had settled; and thus my Colony was in a
Manner settled, as follows -, The Spaniards pos-
sess'd my original Habitation, which was the Capi-
tal City, and extended their Plantations all along
the fide of the Brook, which made the Creek that
I have so often described, as far as my Bower; and
as they increas'd their Culture, it went always East-
ward} the EvgBJb liv'd in the North-East Part,
where Will, Atkins, and his Comrades began, and
came on Southward, and South-West, towards the
back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation
had a great Addition of Land to take in, if they
found Occasion, so that they need not jostle one
another for want of Room.
All the West End of the Island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the Savages should come on
Shore there, only for their usual customary Barba-
rities, they might come and go ; if they disturbs
Body, no Body would disturb them ; and no doubt
but they were often ashore, and went away again }
for I never heard that the Planters were ever at-
tacked or disturbed any more.
It
It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hint-
ed to my Friend the Clergy-man, that the Work of
converting the Savages, might perhaps, be set on
foot in his Absence, to his Satisfaction.; and I told
him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way;
for the Savages being thus divided among the Chri-
stians, if they would but every one of them do
their part with those which came under their Hands,
I hop'd it might have a very good Effect.
He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will
do their Part; but how, says he,shall we obtain
that of them > I told him, we would call them all
together, and leave it in Charge with them, or go
to them one by one, which he thought best, so we
divided it; he to speak ro the Spaniards, who were
all Papists, and I to the English, who were all Pro-
testants; and we recommended it earnestly to them,
tt. and made them Promise, that they never would
make any Distinction of Papist or Protestant, in
their exhorting the Savages to turn Christians but
teach them the general Knowledge of the true God,
and of their Saviour Jesus Christ ; and they like-
wise promis'd us, that they would never have any
Differences or Disputes one with another, about
Religion.
When I came to W. Atkins's House,^ may call it
so, for such a House or such a Piece of Basket-
Work, I believe, was not standing in the World a-
gain; I %, when I came there, I found the young )
Woman I have mention'd aboye, and W. Atkins s
Wife, were become Intimates; and this prudent re-
ligious young Woman, had perfected the WorkW.
Atkins had begun; and thoa it was not above four
Days after what I have related, yet the new bap-
tiz'd Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as
I have seldom heard of any like her in all my Qb-
servation, or Conversation^ in the World.
It came next into my Mind in the Morning be-
fore I went to them, that amongst all the needful
L 4 '* Thing*
Things I had to leave with themAI had not left them
a Bible, in which, I shew'd myielf less considering
for them, than my good Friend the Widdpw was
for me, when she sent me the Cargo of an hundred
Pounds from Lisbon, where she pack'd up 3 Bibles,
and a Prayer-Book: However, the good Woman's
Charity had a greater Extent than ever she ima-
gin'd ; for they were reserved for the Comfort and
Instruction of those, that made much better Use of
them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my poker, and when
I came to Will.Atkins's Tent or House, and found
the young Woman, and Atkins's baptiz'd Wife, had
been discoursing of Religion together; for Witt. At-
tests told it wxe, with a great deal of Joy: I ask'd if
they were together now, and he said, Yes; so I
went into the House, and he, with me, and we
found them together very earnest in Discourse; O Sir, says Witt. Atkins, when God has Sinners to re-
concile to himself, and Aliens to bring Home, He
never wants a Messenger; my Wife has got a new
Instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was unca-
pable of that Work; that young Woman has been
lent hither from Heaven; she is enough to convert a
whole Island of Savages; the young Woman blufh'd,
and rose up to go away, but I desir'd her to fit still;
I told her, she had a good Work upon her Hands,
and I hop'd God would bless her in it.
We talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they
had any Book among them, though I did not ask -9
but I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out
my Bible; here, AsI, to Atkins, I have brought
you an Assistant that perhaps you had not before j
the Man was so confounded, that he was not able to
speak for some Time ; but recovering himself, he
takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his
Wife, here, my Dear, says he ; did not I tell you,
our God, tho' He lives above, could hear what we
said ? Here's the Book I pray'd for. when you and I
kneel'd
kneel'd down under the Bust]; now God has heard
us, and sent it; when he had said so, the Man fell
into such Transports of a passionate Joy, that be-
tween the Joy ot having it and giving God Thanks
for it, the Tears run down his Face like a Child
that was crying.
The Woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a Mistake, that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believ'd God had sent the Book upon
her Husband's Petition ; It is true, that providenti-
ally it was so, and might be taken so in a conse-
quent Sense; but I believ'd it would haye been no difficult Matter at that Time to have persuaded the
poor Woman to have believ'd, that an express Mes-
senger came from Heaven, on purpose to bring that
individual Book; but it was taserious a Matter, to
suffer any Delusion to take Place; so I turned to
the young Woman and told her we did not desire to
impose upon the new Converr, in her first, and
more ignorant understanding of Things and
begg'd her to explain to her, that God may be ve-
ry properly laid to answer our Petitions, when in
the course of his Providence, such Things are in
a particular Manner brought to pass, as we petiti-
on d for; but we do not expect returns from Hea-
ven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and
that it is our Mercy, that it is not so.
This the young Woman did aftetwards effectual-
ly ; so that there was I assure you, no Priest-craft
used here ; and I should have thought it one of the
most unjustifiable Frauds in the World, to have
had it so i but the Surprise of Joy upon WiU. At-
lanta is really not to be expressed ; and there we
may be sure, there was no Delusion : Sure, no Man
was ever more thankful in the World for any Thing
of its Kind, than he was for this Bible \ nor I believe, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a
better Principle ; and though he had been a most
profligate Creature, desperate, headstrong, outra-
gious,
gious, furious, and wicked to a great Degree ; yet
this Man is a standing Rule to us all, for the well
instructing Children, (viz.) that Parents should ne-
ver give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of the success of their Endeavours, let the Chil-
dren be ever so obstinate, refractory, or to Appear-
ance, insensible of Instruction; for if ever God in
his Providence, touches the Consciences of such,
the Force of their Education returns upon them,
and the early Instruction of Parents is not lost $
though it may have been many Years laid asleep;
but some Time or other, they may find the Benefit
of it.
Thus it was with this poor Man However igno-
rant he was, or divested of Religion and Christian
Knowledge: He found he had some to do with
now, more ignorant than himself; and that the
least Part of the Instruction of his good Father
that could now come to his Mind, was of use to
him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his Father us'd to insist much upon the inexpressible
Value of the Bible; the Privilege and Blessing of
it to Nations, Families, and Persons; but he never
entertain'd the least Notion of the Worth of it,
'till now ; when being to talk to Heathens, Savages,
and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of the written
Oracle for his Assistance.
The young Woman was very glad of it also for
the present Occasion, tho' she had one, and so had
the Youth on board our Ship among their Goods,
which were not yet brought on Shore; and now ha-
ving said so many Things of this young woman, I
cannot omit of telling one Story more of her, and
my self, which has something in it very informing
and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young
woman was reduced; how her Mistress was starved to Death, and did die on board that unhappy Ship
we
i
we met at Sea ; and how the whole Ship's Company
being reduc'd to the last Extremity; the Gentlewo-
man, and her Son, and this Maid, were first hardly
used as to Provisions; and at last totally neglected
and starved ; that is to say, brought to the last Ex-
tremity of Hunger.
One Day being Discoutsing with her upon the
Extremities they fuffer'd, I ask'd her if she could
describe by what she had felt, what it was to
starve, and how it appear'd; she told me, she
believ'd she could ; and she told her Tale very di-
stinctly thus,
"First, Sir, said she, we had for some Days sar'd
"exceeding hard, and suffered very great Hunger s
"but now at last, we were wholly without Food
** of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine,
"and a little Water. The first Day, after I had
"receiv'd no Food at all, I found my self towards
"Evening, first empty and sickish at my stomach, "and nearer Night mightily enclin'd to yawning
"and sleepy ; I laid down on a Couch in the greac
"Cabin to sleep, and slept about three Hours, and
"awak'd a little refresh'd ; having taken a Glass
"of Wine when I lay down; after being about
'* three Hours awake, it being about five a-Clock
"in the Morning, I found myself empty and my
** Stomach sickish, and lay'd down again, but could
"not sleep at all, being very faint, and ill; and
"thus I continu'd all the second Day, with a
"strange Variety, first Hungry, then sick again, with
"jeachings to vomit; the second Night being
"obliged to go to Bed again, without any Food,
w more than a Draught of fair Water; and being
"asleep, I dream'd I was at Barbadoes, and that the
"Market was mightily stork'd with Provisions j
"that I brought some for my Mistress, and went
*' and din'd very heartily.
"I thought my Stomach was as full after this as
"any would have been after, or at good Dinner;
- "but
"but when I awak'd, I was exceedingly funk in
* my Spirits, to find myself in the extremity of
"Famine: The Last Glass of Wine we had, I
"drank, and put Sugar in it, because, of its ha-
** ving some Spirit to supply Nourishment; but
** there being no substance in the Stomach for the
*l digesting Office to work upon, I found the only
cl effect of the Wine was, to raise disagreeable
"Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head and I
"lay, as they told me, stupid, and senseless, as
K one Drunk for some Time.
"The third Day in the Morning, after a Night
"of strange and confus'd inconsistent Dreams i and
"rather daring than sleeping, I wak'd, ravenous
** and furious, with Hunger; and I question, had
K not my Understanding return'd and conquer'd it?
"I say, I question whether if I had been a Mother,
"and had had a little Child with me, its Life would
"have been safe or not?
"This lasted about three Hours during which
** Time I was twice raging Mad as any Creature in
"Bfdlam, as my young Master told me, and as he
"can now inform you.
"In one of these fits of Lunacy or Distraction,
"whether by the Motion of the Ship, or some Slip
** of my Foot, I know not I fell down, and struck
"my Face against the Corner of a Palat Bed in
** which my Mistress lay * and with the Blow the
"Blood gushed out of my Noise; and the Cabin
u Boy bringing me a little Bason, 1 fat down and
41 bled into it a great deal ; and as the Blood run
w from me, I came to my self; and the Violence of
M the Flame.or the Fever, I was in, abated, and so
** did the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
'* Then I grew sick, and reach'd to Vomit, but
M could not; for I had nothing in my Stomach to
.M bring up: After I had bled some Time, I swooned, ** and they all believ'd 1 was dead * but I came to
"myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful
"Pain
"Pain in my Stomach, not to be described; not
"like the Cholick, but a gnawing eager Pain for
** Food; and towards Night it went off with a
"kind of earnest Wishing or Longing for Food *
u something like, as I suppose, the Longing of a
"Woman with Child. I took another Draught of
"Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loath-
"ed the Sugar, and brought it all up again ; then
"I took a Draught of Water without Sugar, and
"that stayed with me; and I laid me down upon
"the Bed, praying most heartily, that it would
"please God to take me away; and composing
** my Mind in Hopes of it, I flumber'd a while,
*' and then waking, thought myself dying, being
"light with Vapours from an empty Stomach, I re-
"commended my Soul then to God, and earnestly
"wish'd that some Body would throw me into
"the Sea.
"All this while my Mistress lay by me, just as I
"thought expiring, but bore it with much more
"patience than I, and gave the last bit of Bread
"she had left to her Child, my young Master,
"who would not have taken it, but she obliged him

a Towards the Morning I slept again, and first
"when I awak'd, I fell into a violent passion of
"Crying, and after that had a second Fit of vio-

"dreadful Condition; had my Mistrels been dead,

"have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much

** Flesh of any Creature appointed for Food * and
"once or twice I was going to bite my own Arm:
*l At last, I saw the Balon in which was the Blood
*' I had bled at my Noise the Day before ; I ran to
"it, and swallowed it with such Haste, and such a
"greedy Appetite, as if I had wonder'd no Body

"from me now, "Tho'
K Tho' after it was down, the Thoughts of it
"fill'd me with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of
"Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair Water,
*' and was compos'd and refrefh'd for some Hours
** after it : This was the 4th Day, and thus I held
tc it, 'till towards Night, when within the Com-
"pass of three Hours, I had all these several Cir-
*' cumstances over again, one after another, (viz.)
"fick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the Sto-

"lunatick, then crying, then ravenous again; and
*' so every quarter of an Hour, and my Strength
"wasted exceedingly: At Night I laid me down,
"having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I should
** die before Morning.
"All this Night I had no Sleep ; but the Hun-
"ger was nowturn'd into aDiscasc; and I had a
"terrible Cholick and Griping, Wind instead of
"Food, having found its Way into the Bowels 5 and
*{ in this Condition I lay 'till Morning, when I was
** siirpriz'd a little with the Cries and Lamentations

"his Mother was dead: I lifted my self up a lit—
"tie; for I had not Strength to rise, but found she
"was not dead, tho' she was able to give very
'* little Signs of Life. f
** I had then such Convulsions in my Stomach,
"for want of some sustenance, that I cannot de-
"scribe; with such freequent Throws and Pangs
** of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of
Death can imitate ; and in this Condition I was
when I heard the Seamen above cry out a Sail, a
"Sail, and hallow and jump about, as if they
*' were distracted.
"I was not able to get off from the Bed, and
"my Mistress much less $ and my young Master
*' was so sick, that I thought he had been expiring;
*' so we could not open the Cabin-Door, or get
"any Account what it was that occasioned such a
« Com-
to
Combustion, nor had we had any Conversation
"with the Ship's Company for two Days; they
** having told us they had not a Mouthful of any
"Thing to eat in the Ship ; and they told us after-
"wards, they thought we had been dead. .
"It was this dreadful Condition we were in when
w you were sent to save our Lives; and how you
*' found us, Sir, you know as well as I, and bet-
"ter too.
This was her own Relation, and is such a distinct
Account of starving to Death, as I confess I never
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me;
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true Ac-
count, because the Youth gave me an Account of a
good Part of it; tho' I must own, not so distinct
and so feelingly as his Maid and the rather, be-
cause it seems his Mother fed him at the Price of
her own Life .. But the poor Maid, tho' her Consti-
tution being stronger than that of her Mistress, who
was in Years, and a weakly Woman too, she might
struggle harder with it; I say, the poor Maid
might be supposed to feel the Extremity something
sooner than her Mistress, who might be allowed to
keep the last Bit,ibmething longer than she parted
with any to relieve the Maid. No Question, as the
Cafe is here related, if our Ship or some other,
had not so providentially met them, a few Days
more would have ended all their Lives, unless they
had prevented it by eating one another; and even,
that as«their Cafe stood, would have served them
but a little while, they being 500 Leagues from any
Land; or any Possibility of Relief, other than in
the miraculous Manner it happen'd: But this is by
the Way I return to my Disposition of Things
among the People.
And, First, It is to be observed here, That for
many Reasons I did not think fit to let them know
any Thing of the Sloop I had framed, and which I
thought of setting up among them; for I found,
at
at least at my first coming, such Seeds of Divisions
among them, that I saw it plainlyt had I set up the?'
Sloop, and left it among them, they would upon
every light Disgust have seperated, and gone away from one another, or perhaps haveturn'd Pirates,and
so made the island a Den of Thieves,instead of a Plan-
tation of sober and religious People, so as I intended
it; nor did I leave the two Pieces of BrassCannon that
I had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns,
that my Nephew took extraordinarily, for the saffley
Reason: I thought they had enough to qualify
them for a defensive War against any that should in-
vade them; but I was not to set them up for an of-
fensive War, or to encourage them to go Abroad to
ui attack others, which in the End would only bring
Ruin and Destruction upon themselves and all their
undertaking: I reserved the Sloop therefore, and
the Guns, for their Service another Way, as I shall
observe in its Place.
I have now done with the Island: I left them all in good Circumstances, and in a flourishing Conditi-
on, and went on board my Ship again the
of , having been five and twenty Days
among them and as they were all resolv'd to stay
upon the island 'till I came to remove them, I pro-
mis'd to fend some further Relief from the BrasiU,
if I could possibly find an Opportunity ; and parti. -
cularly I promls'd to fend them some Cattel, such
as Sheep, Hogs, and Cows: For as to the two
Cows and Calves which I brought from England,
we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage
to kill them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them.
The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns
at parting, we set Sail, and arriv'd at the Bay of
AU-Saints in the Brafils in about 22 Days; meeting
nothing remarkable in our passage, but this, That
about three Days after we laifd, being becalm'd, and
the Current setting strong to the E. N. E. running, as
it were, into a Bay or Gulph on the Land Side, we
were
Were driven something out of our Course, and once
or twice our Men cry'd Land to the Eastward ; but ^ > i<
whether it was the Continent or Islands, we could '76
not tell by any Means.
But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea
smooth, and the Weather calm, we saw the Sea, as
it were, covered towards the Land with something
very black, not being able to discover what it was, ;/
'till after some Time, our chief Mate going up the Ld
main Shrowds a little Way, and looking at them
with a Perspective, cry'd out it was an Army, I could;
not imagine what he meant by an Army, and spoke
a little hastily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or some
such Word : Nay, Sir, sap he, don't be angry, for
'tis an Army and a Fleet too} for I believe there
are a thousand Canoes, and you may fee them pad-
dle along, and they are coming towards us toot
apace^ . luti ./ /t/f. 7
I was a little surpriz'd then indeed, and so was
my Nephew, the Captain ; for he had heard such
terrible stories of them in the island, and having
never been in thole Seas before, that he could not
tell what to think of it, but said two or three Times,
We should all be devour'd. I must Confess consider-
ing we were becalm'd, and the Current set strong
towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worse i However,
I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an
Anchor, as soon as we came so near as to know
that we must engage them.
The Weather continu'd fcalm, and they came ori
apace towards us; so I gave Order to come to an
Anchor, and furle all our Sails: As for the Savages, .',
I told them they had nothing to fear but 10 Fires 1
and therefore they should get their Boats outs and
fatten them, one close by the Head, and the other by the Stern, and man them both well, and wait
the issue in that Posture: This I did, that the Meri
in the Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets
Mia,'. v'
to
to put out any Fire, these Savages might endeavour
; , to fix to the Out-fide of the Ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us ; but never was such a
horrid Sight seen by Christians: My Mate was
much mistaken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of a thousand Canoes; the most we could
make of them when they came up, being about a
hundred and fix and twenty and a great many of them too ; for some of them had sixteen or seven-
teen Men in them, some more; and the least fix
or seven.
When they came nearer to us they seemed to be
struck with Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight
which they had doubtless never seen before ; nor
could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know
what to make of us : They came boldly up however
very near to us, and seemed to go about, to row
round us ; but we call'd to our Men in the Boats,
not to let them come too near them.
This very Order brought us to an Engagement
with them, without our designing it; for five or
fix of their large Canoes came so near our Long-Boat,
that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to
keep back, which they understood very well, and
went back j but at their Retreat, about 50 Arrows
came on board us from those Boats; and one of our
Men in the Long-Boat was very much wounded.
However, I call'd to them not to fire by any
Means; but we handed down some Deal-Board sin-
to the Boat, and the Carpenter presently set up a
kind of a Fence like waste Boards, to cover them
from the Arrows of the Savages, if they should
shoot again.
About half an Hour afterwards they came all up
in a Body astern of us, and pretty near, so near
that we could easily discern what they were, tho' we
could not tell their Design: I easily found they were
lome of my old Friends, the same sort of Savages
* that
that I had been used to engage with; and in a little
Time more they rowed a little farther out to Sea,
'till they came directly Broad-fide with us, and then
rowed down strait upon us, 'till they came so near
that they could hear us speak: Upon this I order'd
all my Men to keep close, least they should (hoot
any more Arrows, and made all our Guns ready;
but being so near as to be within hearing, I made
Friday go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to
them in his Language to know what they' meant,
which accordingly he did; whether they understood
him or not, that I knew not: But as soon as he had
call'd to them, six of them who were in the foremost or highest Boat to us, turns their Canoes from
us; and stooping down, sliew'd us their naked Back-
fides, just as if in English,saving your presence, they
had bid us kiss—b whether this was a Defiance or
Challenge, we know not; or whether it was done
in meer Contempt, or as a Signal to the rest; but
immediately Friday cry'd out they were going to
shoot, and unhappily for him poor Fellow $ they
let fly about 300 of their Arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible Grief, kill'd poor Friday, no other Man be-
ing in their Sight. The poor Fellow was shot with
no less than three Arrows, and about three more
fell very near him; such unlucky Marksmen they
were.
I was so enrag'd with the loss of my old Servant,
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes,
that I immediately order'd five Guns to be loaded
with small Shot, and four with great, and gave
them such a Broad-side, as they had never heard in
their Lives before, to be sure.
They were not above half a Cable,Length off
when we fir'dand our Gunners took their aim so well,
that three or four of their Canoes were overset, as
we had reason to believe, by one Shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare Back-
fides to us, gave us no great Offence; neither did I M 2 know
know for certain, whether that which would pass
for the greatest Contempt among us, might be un-
derstood so by them, or not; therefore in Return,
I had only refolv'd to have fired four or five Guns at.
them with Powder only, which I knew would fright
them sufficiently: But when they shot at us directly
with all the Fury they were capable of, and especi-
ally as they had kill'd my poor Friday, who I so en-
tirely loved and valued, and who indeed so well de-
serv'd it3 I not only had been justify'd before God
and Man, but would have been very glad, if I could,
to have overset every Canoe there, and drown'd eve-
ry one of them.
I can neither tell, how many we kill'd, or how
many we wounded at this Broad-fide ; but sure such
a Fright and Hurry never was keen among such a
Multitude ; there were 13 or 14 of their Canoes
split and overset in all, and the Men all set a swim-
ming ; the rest frighted out of their Wits , scoured
away as sast as they could, taking but little care to
leave those whose Boats were split or ipoil'd with
our Shot: So I suppose, that they were many of
them lost: And our Men took up one poor Fellow
iwimming sot his Life, above an Hour after they
were all gone.
Our small Shot from our Cannon must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never knew any Thing how it went with them; for they
fled so vast, that in three Hours or thereabouts, we
could not fee above three or four straggling Canoes;
nor did we ever fee the rest any more; for a Breeze
of Wind springing up the same Evening, we
weighed and set Sail for the Brasilt.
We had a prisoner indeed j but the Creature was
so sullen, that he would neither eat or speak ; and
we all sanfied he would starve himself to Death:
But I took a Way to cure him ; for I made them
take him and turn him into the Long-Boat, and
make him believe they would toss him into the Sea
* agaifl;
again, and so leave him where they found him, if
, he would not speak: Nor would that do ; but they
really did throw him into the Sea, and came away
from him; and then he follow'd them; for he
swam like a Cork, and call'd to them in his Tongue,
tho' they knew not one Word of what he said: How-
ever, at last they took him in again, and then he be-
gan to be more tractable5 nor did I ever design they
should drown him.
We were now under Sail again ; but I was the
most disconsolate Creature alive, for want of my
Man Friday, and would have been very glad to have
gone back to the Island, to have taken one of the
rest from thence for my Occasion, but it could not
: be; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have
laid ; and 'twas a long while before we could make
him understand anything: But, in time, our Men
taught him some English, and he began to be a lit-
tle tractable; afterwards we enquir'd what Country
he came from, but could make nothing of what he
said; for his Speech was so odd, all Gutturals, and
spoke, in the Throat, in such an. hollowAodd manner,
thaffwe could never form a Word from him ; and 'Sy v
we were all of opinion that they might speak that
Language as well, if they were gagg'd, as other-
ywife: Nor could we perceive that they had any
Occasion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips, or Palate j
but form'd their Words just as a hunting Horn forms
a Tune with an open Throat; he told us however,
some time after, when we had taught him to speak a
little English,that they were going with their Kings
to right a great Battle. When he laid Swings, we
as'd him how many Kings? He said, they were
FIVENATIQN,we c0Uld hot make hirriW
derstand the Plurial S. and tljat they all join'd to go
against Two Nation. We ask'd him what made
them come up tons > He laid, fy makes te great Won-
der look: Where it is to be observed, That all those
Natives, as also those of Africa, when they'learn


English,they always add two Es at the' End of the
Words where we use one, and make the Accent up-
on them, as makee tal.ee, and the like; and we could
not break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Frin
day leave it off, tho' at last he did.
And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I
must take my last Leave of him; poor honest Fri-
day! We buried him with all the Decency and So-
lemnity possible, by putting him into a Coffin, and
throwing him into the Sea: And I caus'd 'em to fire
eleven Guns for him; and so ended the Life of the
most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate
Servant that ever Man had.
We went now away with a fair Wind for Brazil,and in about twelve Days Time we made Land in
the Latitude of five Degrees South of the Line, be-
ing the North-Eastermost Land of all that Part of
America. We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the Shore
four Days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and
in three Days came to an Anchor off of the Bay of
allSaints, the old place of my Deliverance, from
whence came both by good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part that had less Busi-
ness than I had; and yet it was with great Difficul-
ty that we were admitted to hold the least Corre-
spondency on Shore, not my Partner himself, who
was alive, and made a great Figure among them *
not my two Merchants Trustees, nor the Fame of
my wonderful Preservation in that Island, could ob-
tain me that Favour : But my Partner remembring,t
that I had given you Moidores to the PrioLof the
Monastery of the Augustines, and 272 to the Poor,
went to the Monastery, and oblig'd the Prior that
then was, to go to the Governor, and get leavefor me
personally, with the Captain, and one more, besides
eight Seamen, to come on Shore, and no more ; and
this upon Condition absolutely capitulated for, that
we should not offer to land any Goods out of the
Ship, or to carry any Person away without Licence
They were so strict with us, as to landing any
Goods, that it was with extream Difficulty that I
got on Shore three Bales of EnglishGoods, such as
fine broad Cloaths, Stuffs, and some Linnen, which
I had brought for a present to my Partner.
He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho*
like me, he came from little at first; and though he
knew not that I had the least Design of giving him,
any Thing, he lent me on Board a Present of fresh
Provisions, Wine, and Sweet-meats, worth above
30 Moidores, including some Tobacco, and three
or four fine Medals in Gold: But I was even with
him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted
of fine broad Cloath, Englifi Stuffs, Lace, and fine
Hollands : Also I deliver'd him about the Value of
loo J$. Sterl. in the same Goods for other Uses
and I oblig'd him to set up the Sloop which I had
brought with me from England, as I have said, for
the Use of my Colony, in order to send the Re-
freshments I intended to my Plantation.
Accordingly, he got Hands, and finished the Sloop
in a very few Days, for she was already fram'd,
and I gave the Master of her such Instructions, as
he could not miss the Place, nor did be miss them, as
I hadan Account from my Partner afterwards. I got
him soon loaded with the small Cargo 1 had sent x
them; and one of our Seamen that had been on
shore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop,
and settle there upon my Letter to the Governour
Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of Land
for a Plantation ; and giving him IbmeCloaths, and
Tools for his Planting-Work, which he said he un-
derstood, having been an old Planter at Maryland,
and a Buckaneer into the Bargain.
I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he desir-
ed ;and as an Addition I gave him the Savage, which
we had taken Prisoner of War, to be his Slave, and
order'd the Governour Spaniard to give him his share
of every thing he wanted with the rest.
- M 4" When
When we came to fit this Man out, my old Part*
tier told me, there was a certain very honest Fellow
a Brasil Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the Displeasure of the Church; I know not
what the matter is with him, Ashe; but on my
Conscience, I think he is an Heretick in his Heart,
and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear
of the Inquisition ; that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his Escape with his
Wife and two Daughters ; and if I would let them
go to my island, and allot them a Plantation, he
would give them a small Stock to begin with % for
the Officers of the Inquisition had seized all his Ef-
fects and Estate, and he had nothing left but a little
Houshold Stuff and two Slaves. And, adds he, Tho' I hate his Principles, yet I would not have
him fall into their Hands ; for he would assuredly
be burnt alive, if he does.
I granted this presently, and join'd my EnglishMan with them, and we conceal'd the Man, and his
Wife and Daughters on Board our Ship, 'till the
Sloop put out, to go to Sea ; and then (having put
all their Goods on board the Sloop, some time be-
fore) we put them on board the Sloop, after he was
got out of the Bay.
Our Seamen was mightily pleas'd with this new
Partner -y and their Stock indeed was much alike rich
in Tools, in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing
to begin with but as above: However, they carried
over with them, , which was worth all the rest, some
Materials for planting Sugar Canes, with some
Plants of Canes; which he, I mean, the Portugal
Man, understood very well.
Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenants
in the island, I sent them by this Sloop, three Milch
Cows, and fiveCalves,about 2aHogs among 'em,three
Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and. Stone-Horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I en-
gag'd three Portugal Women to go, and recom-
mended
mended it to them to marry them, and nfe them
kindly. I could have procured more Women, but
I remember'd, that the poor persecuted Man had
two Daughters, and there was but five of the Spani-
ards that wanted ; the rest had Wives of their own,
tho' in another Country.
All this Cargoe arriv'd safe, and as you may easi-
ly suppose, very welcome to my old Inhabitants,
who were now with this Addition,between sixty and
seventy People, besides little Children; of which,
there was a great many: I found Letters at London
from them all by the Way of Lisbon, when I came
back to England., being sent back to the Brafils by this
Sloop,of which I shall take some Notice in it's Place.
I have now done with my Island, and all Manner
of Discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest
of my Memorandums, would do well to turn his
Thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only
of the Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own
Harms, much less by those of other Men, to beware
of the like not cool'd by almost forty Years Mise-
fy and Disappointments, not satisfy'd with Prospe-
rity beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Af-
fliction and Distress beyond Imitation.
I had no more Business to go to the East-Indies,
than a Man at full Liberty, and having comirted no
Crime, has to go to the Turn-key at Newgate, and
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from
England, and went directly to the Island; had I
loaded her, as I did the other Veflel, with all the
Necessaries for the Plantation, and for my People,
took a Patent from the Government here, to have
secur'd my Property, in subjection only to that of
England to be sure I might have obtain'd; had I
carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants, and
People, to plant, and taking possession of the Place,
fortified and strengthens it in the Name of England,
and increased it with People, as I might easily have
done;
done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the
Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might alfa
have done in fix Months time, and order'd my Friends
to have fitted her out again for our Supply ; had I
done this, and staid there myself, I had, at least,
acted like a Man of common Sense; but I was pof-
At fest with a wandring Spirit, scorned all Advantages,
pleased myself with being the Patron of those Peo-
ple I had placed there, and doing for them in a kind
of haughty majestick Way, like an old Patriarchal
Monarch; providing for them, as if I had been Fa-
ther of the whole Family, as well as of the Planta-
tion: But I never so much as pretended to plant in
the Name of any Government or Nation, or to ac-
knowledge any Prince, or to call my People Subjects
to any one Nation more than another; nay, I never
fo much as gave the Place a Name ; but left it as I
found it, belonging to no Man; and the People un-
der no Discipline or Government but my own; who,
f , ^-j tho' I had, influence over them as Father and Benesa-
ctor, had no Authority or Power, to Act or Cons .I mandAone way or other, farther than voluntary Con-
sent moved them to comply; yet even this, had I
staid there, would have done well enough; but as I
rambl'dfrom them, and came there no more, the last
Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partners
means; who afterwards sent another Sloop to the
Place, and who sent me word, tho' I had 'not the
Letter 'till five Years after it was written ; that they
went on but poorly, were Male'content with their
long stay there i That Witt. Atkins was dead; That
five of the Spaniards were come away, and that tho' they had not been much molested by the Savages,
yet they had had some skirmishes with them ; That
they begg'd of him to write to me, to think of the
promise I had made, to fetch 'em away that they
might see their own Country again before they
dy'd.
But I was gone a Wild Goose Chase indeed; and
—r They
They who will have any more of me, must be con-
tent to follow me thro' a new'Variety of Follies,
Hardships, and Wild Adventures; wherein the Ju-
stice of Providence may be duly observed, and we
may fee how easily Heaven can gorge us with our
own Desires ; make the strongest of our wishes to
be our Affliction, and punish us most severely with
those very Things, which we think, it would be our
utmost Happiness to be allow'd in.
Let no wife Man flatter himself, with the Strength
of his own Judgment, as if he was able to chuse
any particular Station of Life for himself: Man,
is a short sighted Creature, sees but a very little
Way before him ; and as his Passions, are none of
his best Friends, so his particular Affections, are
generally his worst Counsellors.
I fay this, with Respect to the impetuous Desire
I had from a Youth, to wander into the World;
and how evident it now was, that this Principle was
preserv'd in me for my Punishment: How it came
on, the Manner, the Circumstance, and the Conclu-
sion of it, it is easy to give you Historically, and
with its utmost Variety of Particulars: But the fe-.
cret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us, to
be hurry'd down to the Stream of our own desires, is only to be understood of those who can listen to
the Voice of Providence, and draw religious Conse-
quences from God's Justice and their own Mistakes.
Be it, I had Business, or no Business, away I went;
'tis no Time now to enlarge any sarther upon the
Reason, or Absurdity of my own conduct but to
come to the History, I was embarked for the Voyage,
and the Voyage I went.
I should only add here, that my Honest and truly
pious Clergyman left me here; a Ship being ready
to go to Lisbon, he ask'd me leave to go thither;
being still, as he observes,bound never to finish any
Voyage he began : How happy had it been for me,
if I had gone with him!
But
But it was too late now; all things Heaven ap-
points are best ; had I gone with him, I had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had
never heard of the second Part of the Travels and
Adventures of Robin, Crusoe; so I must leave here
the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on with
my Voyage.
From the Brasih, we made directly away over the
AtlanticSea, to the Cape de bon EJperance, or as we
call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tolerable
good Voyage, our Course generally South-East; now
and then a Storm, and some contrary Winds, but
my Disasters at Sea were at an End ; my future
Rubs and cross Events were to befall me on shore *
that it might appear, the Land was as well prepared to be our Scourge, as the Sea when Heaven, who directs the Circumstances of Things, pleases to ap>
appoint it to be so.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a
Supra Cargo on board, who was to direct, all her Mo-
tions after she arriv'd at the Cape; only being limit-
ed to certain Numbers of Days, for stay, by Char-
ter party, at the several Ports she was to goto :.
This was none of my Business, neither did I med-
dle with it at all; my Nephew, the Captain, and
the Supra Cargo, adjusting all those things between
them, as they thought fit. '"'
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was.
needful, to take in fresh Water; but made the best
of our way, for the Coast of Coremandel; we were
indeed informed, that a French Man of Wat of
fifty Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were
gone for the Indies, and as I knew we were at War,
with France, I had some Apprehensions of them 5
but they went their own Way, and we heard no
more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader,
with Descriptions of Places, Journals of our Voy-
ages, Variations of the Compass, Latitudes, Meri-
dian-
ifiian-Distances, Trade-Winds, Situation of Ports,
and the likes, such as almost all the Histories of
long Navigation are full of, and which make the
reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofi-
table to all that read, except only to those, who are
to go to those Places themselves.
It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which
we touch'd ar, and what occurred to us upon our
passing from one to another. We touch'd first at the
island of Madagascar * where, tho' the People are
fierce and treacherous, and in particular, very well
arm'd with Launces and Bows, which they use with
inconceivable Dexterity $ yet we fared very well
with them a while; they treated us very civilly,
and for some Trifles, Which we gave them, such as
Knive9, Sciflars, Cic. they brought us eleven good
sat Bullocks, middling in size, but very good in
Flesh which we took in, partly for fresh Provisi-
ons for our present spending, and the rest, to Sale
for the Ship's Use.
We were obliged to stay here some Time, after we
had furnished ourselves with Provisions * and I, that
was always too curious, to look into every Nook of
the World where, ever I came, was for going on
Shore as often as I could: It was on the East Side
of the Island that we went on Shore, one Evening,
and the People, who by theWay are very numerous,
came thronging about us, and stood gating at us at
a Distance: As we had traded freely with them,
and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in
no Danger; but When we law the People, we cut
three Boughs out of a Tree, and stuck them up at 2
Distance from us, which it seems, is a Mark in the
Country not only of Truce and Friendship, but
when it is accepted, the other Side set up three
Poles or Boughs also, which is a Signal, that they
accept the Truce too; but then, this is a known
Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pass be-
yond their three Poles towards them, nor they to
come
come past your three Poles or Boughs, towards you «
,
so that you are perfectly secure within the three
Poles, and all the Space between your Poles and
theirs, is allow'd like a Market, for free Converse,
Traffick, and Commerce: When you go there, you
must not carry your Weapons with you -t and if
they come into that space they stick up their Jave-
lines and Launces, all at the first Poles, and come
on unarm'd ; but if any Violence is offered them,
and the Truce thereby broken ; away they run to
the Poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then
the Truce is at an End.
It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore,
that a greater Number of their People came down
than usual, all was very friendly and civil: They
brought with them several Kinds of Provisions, for -
which we satisfied them, with such Toys as we had;
their Woman also brought us Milk, and Roots, and
several Things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet and we made us a little Tent or Hut, of some
Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all that Night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was
not so well satisfied to lye on Shore as the rest, and
the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a Stone cast
: from the Land, with two Men in her to take care
of her; I made one of them come on Shore, and
getting some Boughs of Trees to cover us also in the
Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom of the Boat,
and lay under the Cover of the Branches of Trees *U/
all Night.
About two a Clock in the Morning, we heard
one of our Men make a terrible Noise on the Shore,
calling out for God's lake, to bring the Boat in, and
come and help them, for they were all like to be
murther'd; at the same time, I heard the firing of
5 Muskets, which was the Number of the Guns
they had, and that, three times over j for it seems, .
the Natives here were not so easily frighted with
Guns, as the Savages were in America, where I had
to do with them. All
All this while, I knew not what was the Matter %
but rouzing immediately from Sleep with the Noise,
I caus'd the Boat to be thrust in, and resolv'd, with
three Fusils we had on Board, to Land, and assist
our Men.
We got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men
were in too much haste: For being come to the
Shore, they plunged into the Water, to get to the
Boar, with all the Expedition they could, being pur-
sued by between three and four hundred Men: Our
Men were but Nine in all, and only five of them
had Fusils with them ; the rest indeed had Pistols
and Swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our Men, and with Dif-
ficulty enough too, three of them being very ill
wounded; and that which was still worse was,
that while we stood in the Boat to take our Men
in, we were in as much Danger as they were in on
Shore; for they pour'd their Arrows in upon us so
thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of
the Boat up with the Benches, and two or three
loose Boards, which to our great Satisfaction, we
had by mere Accident, or Providence rather, in the
Boat.
And yet, had it been Day-light, they are it seems
such exact Marks-men, that if they could have seen
but the least Part of any of us, they would have
been sure of us ; we had by the Light of the Moon' a little Sight of them, as they stood pelting us from
the Shore with Darts and Arrows ; and having got
ready our Fire-arms, we gave them a Volley, and
We could hear by the Cries of some of them, that
we had wounded several; however, they stood thus
in Battle Array on the Shore 'till break of Day,
which we suppose was, that they might fee the bet-
ter to take their Aim at us.
In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our Anchor, or set up our Sail, because
we must needs stand up in the Boat, and they were
as
, as Hire to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree
with small Shot; we made Signals of Distress to
the Ship, which, tho' we rode a League off, yet
my Nephew the Captain hearing our firing, and by
Glasses, perceiving the Posture we lay in, and tljat
we fled rowards the Shore, pretty well understood
us ; and weighing Anchor, with all speed, he stood
as near the Shore as he durst with the Ship, and
then sent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to as-
sist us; but we call'd to them not to come too near,
telling them what Condition we were in: However,
they stood in nearer too Us; and one of the Men ta-
king the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and keep-
ing our Boat between him and the Enemy, so that
they could not perfectly see him, swam on board u$^
and made sast the Line to the Boat ; upon which we
flipped our little Cable, and leaving our Anchor be-
hind, they tow'd us out of the reach of the Arrows, we all the while lying close behind the Barricado we
had made.
As soon as we were got from between the Ship
and the Shore, that (he could lay her Side to the
Shore, she riin along just by them and we pour'd
in a Broad-fide among them loaden with Pieces of
Iron and Lead, small Bullets, and such stuff, besides
the great Shot* which made a terrible Havock
amongst them.
When we were got on board and out of Danger,
we had time to examine into the Occasion of this
Fray j and indeed our Stipra-Cargo who had been
often in those Parts, put me upon it ; for he laid,
he was sure the Inhabitants would not have touched us, after we had made a Truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to it. At length it
came out (viz.) that an Old Women who had come *
to fell us, some Milk, had brought it within out
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who also
brought some Roots or Herbs; and while the Old
Woman, whether she was Mother to the young WcA
man,'
man or no, they could not tell, was selling us the
Milk, one of our Men offer'd some Rudeness to the
Wench that was with her, at which the old Woman
made a great Noise: However, the Seaman would
not quit his Prize, but carried her out of the old
Woman's Sight, among the Trees, it being almost
dark; the old woman went away without her,
and as we suppose, made an outcry among the
People she came from ; who upon Notice, rais'd
this great Army upon us in three or four Hours;
and it was great odds, but we had been all de-
stroys.
One of our Men was killed, with a Launce that
was thrown at him, just at the beginning of the
Attack, as he salley'd out of the Tent we had made;
the rest came off free, all but the Fellow who was
the occasion of all the Mischief, who paid dear
enough for his black Mistress; for we could not
hear what became of him, a great while; we lay
upon the Shore two Days after, tho' the Wind pre-
sented, and made Signals for him ; made our Boat
sail up Shore and down Shore, several Leagues, but
in vain; so we were oblig'd to give him over, and
if he alone had suffered for it, the Lois had been the
less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without
venturing on Shore once more, to try if I could
learn any Thing of him, or them ; it was the third
Night after the Action, that I had a great Mind
to learn if I could by any Means, what Mischief
we had done, and how the Game stood on the In-
dians Side: I was careful to do it in the dark, lest
we should be attacked again ; but I ought indeed to
have been sure, that the Men I went with, had been
under my Command, before I engjg'd in a Thing so
hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought into by
it, without my Knowledge or Design.
We took twenty stout Fellows with us as ary
in the Ship, besides the Sunn Cargo and myself,
N :'r and
and we landed two Hours before Midnight, at the
lame Place where the Indians stood drawn up the
Evening before; I landed here, because my Design
as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quit-
ted the Field, and if they had left any Marks be-
hind them of the Mischief we had done them ; and
I thought, if we could surprize one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our Man again by Way of
Exchange.
We landed without any Noise, and divided our
Men into two Companies, whereof, the Boatswain
commanded one, and I the other: We neither
could see or hear any Body stir when we landed, so
we march'd up, one Body at a Distance from the
other, to the Field of Battle: At first, we could see
nothing,it being very dark; But by and by, our
Boatswain that lead the first Party, stumbled and
fell over a Dead Boy -, this made them halt a while,
for knowing by the Circumstances that they were at
the Place were the Indians had stood, they waited
for my coming up * here we concluded to halt 'till
the Moon began to rise, which we knew would be in
less than an Hour; and then we could easily discern
the Havock we had made among them ; we told
two and thirty Bodies Upon the Ground, whereof
two were not quite dead: Some had an Arm,
and some a Leg shot off, and one his Head ; those
that were wounded we suppos'd, they had carried
hen we had made, as I thought, a full Disco-
very Of all we could tome at the Knowledge of, I
was for going on Board again "s but the Boatswain
and his Party of ten, sent me Word, that they were
resolved to make a visit to the Indian Town, where
these Dogs, as they calVd themt dwelt, and deiir'd me
to go along with them; and if they"could find
them, as still they sanned they should, they did not
, doubt, they said, getting a good Booty, and it might
be, they might find Tbo. jsefry there, that was the
Man's Name we hadlost. t Had
Had they lent to ask my Leave to go, I knew
well enough what Answer to have given them; for I would have commanded them instantly on Board,
knowing it was not a Hazard fit for us to run who
had a Ship, and Ships loading in our Charge, and
a Voyage to make, which depended very much up-
on the Lives of the Men; but as they sent me
Word they were resolved to go, and only ask'd me
and my company to go along with them* I posi-
tively refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the
Ground, in order to go to the Boat; one or two of
the Men, began to importune me to go, and when I
still resus'd positively, began to grumble, and fry they
were not under my Command, and they would go:
Come Jack, lays one of the Men, will you go with
me? I'll go for one; Jack said he would, and ano-
ther followed, and then another ; and in a Word,
they all left me but one, who with much difficulty, too, I persuaded to stay ; so the Supra Cargo and I,
with the third Man, went back to the Boar, where
I told them we would stay for them, and take Care
to take in as many of them as should be left; for I told 'em it was a mad Thing they were going about,
and supposed most of 'em would run the Fate of
Tho.Jeffry.
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care,
&c. So away they went: I entreated 'em to consider
the Ship and the Voyage; that their Lives were
not their own, and that they were entrusted with
the Voyage in some measure; that if they miscar-
jy'd, the Ship might be lost for want of their Help,
and that they could not answer it to God or Man;
I said i great deal more to 'em on that Head, but
I might as well have talked to the Main Matt of the
Ship, they were mad upon their Journey, only
they gave me good Words, and begg'd I would not
be angry Said, they would be very cautious, and
they did not doubt but they would be back again in
N 2 about
about an Hour at sarthest 4 for the Indian Town,
they said, was not above half a Mile off: Tbd*
thofound it above two milesbefore they got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above ; and tho' the Attempt was desperate, and such, as none but
mad Men would have gone about, yet to give 'em
their due, they went about it warily as well as bold-
ly: They were galantly armed, that's true; for
they had every Man a Fuzee or Musket, a Bayonet,
and every Man a Pistol ; some of them had broad
cutlasses, some of them Hangers and the Boatswain
and Two more had Pole-Axes: Besides all which,
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenados. -
Balder Fellows, and better provided, never went
about any wicked Work in the World.
When they went out, their chief Design was
Plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding
Gold there i but a Circumstance which none of
them were aware of, set them on fire with Revenge,
and made Devils of them all. When they came to
the few Indian Houses, which they thought had
been the Town, which was not above half a Mile
off; they were under a great Disappointment ; for .
there were not above 12 or thirteen Houses; and
where the Town was, or how big, they knew not:
They consulted therefore what to do, and were
Tome time before they could resolve : For if they;
fell upon these, they must cut all their Throats,
and it was ten to one but some of them might
escape, it being in the Night, tho' the Moon was
up; and if one escaped, he would run away, and
raise all the Towns, so they should have a whole
Army upon them: Again, on the other hand, if
they went away and left those untouch'd (for the
people were all asleep) they could not tell which
Way to look for the Town.
However, the last was the best Advice; so they
resolved to leave those Houses, and look for the
Town as well as they could: They went on a little
* ' ways
way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree j this they
presently concluded, would be a good Guide to
them ; for they said, the Cow certainly belonged to
the Town before them, or the Town behind them j
and if they untied her, they should see which way she went $ if she went back' they had nothing to
say to her; but if she went forward, they had no-
ething to do but to follow her.: So they cut the Cord,
which was made of twilled Flags, and the Cowwent
on before them; in aWord,theCowied them directly
to the Town, which as they report, consisted of
above 200 Houses, or Hues; and in some of these,
they found several Families living together.
Here they found all in Silence; as profoundly
secure, as Sleep, and a Country that had never
seen an Enemy of that Kind, could make them 5
and first, they call'd another Council to consider
what they had to do; and in a Word, they rer
folv'd to divide themselves into three Bodies, and
to let three Houses on Fire in three Parts of the Town; and as the Men came out, to seize them
and bind them; if any resisted, they need not be
ask'd what to do then, and so to search the rest of
the Houses for Plunder; but they resolved to march silently first, thro' the Town, and see what Dimen-
sions it was of, and if they might venture upon it
<pr no.
They did so, and desperately resolv'd that they;
would venture upon them; but while they were,
animating one another to the Work, three of them
that were a little before the rest, call out aloud, and
told them they had found Tbom. Jefsry; they all
ran up to the Place, and so it was indeed: for
there they found the poor Fellow, hang'd up naked
by one Arm, and, his Throat cut; there was an In-
dian House just by the Tree, where they found six-
teen or seventeen of . the principal Indianswho had
been concern'd in the Fray, with us before; and two
or three of them wounded with our Shot ; and but N 3 Men.
Men found they were awake, and talking one to
another in that House, but knew not their Num-
ber.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so
enrag'd 'em, as before, that they swore to one ano-
ther they would be reveng'd, and that not an Mi-
an who came into their Hands should have Quarter,
and to work they went immediately; and yet not so
madly as by the Rage and fury they were in might
be expected. Their first Care was to get something
that would soon take Fire; but after a little search,
they found that would be to no purpose ; for molt -
of the Houses were low, and Thatch'd with Flags
or Rushes, of which the Country is full so they,
presently made some wild Fire, as we call it, by wet-
ting a little Powder in the Palms of their Hands,
and in a quarter of an Hour they set the Town on,
fire in four or five Places; and particularly that
House where the Indians were not gone to Bed. As
soon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted
Creatures began to rush out to save their Lives ; but
met with their Fate in the Attempt, and especially
at the Door, where they drove them back, the Boat-
swain himself killing one or two with his Pole-Ax;
The House being large, and many in it, he did not'
care to go in, but called for a Hand-Grenado, and
threw it among 'em, which at first frighted 'em *
but when it burst, made such Havock among 'em,
that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the
open Part of the House, were killed or hurt with
the Grenado, except two or three more who press'd -
to the Door, which the Boatswain and two more/
kept with their Bayonets in the Muzzles of their
Pieces, and dispatch'd all who came that Way.
But there was another Apartment in the House where
the Prince or King, or whatsoever he was and seve-
ral others were,and there they kept in till the House,
which was by this time all of a light Flame, fell in
upon them, and they were smothered or burnt to-
gether.
All this while they fir'd not a Gun, because they
would not waken the People faster than they could
master them; but the Fire began to waken them fast
enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little
together in bodies ; for the Fire grew so raging, all
the Houses being made of light combustible Stuff,
that they could hardly bear the Street between them,
and their Business was to follow the Fire sot the
surer Execution: As fast as the Fire either forc'd
the People out of those Houses which were burning,
or frighted them out of others, our People were
ready at their Doors to knock them on the Head,
still calling and hallowing to one another to remem-
ber Tho.Jefryt. x
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially when I saw the Flames of
the Town, which, it being Night, scem'dto be just
by me.
Ny Nephew, the Captain, who was routed by
his Men too, seeing such a Fire, was very uneafie,
ot knowing what the Matter was, or what Danger
was in ; especially hearing the Guns too ; for by
this time they began to use their Fire-Arms; a thou-
sand Thoughts oppress his Mind concerning me,
and the Supra Carga, what should become of us:
And at last, tho' he could ill spare any more Men,
yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he
takes another Boat, and with 13 Men and himself,
comes on Shore to me.
He was surpriz'd to see me and the Supra-Cargo
in the Boat with no more than two Men, for One
had been left to keep the Boat; and tho' he was glad
that we were well, yet he was in the same Impati-
ence with us to know what was doing 5 for the
Noise continu'd and the Flame encreas'd : I, Con-
fess, it was next to an Impossibility for any Men in
the World to restrain their Curiosity of knowing,
N 4 what
what had happen'd, or their Concern for the Safety
of the Men: In a Word, the Captain told me, he
would go and help his Men, let w hat would come.
I argued with him as I did before with the Men;
the Safety of the Ship, and the Danger of the
Voyage, the interest of the Owners and Merchants /
£fc. and told him, I would go and the two Men, and
only fee if we could at a Distance learn what was Cs»
like to be the Event, and come back and tell him.
It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was
to talk to the rest before; he would go^hesaid, and ,'
he only wished he had left but ten Men in the ihip;
for he could not think of having his Men lost for want of Help,he had ratherJoosetheShip,the Voyage,
and his Life and all and so, away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now,
than I was to persuade them not to go before ; so in
short, the Capatin order'd two Men to row back
the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more from the
Ship, leaving the Long Boat at an Anchor, and that
when they came back, fix Men should keep the two
Boats and fix more come after us ; so that he left
only 16 Men in the Ship,; for the whole Ship's
Company consisted of 65 Men, whereof two were
lost in the first Quarrel, which brought this Mis-
chief on. r
L; Being now on the March, you may be sure we
felt little of the Ground we trode on; and being
guided by the Fire, we kept no Path, but went di-
rectly to the Place of the Flame : If the Noise of
the Guns was surprizing to us before, the Cries of
the poor People were now of quite another Nature,
and fill'd us with Horror. I must confess I never was
at the sacking of a City, or at the taking of a
Town, by storm. I have heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogbeda in Ireland, and killing Man, Wo-
man and Child: And I had read of Count Tilly,sacking of the City of Magdeburgb, and cutting the
Throats of 29000 of all Sexes: but I never had an
Idea of the Thing itself before, nor is it possible to
describe ir, or the Horror which was upon our
Minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and at length came to the" Town, tho' there was no entring the Streets of it
: for the Fire. The first object we met with, was
. the Ruins of a Hut or House, or rather the Ashes of
J it, for the House was conlum'd; and just before ir,
plain now to be seen by the Light of the Fire, lay
four Men and three Women kili'd; and as we
thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among
the Fire. In short, there were such instances of a
Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, something
beyond what was human, that we thought it impos-
sible our Men could be guilty of it; or if they
were the Authors of it, we thought they every one
of 'em ought to be put to the worst of Deaths, ;j
But this was not all, we saw the Fire encreas'd for-
ward, and the Cry went on just as the Fire went on^,,/
ib that we were in the utmost Confusion. We ad- ./
vanc'd a little Way farther, and beheld,"to our A-' tL.
stonishment, three Women naked, and crying in a
most dreadful Manner, come flying, as if they had r-^iLj
indeed had Wings, and after them sixteen or seven-
teen Men, Natives, in the fame Terror, and Con-
. iternation,with three of our Englist Butchers, for I
can call them no better, in their Rear; who, when
they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them,
and one that was kili'd by their Shot fell down in
our Sight; when the rest saw us, believing us to be
their Enemies, and that we would Murther them as
well as those that pursued them, they set up a most
dreadful Shreik, especially the Women; and two of
them fell down as if already dead with the Fright.
My very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood
run chil in my Veins, when I saw this; and I believe,
had the three EnglishSailors that pursu'd them come
on, I had made our Men kill them all; However,
we took some ways to let the poor flying Creatures
know,
know, that we would not hurt them, and immedi-
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with
their hands lifted up% made piteous Lamentation to
us to save them, which we let them know we would,*
whereupon they kept altogether in a Huddle dole"
behind us for Protection. I left my Men drawn up
together, and charg'd them to hart no Body, but if
possible to get at some of our People, and see what
Devil it was poffest them, and what they intended
, to do; and,in a Word, to command them off * as-
suring them, that if they stayed 'till Day-light, they
would have an hundred thousand Men about their
Ears: I say, I left them, and went among those fly-
ing People, taking only two of our Men with me *
and there was indeed a piteous spectacle among
them: Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt
with trampling and running thro' the Fire, others
their Hands burnt; one of the Women had sallen
down in the Fire, and was almost burnt to Death be-
fore she could get out again; two or three of the
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our Men pursuing; and another was shot thro' the Body,
and died while I was there.
I would fain have learned what the Occasion of
all this was, but I could not understand one Word
they said; tho' by Signs I perceived that some of
them knew not what was the Occasion themselves.
I was so terrified in my Thoughts at this outrageous
Attempt, that I could not stay there but went back
to myown Men, I told them my Resolution, and com-
manded them to follow me, when in the very Mo-
ment came four of our Men with the Boatswain at
their Head, roving over the Heaps of Bodies they
had killed, all cover'd with Blood and Dust, as if
they wanted more People to massacre, when our
Men hallOw'd to them as loud as they could hallow',
and with much ado one of them made them hear 5
so that they knew who we were, and came up to
us.
As
As soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a
Hallow like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come, and without bearing to
hear me, Captain, says he, Noble Captain, I am
glad you are come we have not half done yet;
Villains, Hell-hound Dogs! I'll kill as many of them
as poor Tom. has Hairs upon his Head. We have
sworn to spare none of them, we'll root out the ve-
ry Nation of 'em from the Earth, and thus he run
on, out of Breath too with Action, and would not
give us leave to speak a Word.
At last, railing my Voice, that I might silence him
a little > Barbarous Dog! said /, what are you dor
ing? I won't have one Creature touch'd more, upon
'pain of Death, I charge you upon your Life, to stop
your Hands, and standstill here, or you are a dead Man
this Minute.
Why, Sir, says he, Do you know what youdo, or
what they have done > If you want a Reason for what
we have done, come hither; and with that he shew'd
me the poor Fellow hanging upon the Tree with his
Throat cut.
I confess, I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough j but I thought they had carried their Rage too far, and
thought of Jacob's Words to his Sons Simeon and
Levi;Cursed be their Anger, for it was fierce ; and their
wrath,for it was cruel : But I had now a new Task
upon my Hands; for when the Men I carried with
me saw the Sight as I had done, I had as much to
do to restrain them, as I should have had with the
other * nay, my Nephew himself fell in with them,
and told me in their hearing that he was only con-
cerned for fear of the Men being overpower'd * for
as to the People, he thought not one of 'em ought
to live ; for they had all glutted themselves with the
Murther of the poor Man, and that they ought to
be used like Murtherers. Upon these Words, away
run eight of my Men with the Boatswain and his
Crew,
I 204 }
Crew, to compleat their bloody Work ; and I see-
ing it quite out of my Power to restrain them, came
away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the Sight,
much less the horrible Noise and Cries of the poor
Wretches that fell into their Hands
I got no Body to come back with me but the Su-
pra-Cargo and two Men; and with these I walked back to the Boats. It was a very great Piece of Fol-
ly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were
alone; for as it began now to be almost Day, and
the Alarm had run over the Country, there stood
about 40 Men arm'd with Launces and Bows at the
little Place where the 12 or 19 Houses stood menti-
oned before; but by Accident I mifs'd the Place, and came directly to the Sea-side, and by the Time
I got to the Sea-side, it was broad-Day * immediate-
ly I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and, sent net
back to assist the Men in what might happens
I observed that about the Time that I came to the, Boat-side, -that the Fire was pretty well out, and
the Noise abated; but in about half an Hour after
I got on board, I heard a Volley of our Mens Fire-"
arms, and saw a great Smoak; this, as I understood
afterwards was our Men falling upon the forty Men,
who, as I said, stood at the few Houses on the Way;
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all
those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle with the
Women or Children.
By that Time the Men got to the Shore again
with the Pinnace, our Men began to appear ; they
came dropping in some, and some, not in two Bo-
dies, and in Form as they went Out, but a)l in Heaps,
straggling here, and there, in such a Manner, that a
small Force of resolute Men might have cut them
all off.
But the Dread of them was upon the whole
Country: The People were amaz'd, and surpriz'd,
and so frighred, that I believe a hundred of 'em
would have fled at the Sight of but five of our
Men.'
Men. Nor in all this terrible Action was there a
Man who made any considerable Defence; they were
so surpriz'd between the Terror of the Fire, and the
sudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they
knew not which Way to turn themselves; for if
they fled one Way, they were met by one Party 5
if back again, by another : So that they were every
where knock'd down: Nor did any of our Men re-
ceive the lead hurt *, except one who strained his
Foot, and another had one of his Hands very much
burnt.
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain,
and indeed with all the Men "in my Mind, but with
him in particular; as well for his acting so out of
his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having
the Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in his
prompting, rather than cooling^the rage of his Men,
in so bloody and cruel an Enterprize. My Nephew
answer'd me very respectfully $ but told me, that
when he saw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom
they had murther'd in such a cruel and barbarous
manner, he was not Master of himself, neither could
he govern his Passion. He own'd, he should not
have done so, as he was Commander of the Ship;
but as he was a Man, and Nature mcv'd him, he
could not bear it. As for the rest of the Men, they;
were not subject to me at all, and they knew it
well enough; so they took no notice of my Dis-
like.
The next Day we set sail, so we never heard any
more of it: Our Men differ'd in the Account of the
Number they kill'd : Some said one Thingsome ano-
ther; but according to the best of their Accounts
put altogether, they killed or destroyed about 150
People, Men, Women, and Children, and left not
a House standing in the Town.
As for the poor Fellow Tho. Jffrys, as he was
quite dead,forhis Throat was so cut,that his Head was
half off, it would do him no service to bring him
away,
away, so they left him where they found him, only
took him down from the Tree where he was hang'd
by one Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action, I was
against them in it j and t always after that Time,
told them God would blast the Voyage ; for I looked upon all the Blood they slied that Night to be Mur-
ther in them: For tho' it is true, that they had kill'd
Tho. Jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jejfrys was the
Aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated
or debauch'd a young Woman of theirs, who came
to our Camp innocently; and on the Faith of their
publick Capitulation.
The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we
were afterwards on board : He said, It was true that
we seem'd to break the Truce, but really had not, and that the War was begun the Night before by
-u the Natives themselves, who had shot,us, and kill'd
one of our Men without any just provocation ; so
that as we were in a Capacity to fight them then, we might also be in a capacity to do ourlqlves Ju-
stice upon them, in an extraordinary Manner, that;/
tho' the poor Man had taken a little Liberty with a
Wench, he ought not to have been murther'd, and
that in such a villanous Manner: And that they did
nothing but what'was just, and what the Laws of
God allow'd to be done to Murtherers.
One would think this should have been enough to
have warn'd us, against going on Shore among Hea-
thens and Barbarians: But it is impossible to make
Mankind wise, but at their own Expence, and their
Experience seems to be always of most Use to them,
when it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulph of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coreniandel, only to
touch at Surrat: But the chief of the Supra-Cargo's
Design lay at the Bay of Bengale,whete if he miss'd of
his Business outward bound, he was to go up to China,
and "turn to the Coast as he came Home.
The
The first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulph
of Persia,where five of our Men venturing on Shore,
on the Arabian Side of the Gulph, were surroun-
ded by the Arabs, and either all kill'd, or carry'd i
away into Slavery; the rest of the Boats Crew were
not able to rescue them, and had but just Time to
get off their Boat. I began to upbraid them with
the just Retribution of Heaven in this Cafes But -/ I
the Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I
went farther in my Censures, than I could shew any
Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 13, St. ru;
Luke, Verse 4th. where our Saviour intimates, that
those Men, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were
not Sinners above all the 'Galileans: But that which;,'
indeed put me to Silence in the case, was that none
of these five Men, who were now lost, were of the
Number of those who went on Shore to the Massa-
cre of Madagascar ; (so I always calledit, tho' our Men
could not bear the Tford Massacre with any Patience:)
And indeed, this last Circumstance, as I have said,
put me to Silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this Sub-
ject, had worse Consequences than I expected ; and
the Boatswain, who had been the Head of the At-
tempt, came up boldly to me one Time, and told
me, he found, that I continually brought that Affair
upon the Stage, that I made unjust Reflections upon
it, and had used the Men very ill on that Account, and himself in particular ; that as I was but a Pas-
senger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Con-
tern in the Voyage, they were not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know, but I might have some
ill Design in my Head, and perhaps to call them to
Account for it, when they came to England; and
that therefore, unless I would resolve to have done
with it; and also, not to concern myself any far-
ther with him, or any of his Affairs, he would leave
the Ship i for he did not think it was safe to sail
with me among them.
I heard
I heard him patiently enough 'till he had done,
and then told him, that I did confess I had all along
oppos'd the Massacreof Madagascar, for such I would
always call it; and that I had on all Occasions spo-
ken my Mind freely about it, tho' not more upon
him than any of the rest : That as to my having no
Command in the Ship, that was true : nor did I ex-
ercise any Authority, only took my Liberty of speak-
ing my Mind in Things which publickly concern'd
us all; and what Concern I had in the VoyageAwas
none of his Business -,that I was a considerable Owner
of the Ship ; and in that Claim I conceived I had a
Right to speak even farther than I had yet done,
and would not be accountable to him or any one else,
and begun to be a little warm with him: He made
but little Reply to me at that Time, and I thought
that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in
the Road at Bevgale, and being willing to fee the
Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in the
Ship's Boat, to divert myself, and towards Evening,
was preparing to go on Board, when one of the
Men came to me, and told me, he would not have
me trouble myself to come down to the Boat, for
they had Orders not to carry me on Board. Any one
may guess what a Surprize I was in at so insolent a
Message ; and I ask'd the Man who bad him deliver
that Errand to me ? He told me, the Cockswain. I
said no more to the Fellow, but bad him let them
know he had deliver'd his Message, and that I had
given him no answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the Supra-Car-
go, and told him the Story, adding what I presently
foresaw, (viz.) That there would certainly be a Mu-
tiny in the Ship, and entreated him to go immedi-
ately on Board the Ship in an Indian Boat, and ac-
quaint the Captain of it: But I might ha'ipar'd this
Intelligence; for before I had spoken to him on
Shore, the Matter was effected on Board. The Boat-
swain, the Gunner, the Carpenter and in a Word,
all the Inferidttr Officers, as soon as I was gone off
in the Boat, came up to the Quartet Deck, and de-
fir'd to speak with the Captain, and there the Boat-
swain making a long HarangueAfor the Fellow talk'd
very well, and repeating all he had said to me, told
the Captain in few Words, That as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they, were k>th to use any Vio-
lence with me; Which, if I had not gone on Shore,
they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to
have gone: They therefore thought fit to tell him,
That as they shipp'd themselves to serve in the Ship
under his Command, they would perform it saith-
fully: But if I would not quit the ship, or the
Captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave
the Ship, and fail no farther with him; and at that
Word, ALL, he turned his Face about towards
the Main malt, which was it seems the Signal agre-
ed on between them ; at which, all the Seamen be-
ing got together, they cry'd our, One and ALL,
One and ALL.
My Nephew, the Captain, was a Mart of Spirit,
and of great Presence of Mind; and tho' he was surpriz'd, you may be sure, at the Thing, yet he
told them calmly, that he would, consider of the
Thing, but that he could do nothing in it, 'till he
had spoken to me about it. He us'd some Argu-
ments with them, to shew them the Unreasonable-
ness and Injustice of the Thing: But it was all in
vain, they swore and shook Hands round, before his
Face, that they would go all on Shore, unless he
would engage to them, not to suffer me to come any
more on Board the Ship.
This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his
Obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk Cavalierly to them, told
them that I was a very considerable Owner of the
Ship, and that in Justice he could not put me out
of my own House; that this was next Door to serv-
ing me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done, who
o made
made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the Captain on
Shore in an uninhabited Island, and run away with
the Shir) ; that let them go into what Ship they
would, if ever they came to England again, it would
cost them dear; that the Ship was mine, and that
he would not put me out of it ; and that he would
rather loose the Ship and the Voyage too, than dis-
oblige me so much ;so they might do as they plea-
sed: However, he would go on Shore, and talk with
me on Shore, and invited the Boatswain to go with
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the
Matter with me.
But they all rejected the proposal ; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, nei-
ther on Board, ,or on Shore; and if I came on
Board, they would all go on Shore. Well, said
the Captain, if you are all on this Mind, let me go
on Shore and talk with him ; so away he came to
me with this Account, a little after the Message had
been brought to me from the Cockswain.
I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I must con-
fess; for I was not without Apprehensions, that
they would confine him by Violence, set sail, and
run away with the Ship, and then I had been stripped naked in a remote Country, and nothing to help my
self: In short, I had been in a worse case, than
when I was all alone in the Island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to
my great satissaction ? and when my Nephew told
me what they had said to him, and how they had
sworn, and shook Hands, that they would one and
allleave the Ship, if I was suffer'd to come on
Board, I told him, he should not be concetn'd at
it at all, for I would stay on Shore. I only desired he would take Care and send me all my necessary
Things on Shore, and leave me a sufficient Sum of %
Money, and I would find my Way to England, as
well as t could*
This
This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew;
but there was no Way to help it, but to comply
: with it: So, in short, he went on Board the Ship
again, and satisfy'd the Men, that his Uncle had
yielded to their Importunity, and had lent for his
Goods from on Board the Ship; so the Matter was
over in a very few Hours, the Men return'd to their
t)uty, and I began to consider what Course I should
steer.
:. I was now alone in the remotest Part of the
World, as I think I may call it ; for I was near three
thousand Leagues by Sea farther off from England,
than I was at my Island; only it is true, I might
travel here by Land over the Great Mogul's Coun-
try to Suraltex migh go from thence to Bafora by
Sea, up the Gulph of Persia, and from thence might
take the Way of, Caravans, over the Desarrs of
Arabia to Aleppo and Scanieroon; from thence by
Sea agdin Into Italy, and so over Land into France,
and this put together might be at least a full Diame-
ter of the Globe; but if it were to be measured, I
suppose it would appear to be a great deal more.
I had another Way before me, which was to
wait for some English Ships, which were coming
to Ben'gale from Actiih on the Island of Sumatra,
and get Passage on Board theiri for England: But
as I came hither without any Concern with the En-
glijl) East India Company, so it would be difficult to
go from hence without their License, unless with
great Favour of the Captains of the ships, or of
'- the Companies Factors, and to both, I was an utter
Stranger.
. Here I had the particular. Pleasure, speaking by
Contraries, to fee the Ship set Sail without me ia
. Treatment.I think a Man in my Circumstances
scarce ever rrjet with, except from Pirates running
away with a Ship, and setting those that would not agree with their Villany, on Shore: Indeed this
was neit Door to it, both ways ; however, my
O 2 Nephew
Nephew left me two Servants, or rather, one Com-
panion, and one Servant, the first was Clerk to the
Purser, who he engagg'd to go with me, and the
other was his own Servant « , 1 took me also a good
Lodging in the House of an EnglishWoman, where
several Merchants lodg'd -, some trench, two Itali-
ans, or rather Jews, and one Englijb Man: Here I
was handsomely enough entertain'd; and that I
might not be said to run rashly upon any Thing, I
stay'd here above nine Months, considering what
Course to take, and how to manage myself, I had
some EnglishGoods with me of Value, and a consi-
derable Sum of Money, my Nephew furnishing me
with a thousand Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of
Credit for more, if I had Occasion, that I might
not be straiten'd whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my Goods, and to Advan-
tage too; and, as I originally intended, I brought
here some very good Diamonds, which, of all
other Things, was the most proper for me, in my
Circumstances, because I might always carry my
whole Estate about me.
After a long Stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none falling out to
my Mind, the EngliJI) Merchant who lodged with
me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate
Acquaintance, came to me one Morning : Country-
man, says he, I have a Project to communicate to
you, which, as it suits with my Thoughts, may for
ought I know, suit with your's also, when you shall
have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, Ashe, you by Accident, and
I by my own Choice, in a Part of the World very
remote from our own Country ; but it is in a Coun-
try, where, by us who understood Trade and Busi-
ness, a great deal of Money is to be got: If you
will put a thousand Pound, to my thousand Pound,
we will hire a Ship here, the first we can get to our
Minds; you shall be Captain, I'll be Merchant,
and we will go a Trading Voyage to China-, for
what should we stand still for? The whole World
is in Motion, rotiling round and round; all the
Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are
busy and diligent, Why should we be idle? There
are no Drones, says hejivhtg in the World but Men,
Why should we be of that Number >
I lik'd'his Proposal very well, and the more, because it seemed to be expressed with so much good
Will, and in so friendly a Manner: I will not say,
but that I mightAby my loose and unhing'd Circum-
stances be the fitter to embrace a Proposal for Trade,
and indeed for any Thing else; or, otherwise,
Trade was none of my Element: However, I might
perhaps-say with some Truth, that if Trade was
not my Element, Rambling was ; and no Proposal
for seeing any Part of the World which I had never seen before, could possibly come amiss to me.
It was however, some time before we could get a
Ship to our Minds; and when we had got a Vessel,1
it was not easy to get Evglijh Sailors s that is to fay,
so many as were necessary to govern the Voyage,
and manage the Sailors which we should pick up
there: After some time we got a Mate, a Boat-
swain, and a Gunner, EngliJJ) ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese Fore-mast Men ; with these we
found, we could do well enough, having Indian
Sea-men, such as they are, to make up.
There are so many Travellers, who have wrote
the History of their Voyages and Travels this Way,
that it would be very little Diversion to any Body,
to give a long Account of the Places we went to,'
and the People who inhabit there: Those Things I
leave to others, and refer the Reader to those Journ-
als and Travels of Englijb Men, of which, many I
find are published, and more promis'd every Day;
'tis enough to me to tell you, that we made the
Voyage to Achin, in the Island of Sumatra first,
and from thence to Sww, where we exchang'd some
0 2
of our Wares for Opium, and for some Arrack, the
first, a Comodity which bears a great Price among
the Chinese, and which at that Time, was very much
wanted (here in a Word, we went up to Suafaw,
made a very great Voyage was eight Months out,
and return'd to Bengale, and I was very well satis-
fy'd with my Adventure: I observe that cur People
in England, often admire how the Officers which
the Company ;fend into India, and the Merchants
which generally stay there, get such very great E-
ftates as they do, and sometimes come Home worth
60, to 70 and 100 thousand Pound at a Time.
But it is no Wonder, or at least we shall see so
much farther into it, when we consider the innume-
rable Ports and Places where they have a free Com*
merce, that it will then be no Wonder ; and much
less wist it be so, when we consider, that at all those
Places and Ports where the hvglijl) Ships come,
there is so much, and inch constant Demand for
the Growth of all other Countries, that there is a
certain Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market
abroad, for the Goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got
fb much Money by the first Adventure, and such an
Insight into the Method of getting more, that had
I been twenty Year ycunger, I should have been
tempted to have staid here and sought no farther,
for making my Fortune * but what was all this, to
a Man on the wrong Side of threescore? That was
rich enough, and came abroad more in Obedience to
a restless Desire of seeing the World, than a cove-
tuous Desire of getting in it -t and indeed I think,
'tis with great Justice, that I now call it a restless
Desire, for it was so; when I was at Home, I was
restless to go abroad * and now I was abroad
I was restless to be at Home: Isay, what
was this gain to me ? I was rich enough already,
nor had I any uneasy Desires about getting more
Money ; and therefore, the Profits of the Voyage
to
to me, were Things of no great Force, for the
prompting me forward to farther Undertakings;
Hence I thought, that by this voyage, I had made
no progress at all; because I was come back as I
might call it, to the Place from whence I came, as
to a Home; whereas, my Eye, which like that,
which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with
Seeivg, was still more desirous of Wand'ring and
Seeing ; I was come into a Part of the World, which
I was never in before ; and that Part in particular,
which I had heard much of; and was resolvM to
fee as much of it as I could; and then I thought, I
might fay, I had seen all the World, that was worth
feeing.
But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different
Notions; I do not name this, to insist upon my
own, for I acknowledge his was the most just and
the most suited to the end of a Merchants Life;
who, when he is abroad upon Adventures, 'tis. his
wisdom to stick to that, as the best Thing for him,
which he is like to get the most Money by : My
new Friend kept himself to the Nature of the
Thing, and would have been content to have gone
like a Carrier's Horse, always to the fame Inn, back-
ward and forward, provided he could, as he call'd
it, find bis Account in it; on the other Hand, mine
as old as I was, was the Notion of a mad ramb-
ling Boy, that never cares to fee a Thing twice
over.
But this was not all, Ihad a Kind of Impatience
upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the most un-,.
fettled Resolution immaginable, which Way to go;
in the Interval of these Consultations, my Friend,
who was always upon the Search for Business, pro-
pos'd another Voyage to me, (viz.) among the
Spice Islands; and to bring Home a Loading of
Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts Places
where indeed the Dutch do Trade, but the Islands, be*

far, but to some other, where they have not the
whole Power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c.
We were not long in preparing for this Voyage^
the chief Difficulty was in bringing me to come in-
to it however, at last nothing else offering, and
finding that really stirring about and Trading, the
Profit being so great, and as I may fay certain, had
more pleasure in it, and more Satissaction to the
Mind, than sitting still, which to me especially, was
the unhappiest Part of Life: I resolv'd on this Voy-
age too, which we made very succelsfuliy, touching
at Borneo, and several Iflands, whose Names I do
not remember, and came Home in about five
Months; we sold our Spice, which was chiefly
Cloves, and some Nutmegs, to the Persian Merch-
ants, who carried them away for the Gu!ph ; and
making near five of one, we really got a great deal
of Money.
My Friend, when we made up this Account
smiPd at me ; well now, said he, with a sort of
agreeable insult upon my indolent Temper; is not
this better than walking about here, like a Man of
yotbing to do, and spending our Time in staring at
the Nonsense and Ignorance of the Pagans? Why
truly, fays 1 my Friend, I think it is ; and I begin
to be a Convert to the Principles of Metchandising;
but I must tell you, said I, by the Way, you do
not know what I am a doing, for if once I conquer,
toy backwardness, and imbark heartily; as old as I
am, I shall harrass you up and down the World,'till
I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lye still.
But to be short with my Speculations, a little
while after this, there came in a Dutch ship from
Batavia $ she was a C after, not an European trader,
and of about two hundred Tun Burthen : The Men,
as they pretended having been so sickly, that the Cap-
tain had not Men enough to go to Sea with 3, he lay
by at Bengal,and as if having got Money enoughs
or being willing for other Reasons, to go for Europe,
he gave publick Notice, that he would fell his Ship:
This came to my Ears before my new Partner heard
of it; and I had a great Mind to buy it, so I goes
Home to him, and told him of it ; he considers a
while, for he was no rash Man neither $ but musing
some Time, he reply'd, she is a little to, big, buc^
however, we will have her: Accordingly we bought
the Ship, and agreeing with the Master, we paid for
her, and took Possession when we had done so,
We resolv'd to entertain the Men if we could, to
join them with those we had, for the pursuing our
Business; but on a sudden, they having received
not their Wages, but their share of the Money, as
we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be
found •. We enquir'd much about them, and at length
were told, that they were all gone together by Land
to Agra, the great City of the Mogul's Residence 5;
and from thence were to travel to Snratte, and so by *
Sea, to the Gulph of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good
while ) as that I miss'd the Opportunity of going
with them; for such a Ramble I thought, and in
such Company as would both have guarded me, and
diverted me, would have suited mightily with my
great Design ; and I should both have seen the
World, and gone homewards too 5 but I was much
better satisfied a few Days after, when I came to
know what lort of Fellows they were; for in fort,their History was, that this Man they call'd Captain
was the Gunner only, not the Commander $ that
they had been a Trading Voyage, in which, they
were attack'd on Shore, by some of the Mallajcmttf a/who had kuTd the Captain and three of his Men \
and that after the Captain was kiU'd, these Men,
Eleven in Number, had resolved to run away with
the Ship, which they did j and had brought her in
at the Bay of Bengal,leaving the Mate and five Men
more on Shore, of whom, we shall hear farther.
Well,
Well, let them come by the Ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, at we thought; tho' we
did not, Iconfess examine into Things so exactly as
we ought, for we never enquired any Thing of the
Seamen ; who, if we had examin'd, would certain-
ly have saulter'd in their Accounts, contradicted
one another, and perhaps contradicted themselves
or one how or other, we should have seen Reason
to have suspected them; but the Man shew'd us a
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Closterjho-
ven, or some such Name ; for I suppose it was all
a Forgery, and call'd himself by that Name, and
we could not contradict him; and being withal, a
little too unwary, or at least, having no Suspicion of
the Thing, we went thro' with our Bargain.
We pick'd up some more EnglishSeamen here af-
ter this, and some Dutch; and now we resolved for
a second Voyage, to the Southeast for Cloves, &c.
that is to say, among the Philippine and MoUucco
Isles ; and in short, not to fill this Part of my Story
With Trifles, when what is yet to come, is so re-
markable ; I spent from first to last, six Years in
this Country, trading from Port to Port, backward
and forward, and with very good success, ; and was
now the last Year with my Partner, going in the
Ship ahove-mention'd, on a Voyage to China; but
designing first to Siam to buy Rice.
In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblgtfd
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of
JMaBacca, and among the Islands; we were no soon-
er got clear of those difficult Seas, but we found
our ship had sprung a Leak, and we were not able
tr. all our Industry to find out where it was: This
ifcrc'd us to make for some Port, and my Partner,
who knew the Country better than I did, directed
the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for
I hadmade the English Mate one Mr. Thomson, Cap-
tain, not being willingto take the Charge of the Ship.
upon

upon myself: This River lies on the North Side of
the great Bay or Gulph, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on Shore;
for Refreshment, there comes to me one Day aq
English Man, and he was it seems a Gunner's Mate,
on board an EnglishEast-India Ship, which rode in
the same River, up at, or near the City of Cambo-
dia ; what brought him hither we knew not * but
he comes up to me, and speaking English): Sir, says
he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you ; but I
have something to tell you, that very nearly con-
cerns you.
I looked steadily at him a good while, andL'V
thought at first I had known him, but I did not ; if / ;r
it very nearly concerns me, said 1, and not yourself,
what moves you to tell it me > I am moved, says he,
by the eminent Danger you are in, and for ought I
fee, you have no knowledge of it t I know no Dan-
ger I am in, said I, but that my Ship is leaky, and
I cannot find it out; but I propose to lay her a-
Ground to Morrow, to see if I C3n find it ; but Sir,
lays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, or not find it,
you will be wiser than to lay your Ship on Shore to
Morrow, when you hear what I have to fay to you;
do you know Sir, said he, the Town of Cambodia;'lyes about fifteen Leagues up this River ? and there
are two large Englijb Ships about five Leagues on
- this Side, and three Dutch \ weftsaid I, and what is
that to me > Why Sir, said bey is it for a Man that
is upon such Adventures as you are upon, to come
into a Port, and not examine first what Ships there
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them >
I suppose you don't think you are a Match for them:
I was amused very much at his Discourse, but not
amaz'd at it, for I could not conceive what he meant *
and I turn'd short upon him and said, Sir, I wish
Jou would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what
Lessen I have to be afraid of any of the Company's
Ships or Dutch Ships; I am no Interloper, what can
they have to say to me? He
He looked like a Man half angry, half pleased, and pausing a while, but smiling ; well Sir, says he,if you think yourself secure, you must take your
Chance ; I am sorry your Fate should blind you^
against good Advice; but assure yourself if you do
not put to Sea immediately, you will the very next
Tide be attack'd by five Long-Boats full of Men,
and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hang'd for a
Pirate, and the Particulars be examined afterwards s
1 thought Sir, added he, I should have met with a
better Reception than this, for doing you a Piece of
Service of such Importance : I can never be ungrate-
ful, said J, for any Service or to any Man that of-
fers me any kindness, but it is past my Comprehen-
sion, laid I, what they should have such a Design
upon me for; however, since you say, there is no
Time to be lost, and that there is some villainous
Design in Hand against me 3I'll go on board this
Minute, and put to Sea immediately, if my Men
can stop the leak, or if we can swim without stop-
ping it ; But, Sir, said [, shall I go away ignorant
of the Reason of all this > Can you give me no far, ther Light into it >
I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, says he,
hat, I have a Dutch Seamen here with me, and I be-
lieve I could persuade him to tell you the rest ; but
there is scarce time for it. But the short of the
Story is this, the first Part of which, I suppose, you
know well enough, (viz.) that you was with this
Ship at Sumatra; that there your Captain was mur-
ther'd by the MaUayam, with three of his Men *
and that you, or some of those who were on Board
with you, ran away with the Ship, and are since
turn'd FIRATES; this is the Sum of the Story,
and you will be all seiz'd as Pirates I can assure you*
and executed with very little Ceremony j for you
know, Merchants Ships shew but little Law to Pi-
rates,if they get them in their Power.
Now,
Now you speak plain EfgUJby said I, and I thank
you ; and tho' I know nothing, that we have done,
like what you talk of, but am sure we came honest-
ly and fairly by the Ship, yet seeing such Work is a
doing as you fay, and that you seem to mean honest-
ly, I'll be upon my Guard; nay, Sir, says he, do
not talk of being upon your Guard; the best De-
fence is to be out of the Danger; if you hav«any
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men' s put out to Sea without fail at High Water, and as
you have a whole Tide before you, you will be gone
too far out before they can come down4 for they
will come away at High Water; and as they have
twenty Miles to come, you get near two Hours of
them, by the Difference of the Tide, not reckoning
the length of the Way % besides, as they are only
Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow
you far out to Sea, especially if it blows.
We\\says J, you have been very kind in this, what
shall I do to you, for make you amends ? Sir, says '. .,/1 tfk!- ,
he, you may not be fb willing to make me any
amends, because you may not be convinc'd of the
Truth of it: I'll make an offer to you ;I have nine-
teen Months Pay due to me, on board the Ship-
which I came out of England in, and the Dutch
Man that is with me, has seven Months Pay due to
him; if you will make good our Pay to us, we will
go along with you ; if you find nothing more in it,
we will desire no more; but if we do convince you,
that we have sav'd your Lives, and the Ship, and
the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave the
rest to you.
I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two Men with me; as soon as I
- came to the Ship Side, my Partner who was on
board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and call'd
to me with a great deal of Joy, O ho! Oho! we
have stoppedthe leak '. we have stoppedthe leak! Say
you so, said /, thank God 5 but weigh the Anchor
then
then immediately: Weigh! Saj bei What do yoii
mean by that > What is the Matter, sayshe? Ask
no Questions fays J, but all Hands to work, and
weighs without loosing a Minute: He was surpriz'd,
but however, he call'd the Captain, and he immedi-
ately order'd the Anchor to be got up; and tho' the Tide was not quite done, yet a little Land
Breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea then I call'd
him into the Cabin and told him the Story at large,
and we call'd in the Men, and they told us the rest
of it} but as it took us up a great deal of Time,
ib before we had done, a Sea-man comes to the Ca-
bin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad
him tell us, we were chas'd ; chas'djiyi /, by who, a) and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, says the
Fellow, full of Men; very well, said J, then it is
apparent there is something in it 5 in the next place I order'd all our Men to be call'd up, and told
them, that there was a Design to seize the Ship,
2nd to take us for Pirates, and ask'd them, if they
would stand by us, and by one another_the Men
Jinfwered chearfully, that one and all, they would
ive and die with us: Then I asked the Captain,
what Way he thought best for us to manage a
Fight with them; tor resist them I resolved we
would, and that to the last drop; he said readily;
That the Way was to keep them off with our great
Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at them'
with our small Arms to keep them from boarding
us) but when neither of these would do any long-
er, we should retire to our close Quarters ; perhaps
they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-
Heads, or get in upon us.
The Gunner had in the mean Time Order, to
bring two Guns to bear fore and aft, out of the Steerage, to clear the Deck, and loaded them with
Muiquit-Bullets and small pieces of old Iron, and
what next came to Hand, and thus we made ready
for Fight} but all this while we kept out to Sea,
with Wind enough; and could see the Boats at a
Distance,, being five large Long-Boats, following us,
with all the sail they could make.
Two of these, Boats, which by our Glasses we
could see, were English,had out sailed the rest, were
near two Leagues a Head of them, and gain'd upon
us considerably ; so that we found they would come
up with us; upon which, we fired a Gun without
a Shot, to intimate, that they should bring too,
and we put out a Flag of Truce, as a Signal for
Parley? but they kept crowding after us, ^till they
came within Shot: Upon this we took in our white
Flag, they having made no Answer to it, hung out
a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot: Not-;
withstanding this, they came on, 'till they were
near enough to call to them with a speaking Trum-
pet, which we had on Board ; so we called to them,
and bid them keep off at their Peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and endea-
voured to come under our Stern, Ib to board us on
our Quarter; upon which, seeing they were resc*
lute for Mischief, and depended upon the strength
that followed them, I ordered to bring the Ship too,
so that they lay upon our Broad-fide, when immedi-
ately we fir'd five Guns at them ; one of which,
had been levelled so true, as to carry away the Stern
of the hindermost Boar, and bring them to the Ne-
cessity of taking down their Sail, and running all to
the Head of the Boat to keep her from sinking ; so
she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the
foremost Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to
fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three Boats
that was behind, being forwarder than the other
two, made up to the Boat which we had disabled, to
relieve her, and we could afterwards see her take
out the Men; we call'd again to the foremost Boar,
and offer'd a Truce to parley again, and to know
what was her Business with us 5 but had no answer, only she crowded close under our Stern; upon this
our Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run
out his two Chase-Guns and fired again at her 5
but the shot missing, the Men in the Boat shouted,
wav'd their Caps, and came on ; but the Gunner
getting quickly ready again, fired among them the
second Time; one Shot of which, tho' it mife'd
the Boat itself, yet fell in among the Men, and we
could easily see, had done a great deal of Mischief
among them; but we taking no notice of that,
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to
bear upon them; and firing three Guns more, we
found the Boat was split almost to Pieces; in parti-
cular, her Rudder, and a Piece of her Stern was
ihot quite away, so they handed their Sail immedi-
ately, and were in great Disorder; but to compleat
their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at
them again *, where he hit them we could not tell,
but we found the Boat was sinking, and some of the
Men already in the Water ; upon this, I immedi-
ately man'd out our Pinnace, which we had kept
close by our Side, with Orders to pick up some of
the Men if they could and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them $
because we saw the rest of the Boats began to come
up i our Men in the Pinnace followed their Orders,, and took up three Men ; one of which was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could
recover him j as soon as they were on Board, we?x,
crouded all the Sail we could make, and stood farther out to Sea, and we found that when the other three Boats came up to the first two* they gave over
their Chace
Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which tho'
I knew not the Reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I apprehended ; I took Care that we
would change our Course, and not let any one ima-
gine whither we were going; so we stood out to
Sea Eastward, quite out of the Course of all Euro-
pean
pean Ships, whether they were bound to China, or
any where else, within the Commerce of the Euro-
pean Nations,
When we were now at Sea, we began to consult
with the two Seamen, and enquire first, what the-
meaning of all this should bedlams .the Dutch-TSAin
let us into the secret of it at once ;. telling us,that
the Fellow that fold us the Ship, as we said, was no
more than a Thief, that had run away with her:
Then he told us, how, the Captain, whose Name
too he told us, tho' I do not remember it now, was
treacherously murthered by the Natives on the
Coast of Mallaca, with three of his Men, and that
he, this Dutch Man, and four more got into the
Woods, where they wandred abi ut a great while;
'till at length, he in particular, in a miraculous
manner made his Escape, and swam off to a Dutch
Ship, which sailing near the Shore, in its Way from
China, had sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water;
that he durst not come to that Part of the Shore
where the Boat was, but made shift in the Night,
tp take into the Water farther off, and swimming a
great while, at last the Ship's Boat took him up.
, He then told us, that he went to Battavia, where
two of the Sei:men belonging to the ShipAarriv'd,
having deserted the rest in their Travels, and gave an
Account, that the Fellow who had run away with
the ship, fold her at Bengals,to a Set of Pirates,
which were gone a Cruising in her; and that, they
had already taken an EnglishShip and two Dutch
Ships very richly laden. .
This later Parr, we found to concern us directly*
and tho' we knew it to, be false ; yet as my Partner
said very well, if we had fallen into their Hands,
and they had had such a Preposition again.us before-
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended
ourselves, or to hope for any good Quarters at their
Hands ; especially considering that our Accusers had
been our judges, and that we could have expected
P nothings
nothing from them, but what Rage would have di-
ctated, and ungoverned Passion have executed; and
therefore it was his Opinion, we should go directly
back to Bengale, from whence we came, without
putting in at any Port whatever; because there, we
could give a good Account of ourselves, and could
prove where we were when the Ship put in, who
we bought her of, and the like; and which was
more than all the rest, if we were put to the Ne-
cessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we
should *be sure to have some Justice, and not be
hang'd first, and judg'd afterward.
I was sometime of my Partner's Opinion; but
after a little more serious thinking, I told him, I
thought it was a very great Hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal,for that we were on the wrong
fide of the Straits of Malacca; and that if the A-
larm was given, we should be sure to be Way-laid
on every side, as well by iheDutch of Battavia, as the
English else-where; that if we should betaken, as
it were, running away, we should even condemn
ourselves, and there would want no more Evidence
to destroy us ; I also asked the EnglishSailor's Opini-
on, who said, he was of my Mind, and that we
should certainly be taken.
This Danger, a little startled my Partner and all
the Ship's Company ; and we immediately resolved
to go away to the Coast of Tonquin,anA so on to Chi*
»«, and from thence pursuing the first Design as to
Trade, find some Way or other to dispose of the
Ship, and come back in some of the Vessels of the
Country, such as we could get: This was approved
of as the best Method for our Security ; and accord-
ingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty
Leagues off from the usual Course to the Eastward.
This however put us to some Inconveniences; for
first the Winds, when we came to that Distance
from the Shore, feem'd to be more steadily against
us, blowing almost Trade, as we call it, from the £alf;
East, and E N. E. so that we were a long while
upon our Voyage, and we were but ill provided
with Victuals for so long a Run; andA which was
still worse, there was some Danger that those English
and Dutch Ships, whose Boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that Way, might be got in before
us ; and if not, some other Ship, bound to China,
might have Information of us from them, and pur-
sue us with the same Vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and
thought myself, including the late Escape from the
Long-Boats, to have been in the most dangerous
Condition that ever I was in, thro' all my past Life;
for whatever ill Circumstances I had been in, I was
never pursued for a Thief before; nor had I ever
done any Thing that merited the Name of Dishonest
or Fraudulent, much less Thievish : I had chiefly
been my own Enemy, or.as I may rightly fay, I had
been no Body's Enemy but my own: But now I
was embarrassed in the worst Condition immagina-
ble; for tho' I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
Condition to make that Innocence appear : And if
I had been taken it had been under a supposed guilt
of the wctt Kind -, at least, a Crime etteem'd so
amovigthe People I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape,
tho', which Way to do it, I knew not ; or what
Port or Place we should go to: My Partner seeing
me thus dejected, tho' he was the most concern'd at
first, began to encourage me and describing to me
the several Ports of that Coast, told me he would
put in, on the Coast of Chocbincbina. or the Bay
of Toitqubi 5 intending to go afterwards to Macao,
a Town once in the Possession of the Portngiteze, and
where still a great many European Families resided,
and particularly the missionary priests usually went
thither, in order to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go ; and accordingly,
tho' after a tedious and irregular Course, and very
Pa . much
much straited for Provisions, we came within Sight
of the Coast very early in the Morning and upon
Reslection, upon the past Circumstances we were in,
and the Danger if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into a small River, which, however, had a
Depth enough of Water for us, and to fee if we
could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace,
come to know what Ships were in any Port therea-
bouts. This happy Step, was indeed our Delive-
rance; for tho' we did not immediately see any Eu-
ropean Ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet the next
Morning, there came into the Bay two Dutch Ships,
and a third without any Colours spread out,but which
we believed to be a Dutch Man, passed by at about
two Leagues Distance, steering for the Coast of Chi-
na; and in the Afternoon went by two Englifi Ships
steering the same Course 5 and thus, we thought,
we saw ourselves beset with Enemies, both one way or other. The Place we were in was Wild and Bar-
barous, the People Thieves, even by Occupation or
Profession ; and tho' it is true, we had not much to
leek of them, and except getting a few Provisions,
car'd not how little we had to do with them, yet it
was with much Difficulty, that we kept ourselves
from being insulted by them several Ways.
We were in a small River of this Country, with-
in a few Leagues of it's utmost Limits Northward;
and by our Boat, we coasted North-East to the Point
of Land, which opens the great Bay of Tortquzn;
and it was in this beating up along the Shore, that
we difcover'd as above, that in a Word, we were
surrounded with Enemies. The People we were
among, were the most barbarous of all the Inhabi-
tants of the Coast; having no Correspondence with
any other Nation, and dealing only in Fish, and
Oil, acid such gross Commodities; and it may be
particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the most
barbarous of any of the Inhabitant's ( viz) that
among other Customs they have this as one, (viz.)
That
That if any Vessel have the Misfortune to be Ship-
wreck'd upon their Coast, they presently make their
Men all Prisoners, that is to fay Slaves; and it was
not long before we found a spice of their Kindness
this Way, on the occasion following.
I have observed above, that Our Ship sprung a
Leak at Sea, and that we could not find it out ; and
however, it happened, that as I have said it was
ftopp'd unexpectedly in the happy Minute of our
being to be seiz'd,by the Dutch and English Ships iij
the Bay of Siam ; yet as we did not find the Ship so
perfectly tight and found as we desired, we resolv'd,
while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore,
take out what heavy Things we had on Board,
which were not many, and to wash, and clean her
Bottom; and, if possible, to find out where the
Leaks were.
Accordingly, having lighten'd the Ship, and
brought all cur Guns, and other moveable Things to
one fide, we try'd to bring her down, that we might
come at her Bottom ; for on second Thoughts, we
did not care to lay her dry, a Ground, neither could- we find out a proper Place for it.
The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down the Shore,
to look at us ; and seeing the Ship lie down on one
fide in such a manner, and heeling it) towards thej
Shore; and not seeing our Men, who were at Work on her Bottom with Stages and with their Boats on
the off side, they presently concluded, that the Ship was cast away and lay so very sast on the Ground.
On this supposition, they came all about us in two
or three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats,
having some of them eight, some ten Men in a Boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board, and
plunder'd the Ship; and if they had found us there,
to have carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or
whatever they call him; for we knew nothing, who
was their Governour. -
P 3 When
When they came up to the ship, and began to
row round her, they discovered us all hard at Work,
on the Out fide of the Ship's bottom and side, wash-
ing, and graving, and stopping, as every seasaring
Man knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we,
who were a little surpriz'd, could not imagine
what their Design was; but being willingto be sure,
we took this Opportunity, to get some of us into
the Ship, and others to hand down Arms and Am-
munition to those that were at Work, to defend
themselves with,if there should be occasion ; and it
was no more than Need ; far in less than a quarter .
of an Hour's Consultation, they agreed, it seems,
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all
at Work. endeavouring to save her, or to lave our
our Lives by the Help of our Boats, and when we
hand, our Arms into the Boats, they concluded, by
that Motion, that we were endeavouring to save
some of our Goods ; upon this they took it for
granted, we all belong'd to them ; and away they
came Directly upon our Men, as if it had been in a
Line of Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted ; for we lay but in an ill posture to fight,
and cry'd out to us, to know what they should do:
I immediatly call'd to the Men who work'd upon the
Stages, to flip them down, and get up the fide into
the Ships and bad those in the Boat to row round
and come on Board ; and those few of us, who were
on board, work'd with all the strength and hands we
had, to bring the Ship to Rights ; but however,
neither the Men upon the Stages, ,or those in the
Boats, could do as they were order'd, before the
Cochinchinejfes were upon them; and,twe of their
Boats boarded our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold
of the Men as their Prisoners.
The first Man they laid hold of, was an English-
Seaman, a stout, strong Fellow, who having a Mus-
ket
ket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire it, but laid itdown in the Boat like a Fool, at I thought: But he
understood his Business better than I could teach him
for he grappled the Pagan, and dragg'd him by
main Force, out of their own Boat into ours; where,
taking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head so
against the Boafs Gunnel, that the Fellow dy'd in-
stantly in his Hands ; and in the mean time, a Dutch
Man, who stood next, took up the Musket, and
with the But-end of it, so laid about him, that he
knock'd down five of them, who attempted to en-
ter the Boat; But this was doing little towards re-
sisting thirty or forty Men, who fearless, because ig-
norant of their Danger, began to throw themselves
into the Long-Boar, where we had but five Men it fall to defend it: But one Accident gave our Men a
compleat Victory, which deserv'd our Laughter ra-
ther than any Thing else, and that was this:
Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out-
fide of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where
he had caulk'd her to stop the Lakes, had got two
Kettles just let down into the Boat ; one fill'd with
boiling Pitch, and the other with Rosin, Tallow,
and Oil, and such stuff, as the Ship Wrights use for
that Work ; and the Man that tended the Carpenter,
had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with which he
supply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot stuff ; two of the Enemies Men entred the Boat just
where this Fellow stood, being in the Fore-sheets;
he immediately saluted them with a Ladle full of
the Stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt, and scalded
them, being half naked, that they roar'd out like
two Bulls, and enrag'd with the Fire, leap'd both
into the Sea: The Carpenter saw it, and cry'd out, Well done, Jack, give them some more of it; when
stepping forward himself, he takes one of their
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his
Man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in
short, of all the Men in three Boats, there was not
P 4" one
one that was not scalded^ and burnt with it in a most
frightful pitiful Manner, and made such a Howling
and Crying, that I never heard a worse Noise, and
indeed nothing like it; for it is worth observing,
That tho' Pain Naturally makes all People cry our,
yet every Nation have a particular way of Excla-
mation, and make Noises as different from one ano-
ther, as their Speech 5I cannot give the Noise, these
Creatures made, a better Name than Howling, nor
a Name more proper to the Tone of it; for I never
heard any Thing more like the Noise of the Wolves,
which as I have said, I heard howl in the Forest on
the Frontiers of Langueioc.
I was never pleas'd with a Victory better in mv
Life ; not only as it was a perfect surprize to me,
and that our Danger was imminent before: But as
we got this Victory without any Bloodshed, except
of that Man the Fellow kill'd with his naked Hands,
and which I was very much concern'd, at: for I was
iick of killing such poor Savage Wretches, even
tho'it was in my own Defence, knowing they came
on Errands, which they thought just, and knew no
better % and that tho' it may be a mst Thing, because
necessary, for there is no neeffary Wickedness in
Nature; yet I thought it was a fad Life, when we
must be always oblig'd to be killing our fellow-
Creatures to preserve ourselves, ,indeed I think so
still; and I would even now suffer a great deal, ra-
ther than I would take away the Life, even of the
worst Person injuring me : I believe also, all conside-
ring People, who know the Value of Life, would be
of my Opinion, if they entred seriously into the con-
sideration of it.
But to return to my Story; al l the while this was
doing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the rest of
the Men on Board, had with great Dexterity
brought the Ship almost to Rights ; and having got-
ten their Guns into their Places again, the Gunner
call'd to me, to bid our Boat get out of the Way,
* ",for for he would let fly among them. I called back
again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the
Carpenter would do the Work without him ; but
bad him heat another Pitch-Kettle, which our Cook,
who was on Board, took Care of: But the Enemy
was so terrifyM with what they had met with in
their first Attack, that they would not come on
again $ and some of them that were farthest off, fee-
ing the Ship swim, as it were upright, begun, as
we supposed, to see their Mistake, and give over
the Enterprize, finding it was not as they expected:
Thus we got clear of this merry Fight; and having
gotten some Rice, and some Roots, and Bread,
with about sixteen good big Hogs on Board, two
Days before; we resolved to stay here no longer,
but go forward whatever came of it t, for we made
no Doubt but we should be surrounded the next Day
with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-
Kettle would dispose of for us.
We therefore got all our Things on Board the fame
Evening, and the next Morning was ready to fail;
in the mean time, lying at an Anchor some Distance
from the Shore, we were not so much concern'd,
being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a fail-
ing Posture, if any Enemy had presented : The next
Day having finished our work within Board, and
finding our Ship was perfectly heal'd of all her Leaks,
we set sail; we would have gone into the Bay of
Tonquiri; for we wanted to inform ourselves of what
was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that
had been there, but we durst not stand in there;
because we had seen several Ships go in, as we sup-
pos'd, but a little before, so we kept on N. E. to-
wards the Ifle of Formosa,as much afraid of being
seen by a Dutch or EngliJI) Merchant Ship, as a
Dutch or English Merchant Ship in the Medheranean
is of an Algerine Man of War.
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E.
as if we would go to the Manillas or the PhiDippine
Islands
Islands} and this we did that we might not fall into
the Way of any of the European Ships; and then
we fteer'd North again, 'till we came to the Latitude
of 22 Degrees, :o Minutes; by which means we
made the island Formosa directly, where we came to
an Anchor, in order to get Water, and fresh Provi-
sions, which the People there, who are very courte-
ous and civil in their Manners, supply'd us with
willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually^ with
us in all their Agreements and Bargains; which is
what we did not find among other People; and may
be owing to the Remains of Christianity, which
was once Planted here by a Dutch Missionary of Pro-
testants, and is a Testimony of what I have often
observed, viz. That the Christian Religion always
civilizes the People, and reforms their Manners,
where it is receiv'd, whether in Works laving Ef-
fects upon them or no.
From hence we sail'd still North, keeping the
Coast of China at an equal Distance, 'till we knew
we were beyond all the Ports of China, where our
European Ships usually come -y being resolved, if pos-
sible, not to fall into any of their Hands, especially
in this Country, where, as our Circumstances were,
we could not fail of being entirely ruined ; nay,.so
great was my Fear in particular, as to my being ta-
ken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much
rather have chosen to fall into the Hands of the
Spanish Inquisition.Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading Port we
should come at; and standing in for the Shore, a Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old Por-
tuguese Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be art
European Ship, came to offer his Service, which in-
deed we were very glad of, and took him on Board}
upon which, without asking us whether we would-
go, he dismiss'd the Boat he came in, and fent it
back.
I thought
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to
make the old Man carry us whither we would ; that
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the
Gulph of Rianquin, which is the most Northern
Part of the Coast of China: The old Man said he
knew the Gulph of Nanquin very well; but, smiling,
ask'd us what we would do there >
I told him, we would fell our Cargo, and pur-
chase China-Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea,
Wrought-Silks, cJc. and so would return by the fame
Course we came: He told us our bett Port had
been to have put in at Macao, where we could not
have sail'd of a Market for our Opium, to our Sa- ''
tissaction, and might for our Money have purchas'd
all Sorts of Cj&z««-Goods, as cheap as we could at
Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old Man out of his
Talk, of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, nJ
I told him, we were Gentlemen^ as well as Merch-
ants, and that we had a Mind to go and fee the
great City of Pecking, and the famous Court of the
Monarch of China, Why then, says the old Man,
you should go to Ningpo, where, by the River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up with-
in five Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a :f
navigable made Stream, which goes thorow the
Heart of that vast Empire of China, crosses all the
Rivers, passes some considerable Hills,by the Help
of Sluices and Gates, and goes up to the City of
'Becking, being in Length near 270 Leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not
our Business now: The great Question is, if you
can carry us up to the City of Nanquin, from
whence we can travel to Pecking afterwards? Yes,
he said, he could do so very well, and that there was
a great Dutch Ship gone up that Way just before.;/
This gave me a little Shock; a Dutch Ship was now
our Terror, and we had much rather have met the
Devil 1 at least, if he had not come in too fright-
ful
ful a Figure; we depended upon it, that aDutch
Ship would be our Destruction, for we were in no
condition to fight them all the Ships they trade
with into those Parts being of great Burthen, and
of much greater Force than we were.
The old Man found me a little confus'd, and un-
der some Concern, when he nam'd a Dutch Ship,
and said to me, Sir, you need be under no Apprehen-
sions of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now at War
.I with your Nation: No, says I, that's true; but I
know not what Liberties Men may take when they
are out of the Reach of the Laws of their own
Country ; Why, fays he, you are no Pirates, what
need you fear> They will not meddle with peacea-
ble Merchants sure.
If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly
up into my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by
some Stop in the Vessels, appointed by Nature to
circulate it; for it put me into the greatest Disor-
der and Confusion imaginablej Nor was it possible
for me to conceal it io, but that the old Man easily
perceiv'd it.
Sir, lays he, I find you are in some Disorder in
your Thoughts at my talk, pray be pleas'd to go
which Way you think fit, and depend upon it, I'll
do you all the Service I can. Why, Seignior, said
I, it is true, lama little unsettled in my Resoluti-
on at this Time, whither to go in particular ; and I
am something more so, for what you said about Pi-
rates, I hope there are no Pirates in these Seas; we
are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for
you fee we have but a small Force, and but very
weakly mann'd.
O Sir, fays he, do not be concerned, I do not
know that there has been any Pirates in these Seas
these fifteen Years, except one which was seen, as I
hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a Month since; but
you may be assured she is gone to the Southward;
nor was she a Ship of any great Force, or fit for, the
the Work * she was not built for a Privateer, but
was run away with by a Repfibate Crew that were) on Board, after the Captain and some of his Men
had been murther'd by the Malayans, at or near
the Island of Sumatra.
What! SAID I, seeming to know nothing of the
Matter, Did they murther the Captain? No,y«ihe,
I do not understarid that they murther'd him: but, as they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is ge-
nerally believ'd they betray'd him into the Hands of
the Malayans, who did murther him, and perhaps
they procur'd them to do it: Why then, said I,
they deserve Death as much as if they had done it
themselves: Nay, says the old Man, they do deserve
it, and they will certainly have it, if they light up-
on any English or Dutch Ship; for they have all a-
greed together, that if they meet that Rogue, they
will give him no Quarter.
But, said I to him, you fay the Pirate is gone out
of these Seas, how can they meet with him then >
Why, that is true, fays he, they do fay so; but he
was, as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River
Cambodia, and was discovered there by some Dutch
Men who belonged to the Ship, and who were left
on Shore when they run away with her ; and some
English and Dutch Traders being in the River, they
were within a little of taking him : Nay, said be9
if the foremost Boats had been well seconded by the
reft, they had certainly taken him but he finding
only two Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about,
and fir'd at these two, and disabled them, before the
other came up, and then standing off to Sea, the
other were not able to follow him, and so he got
away: But they have all so exact a Description of
the Ship, that they will be sure to know him and
where-ever they find him, they have vow'd to give at no Quarter to either the Captain, or the Seamen,
but to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
What!
What! says I, will they execute them right or
wrong, hang them first, and judge them afterwards?
O Sir! fays the old Pilot, there's no Need to make
a formal Business of it with such Rogues as thole,
let them tye them Back to Back, and set them a div-
ing; 'tis no more than they richly deserve.
I knew I had my old Man sait aboard, and that-
he could do me no Harm, so that I turn'd short up-
on him: Well now, Seignior, said I, and this is
the very Reason, why I would have you carry us up
to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or to
any other Part of the Country, where the EngliJI) or Dutch Ships come; for be it known to you, Seigni-
or, those Captains of the EngliJI) and butch Ships,
are a Parcel of rash, proud, insolent Fellows, that
neither knows what belongs to Justice, nor how
to behave themselves, as the Laws of God and Na-
ture direct; but being proud of their Offices, and
not understanding their Power, they would act the
Murtherers to punish Robbers •, would take upon
them to insultMen salslyaccuied,and determine them
guilty without due Enquiry j and perhaps I may
live to call some of them to an Account for it,
where they may be taught how Justice is to be exe^
cuted, and that no Man ought to be treated as a
Criminal, 'till some Evidence may be had of the
Crime, and that he is the Man.
With this I told him, that this was the very Ship
they; attack'd, and gave him a full Account of the
Skirmish we had with their Boats, and how fool-
ishly and coward-like they behav'd. I told him all
the Story of our buying the Ship, and how the
Dutch Men served us. I told him the Reasons I had
to believe that this Story of killing the Master by
the Malayans was true ; as also the running away
with the Ship ; but that it was all a Fiction of their
own, to suggest that the Men were turn'd Pirates;
and they ought to have been sure it was so, before
they had ventur'd t6 attack us by Surprize, and
* oblige
oblige us to resist then, ; adding that they would
have the Blood of those Men, who we kill'd there
in our just Defence, to answer for.
The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and
told us, we were very much in the Right to go away
to the North, and that if he might advise us, it
should be to fell the Ship in China, which we might
very well do, and buy or build another in the
Country s and, said he, tho' you will not get fo
good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to
carry you and all your Goods back again to Ben-
gale, or any where else.
I told him, I would take his Advice, when I
came to any Port where I could find a Ship for my
Turn, or get any Customer to buy this : He reply'd,
I should meet with Customers enough for the Ship
at Nanquin, and that a Chinese Junk would serve
me very well to go back again; and that he would
procure me People, both to buy one, and sell the
other.
Well, but Seignior, says I, as you fay they know
the Ship so well, I may perhaps, if I follow your
Measures, be instrumental to bring some honest in-
nocent Men into a terrible Broil, and perhaps to be
murther'd in cold Blood for wherever they find the .
Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the Men, by
proving this was the Ship, and so innocent Men
may probably be overpower'd and murther'd: Why,
says the old Man, I'll find out a Way to prevent
that also ; for as I know all those Commanders you
speak of very well, and shall see them all as they
pass by, I will be sure to set them to Rights in the
Thing, and let them know that they had been so
much in the Wrong; that tho' the People, who
were on board at first, might run away with the Ship,
yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates *
and that in particular, these were not the Men that
first went off with the Ship, but innocently bought
her for their Trade ; and I am persuaded they will so
far
sat believe me, as at least to act more cautioufly for
the Time to come. Well, says J, and will you de-
liver one Message to them from me? Yes, I will,
sayshe,if you will give it under your Hand in Writ-
ing, that I may be able to prove it came from you,
.I and not out of my own Head. I answered, That I
would readily give it him under my Hand; so I
took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large
the Story of assaulting me with the Long-Boats;
etc.the pretended Reason of it, and the unjust cruel
Design of it; and concluded to the Commanders,
that they had done what they not only should have
been ashamed of, but also, that if ever they came to
England, and I liv'd to see them there, they should
all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Country
were not grown out of Use before I arriv'd there.
My old Pilot read this over and over again, and
ask'd me several Times if I would stand to it ? I an swer'd, I would stand to it as long as I had any
/ Thing left in the Word, being sensible that I should
one Time or other find an opportunity to put it
home to them: But we had no occasion ever to let
the Pilot carry this Letter; for he never went back
again: While those Things were passing between us,
by Way of Discourse, we went forward, directly
for Nanquin, and in about thirteen Days Sail came
to an Anchor at the South West Point of the great
Gulph of Nanqnin, where, by the Way, I came by
^Accident to understand, the two Dutch Ships were
gone that length before me, and that I should cer-
tainly fall into their Hands; I consulted my Partner
again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a
Lois as I was, and would very gladly have been safe
on Shore almost any where; however, I was not in
such Perplexity neither, but I ask'd the old Pilot,
if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might
put into, and pursue my Business with the Chinese
privately, and be in no Danger of the Enemy: He
told me if I would fail to the Southward about two
and forty Leagues, there was a little Port call'd
^tnnchang, where the Fathers of the Mission usual-
ly landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the
Christian Religion to the Chinese,and where no
European Ships ever put in; and if I thought to put
in there, I might consider what farther Course to
take when I was on Shore : He confefs'd, he laid,
it was not a Place for Merchants, except that at
some certain Times, they had a kind of a Fair there,
when the Merchants from Japan came over thither
to buy the Chinese Merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the
Name of the Port, as he call'd it, I may perhaps
spell wrong ; for I do not particularly remember it,
having lost this, together with the Names of many
other Places, set down in a little Pocket-Book, which
was spoiled by the Water, on an Accident, which I
(hall relate in its Order ; but this I remember, that
the Chinese, or Japanese Merchants we corresponded
with, call'd it by a differing Name from that which
Our Portuguese Pilot gave it, and pronounced it a$
above, J^uinchang. [
As we were unanimous in our Resolutions, to go
to this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, having
only gone twice on shore, where we were to get
fresh Water; on both which Occasions, the People
of the Country were very civil to us, and brought
Us abundance of Things to sell to us; I mean, of
Provisions, Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and some Fowlsj
but nothing without Money.
We came to the other Pott, ("the Wind being con-
trary) not 'till five Days, but it was very much to
our Satisfaction 5 and I was joyful, and I may fay,
thankful, when I set my Foot safe bn Shore ; re-
solving, and my partner too, that if it was possible
to dispose of ourselves and Effects, any other way, tho' not every way to our Satisfaction, we would
never set one Foot on board that unhappy Vessel
iliore; and indeed I must acknowledge, that of all
Q,. the
the Circumstances of Life, that ever I had any Ex-
perience of, nothing makes Mankind lb compleatly
miserable as that, of being in constant Fear: Well
does the Scripture lay, the Fear os Man brings a
Snare; it is a Life of Death, and the Mind is so
entirely supprels'd by it, that it is capable of no
Reliefs the animal Spirits fink and all the Vigour
of Nature, which usually supports Men under
other Afflictions, and is present to them in the great-
est Exigencies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of it's usual Operations upon the
Fancy, by heightening every Danger, representing
the English and Dutch Captains, to be Men uncapa-
ble of hearing Reason, or of distinguishing between
honest Men and Rogues; or between a Story calcu-
lated for our own Turn, made out of nothing, on
purpose to deceive ; and a true genuine Account of
our whole Voyage, Progress, and Design ; for we
might many Ways have convinced any reasonable
Creature, that we were not Pirates; the Goods we
had on board, the Course we steer'd, our frankly
shewing ourselves, and entering into such and such
Ports even our very Manner, the Force we hid,
the Number of Men, the few Arms, little Ammu-
nition, short Provisions all these would have served to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates; the
Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would
make it appear the Ship had been at Bengale; the
Dutch Men, who it was said, had the Names of all
the Men that was in the Ship, might easily fee that
we were a Mixture of Englijl), tortugueze, and Indi-
ans, and but two Dutch Men on board : These, and
many other particular Circumstances, might have
made it evident to the Understanding of any Com.
mander, whose Hands we might fall into, that we
were no pirates. But Fear, that blind useless Passion, work'd ano-
ther Way, and threw us into the Vapours $ it be-
wildred our Understandings, and set the Imagination
at
at Work, to form a thousand terrible Things, that
perhaps might never happen we first supposed, as
indeed every Body had related to us, that the Sea-
men on board the English and DutchShips, but
especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the Name
of a Pirate, and especially at our beating of their
Boats, and escaping, that they would not give
themselves leave to enquire, whether we were Pi-
rates or no; but would execute us off Hand, as we
call it, without giving us any Room for a Defence;
we reflected that there was really so much apparent
Evidence before them, that they would scarce en-
quire after any more; as first, That the Ship was
certainly the fame, and that some of the Seamen
among them knew her, and had been on board her, and secondly, That when we had intelligence at the
River of Cambodia, that they were coming down to
examine us, we fought their Boat and fled ; ib that
we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfy'd
of our being Pirates, as we were satisfy'd of the
contrary; and as I often said, I know not but I
should have been apt to have taken these Circum-
stances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and
my Cafe was theirs, and have made no Scruple of
cutting all the Crew to Pieces, without believing,
or perhaps considering, what they might have to
offer in their Defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our Ap-
prehensions «, and both my Partner and I too, scarce
slept a Night, without dreaming of Halters, and
Yard-Arms; that is to say, Gibbets, of fighting,
and being taken ; of killing, and .being kill'd $ and
one Night I was in such a Fury in my Dream, fan-
cying the Dutch Men had boarded us, and I was
knocking one of their Seamen down that I struck
my double Fist against the Side of the Cabin 1 lay
in, with filch a Force, as wounded my Hand most
grievously, broke my Knuckles, and cut and bruised
the Flesh ; Id that it not only wak'd me out of my
Q. 2 Sleep,
Sleep, bat I was once afraid I should have lost two
of my Fingers.
Another Apprehension I had, was of the cruel
Usage we might meet with from them, if we fell
into their Hands , then the Story of Amboyna came
into my Head, and how the Dutch, might perhaps
torture us, as they did our Country-men there and
make some of our Men by extremity of Torture,
confess those Crimes they never were guilty of}
own themselves, and all of us to be Pirates, and so
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appear-
ance of Justice ; and that they might be tempted
to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and Cargo,
which was worth four or five thousand Pound, put
altogether.
These Things tormented me and my Partner too,
Night and Day; nor did we consider that the Cap
tains of Ships have no Authority to act thus; and
if we had surrenders Prisoners to them, they could
would be accountable for it, when they came in
their own Country: This I say, gave me no Satisfa-
ction; for if they will act thus with us, what Ad-
vantage would it be to us, that they would be
call'd to an Account for it; or if we were first to
be murthered, what Satissaction would it be to us,
to have them punifli'd when they came Home >
I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Refle-
ctions I now had upon the past Variety of my par-
ticular Circumstances; how hard I thought it was,
that I who had spent forty Years in a Life of conti-
nu'd Difficulties, and was at last come as it were to
the Port of Haven, which all Men drive at, (viz.)
to have Rest and Plenty, should be a Volunteer in
new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice; and
that I, who had escaped so many Dangers in my
Youth^stiould now come to be hang'd in my old
Age, and in so remote a Place, for a Crime I was
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of 4

torturing us, but
and
and in a Place and Circumstance, where Innocence
was not like to be any Protection at all to me.
After these Thoughts, something of Religion
would come in ; and I should be considering, that
this seemed to me to be a Disposition of immediate
Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and sub-
mit to it as such ; that although I was innocent as
to Men, I was far from being innocent as to my
Maker ; and I ought to look in and examine, what
other Crimes in my Life, were most obvious to me;
and for which, Providence might justly inflict this
punishment, as a Retribution , and that I ought to
submit to this, Just as I would to a Ship wreck, if
it had pleased God to have brought such a Disaster
upon me.
In its Turn, Natural Courage would sometimes
take.it's Place; and then I would be talking myself
up to vigorous Resolutions, that I would not be ta-
ken, to be barbarously used by a Parcel of mercy-
less Wretches, in cold Blood ; that it were much
better to have fallen into the Hand.of the Savages,
who were Man-Eaters, and who, I was sure, would
feast upon me, when they they had taken me; than
by those, who would perhaps glue their Rage upon
me, by inhuman Tortures and Barbarities; that
in the Cafe of the Savages, I always resolved to die
fighting, to the last Gasp, and why should I not
do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful to me
at least, to think of falling into these Mens Hands,
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men;
for the Savages, give them their due, would not eat
a Man 'till he was dead, and kilN them first, as
we do a Bullock ; but that these Men had many
Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death: When ever these
Thoughts prevail'd, I was sure to put myself in a
kind of Fever, with the Agitations of a supposed
right ; my Blood would boil, and my Eyes sparkle,
as if I was engag'd5 and I always resolv'd that I would take no Quarter at their Hands ; but even at
Q. 3 last,
last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up
the Ship and all that was in her, and leave them but
little Booty to boast of
By how much the greater Weight, the Anxieties
and Perplexities of these Things were to our
Thoughts while we were at Sea, by so much the
greater was our Satissaction, when we saw ourselves
on Shore ; and my Partner told me he dream'd,
that he had a very heavy Load upon his Back, which
he was to carry up a Hill, and found that he was
not able to stand long under it; but that the Por-
tuguese Pilot came and took it off his Back, and
the Hill disappears, the Ground before him mew-
ing all smooth and plain, and truly it was so, we
were all like Men, who had a Load taken off their
Backs.
For my Part, I had a Weight taken off from my
Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear;
and as I said above, we resolved to go no more to
Sea in that Ship: When we came on Shore, the old
Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a Lodging
and a Ware House for our Goods, which by the
Way, was much the lame ; it was a little House or
Hut, with a large House joyning to it, all built with
Canes, and pallisadoed round with large Canes, to
keep out pilfering Thieves, of which, it seems
there were not a few in that Country however, the
Magistrates allowed us also a little Guard, and we
had a Soldier with a kind of Halberd, or Half pike,
who stood Sentinel at our Door; to whom we al-
lowed a Point of Rice, and a little Piece of Money
about the Value of three Pence per Day, so that our Goods were kept very safe.
The Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had
been over some Time ; however, we found that there
were three or four Junks in the River, and two Ja-
gamers; I mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods
which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having Japanese Merchants on Shore.
The
The first Thing our eld Portugueze Pilot did for
us, was to bring us acquainted with three missionsry RorhiJI) Priests, who were in the Town, and who
had been there some Time, converting the People
to Christianity; but we thought they made but
poor Work of it, and made them but sorry Chri-
stians when they had done; however, that was
none of our Business: One of these was a French
Man, who they call'd Father Simon; he was a jolly
well conditions Man, very free in his Conversation,
not seeming so serious and grave as the other two
did; one of whom was a Portugueze, and the
other a Genoese; but Father Simon was courteous,
easy in his Manner, and very agreeable Company $
the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and
austere, and apply'd seriously to the Work they
came about, (viz.) to talk with, and insinuate
themselves among the Inhabitants, where-ever they
had Opportunity; we often eat and drank with
those Men, and tho' I mutt confess, the Conversion
as they call it, of the Chinese* to Christianity, is fir far from the true Conversion, required, to bring Hea-
then People to the Faith of Christ, that it seems to
amount to little more, than letting them know the
Name of Christ, and say some Prayers to the Virg-
in Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which they un-
derstand not, and to cross themselves and the like;
yet it must be confessed that these Religious, who
we call Missionaries, have a firm Belief that these
People shall be saved, and that they are the Instru-
ments of it; and on this Account, they undergo*
not only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards
of living in such Places, but oftentimes Death it-
self, with the most violent Tortures, for the Sake
of this Work; and it would be a great w;mt of
Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of the
work itself, and the Manner of their doing it, if
we should not have a good Opinion of their Zeal,
who undertake it with so many Hazards, and who
Q 4 have
have no Prospect of the least Temporal Advantage
to themselves.
But to return to my Story ; this French Priest Far
ther Simon, was appointed it seems, by Order of
the Chief of the Mission, to go up to Peking, the
Royal Seat of the Chinese Emperor, and waited on-
ly for another Priest, who was order'd to come to
him from Macao, to go along with him ; and we
scarce ever met together, but he was inviting me to
go that Journey with him, telling me, how he
would shew me all the glorious Things of that
mighty Empire; and among the rest, the greatest
City in the World; a City, said he, that your Lo*,
ion and our Paris put together cannot be equal to:
This was the City of Peking, which I confess is ve-
ry great, and infinitely full of People; but as I
looked on those Things with different Eyes from
other Men, so I shall give my Opinion of them in
few Words, when I come in the Course of my Tra-
vels, to speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my Fryar or Missionary ; di-
ning with him one Day, and being very merry to-;
gether, I shew'd some little Inclination to go with
him, and he press'd me and my Partner very hard, t
and with a great many Perfwafions to consent ; why
Father Simon, lays my Partner, why should you de-
fire our Company so much : You know we are He-
reticks, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us
Company with any Pleasure? 0! says he, you
may perhaps be good Catholicks in Time j my Bu-
siness here is to convert Heathens, and who knows
but I may convert you too ? Very well, Father said
fj, so you will Preach to us all the way I won't be
troublesome to you, Ashe, our Religion does not
divest us of good Manners ; besides, lays his, we
are here like Country-men, and so we are, compa-
red to the PUce we are in ; and if you ase Hugo,
nots, anvl I a Catholick, we may be all Christians
at last i at ^east, said he, we are all Gentlemen,
. «nd
. -!

and we may converse ib, without being uneasy to
one another. I lik'd that Part of his Discourse ve-
ry well, and it began to put me in Mind of my
Priest, that I had left in the Brasik; but this Fa-
ther Simon did not come up to his Character, by a
great deal § for tho' Father Simon had no appearance
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had
not that Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and
sincere Affection to Religion, that my other good
Ecclefiastick had, of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, tho' he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him but we had some-
thing else before us at that time ; for we had all
this while our Ship, and our Merchandize to dis-
pose of, and we began to be very doubtful what
we should do, for we were now in a Place of very
little Business; and once I was about to venture to
fail for the River of Islam,and the City of fianquin:
But Providence seem'd now' more visible as I
thought, than ever, to concern itself in our Affair *
and I was encouraged from this very Time, to
think, I should one Way or other get out of this
tangled Circumstance, and be brought Home to my
own Country again, tho' I had not the least view of the Manner: And when I began sometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it
was to be done * Providence, I say, began here to
clear up our Way a little; and the first Thing that
offered was, that our old Portugueze Pilot brought a
Japan Merchant to us, who began to enquire what
Goods we had f, and in the first Place, he bought
all our Opium, and gave us a very good Price for it paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small Pieces,
of their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of
about ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were
dealing with him for our Opium, it came into my
Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the
Ship too, and I ordered the Interpreter to propose
it to him j he shrunk up his Shoulders at it, when
V. "> : j -- , it
it was first propos'd to him; but in a few Days af-
ter, he came to me with one of the missionary
priests for his Interpreter, and told me, he had a
Proposal to make to me, and that was this; he had
bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he
had no Thoughts for Proposals made to him) of buy-
ing the Ship; and that therefore, he had not Mo-
ney enough to pay for the Ship; but if I would
let the lame Men who were in the Ship navigateher,
he would hire the Ship to go to Japan, and would
fend them from thence to the Philippine Islands
with another Loading, which he would pay the
Freight of, before they went from Japan; and
that at their Return he would buy the Ship: I be-
gan to listen to his proposal, and so eager did my
Head still run upon Rambling, that I could not but
begin to entertain a Notion myself of going with
him, and so to sail from the Philippine Islands, away
to the South Seas ; and accordingly I ask'd the Ja-
panese Merchant, if he would not hire us to the
Philippine Islands, and discharge us there; he said,
no he could not do that, for then he could not
have the Return of his Cargo; but he would dis-
charge us in Japan, he said, at the Ship's Return.
Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and going myself $ but my Partner, wiser than my-
self, persuaded me from it, representing the Dangers
as well of the Seas, as of the Japoneses, who are a
false, cruel, and treacherous People ; and then of
the Spaniards at the Philippines, more salsa, more
cruel, more treacherous than they.
But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a
a Conclusion; the first Thing we had to do, was to
consult with the Captain of the Ship, and with his
Men, and know if they were willing to go to Ja-
panand while I was doing this, the young Man,
who, as I said, my Nephew had left with me as
my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and
told me, that he Thought that Voyage promised
very
very Fair, and that there was a great Prospect of
Advantage, and he would be very glad if I under-
took it ; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I
pleas'd to order him ; that if ever he came to Eng-
land, and I was there, and alive •, he would render
me a faithful Account of his success, and it should
be as much mine as I pleas'd.
I was really loth to part with him, but consider-
ing the Prospect of Advantage which was really
considerable, and that he was a young Fellow, as
likely to do well in ir; as any I knew, I inclin'd to
let him go * but first I told him, I would consult
my Partner, and give him an Answer the next Day *
my Partner and I discoursed about it, and my Part-
ner made a most generous Offer; he told me, you
know it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both re-
solve not to go to Sea in it again ; if your Steward,
so he calTd my Man, will venture the Voyage, I'll
leave my Share of the Vessel to him and let him
make his best of it; and if we live to meet in Eng-
land) and he meets with success abroad, he shall ac-
count for our Half of the Profits of the Ship's
Freight to us, the other shall be his own.
If my Partner, who was no Way concerned with
my young Man, made him such an Offer, I could
do no less than offer him the same; and all the
Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we
made over Half the Ship to him in Property, and
took a Writing from him, obliging him to account
for the other and away he went to Japan. The
Japan Merchant prov'd a very punctual honest
Man to him, protected him at Japan, and got him
a License to come on Shore, which the Europeans
in general have not lately obtained ; pay'd him
his Freight very punctually, sent him to the Philip-
pines, loaded with Japan and China Wares, and a
Supra-Cargo of their own, who trafficking with
Spaniards, brought back European Goods again,
and

and a great Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice i
and there he was not only pay'd his Freight very
well, and at a very good Price, but being not wil-
ling to fell the Ship then, the Merchant surnisiYd
him with Goods, on his own Account; that for
feme Money, and some Spices of his own, which
he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas,
to the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very well;
Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his Ship made a free Ship; and the Govern-
our of Manilla hired him, to go to Acapulco,in
America, on the Coast of Mexico, and gave him a
License to Land there, and travel to Mexico, and to
pass in any Spamfli Ship to Europe, with all his Men.
He made the voyage to Accapulco very happily,
and there he fold his Ship; and having there also
abtained Allowance to travel by Land to Porto Bello,
he found Means some how or other, to get to Ja-
maica, with all his Treasure; and about eight Ygats
after, came to England exceeding Rich,: Of the;
the which, I shall take Notice in its Place ; in the
mean Time, I return' to our particular Affairs.
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Com-
pany; it came before us of course, to consider
what Recompence we should give to the two Men,
that gave us such timely Notice of the Design
against us in the River of Cambodia: The Truth
was, they had done us a considerable Service,, and
deferv'd well at our Hands; tho' by the Way, they
were a Couple of Rogues too ; for as they believes
the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had re-
ally run away with the Ship, they came down to
us, not only to betray the Design that was form'd
against us, but to go to Sea with us as Pirates; and
one of them confessed afterwards, that nothing
else but the Hopes of going a Rouging, brought
him to do it ; however, the Service they did us
was not the less; and therefore as I had promis'd
to be grateful to them, I first ordered the Money to
'he
be pay'd to them, which they said was due to them
on board their respective Ships; that is to far, the
English Man nineteen Months Pay, and to the Dutch
Man seven; and over and above that, I gave them,
each of them, a small Sum of Money in Gold,
and which contented them very well ; then I made
the Etiglifi Man Gunner in the Ship, the Gunner
being now made Second-Mate, and Purser; the
Dutch Man I made Boatswain so they were both
very well pleas'd, and prov'd very serviceable, be-
ing both able Seamen, and very stout Fellows.
We were now on Shore in China ; if I thought
myself banish'd, and remote from my own Country
at Beugale, where I had many Ways to get home for
my Money; what could I think of myself now?
When I was gotten about a thousand Leagues far-
ther off from Home, and perfectly destitute of all
manner of Prospect of Return.
All we had for it was this, that in about four
Months Time, there was to be another Fair at the
Place where we were, and then we might be able
to purchase all sorts of the Manufactures of the
Country, and withal, might possibly find some Chi-
nese Jonks or Vessels from Tonquin, that would be;
to be sold, and would carry us and our Goods, whi-
ther we pleas'd ; this I lik'd very well, and resolved to wait ; besides, as our particular Persons were
not obnoxious, so if any Englishor Dutch Ships
came thither, perhaps we might have an Opportu-
nity to load our Goods, and get Passage to some
other Place in India.neater Home.
Upon these Hopes we resolv'd to continue here;
but to divert ourselves, we took two or three Jour-
neys into the Country ; first we went ten Days Jour-
ney to see the City of Nanquin, and a City well
worth seeing indeed; they say it has a Million of
People in it; which however, I do not believe; it
is regularly built, the Streets all exactly strait, and
cross one another, in direct Lines, which gives the
figure of it great Advantage. But
k' But when I come to compare the miserable Peo»
pie of these Countries with ours, their Fabricks,
their manner of Living, their Government, their
Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as some
call it) I must confess, I do not so much as think
it is worth naming, or worth my while to write of,
or any that shall come after me to read.
It is very observable that we wonder at the Gran-
deur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the
Government, the Manusactures, the Commerce, and
the Conduct of these People "snot that it is to be
wonder'd at, or indeed in the least to be regarded j
but because, having first a true Notion of the Bar-
barity of those Countries, the Rudeness and the
Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to
find any such things Ib far off.
Otherwise, what are their Buildings to the Pala-
ces and Royal Buildings of Europe} What their
Trade, to the universal Commerce of England, Hol-
land; France and Spain} What their Cities to ours,
for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rich
Furniture, and an infinite Variety ? What are their
Ports, supply'd with a few Jonks and Barks, to our
Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and
powerful Navys? our City of London has more
Trade than all their mighty Empire : One English,
or Dutch, or French Man of War of 80 Guns,
would fight with, and destroy all the Shipping of
China: But the Greatness of their wealth, their
Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength
of their Armies, is surprising to us, because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous Nation
of Pagans, little better than Savages, we did not
expect such Things among them; and this indeed
Is the Advantage with which all their Greatness and
Power is represented to us j otherwise it is in itself
nothing at all; for as I have said of their Ships, so
may be said of their Armies and Troops ; all the
Forces of their Empire, tho' they were to bring
two
two Millions of Men into the Field together, would
be able to do nothing but ruin the Country, and
starve themselves: If they were to besiege a strong
Town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplin'd Army, _
one Line of German Curiafliers, or of French Caval- i ;ni. t'
ry, would overthrow all the Horse of China; A Mil-
lion of their Foot could not stand before one embat-
tled Body of our Infantry, posted so as not to be
furr©unded,tho' they were not to be One to Twenty in /
Number; nay, I do not boast, if I say that 30000
German or EngUJJ) Foot, and 10000 French Horse,
would fairly beat all the Forces of China : And Ib
of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our En-
gineers in assaulting and defending Towns 5 there's
not a fortified Town in China, could hold out one
Month against the Batteries and Attacks of an Eu- . - /
ropean Army; and at the same time all the Armies
of China could never take such a Town as Dunkirk,
provided it was not starved ; no, not in a ten Years
Siege. They have Fire-Arms, 'tis true, but they
are awkward clumsy and uncertain in going off: They have Powder, but it is of no Strength: They
have neither Discipline in the Field, Exercise to
their Arms, Skill to Attack, or Temper to Retreat j
and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange to
me, when I came home, and heard our People say
such fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory,
Magnificence, and Trade of the Chinese; because I
law, and knew, that they were a contemptible Herd
or Crowd of ignorant sordid Slaves, subjected to a
Government qualified only to rule such a People}
and in a word, for I am now launch'd quite beside
my Design, I say, in a word, were not its Diliance
inconceivably great from Muscovy, and was not the '/
Muscovite Empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill
govern'd a Crowd of Slaves as they, the Czar of
Muscovy might with much Ease drive them all out
of their Country, and conquer them in one Cam-
paign j and had the Czar, who 1 since hear is a
grow-
growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable in
the world, fallen this Way, instead of attacking the
Warlike Smedet, in which Attempt none of the
Powers of tvrope would have envy'd or interrupted
him; he might by this time have been Emperor of
China, instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden
at Narva, when the latter was not One to Six in
Number. As their Strength and theif Grandeur,
ib their Navigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is
imperfect and impotent, compar'd to the same Things
in Europe; also in their Knowledge, their Learning,
their Skill in the Sciences; they have Globes and
Spheres, and a match of the Knowledge of the
Mathematicks; but when you come to inquire into
their Knowledge, how sliort-fighted are the wisest
of their Studients! they know nothing of the Mo-
tion of the Heavenly Bodies; and so grofly absurdly
ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they think
'tis a great Dragon has assaulted and run away with
it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums
and Kettles in the Country, to fright the Monster
away, just as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
As this is the only Excursion of this kind which
I have made in all the Account I have given of my
Travels, so I shall make no more Descriptions of
Countrys and People, 'tis none of my Business, of
any part of my Design; but giving an Account of
my own Adventures, through a Life of inimitable
Wandrings, and a long Variety of Changes, which
perhaps sew that come after me will have heard the
like of the mighty Places, desart Country's, and nu-
merous People, I have yet to pals thro' more than re-
lates to my own Story, and which my Concern among
them will make neceflary. I was now, as near as I
can compute, in the heart of China, about the La-
titude of thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we
were return'd from Nanquin ;I had indeed a mind to
fee the City of Pekin, which I had heard so much of,
and Father Simon importun'd me daily to do it; at
length
length his Time of going away being set, and the o-
ther Missionary, who was to go with him, being ar-
riv'd from Macao, it was necessary that we should re-
solve, either to go, or no^to go; so I referr'd him to
my Partner, and left it wholly to his Choice, who at
length resolv'd it in the Affirmative, and we prepared
;( for our Journey. We set out with very good Advan-
tage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel
in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of
Viceroy, or principal Magistrate in the Province where
they reside, and who take great State upon them,
travelling with great Attendance, and with great
Homage from the People, who are sometimes great-
ly impoverished by them, because all the Countries
they pass thro' are oblig'd to furnish provisions for
them and all their Attendance: That which I par-
ticularly observed, as to our travelling with his Bag-
j/ gage,was this, that tho' we reeeiv'd sufficient Provi-
sions, both for our selves and our Horses, from the
Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, ye we were
oblig'd to pay for every thing we had, after the
Market Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's Steward, or Commissary of the Provisions, collected
it duly from us ; so that our travelling in the Re-
tinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very great Kind-
ness to us, was not such a mighty Favour in him,
but was indeed a great Advantage to him, consider-
ing there were about thirty other People travell'd in
the fame Manner besides us, under the protection of
his Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy:
This, I fay, was a great Advantage to him, for the
Country furnish'd all the Provisions for nothing, and
he took all our Money for them.
We were five and twenty Days ttavelling to Peking, -
through a Countty infinitely populous, but misera-
bly cultivated; the Husbandry, the Economy, and
the Way of living, all very miserable, tho' they boast
so much of the Industry of the People^ I say, mise-
rable; and so it is, if we who understand how to
R live
live were to endure it, or to compare it with our
own, but not so to these poor Wretches who know
no other: The Pride of these People is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty,
which adds to that which I call their Misery, I must
needs think the naked Savages of America live much
more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they
desire nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent,
and in the main are meet Beggars and Drudges;
their Ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly
fliew'd in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which
Is to the last Degree ridculous, their Contempt of
all the World but themselves.
I must confess, I travell'd more pleasantly after-
wards in the Deserts and vast Wildernesses of Grand
Tartary, than here; and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept, and very convenient for Tra-
vellers; but nothing was more aukward to me, than
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent People,
In the midst of the grossest Simplicity and Ignorance,
for all their sam'd Ingenuity is no more : My Friend
Father Simon and I us'd to be very merry upon these
Occasions, to see the beggarly Pride of those People;
for Example: Coming by the House of a Country
Gentleman, as Father Simon call'd him, about ten
Leagues off of the City of Nanquin, we had first of
all the Honour to ride with the Matter of the House,
about two Miles: The State he rode in, was a per-
fect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of Pomp and
Poverty.
The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper
for a Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew, being a dirty
Callicoe, with all the Tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, such as Hanging-Sieves, Tossels, and Cuts and
Slashes almost on every Side it cover'd a Taffaty
Vest, as greasy as a Butcher, and which testify'd,
that his Honour must needs be a most exquisite
Sloven,
His Horse was a poor, lean, starv'd, hobbling Crea-
ture, such as in England might sell for about 30 or
40 shillings, and he had two Slaves follow'd him
on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along; he had a
Whip in his Hand, and he belabour'd the Beast as
sast about the Head, as his Slaves did about theTail^ ,'
and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve Ser-
vants, and we were told he was going from the City
to his Country Seat, about half a League before us:
We travelPd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentle-
man rode away before us, and as we stop'd at a Vil-
lage about an Hour to refresh us, when we came by
the Country Seat of this great Man, We saw him in
a little Place, before his Door, eating his Repast;
it was a kind of a Garden, but he was easy to be
seen, and we were given to understand that the more
we look'd on him, the better he would be pleas'd.
He sat under a Tree, something like the Palmet-
to Tree, which effectually shaded him over the Head,
and on the South Side; bur tinder the Tree also, was
plac'd a large Umbrella, which made that Part look
well enough; he fat lolling back in a great Elbow-
Chair, being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat
being brought him by two Women Slaves; he had
two more, whose Office, I think, few Gentlemen in
Europe would accept of their Service in, (vie) One
fed the Squire, with a Spoon, and the other held the
Dish with one Hand, and scraped off what he let fall
upon his Worship's Beard and Taffaty Vest, with the
other; while the great fat Brute thought it below
him to employ his own Hands in any of those sami-
liar Offices, which Kings and Monarchs would ra-
ther do, than be troubled with the clumsy Fingers
of their Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride
puts them to ^ and how troublesome a haughty:
Temper, thus ill-manag'd, mult be to a Man of
common Sense; and leaving the poor Wretch to
please himself with our looking at him, as if we
R 2 admit'
admit'd his Pomp, whereas we really pity'd and dori-
temn'd him, we pursued our Journey ; only Father Si-
mon had the Curiosity to stay to inform him self what
Dainties the Country Justice had to feed on,' in all his
State; which he said he had the Honour to taste of,
and which was, I think, aDose that an Englifi Hound
would scarce have eaten, if it had been offered him,
(wz.)a Mess of boiPdRice, with a great piecerf Gar-
lick in it, and a littletiag fill'd with Green Pepper, and
another Plant which they have there, something like
pur Ginger but smelling like Musk, and tasting like
Mustard ; all this was put together, and a small
Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boil'd in it; and
this was his Worship's Repast, four or five Servants
more attending at a Distance. If he fed them
meaner than he was fed himself, the Spice except-
ed, they must fare very coarsely indeed.
As for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd,
he was respected like a King; surrounded always
with his Gentlemen, and attended in all his Ap-
pearances with such Pomp, that I saw little of
him but at a Distance ; but this I observed, that
there was not a Horse in his Retinue, but that ouf
Carriers Pack Hories in England seem to me to look
much better, but they were so covered with Equi-
page, Mantles, Trappings and suchlike Trumpery,
that you cannot see whether they are fat or lean 5
in a Word, we could see scarce any thing but their
feetand their Heads.
.. I was now light hearted, and all my Trouble and
Perplexity that I have given an Account of being
over, I had no Anxious Thoughts about me, which
made this Journey much the pleasanter ,o) me; nor
had I any ill Accident attended me, only in the pas-
sing or fording a small River, my Horse fell, and
made me free of the Country, as they call it ; that
is tosayt threw me in; the Place was not deep, but
it wetted me all over; I mention it because it spoiPd
my Pocket-Book, wherein I had'set down the Names
r **i 3
of screral People and Places which I had Occasion
to remember, and which, not taking due Care of,
the Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after
to be read, to my great Loss, as to tlje Names of
some places which I touch'd at in this Voyage.
At length we arriv'd at Peking; t had no Bbdy
with me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the
Caprain, had given me to attend me as a Servant,
and who proved very trusty and diligent j and my
Partner had no Body with him but one Servant, who
was a kinsman : As for the Portuguexe Pilot, he
being desirous to fee the Court, we gave him his
Passage, that is to fay, bore his Charges, for his
Company ; and to use him as an Interpreter, for he
understood the Language of the Country, and spoke
good French, and a little English; and indeed, this
old Man was a most useful Impliment to us every
where; for we had not been above a Week at Pe-
king, when he came laughing, Ah, Seignior Ingljsef
fays he, I have something to tell you will make your
Heart glad. My Heart glad, says, What can that be^
I don't know any thing in this Country can either give
me Joy or Grief to any great Degree. Tes, yest said:
the old Man in broken English,make you glad, me
sorrow sorry he would have said. This made me
more inquisitive. Why, said I, will it make you sorry >
Because, said he, you have brought me here 2 J Day'sJourney, and willleave me to go back alone, and which
way JhaB Iget to my Port afterwards without a Ship,
without a Horse, without Pecune? So he called Mo-
ney, being his broken Latin, of which he had a-
bundance to make us merry' with.
In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of
Muscovite and Polish Merchants in" the City, and
they were preparing to set out on their Journey by
Land to Muscovy within four or five weeks,' and he
was sure we would take the opportunity to go with
them, and leave him behind to go back all.alone':
I confess, I was surprise with his Newts 'a secret
R 3 .. Jojf
Joy spread itself over my whole Soul, which I can-
not describe, and never felt before or since, and I
had no power for a good while to speak a Word to
the old Man; but at last I turn'd to him; How do
you know this, said I, are you sure it is true? Yes,
lays he, I met this Morning in the Street Jan old
Acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one you
call a Grecian, who is among them, he came last
from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his mind,
and is now resolv'd to go, with the Caravan to Mus-
cov, and so down the River of Wolha to Astracan.
Well, Seignior, says I, do not be uneasy about be. ing left to go back alone, if this be a Method for
my return to England, it shall be your Fault, if
you go back to Macao at all. We then went to con-
sulting together what was to be done, and I ask'd
my partner what he thought of the Pilot's News,
and whether it would suit with his Affairs > He
told me he would do just as I would, for he had
fettled all his Affairs so well at Bengale, and left his
Effects in such good Hands, that as we had made a
good Voyage here, if he cou'd vest it in China Silks,
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the Car-
riage, he would be content to go to England,and
then make his Voyage back to Bengale, by the Com-
pany's Ship,
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear
his Charges to Moscow,or to England if he pleas'd;
nor indeed were we to be esteem'd over generous in
that Part neither, if we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had done us was really worth
all that, and more; for he had not only been a Pi-
lot to us at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for
Us on Shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan
Merchant, was some hundreds of Pounds in our
Pocket : So we consulted together about it, and be-
ing willing to gratify Um, which was indeed but
doing him Justice, and very willing also to have
him with us besides, for he was a most necessary
Man on all Occasions, we agreed to give him a
quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about 175 Pounds Sterling between us,
and to bear all his Charges, both for himself
and Horse, except only a Horse to carry his
Goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we call'd
him to let him know what we had refolv'd; I told
him, he had complain'd of our being^to let him go
back alone, and I was now to tell him we was re-
folv'd he should not go back at all : That as we
had refolv'd to go to Europe with the Caravan, we
refolv'd also he should go with us, and that we
call'd him to know his Mind. He shook his Head,:
and said, it was a long Journey, and he had no Po.ame to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when
he came there. We told him, we believ'd it was -
so, and therefore we had refolv'd to do something
for him, that should let him see how sensible we
were of the Service he had done us, and also how
agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what
we had refolv'd to give him here, which he might
lay out as we would do our own; and that as for
his Charges, if he would go with us, we would
set him fase a shore, (Life and Casualties excepted)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at
our own Charge, except only the Carriage of his
Goods.
He receiv'd the Proposal like a Man transported,
and told us he would go with us over the whole
World ; and so, in short, we all prepar'd ourselves
for the Journey: However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other Merchants, they had many
things to do, and instead of being ready in five
Weeks, it was four Months and some odd Days,
before all Things were got together.
R 4. It
It was the Beginning of February, out Stile,
when we set from Peking; my Partner and the old
Pilot had gone express back to the Port where we
had first put in, to dispose of some Goods which we
had left there; and I with a Chinese Merchant,
who I had some Knowledge of at Nanquin, and
who came to Peking on his own Affairs, went to
Nanquin, where I bought ninety Pieces of fine Da-
masks, with about two hundred Pieces of other
very fine Silks, of several Sorts, some mix'd with Gold, and had all these brought to Peking against
my Partner's Return ; besides this, we bought a ve-
ry large Quantity of Raw Silk, and some other
Goods, our Cargo amounting in these Goods only ,i
to about three thousand five hundred Pounds Ster-
ling, which, together with Tea, and some fine Cal-
licoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs and
Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for cur Share,
besides those we rode upon ; which with two or
three spare Horses, and two Horses loaded with Pro-
visions, made us in short 26 Camels and Horses in
our Retinue.
The Company was very great, and, as near as I
can remember, made between three and four hun-
dred Horse, and upwards of a hundred and twenty
Men, very well armed and provided for all Events:
For as the Eastern Caravans are subject to be at-
tacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but
they are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs,
not so barbarous when they prevail.
_ The Company consisted of People of several Nai
tions, such as Muscovites chiesly, for there were a-
bove sixty of them who were Merchants or Inhabi-
tants of Moscow,tho' of them some were Livovians,
and to our particular Satissaction, Five of them
were Scots, who appeared also to be Men of great
Experience in Business, and Men of very good
Substance.
When
When we had travelled one Days Journey, the
Guides, who were Five in Number, called all the
Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to say, all the
Passengers, except the Servants, to a great Council,
as they callAit: At this great Council, every one de- 'M
posited a certain Quantity of Money to a common
Stock, for the necessary Expence of buying Forage
on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be hadN ->/
and for satisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and
the like: And here they constituted the Journey,
as they call^it, (viz,) They named Captains and Of- '//
ficers, to draw u all up, and give the Command in
cafe of an Attack, and gave every one their turn of'
Command : Nor was this forming us into Order any
more than what we found needful upon the Way, as
shall be observed in its Place.
The Road all on this Side of the Country is very
populous, and is full of Potters: And Earth makers, that is to far, People that tamper'd the Earth for
the China Ware; and as I was coming along, our
Portugal Pilot, who had always something or other
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and
told me he would show me the greatest Rarity in all
the Country, and that I should have this to say of
China, after all the ill-humour'd things I had said
of it, that I had seen one Thing which was not to
be seen in all the World beside. I was very impor-.
tunate to know what it was : At last he told me it Jere, was a Gentleman's House built all with CbinaWate^ .-,
Well, fays I, are not the Materials of their Build-
ing the Product of their own Country ; and so it
is all China Ware, is not it ? No, no, fays he, I ? .v ^
mean, it is a House all made of China Ware, such
as you call jt in England; or as it is call'd in our r«/
Country, Torcellain. Well, says I, such a Thing
may be $ how big is it > Can we carry it in a Box
upon a Camel ? If we can, we will buy it. Upon a
Camel! says the old Pilot, holding up both his
Hands, why there is a Family of Thirty People lives in
it. I was
As this is one of the Singularities of China, so
they may be allow'd to excel in it; but I am very
sure they excel An their Accounts , of it ; for they
told me such incredible things of their Performance
in Crockery-Ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true; they told
me in particular of one Workman that made a Ship
with all its Tackle, and Masts and Sails, in Earth*
en Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men : If he had
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Ja-
pan in it, I might have said something to it indeed;
but as it was, I knew the whole Story, which was
in short, asking Pardon for the Word, that the
Fellow lyed; so I smiled, and said nothing to it. ij
This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the
Caravan, for which, the Leader of it for the Day,
fined me about the Value of three Shillings, and
told me, if it had been three Days Journey without
the Wall, as it was three Days within, he mult have
fined me four times as much, and made me ask Par-
don the next Council Day; so I promised to be more
orderly; for indeed I found afterward the Orders
made for keeping altogether, were absolutely neces-
sary for our common Safety.
In two Days more, we pass'd the great ChinaWall, made for a Fortification against the Tartars 5
and a very great Work it is, going over Hills and
Mountains in a needless Track, where the Rocks
are impassible, and the Precipices such as no Enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where
if they did, no Wall could hinder them : They tell
us, its Length is near a Thousand Englijh Miles, but
that the Country is five Hundred in a strait measured
Line, which the Wall bounds, without measuring the
Windings and Turnings it takes, 'tis about four
Fathom high, and as many thick in some Places.
I stood still an Hour or thereabout; without tres-
passing our Orders, for so long the Caravan was in
gaffing theGate-t 1 fay, I stood still an Hour to look
at it on every Side, near, and fat off, I mean, that
was within my View; and the Guide of our Cara-
van, who had been extolling it for the Wonder of
the World, was mighty eager to hear my Opinion
of it; I told him it was a most excellent thing
to keep off the Tartars which he happen'd not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for a Com-
pliment; but the old Pilot laugh'd : O Seignior hi-
gkse, fays he, you speak in Colours: In Colours,
said I, what do you mean by that > Why, you
speak what looks White this way, and Black that
way 4 gay one may, and dull another way: you tell
him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars $ you tell
me by that, it is good for nothing but to keep out
Tartars, or it will keep nut none but Tartars; I
understand you, Seigneur Inglese, I understand you,
fays he Joking, but Seigneur Chinese understood
you his own way.
Well, fays I, Seignior, do you think it would
stand out an Army of our Country People, with
a good Train of Artillery ; or our Engineers, with
two Companies of Miners; would not they batter it down in ten Days, that an Army might enter in
Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, Foundation and
all, that there should be no Sign of it left I Ay, ay,
says he, I know that. The Chinese wanted mightily
to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell
him a few Days after, for we was then almost out
of their Country, and he was to leave us in a little
time afterward; but when he knew what I had
laid, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we
heard no more of his fine Story, of the Chinese Pow-
er and Greatness, while he stay'd.
After we had passed this mighty Nothing call'd a
Wall, some h n;» like thePiff* Wall, so samous in
flurtbumbertand, and bu it by the Romans, we began
to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the People
rather confined to live in fortified Towns and Cities,
as being subject to the Inroads and Depredations of
the Tartars, who rob in great Armies, and therefore
are not to be resisted by the naked Inhabitans of an
ojten Country.
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping
together in a Caravan as we travelled ; for we saw
several Troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to fee them distinctly I wonder'd more that
the Chinese Empire could be conquered by such con-
temptible Fellows ; for they are a meer Hoord or
Crowd of wild Fellows 4 keeping no Order,
and understanding no discipline, or manner of
Fight.
Their tfoxies are poor lean starved Creatures,
taught nothing, and fit for nothing; and this we
found the first Day we saw them, which was after
we entered the wilder Part of the Country; our
Leader for the Day, gave Leave for about sixteen of
us to go a hunting, as they call it; and what was
this, but hunting of Sheep; however, it may be
call'd hunting too $ for the Creatures are the wild-
est and swiftest of Foot that ever I saw of their
Kind; only they will not run a great way; and
you are sure of Sport when you begin the Chace j
for they appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock,
and like true Sheep, always keep together when
they fly.
In pursuit of this odd sort of Game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they
were hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they
looked for another kind of Prey, I know not but
as soon as they saw us one of them blew a kind ot a
Horn very loud, but with a barbarous Sound, that I
had never heard before, and by the way, never care to hear again : We all supposed this was to call their
Friends about them, and so it was; for in less than
Half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fif-
ty more appear'd, at about a Mile distance, but
our Work was over first, as it happen'd.
One
One of the Scots Merchants of Mufcow, happen'd
to be amongst us, and as soon as he heard the Horn,
he told us in short, that we had nothing to do, but
to charge them immediately without loss of time;
and drawing us up in a Line, heask'd if we were re-
solved > we told him we were ready to follow him;
so he rode directly up to them: They stood gazing
at us like a meer Crowd, drawn up in no Order,
Hor shewing the Face of any Order at all ; but as
soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their Ar-
rows, which however miss'd us very happily; it
seems they mistook not their Aim, but their Di-
stance ; for their Arrows all fell a little short of us,
but with so true an Aim, that had we been about
twenty Yards nearer, we must have had several Men
wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted, and tho' it was at a great
Distance, we fir'd, and sent them Leaden Bullets,
for Wooden Arrows, following our Shot full Gal-
lop, resolving to fall in among them Sword in Hand,
for ib our bold Scot that led us directed: He was
indeed but a Merchant, but he behav'd With that
Vigour and Bravery on this Occasion, and yet, with
such a cool Courage to, that I never law any Man
in Action fitter for Command. As soon as we came
up to them, we fir'd our pistols in their Faces, and
then drew, but they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable -, the only stand any of them made, was
on our Right, where three of them stood, and
by signs call'd the rest to come back to them, hav-
ing a kind of Symiter in their Hands, and their
Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com-
mander, without asking any body to follow him^
gallops up close to them, and with his Fuzee knocks
one of them off his Horse, kill'd the second with
his Pistol, and the third ran away, and thus ended
our Fight; but we had this Misfortune attending it;
(vbt.) that all our Mutton that we had in chace, got
away; We had not a Man kill'd or hurt s but as
. . for
for the Tartars, there was about 6ve of them killed; how many were wounded, we knew not; but this
we knew, that the other Party was so frighted with
the Noise of our Guns, that they made off, and
never made any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese Dominion,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five Days we enter'd a vast
great wild Desart, which held us three Days and
Nights March; and we were oblig'd to carry out
Water with us in great Leather Bottles, and to en-
camp all Night, just as I have heard they do in the
Deserts of Arabia.
I ask'd our Guides whose Dominion this was in,
and they told me, this was a kind of Boarder, that
might be called no Man's Lavi being a Part of the
Great Karakathay, or Grand Tartary, but that how-
ever it was all reckon'd to China; that there was
no Care taken here, to preserve it from the Inroads
of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon'd the worst
Desart in the whole March ; tho' we were to go
over some much larger.
In passing this Wilderness, whichAI confess was
at the first View very frightful to me, we saw two
or three times little Parties of the Tartars, but they
seemed to be upon their own Affairs, and to have
no Design upon us ; and so, like the Man who met
the Devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we
had nothing to lay to them; we let them go.
Once however, a party of them came so near, as
to stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider
what they should do, (viz.) to attack us, or not at-
tack us, that we knew not ; but when we were
passed at some distance by them, we made a Rear-
Guard of forty Men, and stood ready for them, let-
ting the Caravan pass half a Mile, or thereabouts,
before us * after a while they march'd off, only we
found they assaulted us with five Arrows at their
parting $ one of which, wounded a Horse, so that
s 272 J
it disabled him ;and we left him the next Day, poor
Creature, in great need of a good Farrier; we sup pose they might shoot more Arrows, which might
fall short of us, but we saw no more Arrows or
Tartars, that time.
We travell'd near a Month after this, the Ways
being not so good as at first, tho' still in the Domi-
nions of the Emperor of China, but lay for the most
Part in villages, some of which were fortified, be-
cause of the Incursions of the Tartars. When we
came to one of these Towns, (it was about two
Days and a Half's Journey before we were to come
to the City Nairn ) I wanted to buy a Camel, of
which there are plenty to be fold all the Way upon
that Road, and of Horses also, such as they are,
because so many Caravans coming that way, they
are often wanted : The person that I spoke to to get
me a Camel, would have gone and fetch'd it for
me, but I like a Fool must be officious, and go my-
self along with him: The Place was about two
Miles out of the Village, where, it seems, they kept the Camels and Horses feeding under a Guard;
I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot in Compa-
ny, and a Chinese, being very desirous, forsooth, of
a little Variety: When we came to this Place, it
was a low marshy Ground, wall'd round with a
stone Wall, piled up dry, without Morter or Earth
among it, like a Park with a little Guard of ChineseSoldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and
agreed for the Price, I came away, and the Chinese
Man that went with me, led the Camel; when on
a sudden came up five Tartars on Horse-back; two
of them seized the Fellow, and took the Camel
from him, while „other three step'd up to me ? and -
my old Pilot: Seeing us as it were unarm'd, for I
had no Weapon about me but my Sword, which
could but ill defend me against three Horsemen ;
the first that came up, stop'd short upon my draw-
ing my Sword ("for they are errant Cowards,) but a
Second
Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on
the Head, which I never felt till afterward, and
wondered when I came to myself, what was the
matter with me, and where I was for he laid me flat
on the Ground ; but my never failing old Pilot, the
Portugueze (To Providence unlooked for directs De-
liverances from Dangers, which to us are unfore-
seen ) had a Pistol in his Pocket which I knew no-
thing of, nor the Tartan neither; if they had, I
suppose they would not have attack'd us: But Cow-
ards are always boldest when there is no Danger.
The old Man fixing me down, with a bold Heart
step'd up to the Fellow that had struck me, and
laying hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling
him down by main Force, a little towards himwith
the otherA shot him into the Head, and laid him /
dead upon the spot ; he then immediately step'd up
to him who had stop'd us, as I said, and before he
could come forward again, (for it was all done as
as it were in a moment's made a Blow at him with
a Scymeter which he always wore, but miffing the
Man, cut his Horse into the Side of his Head, cut
one of his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice
down the Side of his Face; the poor Beast enraged
with the Wounds was no more to be governed by
his Rider, tho' the Fellow fat well enough too; but ,
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the Pi- k
lot's Reach, and at some distance rising up upon his
hind Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon
him.
In this Interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the Camel, but he had no Weapon; however,
fixing the Tartar down, and his Horse fallen upon
him, he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill, favour'd Weapon he had by his Side, something like
a Pole-ax, but not a Pole ax neither; he wrench'd
it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian
Brains out with it. But my old Man had the third
Tartar to deal with still, and seeing he did not fly,
S as
as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he
apprehended, but stood stock still, the old Man
stood still too, and falls to work with his Tackle to
charge his Pistol again ; but as soon as the Tartar
saw the Pistol, whether he supposed it to be the
same, or another, I know not; but away he scower.
ed, and left my Pilot, my Champion I call'd him
afterward, a compleat Victory.
By this time I was a little awake, for I thought
when first I began to wake, that I had been in a
sweet Sleep ; but as I said above, I wondered where
I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was
the matter: In a word, a few moments after, as
Sense returned, I felt Pain, tho' I did not know
where ;1 clap'd my Hand to my Head, and took it
away bloody; then I felt my Head ach, and then
in another Moment, Memory returned, and every
thing was present to me again.
I jumped up upon my Feet instantly, and got
hold of my Sword, but no Enemies in view: I
found a Tartar lie dead and his Horse standing very
Quietly by him; and looking sarther, I law my
Champion and Deliverer, who had been to see what
the Chinesehad done, coming back with his Hanger
in his Hand * the old Man seeing me on my Feet^
came running to me and embraced me with a great
deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been kil-
led, and feeing me bloody, would see how I was
hurt, but it was not much, only what we call a
broken Head % neither did I afterwards find any
great Inconvenience from the Blow, other than the
lace which was hurt, and which was well again in
two or three Days.
We made no great Gain however by this Victory,
for we lost a Camel, and Gained a Horse; but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the Ca-
mel; 1 disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing
before the Chinese Judge of the Place) that is to
fay, in English,we went before a Justice of the
Peace i Give him his, doe, he acted with a great
deal of Prudence and Impartiality; and having
heard both Sides, he gravely ask'd the Chinese Man,
that went with me to buy the Camel, whole Servant
he was > I am no Servant, fays he, but, went with
the Stranger. At whose Request, says the Justice >,/
At the Stranger's Request, fays he^ Why then, fays ;//&
the Justice, you were the Stranger's Servant for the
Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to his Ser-
vant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay
for it.
I confess the Thing was so clear, that I had not a
Word to lay; but admiring to fee such just Reason-
ing upon the Consequence, and so accurate stating
the Cause, I pay'd willingly for the Camel,. and
sent for another; but you may observe, I sent for it, I did not go to fetch it myself any more; I had
enough of that.
The City of 2W» is a Frontier of the Chinese
Empire; they call it fortified, and so it is as Fonts
fications go there 3 for this I will venture to affirm,
that all the Tartars in Karakatbaie, which I believe^
are some Millions, could not batter down the Walls
with their Bows and Arrows ; but to call it strong,
if it were attacked with Cannon, would be to make
thole who understand it, .laugh at you.
We wanted as I have said, above two pays Jour-
ney of this City, when Messengers wer&fent Exprels
to every Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and
Caravans, to halt 'till they had a Guard sent for them; for that an unusal.Bpdy of Tartars, making
ten thousand in all, had appear'd in the Way, about
thirty Milei beyoiid-the City.S ,
This was very bad News to Travellers.j however,
it was carefully done of the Governour, and we
were very glad to hear we should have a Guard;
accordingly, two Day s after, we had two hundred
Soldiers seat us from a Garrison of the Chineses, on
S 2 ou r
our left, and three hundred more from the City of
Naunt, and with those we advanced boldly; the
three hundred Soldiers from Nairn, march'd in our
Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on
each side of our Camels with our Baggage, and the
whole Caravan in the Center; in this Order, and
well prepared for Battle, we thought ourselves a
Match for the whole ten thousand Movgul Tartarsi
if they had appeared; but the next Day when they
did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the Morning, when marching
from a little well situated Town call'd Changer,we
had a River to pals, where we were obliged to ferry $
and had the Tartars had any Intelligence, then had
been the Time to have attacked us, when the Ca-
ravan being over, the Rear Guard was behind; but
they did not appear there.
About three Hours after, when we were enter'd
upon a Desart of about fifteen or sixteen Miles over4
behold, by a Cloud of Dust they rais'd, we saw an
Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed,
for they came on upon the Spur.
The Cbinefes, our Guard on the Front, who had
talk'd so big the Day before, began to stagger, and
the Soldiers frequently looked behind them, which
is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is just ready to
friin away; my old Pilot was of my Mind, and
being near me, he call'd out, Seignior hglese, says
he, those Fellows must be encourag'd, or they will
ruin us all for if the Tartars come on, they will
never stand it; I am of your Minderd J, but what
course must be done > Done!fays he, let fifty of our
Men advance, and flank them on each Wing, and en-,
courage them, and they will fight like brave Fellows
in brave Company; but without it, they will every
Man turn his back; immediately I rode up to our
Leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind 5
and accordingly, fifty of us march'd to the right
wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a
Line
Line of Rescue; and so we march'd, leaving the ,,
last two hundred Men to make another Body by 2 >' ;V
themselves, and to guard the Camels * only that
if need were, they should send a hundred Men, to
assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came cn, and an innume-
rable Company they were; how many, we could
not tell, but ten Thousand we thought was the least:
A Party of them came on first, and view'd our
Posture, traversing the Ground in the Front of our
Line; and as we found them within gun shot, our
Leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly,
and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their
Shot, which was done; but they went off, and I
suppose.back to give an Account of the Reception ^<^2ji
they were like to meet with: And indeed that Sa-
lute clogg'd their Stomach for they immediately
halted, stood a while to consider of it, and wheel-
ing off to the left, they gave over the Design, and said
no more to us for that time which was very agree-
able to our Circumstances, which were but very in-
different for a Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this, we came to the City Nauny ,
or Naum; we thank'd the Governour for his Cafe
for us, and collected to the Value of a hundred
crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the
Soldiers sent to guard us, and here we rested one
Day. This is a Garrison indeed, and there were:
nine hundred Soldier's kept here; bu*t the Reason of
it was, that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers lay
nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites
having abandon'd that Part of the County (which
lies from this City West, for about two hundred
Miles) as desolate and unfit for Use ; and more especially, being so very remote, and ib difficult to
fend Troops thither for its Defence; for we had
yet above two thousand Miles to Muscovy properly
h caffii.
S 5 After
After this, we passed several great Rivers, and
two dreadful Desarts, one of which we were fix-
teen Days passing over, and which, as I said, was
to be call'd no Man's Land ; and on the 13th of
Jpril we came to the Frontiers of the Muscovite Do-
minions : I think the first City, or Town, or For-
ties, whatever it might be call'd, that belongs
to the C Czar of Muscovy, was call'd 4rguny being on
the Welt Side of the River Argun
I could not bur dilcover an infinite Satissaction,
that I was so soon arrived in, as I call'd it, a Chri-
stian Country, or v iejtt in a Country governed by
Christians; for tho' the Muscovites do, in my Opi-
nion, bu: just-deserve the Name of Christians, yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in
their way : It would certainly occur to any Mast
who travels the World as I have done, and who
had any Power of Reflection; 1 fay, it would oc-
cur to him, to reflect what a Blessing it is to be
brought into the World, where the Name of God,
and of a Redeemer is known, worfhip'd and ador'd;
and not where the people, given up by Heaven to
strong Delusions, worship the Devil, and prostrate
themselves to Stocks and Stones; worship fylonsters,
Elements, horrible shaped Animals and Statues, or
Images of Monsters: Not a.Tpwn ot City we
pass'd thro1, but had their Pagods, their Idols, and
their Temples, and ignorant People worshippings
even the Works of their own Hands. h k ~
Now we came where at least, a Face of the
Christian Worship appear'd, where the Knee wa$
jbow'd to Jesus and whether ignorantly or not. yet
the Christian Religion was ovyn'd; and the Name
of the true God was called upon, arifl adpred * and
it made the very Recesses of my Soul rejoice to feel it: I saluted the brave Scots Merchant I mentioned
above, with my first acknowledgment of this ; and
taking him by the, Hand, I said to hirn^ Blefled be
God, we are once again come among Christians: He's. .' , '. t smiled.
/Jniled, and answered, do not rejoice too soon Coun-
tryman, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians i and but for the Name of it, you may
fix very little of the Substance, for some Months
farther of our Journey.
Well, fays I, but still 'tis better than Paganism,
and worshipping of Devils.. Why, I'll tell you,
fays he, except the Ruffian, Soldiers in Garrisons,
and a few of the inhabitants of the Cities upon the
Road, all the rest of this Country, for above a thou-
sand Miles farther, is inhabited by the worst, and
most ignorant of Pagans; and £> indeed we found
it.
We were now launched into the greatest Piece of
<blid Earth, if I understand any thing of the Surface
of the Globe, that is to be found in any fart of the
World; we had at least twelve hundred Miles to
the Sea, Eastward ; we had at least two,'thousand,
to the Bottom of the Baltick Sea, Westward j and
above three thousand Miles, if we left that Sea,
3nd went on west to the Britishand French ' Chan-
nels: We had full five thousand Miles to the Ipa%,
or Persian Sea, South ; and about eight hundred
Miles to the Frozen Sea, North $ nay, ^ some.
People may be believed, there might be no, S.eaf
North-East, 'till we came round the Pole, and con-
sequently into the North-West, and so had a Coritif
nent of Land into America, no Mortal knows where,"
tho' I could give some Reasons, why I believe that
to be a Mistake too.
As we enter'd into the Muscovite Dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable
Towns, we had nothing to observe there but this *
first, That all the Rivers run to the East: As I un-
derstood by the Charts which some in our Caravan
had with them, it was plain, that all thole Rivers
ran into the Great River Tamovr, otGammonr: This
River, by the natural Course of it must run into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The Story they tell
us, that the Mouth of this River is cboak'd up with
Bull-rushes of a monstruous Growth, (viz.) three
Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, I must
be allow'd to say, I believe nothing of; but as its
Navigation is of no use, because there is no Trade
that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it belongs,
dealing in nothing but Cattle, so no Body that ever
I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from
the Mouth of it in Ships ; but this is certain, that
this River running due East, in the Latitude of
carries a vast Concourse of Rivers along
with it, and finds an Ocean to empty itself in that
Latitude; so we are sure of Sea there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River, there
are several considerable Rivers, whose Streams run
as due North as the Tumour runs East, and these are
all found to join their Waters with the Great River
Tartarus, named so, from the northernmost Nations
of the MogulTartars, who the Chinese say, were
the first Tartars in the World; and who, as our Ge-
ographers alledge, are the Gog and Magog, menti-
on'd in sacred Story.
These Rivers running all Northward, as well as
- all the other Rivers, I am yet to speak of, make it
evident, that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land
also on that side; so that it does not seem rational
in the least to think, that the Land can extend itself
to join with America on that fide, or that there is
not a Communication between the Northern and
the Eastern Ocean; but of this I shall say no more,
it was my, Observation at that Time, and therefore
I take Notice of it in this place. We now advanc-
ed from the River Argwia by easy and moderate
Journeys, and were very visibly oblig'd to the Care
the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have Cities and
Towns built in as many Places as are possible to
place them, where his Soldiers keep Garrison some-
thing like the Stationary Soldiers plac'd by the Ro-
mans
fanu in the remotest Countries of their Empire,
some of which I had read particularly wereplac'd
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for
the lodging Travellers ; and thus it was here j for where-ever we came, tho' at these Towns and Stati-
ons, the Garrisons and Governour were Ruffians, and
professed Christians, yet the Inhabitants of the
Country were meer Pagans, sacrificing to Idols,
and worshipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all
the Host of Heaven, and not only so, but were of
all the Heathens and Pagans that ever I met with,
the most barbarous, except only that they did not
eat Man's Flesh, as our Savages of America did.
Some Instances of this we met with in the Coun-
try between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite
Dominions, and a City of Tartars and Russianstoge-
ther, caird flortzivskoy; in which Space is a conti-
nu'd Desert or Forest, which cost us twenty Days
to travel over it: In a Village near the last of those
Places I had the curiosity to go and see their Way
of Living, which is most brutish and unsusferable *
they had I suppose a great Sacrifice that Day, for there stood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an
Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at least
as any Thing we can think of to represent the Devil,
can be made; it had a Head certainly not so much
as resembling any Creature that the World ever saw j
Ears as big as Goats Horns, and as high * Eyes as
big as a Crown-Piece -, a Nose like a crooked Ram's
Horn, and a Mouth extended four corner'd, like
that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a
Parrot's under Bill * it was dressed up in the filthi-
est manner that you could suppose ; its upper Gar-
ment was of Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward,
a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns
growing through it j it was about eight Foot high,
Set had no Feet 01 Legs, or any other Proportion of
'arts.
This
This Scare crow was set up at the outer Side of
the Village, and when I came near to it, there were
sixteen or seventeen Creatures, whether Men or Wo-
men, I could not tell for they make no Destruction by their Habits, either of Body or Head: These I lay all flat on the Ground, round this formidable
Block of shapeless Wood: I saw no Motion among
them any more, than if they had been all Logs of
. Wood like the Idol, at first, I really thought they
had been so ; but when I came a little nearer, they
Cry, as if it had been so many deepmouth'd Hounds,
and walk'd away as if they were displeasM at our
disturbing them : A little way off from this Monster
and at the Door of a Tent or Hutr, made all of
Sheep Skins and Cow-Skins, dry'd, stood three But-
chers, I thought they were such ; for when I came
nearer to them, I - found they had long Knives in
their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap>
paid three Sheep kilPd, and one young Bullock or
, Steer : These.it seems, were Sacrifices to that fens-
kfs Log of an Idol, and these three Men, Priests,
belonging to it and the seventeen prostrated
Wretches, were the People who brought the offering, and were making their Prayers to that Stocks
I confess I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and;
brutish Worship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at
any Thing in my Life \ to fee God's most glorious,
and best Creature, to whom he had granted so ma-
ny Advantages, even by Creation, above the rest of) the Works of his Hands, vested with a reasonable
Soul, and that Soul, adorn'd with Faculties and Ca-
pacities, adapted both to honour his Maker, and be
honoured by him, I say, to fee them funk and dege-
nerated to a Degree so more than stupid, as to pro-
strate itself to a frightful Nothing, a roeer imagina-
ry Object, dress'd up by themselves, arid made terri-
ble to themselves by their own Contrivance; adorn'd
only with Clams and Rags $ and that this should

be the Effect of meer Ignorance, wrought up in-
to hellish Devotion by the Devil himself * who
envying (to his Maker) the Homage and Adoration
of his Creatures, had deluded them into such gross,
surfeiting, sordid and brutish things, as one would
think should shock Nature itself.
But what fignify'd all the Astonishment and Re-
flection of Thoughts ; thus it was and I saw it be-
fore my Eyes, and there was no room to wonder at
it, or think it impossible; all my Admiration turn'd
to Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Monster, call
it what you will, and with my Sword cut the Bon-
net that was on its Head in two in the middle, ib
that it hung down by one of the Horns; and one
of our Men, that was with me.took hold of the
Sheep Skin that cover'd it, and pulled at it, when
behold a most hideous Outcry and Howling fun'
thro' the Village, and two or three hundred People
came about my Ears, so that I was glad to scour
for it ; for we saw some bad Bows and Arrows;
but I resolved from that Moment to visit them

again. \
which was about four Miles off, in order to provide
some Horses which they wanted.several of the hor-
es having been lam'd, and jaded, with the badness
of the Way and long March over the last Desart 5,
so we had some Leisure hereto put my Design in
Execution : I communicated my Project to the Scots
Merchant of Mufcotpt of whose Courage I had had
sufficient Testimony, as above: I told him what I
had seen, and with what Indignation 1 had since
thought that human Nature could be so degenerate:
I told him, I was relblv'd if I could get but four or,
five Men well arm'd to go with me, I was resolv'd
to go and destroy that vile, abominable Idol ; to let
them fee that it had no Power to help itself, and
conse quently could not be an Object of Worship,
or to be pray'd to, much less help them that tfler'd
Sacrifices to it. He
He laughed at me; says he, Your Zeal may be
good, but what do you propose to yourself by it i
Propose^ said I, to vindicate the Honour of God, *ybicb is insulted by this Devil Worship. But how
will it vindicate the Honour of God, said he?
While the People will not be able to know what
you mean by it, unless you could speak to them
too, and tell them lo, and then they will fight you,
and beat you too, I'll assure you, for they are de-
iperate Fellows, and that especially in Defence of
their Idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in the
Night, and then leave them the Reasons and Causes
in Writing in their own Language > Writing! said
he, why there is not a Man in five Nations of them
that know, any thing of a Letter, or how to read a
Word in any Language, or in their own. Wretch-
ed Ignorance J said I to him * however I have a
great mind to do it ; perhaps Nature may draw In-
ferences from it to them, to let them fee how brutisl}
they are, to worship such horrid Things. Look yovr
Sir, said he, if your Zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but in the next place I
would have you consider, these wild Nations of Peel are subjected by Force to the Czar of Muscovy's
minions, and if you do this, 'tis ten to one but'
they will come by Thousands to the Governpur of"
Nertsinskay, and complain, and demand Satisfaction ^
and if he cannot give them Satissaction, 'tis ten to
one but they revolt, and it will occasion a new Wat
with all the Tartars in the Country.
This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head,
for a while; but I harp'd upon the same String still,
and all that Day I was uneasy to put my Project in
Execution: Towards the Evening the Scots Mer-
chant met me by Accident in our Walk about the Town, and dehYd to speak with me * I believe, said
he, I have put yon off of your good Design; I
have been a little concern'd about it since, for I ab-
hor the Idol and Idolatry as much as you can do:
Truly,

Truly, Jans I, you have put it off a little as to the
execution of it, but you have not put it at all out
of my Thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still
before I quit this place; tho' I were to be deliver'd
tap to them for Satissaction. No, no, maybe, God I forbid they should deliver you up to such a Crew
of Monsters; they shall not do that neither, that
would be murdering you indeed, Why,/aj» J, how
would they use me? Use you / says he; I'll tell
you how they served a poor Rufiati, who affronted
them in their Worship just as you did, and who
they took Prisoner; after they had lamed him with
an Arrow that he could not run away, they took
him and stripped him stark naked, and set him up-
on the top of the Idol-Monster, and stood all round
him, and shot as many Arrows into him as would
stick over his whole Body, and then they burnt
him and all the Arrows sticking in him.ja Sacri-
fice to the Idol. And was this the same Idol?
Yes, fays he, the very same. Well, fays J, I'll tell
you a Story t, so I related the Story of our Men at
Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the Vil-
lage there, and kill'd Man, Woman and Child, for
their murdering one of our Men, just as it is related
before; and when t had done, I added, that I thought
we ought to do so to this Village.
He listened very attentively to the Story; but when I
talk'd of doing so to that Village,^be,You mistake
verymuch, it was not this Vil)age,itwas almosta hun-
dred Mile, from this place, but it was the sameIdoI,for
they carry him about in Procession all over the Coun-
try: Well, says I, then that Idol ought to be punished for it, and it shall, says I, if I live this Night out.
In a word, finding me resolute, he lik'd the De-
sign, and told me I should not go alone, but he would
go with me, and bring a stout Fellow, one of his
Countrymen, to go also with us; and one, fays he,
as famous for his Zeal as you can desire any one
to be, against such Devilish things as these: In a
word
#ordj he brought me his Comrade, a Seats Man,
who he called Captain Richardson, and I gave him
a full account of what I had seen,. and also of what
I intended and he told me readily, he would go
with me if it cost him his Life; so we agreed to
so only us Three. I had indeed propos'd it to my
partner, but he declin'd it, he said, he was ready to
assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions for
my defence; but that this was an Adventure quite
out of his way; so, I say, we refolv'd upon our
Work, only us Three and my Man-Servant, and to
put it in Execution that Night about Midnight,
with all the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were will-
ing to delay it till the next Night because the Ca-
ravan being to set forward in the Morning, we sup-
pos'd the Governor could not pretend to give
them any Satissaction upon us when we were out
of his Power. The Scots Merchant, as steady in his
Resolution for Enterprize it, as bold in executing,
brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown of Sheep Skins,
and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and had
provided the same for himself and his Countiy-man,
that the People, if they saw us. should not be able
to determine who we were.
All the first Night we spent in mixing up some
combustible Matter with Aqua-vita, Gun-powder,
and such other Materials as we could get, and ha-
ving a good Quantity of Tar in a little pot, about
an Hour after Night we set out upon our Expedition.
We came to the Place about Eleven a Clock at
Night, and found that the People had not the least
Jealousy of Danger attending their Idol* the Night
was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough
to fee that the Idol stood just in the fame Posture
and Place that it did before: The People seemed to
be all at their Relt, only, that in the great Hutt, or
Tent, as we called it, where we saw the three priests, who we mistook for Butchers, we law a Light, and
going up close to the Door, we heard People talking,
as if there were five or fix of them * we concluded
therefore, that if we set Wild fire to the Idol, these
Men would come out immediately, and run up to
the Place to rescue it from the Destruction that we
intended for it, and what to do with them we knew
hot; once wfe thought of carrying it away and set-
ting Fire to it at a Distance; but when we came to
handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage,
so we were at a Loss again: The second Scots Man
was for setting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, and knock-
ing the Creatures that were there on the Head when
they came out; but I could not joyn with that; I
was against killing them, if it was possible to be
avoided: Well then, said the Scots Merchant, I'll tell you what we will do, we will try to take them
prisoners, tye their Hands behind them, and make
them stand still, and fee their Idol destroy'd.
As it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread
enough about us, which was used to tye our Fire-
Works together with ; so we resolved to attack
these People first, and with as little Noise as we
could: The first Thing we did, we knocked at the
Door, which issued just as we desired it; for one
of their Idol Priests came to the Door: We imme-
diately seized upon him, stop'd his Mouth, and ty'd
his Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol,
where we gagg'd him, that he might not make a
Noise; ty'd his Feet also together, and left him
on the Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting
that another would come out to see what the
Matter was; but we waited so long 'till the third
Man came back to us; and then no Body coming
out, we knock'd again gently, and immediately
out came two more, and we served them just in
the same manner, but was oblig'd to go all with
them, and lay them down by the Idol some Di-
stance from one another 5 when going back, we
found
found two more were come out to the Door,
and a third stood behind them within the Door J
We seiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd them*
when the third stepping back, and crying out, my
Sots Merchant went in after him, and taking out a
Compofition we had made, that would only Smoak
and Stink, he let Fire to it, and threw it in among
them; by that time the other Scots Man and my
Man, taking Charge of the two Men who were al-
ready bound, and ty'd together also by the Arm,
led them away to the Idol, and left them there, to
see if their Idol would relieve them, making haste back to us.
When the Fuze we had thrown in had fill'd the
Hutt with so much Smoak, that they were almost
suffocated, we then threw in a small Leather Bag
of another kind, which flam'd like a Candle, and
following it in, we found there was but four People
left, who, it seems, were two Men and two Women,
and, as we supposed, had been about some of their
Diabolick Sacrifices: They appear'd, in short, fright-
ed to Death, at least so as to fit trimbling and stupid,
and not able to speak neither, for the Smoak.
In a Word, we took them, bound them as we
had the other, and all without any Noise: I should
have said, we brought them out of the House or
Hutt first; for indeed we were not able to bear the
Smoak any more than they were. When we had
done this, we carry'd them all together to the Idol;
When we came there, we fell to work with him *
and first we daub'd him all over, and his Robes also,
with Tar and such other Stuff as we had, which
was Tallow mix'd with Brimstone * then we stopped his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-powder,
then we wrapp'd up a great piece of Wild-fire in
his Bonnet, and then sticking all the Combustibles
we had brought with us upon him, we looked about
to fee if we could find any thing else to help/ to
burn him, when my Scots Man remembred, that by
the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a
heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do
not remember ; away he and the other Scots Man
run, and fetch'd their Arms fullof that: When we had
done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them,
having unty'd their Feet, andungagg'd their Mouths,
and made them stand up, and set them just before
their monstrous Idol, and then set fire to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an Hour, or therea-
bouts, 'till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth,
and Ears of the Idol blew up, and as we could per-
ceive had split and deformed the Shape of it; and in
a Word, 'till we saw it burn into a meer Block ot
Log of Wood, and then setting the dry Forage to
ir, we found it would be soon quite consum'd, so
we began to think of going away; but the Scots
Man said no, we must not go, for these poor delud-
ed Wretches will all throw themselves into the Fire,
and burn themselves with the Idol; so we resolved
to stay 'till the Forage was burnt down too, and
then we came away and left them.
In the Morning we appear'd among our Fellow
Travellers, exceeding busy, in getting ready for our
Journey; nor could any Man suggest that we had
been any where but in our Beds, as Travellers might
be suppos'd to be, to fit themselves for the Fatigues'
of that Day's Journey.
But it did not end so; for the next Day came a
great Multitude of the Country People, not only of
this Village, but of a hundred more, for ought I
know, to the Town-Gates, and in a most outrageous manner, demanded Satisfaction of the Ruffian Gov-
ernour, for the insulting their Priests, and burning
their Great Cbam-Chi-Tbaimgu, such a hard Name
they gave the monstrous Creature they worshiped $
the People of Nertfinskay, were at first in a great Con-
sternation, for,they said, the Tartars were no less than -
thirty thousand, and that in a few days more, would w as be one hundred thousand strong. '.,
T ThV
The Ruffian Governour sent out Messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima-
ginable: He allured them, he knew nothing of ir,
and that there had not a Soul of his Garrison been
abroad : That it could not be from any Body there ^ ^
and if they would let him know who it was, they
should be examplarily punished.; They return'd;/
haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the Great
Cbam-Chi Thjuvgu, who dwelt in the Sun, and no
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his
Image, but some Christian Miscreant, so they calFd
. them it seems j and they therefore denounc'd Wat
against him, and all the Ruffians, who, they said,
were Miscreants and Christians.
The Governour still patient, and unwilling to
make a Breach, or to have any Cause of War alledg-
ed to be given by him; The Czar having straitly
charged them to treat the conquer'd Country with
Gentleness and Civility, gave them still all the good
words he could; at last he told them, there was a
Caravan gone towards Rvffia that Morning, and per-
haps it was some of them, who had done them this
Injury ; and that if they would be satisfied with thar^ .
he would fend after them, to enquire into it: This
ftem'd to appease them a little 5 and accordingly -
the Governour sent after us, and gave us a particu-
lar account how the Thing was ; intimating withal,
that if any in our Caravan had done ir, they should
make their Escape; but that.whether they had done
it or no, we should make all the hastr forward that
was possible; and thacjn the mean time, he would keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the Governour; how-
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was no
Body knew any Thing of the .Matter; andNas sot,/
us that were guilty, we were the least of all suspe-
cted ; none so much asask'd us the Question; how-
ever, the Captain of the Caravan for the Time,
took the Hint that the Governour gave us, and we
marched
marched or travelled two Days and two Nights,
without any considerable Stop ;, and then we lay at >
a Village called Plothus; nor did we make any long
Stop here, but hailed d on towards Jarawena, ano-
ther of the Czar of Muscovy's Colonies, and where
we expected we should be safe; but it is to be ob-
ti serv'd, that here we began for two or three Days
march, to enter upon a vast nameless Desarr, of
which I shall say more in its Place; and which, if
we had now been upon it, 'tis more than probable,
we had been all destroyed : It was the second Day's
march from Plotbus, that by the Clouds of Dust be-
hind us at a great Distance, some of our People be-
gan to be sensible we were pursued ; we had enter'd
the Desarr, and had passed by a great Lake call'd
;/ Scbah Ofer, when we perceiv'd a very great Body of
Horse appear on the other Side of the Lake to the
I c, North, We travelling West : We observ'd they went
away West as we did, but had supposed we would
have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very
happily took the South Side; and in two Days
more we saw them not, for they believing we were
still before them, pushed on, 'till they came to the
River Jidda; this is a very great River when it passes
farther North; but where we came to it, we found
it narrow, and fordable.
The third Day they either found their Mistake,
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in up-
on us, towards the Dusk of the Evening: We had,
to our great Satissaction, just pitch'd upon a Place
for our Camp, which was very convenient for the
Night ; for as we were upon a Desarr, .tho' but at
the beginning of it, that was above five hundred
Miles over, we had no Towns to Lodge at, and in-
deed expected none but the City jarawena, which
we had yet two Days march to; the Dssart,however,,
had some few Woods in it on this Side, and Little Rivers, which ran all into the great River Udda:
It was in a narrow Strait between two little, but very
T 2 thick
thick Woods, that we pitch'd our little camp for
that Night, expecting to be attack'd in the Night.
No body knew but ourselves, what we were pur-
sued for; but as it was usual for the Mongul Tartars
to go about in Troops in that Desart, so the Cara-
vans always fortify themselves every Night against
them, as against Armies of Robbers; and it was
therefore no new thing to be pursued.
But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our
Travels, a most advantageous Camp; for we lay
between two Woods, with a little Rivulet running
just before our Front; so that we could not be sur-
rounded, or attack'd any way, but in our Front or
Rear; we took care also to make our Front as
strong as we could, by placing our Packs, with our
Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the inside of
the River, and felling some Trees in our Rear.
In this posture we encamp'd for the Night, but
the Enemy was upon us before we had finished our
Situation : They did not come on us like Thieves as
we expected, but sent three Messengers to us, to de-
mand the Men to be delivered to them, that had
abus'd their Priests, and burnt their God, Cham-
Chi-Tbamgu with Tiie} that they might burn them
'with Fire ; and upon this, they saidAthey would go
away, and do us no further harm, otherwise, they
would burn us all with Fire. Our Men looked very
blank at this Meflage, and began to stare at one ano-
ther, to see who look'd with most Guilt in their Faces * but no Body was the Word, no body did it.
The Leader of the Caravan sent Word, he was well
aflur'd, it was not done by any of our Camp ; that
we were peaceable Merchants, travelling on our Bu-
siness; that we had done no harm to them, or to
any one else; and that therefore they must look
farther for their Enemies,who had injured them; for
we were not the People; so desired them not to
disturb us, for if they did, we should defend ours elves. 1,

They were far from being sarisfy'd with this for
an answer, but a great Crowd of them came down •
in the Morning by break of Day to our Camp; but
seeing us in such an unaccountable Situation, they
durtt come no farther than the Brook in our Front, where they stood and shew'd us such a Number, that
indeed terrify'd us very much Cs) for those that spoke •
least of them, spoke of ten thousand: Here they
stood and look'd at us a while, and then setting up
a great Howl, they let fly a Cloud of Arrows among
us; but we were well enough fortified for that;
for we slielter'd under our Baggage, and I do not
remember that one Man of us was hurt.
Some Time after this, we fee them move a little
to our Right, and expected them on the Rear, when
a cunning Fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of
Jarawena, in the Pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the Leader of the Caravan, said to him, I'll go send
all these People away to Sibeilka-, this was a City,
four or five Days Journey at least to the Sou hj and
rather behind us: So be takes his Bow and Arrows,
Cand getting on Horse back, he rides away from our
Rear directly, as it were,back to Nertssinskay; after >
this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to
the Army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent
Express to tell them a long Story that the People
who had burnt the Cham Chi Thaungu, were gone to
Sibeilka, with a Caravan of Miscreants, as he calPd
them, that is to far, Christians; and that they had
resolved to burn the God Schalljar, belonging to the
Tongueses.
As this Fellow was himself a meer Tartar, and
perfectly spoke their Language, he counterfeited so
well, that they all took it from him, and away they
drove, in a most violent Hurry ro Sibeilka, which it '.
seems was five Days Journey to the North, and in
less than three Hours, they were entirely out of our
Sight, and we never heard any more of them * not
ever
£ 2<?4 3
ever knew whether they went to that other Place
! called Siheilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the City of Jarawena,
where there was a Garrison of Muscovites, and there
we rested five Days, the Caravan being exceedingly
fatigued with the latt Days hard match, and with
want of Rest in the Night.
From this Ciry we had a frightful Desart, which
held us three and twenty Days march: We fur-
nish'd our selves with some Tents here, for the bet-
ter accommodating our selves in the Nights and
the Leader of the Caravan, procured sixteen Car-
riages or Waggons of the Country, for carrying our
Water and Provisions, and these Carriages was our Defence every Night round our little Camp; so
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been
very numerous indeed, they would not have been
able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want Rest again after
this long Journey ; for in this Desart we saw neither
House or Tree, or scarce a Bush ; we saw.abundance
»i of the Sable-Hunters, as they call'd them: These
t are all Tartars of the Mongiil Tartaty, of which this
Country is a part, and they frequently attack small
Caravans, but we saw no Numbers of them together:
I was curious to fee the Sable Skins they catched,
but could never speak with any of them, for they
durst not come near us, neither d first we straggle from
our Company, to go near them.
After we had pals'd this Desarr, we came into a
Country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we
found Towns and Castles, settled by the Czar of
Muscovy, with Garrisons of Stationary Soldiers to
protect the Caravans, and defend the Country a-
gainst the Tartars, who would otherwise make it
very dangerous travelling; and his Czarifi Majesty
has given such strict Orders for the well guarding the
Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any Tar-
tars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the
G arrisons
Garrisons are always sent to lee the Travellers safe
from Station to Station.
And thus the Governour of Jditishy, who I had
Opportunity to make a Visit to, by means of the
Scots Merchant who was acquainted with him, of-
fer'd us a Guard of fifty Men, if we thought there
was any Danger to the next Station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe,we should find the Country better peo-
pled, and the People more civiliz'd, but I found my-
self mistaken in both, for we had yet the Nation of
the Totiguefes to pass thro'; where we saw the same
Tokens of Paganism and Barbarity, or worse, than
before, only as they were conquer'd by the Muscovi-
tes, and entirely reduc'd, they were not so dange-
rous; but for Rudeness of Manners, Idolatry, and
Multitheism no People in the World ever went be-
yond them: They are cloath'd all in Skins of Beasts,
and their Houses are built of the fame: You know
not a Man from a Woman, neither by the Rugged-
ness of their Countenances or their Cloaths$ and
in the Winter, when the Ground is cover'd with
Snow, they live under Ground in Houses like Vaults,
which have Cavities, going from one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cbam Cbi-Tbauugu for a
whole Village or Country, these had Idols in every
Hurt and in every Caves besides they worship the
Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and.in a word,.
every thing that they do not understand, and they un-
derstand but very little ; so that almost every Ele->.
ment, every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing.
But I am ho more to describe People than Coun-
tries, any farther than my own Story comes to be
concerned in them : I met with nothing peculiar to
my self in all this Country, which I reckon was
from the Desert ,which I spoke of last, at least 400
Miles, half of it being another Desart, which took
us up twelve Days severe travelling, without House,
or Tree, or Bush, but were oblig'd again to carry
T 4' 9^
our own provisions, as well Water as Bread.; After
we were out of this Desart, and had traveled two
Days, we came to Jatttzay, a Muscovite City or Sta-
tion, on the great River Janexay: This River they
told us parted Europe from Asia,tho' our Map ma-
kers, as I am told, do not agree to it 5 however,; it
is certainly the Eastern Boundary of the ancient Si-
beria, which now makes up a Province only of the
vast Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in Bigness
to the whole Empire of Germany.
And yet here I'observ'd Ignorance and Paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite Garrisons -t
all the Country between the River Ob) and the Ri-
ver Janezay is as entirely Pagan, and the People as
barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartan, nay, as
any Nation for ought I know in Janor America: I
also found which I observed to the Muscovite Govern-
ours who I had opportunity to converse with, that
the poor Pagans are not much the wiser, or the near-
er Christianity for being under the Muscovite Go-
vernment; which they acknowledg'd was true
enough, but, as they said, ,was none of their Busi-
ness: That if the Czar expected to convert his Sibe~
rian, or Tovguese, or TjitJr Subjects, it should be done by sending Clergymen among them, not Sol-
diers and they added, with more Sincerity than I
expected, that they found it was not so much the
Concern of their Mornich to make the People Chri-
stians, as it was to make them Subjects.
From this River to the great River Oby, we crossed a wild uncultivated Country : I cannot fay 'tis a bar-
ren Soil; 'tis only barren of People, and good Ma-
nagement, otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant,
fruitful and agreeable Country: What Inhabitants
we found in it are all Pagans, except such as are
sent among them from Ruffia; for this is the Coun-
try I mean on both Sides the River Ob,whither the
Muscovite Criminals, that are not put to Death, are
banish'd, and from whence it is next to impossible they
should ever come away. I have
I have nothing material to say of my particular
Affairs, till I came to Tobohki, the Capital City of
Siberia, where I continued some time on the fol-
lowing occasion. We had been now almost seven Months on our
Journey, and Winter began to come on apace;
whereupon my Partner and I call'd a Council about
our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, and not
for Moscow,to consider how to dispose of curlelves:
They told us of Sledges and Rain© Deer to carry us
over the Snow in the Winter time s"and indeed they
have such things, that it would be incredible to re-
late the Particulars of, by which means the Ruffians
travel more in the Winter than they can in Summer,
because in these Sleds they are able to run Night and
Day; the Snow being frozen, is one universal Co-
vering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the
Rivers, the Lakes, all are smooth, and hard as a
Stone, and they run upon the Surface, without any
regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a Winter Jour-
ney of this kind: I was bound to England, not to .
Moscow,and my Rout lay two Ways, either I must
go on as the Caravan went 'till I came to Jerojlaw,
and then go off West for Narva and the Gulph of
Finland; and so either by Sea or Land to Dantzick,
where I might possibly sell my China Cargo to good
Advantage, or I must leave the Caravan at a little
Town on the Dmina, from whence I had but
six Days by Water to Arch-Angel, and from thence
might be sure of Shipping, either to England, Hol-
land, or Hamburgh.
Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter,
would have been preposterous ; for as to Dantzick,
the Baltick would be frozen up, and I could not get Passage, and to go by Land in those Countries,
was far less safe than among the MongolTartars;
likewise to go to Arch'Angel in OHober, all the Ships
would
would be gone from thence, and even the Merchants
who dwell there in Summer, retire South to Moscowin the Winter when the Ships are gone; so that I
should hare nothing but Extremity of Cold to en-
counter, with a Scarcity of Provisions, and must
lie there in an empty Town all the Winter: So that
upon the whole I thought it much my better way to
let the Caravan go, and to make Provision to Win-
ter where I was, (viz) at Tobohki in Siberia, in the
Latitude of Degrees, where I was sure of three
Things to wear out a cold Winter with, (viz.) Plenty
of Provision such as the Country afforded ; a warm
House, with Fuel enough, and excellent Company;
of all which I (hall give a full Account of in its Place.
I was now in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where I never felt Cold,except when I had my Ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear any Cloaths on my Back, and never made
any Fire but without doors, and for my neceffityjn
dressing my Food,2>V.Nowl made me three "good Vests,
with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang down
to the Feet,and button close to the wrists, and all these
lin'd with Furs to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm House, I must confess I greatly dis-
lik'd our way in England of making Fires in every Room in the Horde, in open Chimneys, which when the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the Room
cold as the Climate: But taking an Appartment in a
good House in the Town, I order'd a Chimney to be
built like a Furnace, in the Center of fix several
Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry the Smoak
went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire
went in another, and all the Rooms were kept
equally warm, but no Fire seen; like as they heat
the Bagniqs in England.
By this meahs we had always the Dme Climate in
all the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preserv'd;
and how cold soever it was without, it was always
warm within, and yet we saw no Fire, nor was ever incommoded with any Smoak. The
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it
should be possible to meet with good Company
here, in a country so barbarous as that of the most
Northerly Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean,
and within but a very few Degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Cri-
minals of Muscovy, as I observ'd before, are all ba-
nish'd, this City was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gen-
tlemen, Colonels, and in short all Degrees of the No-
bility, Gentry, Soldiery and Courtiers ofMuscovy:
Here was the famous Prince\Galisto7.enH the old Ge—
neral RobostUki, and several other persons of note,
and some Ladies.
By means of my Scots Merchanr, who neverthe-
less I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance
here with several of these Gentlemen, and some of
them of the first Rank, and from these in, the long
Winter Nights in which I stayed here, I receiv'd se-
veral very agreeable Visits: it was talking one Night %ur
with .Prince,. .. .-. one of the banisli'd Ministers 0 c
of State belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my -
Talk of my particular Cafe began: He had been tel-
ling me abundance of fine Things of the Greatness,
the Magnificence, the Dominions, and the absolute
Power of the Emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupt-:
ed him, and told him I was a greater and more
powerful Prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy was,
tho' my Dominions were not so large, or my Peo-
ple so many. The Ruffian Grandee looked a little
surpiz'd, and fixing his Eyes tteddily upon me, be-
gan to wonder what I meant.
I told him, his Wonder would cease when I had
explain'd myself: First, I told him, I had the abso-
lute Disposal of the Lives and Fortunes of all my
Subjects: That notwithstanding my absolute Power,
I had not one Person disaffected to my Government,
or to my Person, in all my Dominions. He shook
his Head at that, and said, there indeed I outdid the
Czar of Muscovy. I told him,That all the Lands in
'. . my
my Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects
were not only my Tenants, but Tenants at Will:
That they would all fight for me to the last Drop;
and that never Tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself
to be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so
horribly feared by his subjects. After amusing them with these Riddles in Go-
vernment for a while, I open'd the Cafe, and told
them the Story at large of my living in the island, and how I managed both myself and the People
there that were under me, just as I have since mi-
: rmted it down. They were exceedingly taken with
the Story, and especially the Prince, who told me
with a Sigh, that the true Greatness of Life was to
be Master of ourselves: That he would not have ex-
changed such a State of Life as mine, to have been
Czar of Muscovy and that he found more Felicity
in the Retirement he seemed to be banifh'd to there,
than ever he found in the highest Authority he en joyed in the Court of his Master the Czar: That
the Heighth of human wisdom was to bring our
Tempers down to our Circumstances; and to make
a Calm within, under the Weight of the greatest
Storm without. When he came first hither, he said
he used to tear the Hair from his Head, and the
Cloaths from his Back, as others had done before
him ; but a little Time and Consideration had made
him look into himself, as well as round himself, to
things without; That'he fouud the Mind of Man,
if it was but once brought to reflect upon the State
of universal Life, and how little this World was
concern'd in its true Felicity, was perfectly capable
of making a Felicity for itself, fully satisfying to
itself, and suitable to its own best Ends and De-
fires, with but very little Assistance from the World:
That Air to breath in, Food to sustain Life, Cloaths
for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercise,in order to
Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the
World could do for us; and tho' the Greatness, the
Authority,

Authority, the Riches, and the Pleasures which
some enjoy'd in the World, and which he had en-
joyed his Share of, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet he observed that all those things
chiefly gratify'd the coarsest of our Affections; such
as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice,
our sanity, and our sensuality ; all which were
indeed the meer Product of the worst part of Man,
were in themselves Crimes, and had in them the
Seeds of all manner of Crime, but neither were re-
lated to, or concern'd with any of those Virtues
that constituted us wise Men, or of those Graces
which distinguish'd us as Christians: That being
now deprived of all the fancy 'd Felicity, which he
enjoy'd in the full Exercise of all those Vices, hesaid he was at leisure to look upon the dark Side
Of them, where he found all manner of Deformity *
and was now convinced, that Virtue only makes a
Man truly Wise, Rich, and Great, and preserves
him in the way to a superior Happiness in a fu-
ture State. And in this, be said, they were more
happy in their Banishment, than all their Enemies
were, who had the full Possession of all the Wealth
and Power that they (the Banislx'd) had left behind
them.
Nor, Sir,ya>i he, do I bring my Mind to this
politically, by the Necessity of my Circumstances,
which some call miserable; but if I know any thing
of my self, I would not sow; go back, no not tho'
the Czar, my Master, should call me, and offer to
re-instate me in all my former Grandeur; I say, I
would no more go back to it, than I believe my
Soul, when it mall be deliver'd from this prison of the Body, and has had a Taste of the glorious
State beyond Life, would come back to the Jayl of
Flesh and Blood it is now inclos'd in, and leave
Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human
Affairs.
He
He spoke this with so much Warmth in his
Temper, so much Earnestness and Motion of his
Spirits, which were apparent in his Countenance, that it was evident it was the true sense of his
soul : And indeed there was no room to doubt his
Sincery.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
Monarch in my old Station, of which I had given
him an Account, but that I thought he was not a
Monarch only, but a great Conqueror ; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant De-
fires, and has the absolute Dominion over himself,
whose Reason entirely governs his Will, is certainly greater than he thatconquersa City; But, my Lord,
said I, shall I take the Liberty to ask you a Questi-
on > With all my Heart, says be, If the Door of
your Liberty was open'd, said I, would you not
take hold of it to deliver yourself from this
Exile.
Hold, said he,your Question is subtle, and re-
quires some serious just Distinctions, to give it a fin-
cere Answer; and I'll give it you from the Bottom
of my Heart. Nothing that I know of in this
World would move me to deliver myself from this
State of Banishment, except these two. First, the
Enjoyment of my Relations, and Secondly, a little
warmer Climate ; but I protest to you, that to go
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Pow-
er, the Hurry of a Minister of State, the Wealth,
the Gaiety, and the Pleasures, tbatis to fay, Follies
of a Courtier; if my Master should fend me Word
this Moment, that he restores me to all he banish'd
me from; I protest, If Iknow myself at all, I would
not leave this Wilderness, these Deans, and these
frozen Lakes, for the Palaceat Muscow.
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are
banish'd from the Pleasures of the Court, and from
the Power, and Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd
before ; but you may be absent too from some of the
Cor^

Conveniences of Life, your Estate perhaps confifcat-
edAand your Effects plunder'd, and the Supplies left •
you here,may not be suitable to the ordinary De-
mands of Life.
Ay, fays he, that is as you suppose me to be a
Lord, or a Prince, 0c. So indeed I am but you
are now to consider me only as a Man ; a human
Creature, not at all distinguished from another; and
so I can suffer no Want, unless I should be visited
with Sickness and Distempers. However, to put;
the Question out of Dispute; you see our Manner;
we are in this Place five Persons of Rank^we live per- -
fectly retir'd, as suited to a State of Banishment
we have something rescu'd from the Shipwreck of
our Fortunes, which keeps us from the meer Neces-
sity of hunting for our Food ; but the poor Soldiers
who are here, without that Help, live in as much
. Plenty as we, who go into the Woods and catch Sa-
bles and Foxes; the Labour of a Month will main-
tain them a Year; and as the Way of living is not
expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to our-
selves.» So that Objection is out of Doors.
I have not room to give a full Account of the most
agreeable Conversation I had with this truly great
Man j in all which he (hew'd, that his Mind was
so inspired with a superior Knowledge of Things, so
supported by Religion, as well as by a vast Share
of Wisdom; that his Contempt of the World was
really as much, as he had expressed, and that he
was always the fame to the last, as will appear in
the Story I am going to tell.
I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful
Winter I thought it to be, the Cold.fo intense that >
I could not so much as look abroad without being
wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face,
or rather a Hood/with only a Hole for Breath, and
two for Sight: The little Day-light we had, was,
as we reckon'd, for three Months, not above five
Hours a day, and six at most ; only that the Snow
lying
[ 3<H ^
lying on the Ground continually, and the Weather
clear, it was never quite dark : Our Horses were kept
for rather starv'd) under Ground, and as for our
Servants, for we hir'd three Servants here, to look
after our Horses and selves, we had every now and
then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and take care of,
lest they should mortify and fall off.
It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Hou-
ies being close, the Walls thick, the Lights small,
and the Glass all double: Our Food was chiefly the
Flesh of Deer dry'd and cur'd in the Season ; good
Bread enough, but bak'd as Biskets; dry'd Fish of
several sorts, and some Flesh of Mutton, and of
the Buffaloes, which is pretty good Beef: All the
Stores of Provision for the Winter are laid up in the
Summer, and well cur'd; our Drink was Water,
mix'd with Aqua-virae instead of Brandy, and for a
Treat, Mead instead of Wine, which, however, they
have excellent good :TheHunters,who venture abroad
all Weathers, frequently brought us in fresh Venis-
on, very fat and good, and sometimes Bears Flesh,
but we did not much care for the last: We had a
good Stock of Tea, with which we treated out
Friends, as above ; andAin a word, we liv'd very
chearfully and well, all things considered. It was now Marcbtthe Days grown considerably
longer, and the weather, at least, tolerable $ so
other Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them
over the Snow, and to get things ready to be going;
but my Measures being fixed, as I have said, for
Archangel,and not for Muscovy or the Baltick, I
made no Motion ; knowing very well that the Ships
from the South,do not set out for that Part of the
World till May or June, and that if I was there by
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any
Ships would be ready to go away ; and therefore, I
fay, I made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a
word, I law a great many People, nay, all the Tra-
vellers go away before me: It seems every Year they
go
go from thence to Moscowfor Trade, (via)to car-
ry Furs, and buy Necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their shops; also
others went of the same Errand to Arch-Angel, but
then they also being to come back again above 800
Miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter End of May I began to
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this,
it occurr'd to me, that seeing all these People were
banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet
when they came there, were left titLiberty to go
whither they would ; why did they not then go
away to any Part of the World wherever they thought
fit? and I began to examine what should hinder
them from making such an Attempt.
But my Wonder was over, when I enter'd upon
that Subject with the Person I have mention'd, who
answered me thus: Consider, First, Sir, said he, the
Place where we are; and Secondly, the Condition we
are in; especially, said he,theGenerallity of thePeople
who are banish'd hither ; we are surrounded,' said he,
with stronger Things than Bars and Bolts; on the
North Side,an unnavigable Ocean, where ship never
sailed, and Boat never swam; neither, if we had
both, could we know where to go with them: Eve-
ry other Way, said he, we have above a thousand
Miles to pass thro' the Czar's own Dominions, and
By-Ways utterly impassable, except by the Roads
made by the Government, and thro' the Town's gar-
rison'd by his Troops; so that we could neither
pass undiscover'd by the Road, or subsist any other
Way; so that it is in vain to attempt it.
I was filenc'd indeed at once, and found that they
were in a prison, every Jot as secure as if they had
been lock'dup in the Cattle at Muscow 5 however, it
came into my Thoughts, that I might certainly be
made an Instrument to procure the Escape of this
excellent person, and that whatever HaZard 1 run, t
would certainly try if I could carry him Off. tlpori
At this
this I took an Occasion one Evening to tell him my
Thoughts: I represented to him, that it was ve-
ry easy for me to carry him away, there being no
Guard over him in the Country ; and as I was not
going to Muscowt but to Arcb-Angel, and that I
went in the nature of a Caravan, by which I was
nor oblig'd to lye in the stationary Towns in the
Desart, but could encamp every Night where I
would, we might easily pass uninterrupted, to
Arcb-Angel, where I would immediately secure him
on board an Englishor Dutch Ship, and carry him
off safe along with me; and as to his Subsistence,
and other Particulars, that should be my Care, 'till
he could better supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and look'd earnest-
ly on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in
his very Face, that what I said put his Spirits into
an exceeding Ferment * his Colour frequently
chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and his Heart flut-
ters, that it might be even perceiv'd in his Counte-
nance ; nor could he immediately answer me : When
I had done, and as it were expected what he would
say to it; and after he had paus'd a littleAhe em--./
braced me, and said,how unhappy are we! unguard-
i.v.t .i>-< ed Creatures as we are, that even ourgreatests Acts
of Friendship are made Snares to us, and we are
made Tempters of one another! My dear Friend,
said he,your Offer is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated
for my Advantage, that I must have very little^
Knowledge of the World, if I did not both won-
der at it, and acknowledge the Obligation I have
upon me to you for it: But did you believe I was
sincere in what I have so often said to you of my
Contempt of the World i Did you believe I spoke
my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtained that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac'd me a-
bove all that the World could give me, or do for
me? Did you believe I was sincere, when I told
c 3071
you I would not go back, if I was re-call'd even
to be all, that once I was, in the Court and with
the Favour of the Czar my Master ? Did you believe
me, my Friend, to be an honest Man, or did you
think me to be a boasting Hypocrite? Here he stop-
ped, as if he would hear what I would fay, but in-:
deed, I soon after perceiv'd, that he stopped because
his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was full
of Struggles, and he could not go on : I was, I con-
fess, astonish'd at the thing as well as at the Man,
and I us'd some Arguments with him to urge him to
set himself free : That he ought to look upon this
as a Door open'd by Heaven for his Deliverance ; and -'
a Summons by Providence, who as the Care" and
Disposition of all Events, to do himself good, and
to render himself useful in the World.
He had bv this,time recover'd himself : How do
you know Sir, says he warmly, that instead of a
Summons from Heaven, it may be a Feint of ano-
ther instrument ? Representing in all the alluring
Colours to me the Shew of Felicity as a Deliverance,
which may in itself be my Snare, and tends directly
to my Ruin: Here I am free from the Temptation
of returning to my former miserable Greatness; there
I am not sure, but that all the Seeds of Pride, Am-
bition, Avarce and Luxury, which I know remain
in Nature, may revive and take Root, and in a
Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy
Prisoner, who you fee now Master of his Soul's Li-
berty, shall be the miserable Slave of his own Sen-
ses, in the Full of all personal Liberty: Dear Sir,
let me remain in this blessed Confinement, banish'd
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchase a
Shew of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty
of my Reason, and at the Expence of the future
Happiness which now I have in my View, but shall
then, I fear, quickly lose Sight of it; for I am but
Flesh, a Man, a meer Man, have Paffions and Af-
fections as likely to possess and overthrow me as
U 2 any
any Man: 0 be not my Friend, and roy Tempter
both together!
If I was surpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed admir'd
at what I saw ; the Struggle in his Soul was so great,
that tho' the Weather was extreamly cold, it put
him into a most violent Sweat, and I found he
wanted to give vent to his Mind; so I laid a Word
or two, that I would leave him to consider of it,
and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my
own Apartment.
About two Hours after I heard some Body at, of
near, the Door of my Room, and I was going to
open the Door, but he had open'd it, and came in:
My dear Friend, says he, you had almost overset me,
but I am recover'd; do not take it ill that I do not
close with your Offer, I assure you, 'tis not for want
of a Sense of the Kindness of it in you, and I came
to make the most sincere Acknowledgment of it to
you ; but I hope I have got the victory over myself.
My Lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfy'd
that you do not resist the Call of Heaven, Sir, said
he, if it had been from Heaven, the fame Power
would have influenc'd me to accept it; but I hope,
and am fully satisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I
decline it, and I have an infinite Satissaction in the
Parting, that you shall leave me an honest Man still,'
tho' not a free Man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
Professions to him of my having no End in it, but a
sincere Desire to serve him: He embrac'd me very
passionately, and assured me, he was sensible of that,
and should always acknowledge it, and with that he
offer'd me a very fine Present of Sables, too much
indeed for me to accept, from a Man in his Circum-
stances, and I would have avoided them, but he
would not be refus'd.
The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lord-
ship, with a small Present of Tea, two Pieces of
China
ChinaDamask, and four little Wedges of JapcP
Gold, which did not all weigh above fix Ounces'
or thereabout, but were far short of the Value of
his Sables, which, indeed, when I came to England,
I found worth near 2001. He accepted the Tea,
and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces
of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upon it, of the
Japan Coinage, which I found he took for the,
Rariety of it, but would not take any more; and sent X
Word by my Servant that he desired to speakwith me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what
had pass'd between us, and hoped I would not
move him any more in that Affair 5 but that since I
made such a generous Osier to him, he ask'd me,
if I had kindness enough to offer the same to an-
other person that he would name to me, in whom he had a great Share of Concern; I told him, that I could,
not say I jenclin'd to do so much for any one but him, If
self, for whom I had a particular Value, and should
havebeen glad to have been the Instrument of his De-
liverance; however, if he would please to name the
person to me, I would give him my Answer, and
hop'd he would not be displeased with me, if he was
with my Answer: He told me, it was only his Son,
who, tho' I had not seen, yet was in the fame Condi-
tion with himself, and above two hundred Miles
from him, on the other Side the Oby; but that if I
consented, he would send for him.
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do
it: I made some Ceremony in letting him under-
stand that it was wholly on his Account, and
that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would
show my Respect to him, by my Concern for his
Son ; but these Things are to tedious to repeat
here: He sent away the next Day for his Son, and
in about Twenty Days he came back with the
Messenger, bringing six or seven Horses, loaded
with very rich Furs, and which in the whole,
amounted to a very great Value.
U 3 His
1 .':
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town,
but left the young Lord at a Distance, till Nigh t
when he came incognito into our Apartment, and
his Father presented him to me; and in short, we
concerted there the manner of our travelling, and
every Thing proper for the Journey.
I had bought a considerable Quantity of Sa-
bles, black Fox Skins, fine Ermines, and such
other Furs as are very rich; 1 fay, I had bought them
in that City in Exchange for some of the Goods
brought from China in particular for the Cloves
and Nutmegs, of which, I fold the greatest Part
here, and the rest afterwards at Arch- Angel, for a
much better Price than I could have done at Lon-
don ; and my Partner who was sensible of the Profit,
and whose Business more particularly than mine
was Merchandise, was mightily pleas'd with our
Stay, on Account of the Traffick we made here.
It was the beginning of June, when I left this
remote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in
the World and indeed it is so far out of the
Road of Commerce, that I know not how it should *
I be much talk'd of. We were now come to a very
small Caravan, being only thirty two Horses and
Camels in all, and all of them pals'd for mine, tho'
my new Guest was Proprietor of eleven of them;
it was most natural also that I should take more
Servants with me than I had before, and the young
Lord pafs'd for my Stewards what great Man 1
pals'd for my self, I know not, neither did it con-
cern me to enquire; we had here, the worst and the
largest Desart to pass over that we met with in all
the Journey ; indeed I call it the worst, because
the Way was very deep in some Places, and very
uneven in others the best we had to fay for it, was,
that we thought we had no Troops of Tartars and
Robbers to fear, and that they never came on this
Side the River Oby, or at least, but very seldom $
but we found it otherwise.
My
My young Lord had with him, a faithful Musco-
vite Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was
perfectly acquainted with the Country; and who,
led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming
in to the principal Towns and Cities, upon the great
Road, such as Tumen, Sojy-Kamskoi, and several
others; because the Muscovite Garrisons which are
kept there, are very curious and strict in their Ob-
servation upon Travellers; and latching least any
of the baniih'd Persons of Note mould make their
Escape that Way into Muscovy,but by this means
as we were kept out of the Cities, so our whole
Journey was a Desert, and we were oblig'd to en-
camp and lye in our Tents, when we might have
had very good Accommodation in the Cities on
the Way : This the young Lord was so sensible of,
that he would not allow us to be abroad, when we
came to several Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad
himself with his Servant in the Woods, and met
us always at the appointed Places ,. .
We were just enter'd Europe, having pass'd the
River Kama, which in these Parts, js the Boundary
between Europe and Asia, and the first city on the
European Side was calFd Soloy-Kamaskoy, which ii
as much as to lay, the great City, on the River
Kama; and here we thought to have seen some evi-
dent Alteration in the People, their Manner, their
Habit, their Religion, and their Bufinels; but we
were mistaken, for as we had a vast Delart to pass,
which;by Relation, is near seven hundred Miles long
in some Places, but not above two hundred Miles
over where we pass'd it; so till we came past that
horrible Place, we found very little Difference be-
tween that Country and the Mogul Tartary; the Peo-
ple, mostly Pagans, and little better than the Sava-
ges of America s, their Houses and Towns full of
Idols, and their Way of Living wholly barbarous,
except in the Cities as above, and the Villages near
them j where they are Christians as they call them-
U 3 selves^
selves, of the Greek Church ;but even these have
their Religion mingled with so many Reliques of
Superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some
Places from meer Sorcery and Witchcraft.
In passing this Forrest, I thought indeed we must,
after all our Dangers were in our Imagination
ejcap'd. as before, have been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murther'd by a Troop of Thieves ; of
what Country they were, whether the roving Bands
of the Ostiacbi, a Kind of Tartars, or wild People
on the Bank of the 03i, had rang'd thus far, or
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I
am yet at a Loss to know; but they were all on
Horseback, carry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at
first about five and forty in Number; they came
so near to us, as within about two Mufquet Shot,
and asking no Questions, they surrounded us with
their Horse, and looked very earnestly upon us twice;
at length they plac'd themselves just in our Way,
upon which, we drew up in a little Line befour our
Camels, being not above sixteen Men in afl; and
being drawn up thus, we halted and sent out the
Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to see who
they were; his Master was the more willing to let
him go, because he was not a little apprehensive,
that they were a Siberian Troop sent out after him:
The Man came up near them with a Flag of
Truce, and call'd to them; but tho' he spoke se-
veral of their Languages or Dialects of Languages
rather, he could not understand a Word they said *
however, after some Signs to him, not to come
nearer to them at his Peril; so he said he under-
stood them to mean.offering to shoot at him if he
advanc'd; the Fellow came back no wiser than he
went, only that by their Drels, he said, be believ'd
them to be some Tartan of Kalmuck, or of the dr-
cajian Hoords; and that there mult be more of them
upon the great Desart, tho' he never heard that
anyof them ever were seen so fat North before.
This was small Comfort to us; however, we had
no Remedy ; there was on our left Hand at about
a Quarter of a Mile's Distance, a little Grove of
Clump of Trees which stood close together, and
very near the Road; I immediately refolv'd we
would advance to those Trees, and fortify ourselves
as well as we could there; for first I considered,
that the Trees would in a great Measure cover us
from their Arrows, and in the next Place, they could
not come to charge us m a Body; it was indeed my
old Portuguese Pilot who proposed it, and who had
this Excellency attending him, namely, that he was
always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage
us in Cafes of the most Danger; we advanced
immediately with what Speed we could, and gain'd
that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves,for we knew
not what to call them, keeping their Stand, and
not attempting to hinder us: When we came thi-;'
ther, we found to our great Satisfaction, that it
was a swampy springy Piece of Ground, and on
the one Side, a very great Spring of Water, which
running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a little
farther, join'd by another of the like Bigness, and
was in short, the Head or Source of a considerable
River, call'd afterwards the Wtrtska; the Trees
which grew about this Spring, were not in all above
two hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty
thick ;so that assoon as we got in, we saw ourselves
perfectly safe from the Enemy, unless they alighted
and attack'd us on Foot,
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese,with indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms
of the Trees, and laid them hanging not cut quite off
from one Tree to another, so that he made a conti-
nued Fence almost round us.
We stayed here waiting the Motion of the Enemy
some Hours, without perceiving they made any of-
fer to stir ; when about two Hours before Night,
they came down directly upon us, and tho' we had
not
not perceiv'd it, we found they had been join'd by
some more of the same, so that they were near
fourscore Horse, whereof however, we sancy'd some
were Women : They came on till they were within
half Shot of our little Wood, when we fir'd one
Musquet without Ball, and call'd to them in the
Ruffian Tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid
them keep off; but as if they knew nothing of
what we said they came on with a double Fury di-
rectly up to the Wood.side, not imagining we were
so barricado'd that they could not break in ; our old
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our
Engineer i and defir'd of us, not to fire upon them
till they came within Pistol-Shot, and that we might
be sure to kill, and that when we did fire, we should
be sure to take good Aim; we bad him give the
Word of Command; which he delay'd so long,
that they were some of them within two Pikes
length of us when we fir'd.
We aim'd so true, Cor Providence directed our
Shot so sure) that we kill'd fourteen of them, at
the first Volley, and wounded several others, as also
several of their Horses; for we had all of us loadedjour
Pieces with two or three Bullets a peiceAat least.
They were terribly furpriz'd with our Fire, and
retreated immediately about one Hundred Rods
from us; in which Time, we loaded our Pieces
again, and seeing them keep that Distance, we sal-
ly'd out and catch'd four or five of their Horses,
/ whose Riders.we suppos'd, were kill'd, and coming
up to the dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how
they came to make an Excursion such an unusual
Length.
About an Hour after they made a Motion to at-
tack us again, and rode round our little Wood, to see where else they might break in; but finding us
always ready to Face them, they went off again, and
we resolved not to stir from the Place for that Night.
We
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the
most Part of the Night in ftrengtbning our Situati-
on, and barricadoing the Entrances into the Wood,
and keeping a strict Watch, we waited for Day-
Light, and when it came, it gave us a very unwel-
come Discovery indeed "s for the Enemy, who we
thought were discouraged with the Reception they
had met with, were now encreas'd to no less than
three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve Huts
and Tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us;
and this little Camp they had pitch'd upon the open
Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from us.
We were indeed mrpriz'd at this Discovery $ and
now I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all
that I had, The Loss of my Effects did not lye so!
near me, (tho'they were very considerable) as the
Thoughts of falling into the Hands of such Barbari-
ans, at the latter End of my Journey, after so many
Difficulties and Hazards as I had gone thro' ; and
even in Sight of our Port, where we expected Safe-
ty and Deliverance; as for my Partner, he was ra-
ging ; he declar'd, that to lose his Goods would be
his Ruin and he would rather die than be starved ;
and he was for fighting to last the Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh shew'd
itself, was for fighting to the last also; and my old
Pilot was of the Opinion we were able to resist them
all, in the Situation we then were in; and thus we
spent the Day in Debates of what we should do but
towards Evening, we found that the Number of our
Enemies still encreas'd, perhaps as they were
abroad in several Parties for Prey ; the first had sent
out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them
of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the
Morning they might still be a greater Number; fb
I began to enquire of those People we had brought
from ToboUki, if there was no other, or more pri-
vate Ways by which we might avoid them in the
Night, Night, and perhaps either retreat to some Town, or
get Help to guard us over the Desart.
The Syberian, who was Servant to the young Lord,
told us, if we design'd to avoid them and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the Night, to a
Way that went North towards the River Petrou, by
which he made no Question, but we might get a-
way, and the Tartars never the wiser ; but he said,
his Lord had told him, he would not retreat but would rather chuse to fight, I told him, Tie mis-
took his Lord, for that he was too wife a Man to
love fighting for the sake of it; that I knew his
Lord was brave enough by what he had (hew'd al-
ready i but that his Lord knew better, than to de-
fire to have seventeen or eighteen Men fight five hun-
dred, unless an unavoidable Necessity fote'd them to
it ;and that if he thought it possible for us to escape
in the Night, we had nothing else to do but to at-
tempt it. He answer'd jf his Lord gave him such
Orders, he would lose his Life if he did not per-
form it; we soon brought his Lord to give that Or-
der, tho' privately, and we immediately prepar'd
for the putting it in practice. And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kind-
led a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burn-
ing, and prepar'd so as to make it burn all night, that theTartars might conclude we were still there ^
hut as soon as it was dark, (that is to say) so as we
could fix the Stars (for our Guide would not stir
before) having all our Horses and Camels ready
loaders, we followed our new Guide, who„l soon
foand.steer'd himself by the Pole, or North Star, all
the Country being level for a long Way.
After we had traveled two Hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark
all Night, but the Moon began to rife, so that in
short, it was rather lighter than we wisti'd it to be;
but by fix a Clock the next Morning we were gotten
near forty Miles, tho' the Truth is, we almost
spoil'd
jpoil'd our Horses. Here we found a Rvstan Village;
named Kirmazimkoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day ; about
two Hours before Night we set out again, and tra-
veled till eight the next Morning, tho' not quite fit Hastily as before, and about seven a-Clock we pas-
sed a little River calPd Kirtza, and came to a good
large Town inhabited by Russians,and very popu-
lous, calPd Ozomoys, there we heard that several
Troops or Hoords of Calmuch had been abroad up-
on the Defart, but that we were now compleatly out
of Danger of them, which was to our great Satis-
faction you may be fore. Here we were oblig'd to '.
get some fresh Horses, and having need enough of
Rest, we stayed five Days ; and my Partner and I
agreed to give the honest Siberian, who brought us
thither, the Value of ten Pistoles, for his conduct-
ing us.
In five Days more we came to VevJIima, upon the
River Witzogda, which running into the Dwina, we
were there very happily near the end of our Travels
by Land, that River being navigable in seven Days
Passage to Arch-Angel: From hence we came to
Lawremkoy where the River joins,the %d of Julyt
and provided ourselves with two Luggage Boats,
and a Barge for our own Convenience, we embark'd
the 7th, and arrived all safe at Arch-Angel the i8tb,
having been a Year, five Months and three Days
on the Journey, including our Stay of eight Months
and odd Days at Tobohii.
We were obliged to stay at this Place six Weeks
for the Arrival of the Ships, and must have tarry'd
longer, had not a Bamburgher come in above a
Month sooner than any of the Erglifl) Ships; when
after some Consideration, that the City of Hamburgh
might happen to be as good a Market for our Goods
as London, we all took Freight with him, and hav-
ing put my Good on board, it was most natural foe me to put my Steward on board to take care of'
them,
them, by which means my young Lord had a suffi-
cient Opportunity to conceal himself, never coming
on Shore again in all the time we stayed there; and
this he did, that he might not be seen in the City,
where some of the MoscowMerchants would cer-
tainly have seen and discovered him.
We sail'd from Arch-Angel the 20th of August the
same Year, and after no extraordinary bad Voyage,
arriv'd in the Elbe the s %th of September. Here my
Partner and I found a very good fall for our Goods,
as well those of China as the Sables, Cc. of Syberia;
and dividing the Produce of our Effects, my Share
amounted to 3475—17 — notwithstanding so
many Losses we had sustains, and Charges we had
been at; only remembring that I had included in
this, about fix hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds
which I had purchas'd at Bengal.
Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and
went up the Elbe in order to go to the Court of
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and
where he could correspond with those of his Fa-
ther's Friends who were left alive: He did not
part without all the Testimonies he could give
me.of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, and
his Sence of my kindness to the Prince his Father.
To conclude, having stayed near four Months
in Hamburgh, I came from thence over Land to the
Hague, where I embark'd in the Pacquet, and
arriv'd in London the 10th of January, 1705, having
been gone from England ten Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harrass myself no more,
I am preparing for a longer Journey than all these,
having liv'd 72 Years , a Life of infinite variety, and learn'd sufficiently to know the Value of Retire-
ment, and the Blessing of ending our Days in Peace.
