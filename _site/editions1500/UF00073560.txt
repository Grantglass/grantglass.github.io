ROBINSON CRUsoE;

I wss born in the year 1632, in' the city'ef York, of a good _.

family though not 0 that country, my father being a .ibreign-vg'u
er of firemen, who. settled first at Hull: he got a estate r i
I? merchandise, and leavin ofi' his trade,-lived rwards at

ork; from whence he married in mother, whose relap; 3
tions were named Robinson, a ve 1 family in that coring;
try, and from whom I was called inson Kreutznaer;. but, ,1.
by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now I: -
called, nay we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and .3
so my companions always called me. . 2 . .

I had two,elder brothers, one of whom was heutenant-cdo-g
uel to an'En lish regiment of that in Flanders, formerl com-f;
manded by e, famous Colonel Lockhart and was kill at the 5- -
battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of;

my father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house-ed ucation and a country free-
school generally go, and designed "10 for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothiirr but going to sea; and my inclination
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands
of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of
my mother and other friends, that there seemed. to be some-
thing fatal in that propensmn of nature, tending directly to the
life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and rave man, gave me serious and ex-
cellent counsel against w rat he foresaw was my design. He

, called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-

fined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me
upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a
mere wandering inclination, I had for leavina my father's
house and my native country, where I might :be well intro-
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by a plica-
tion and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. e told
me it was for men of desperate fortunes On one hand, or of as-
piring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous
in undertakin s of a nature out of the common road ; that these
things were I either too far above me, or too far below me;
that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the
upper station of lowlife, which he had found, by long expe-
rience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to
human happiness, not ex' osed to the miseries and hardships
the labor and sufferings o the mechanic part of mankind, and
not embarrassed with the pride, luxur , ambition: and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He tol me 1 might judge of
the happiness of this state by one thing, viz. that this was the
state 0 life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequent] lamented the miserable consequences of being born
to eat ings, and wish they had been laced in the middle
of e two extremes, between the mean an .the great; that the
wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just standard ofROBINSON caUsoa. ' 7

mulel felicity, when he prayed to have neither' poverty not
no es.

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the ca-
lamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
at mankind; but that the middle, station ad the fewest disasa'
ters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the hi her
or lower .art of mankind; nay, they were not subjec to
so many istempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,'
as those were, who, by Vicious living, luxury, and extrava-
gances, on onethand, or by hard labor, want of necessaries,-
and mean and insufficient diet, on the other hand, brin Adisa'
tempers upon themselves. by the natural consequences 0 their >>-
waiof living; that the middle station of life was calculated for
all ind of Virtues and all ltmd of enjogments; that peace and
plenty were the handmade of a mi dle fortune' that tem-
Herance, moderation, quietness, health, societ , all'agreeable
iversions, and all desrrable pleasures, were e blessings at-
tending the middle station of life; that this way men wenssio'
lently and smoothly'through the world, and comfortably out
of it not embarrassed with the labors of the hands 'or of the
head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed
with r lexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace,
and e gody of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
secret burning lust of ambition for at thmSSs; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently throu the wor d, and sensrbly
tasting the sweets of hvm , Without e bitter, feeling that they
are happy, and learning y every day's experience to know it

more sensrbly. _
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the mostalfeo-
tionate manner, not to play the young man, not toprecigitate

myself into miseries which nature, and the station 0 life
bornvin, seemed to.have provided against; that I was under no
necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me,
and endeior to enter me fairly into the station of life which '
he had been 'nst recommendin to me; and that if I was not
very easy an happy in the war (I, it must be my mere fate at

fault that must hinder it; and that he'should have nothing ta
answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warnmg_me
against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a
word, that as he would do ver kind thin s for me if I would
stay and settle at home as he irected, so e would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me an encourage-
' ment to o away; and, to close all, he told me I ad my el er
brother or an example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country
wars, but could not prevail, his youu desires prompting him
torun into the army, where he was k' ed; and though he said
hewould not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to
say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not
bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there might be none to
assist in my recovery. . . _

I observed in this ast part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic though I suppose my father did not know it to be
so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very
plentifuilg, and especially when he spoke of my brother who
was kill ; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to
re nt, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke
o the discourse, and told me, his heart was so full he could
say no more to me. . _

was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of oing
~ abroad an more, but to settle at home according to my fa er's
desire. ut, alas! a few days wore it all ofl'; and, in short, to
prevent any of my father's further importunities in a few weeks
afier I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily, neither, as my first heat of resolution
grompted but I took my mother, at a time when I though!
er a little pleasanter than ordinary, and' told her, that my
thoughts were so entirely bent upon seein the rld, that
[should never settle to any thing with ution nough to
go through with it, and my father had better give me his con-
sent, than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen
years old, which was too late to go apfrentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, I I did, I should'neEer
serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go one voyafe abroad, if I
came home again, and did not like it, I won] go no more,
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover that
time I had lost. '

This put mdy mother into a great passion: she told me she
knew it woul be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest-
to ive his consent to any such thing so much for my hurt;
ang that she wondered how I could think of any we thin
after such a discourse as I had had with my father, and suc
kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin in self, there was no
help for me; but I mi ht depend I shoul never have their .
consent to it; that for er part she would not have so much
hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say,
that my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afierwards, she reported all the discourse to him
and that my father, after showmg a great concern at it, said
to her with a. si h, "That boy might be hapsly if he would
stay at home; ut if he goes abroad, he w be the most
miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give no con-
sent to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose
though, in the mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to_a.ll
pro 5 of settling to business, and frequently expostulatmg
wr my father an mother about their being so positively de-
termined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to._ But being one da at Hull, where I went casually;

oy sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of sea-faring men
viz. that it should cost me nothing for my passa e, I consulte
neither father or mother any more, not so muc as sent them
word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out askina' God's blessmg, or my father's, without any consid-
eration of circumstances or conse uences, and in an ill hour
God knows, on the first of Se tem r, 1651, I went on board
a ship bound for London. ever any young adventurer's
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued lon r than
mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the Hum r, but
the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most fright-
ful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was
most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I be-
gan now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how
justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for wick-
edly eaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All
the good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my
mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my
conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness
to which it has been since, reproached me with the contempt
of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and m father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, w 'ch I had
never been upon before, went very high, though nothin like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor like what saw
a few days after: but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a oung sailor, and had never known an this? of the
matter. expected every wave would have sw low us 11 ,
and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in e
trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in
:his ony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if
it wo d please God here to spare my life this one vo age, if
ever I ot once my foot upon dry land again, I won] go di-
rectly ome to my father, and never set it into a ship again
while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run in -
self into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw pl ' y
the oodnessof ' observations about the middle station of
life, ow easy, h v comfortably he had lived all his da 8, and
never had been exposed to tem cats at sea, or trou 165 on
shore; and I resolved that I won] , like a true repenting prod-
igal go home to my- father, ~
TI ese wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm
and, indeed, some time after; but the next day, as the win
was abated, and the seacalmer, I began to be a little inured-
. to it: however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a
little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared u ,
the wind was (finite over, and a charmin fine evening followed;
the sun went own perfectly clear, an rose so the next gnom-

ing;_ and having little or no wind and a smooth sea, the sun '

shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delight-
ful that I ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea, that Was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm
and so pleasant in a little time afier. And now, lest my
resolutions should continue, my companion, who had in eed,-r
enticed me away, came to me and said, "Well,.Bob," clap.
ping me on the shoulder, " how do you do after it? . I warrant
you were fri htened, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but
a cap-full o wind'l"--" A ca full do you call it?" said I:
"it was a terrible storm."--" storm, you fool you," replied
he," do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all deg give
us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such
a squall of wind as that' but ou're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob. Come, let us ma e a W] of punch, and we'll for t
all that; _do you see what charming weather it'is now?" '0
make short this sad art of my story we went the old way of
all sailors; the punc was made, an I was made drunk with
it; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my re-
pentance, all m reflections upon my past conduct, and all'
my resolutior s or my future. In a word, as the sea was re-'
turned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by '

the abatement of that storm, so, the hurr ofmy thou hts being
over my fears and apprehensions 0 being swal owed up
by the sea bein forgotten, and the current of my former de-
sires returned, entirel forgot the vows and promises that I '
made in my distress. found, indeed, some intervals of re-
flection; and serious thoughts did, as it were endeavor to
return again sometimes; but I shook them 0 , and roused
myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applyin
myself to drinkinlg and company, soon mastered the return 0
those fits, for so called them; and I had in five or six days

at as complete a victory over conscience, as any oung
fiallow, that resolved not to be troubled with it could esire:
but I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as
in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance
the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened
wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy of. .

The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth
Roads - the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to anchor, and here we lay, the wind contin-
uing contrary, VIZ. at south-west, for seven or ei ht days,
durin which time a great many ships from Newc tle came
into e same roads, as the common harbor where the ships
mi ht wait for a wind for the River.

e had not, however, rid here so lon , but should have
tided it up the river, but that the wind bew too fresh; and,
after we had lain four or five days, blew verigiard. However,
the roads being reckoned as good as a har r, the anchorage
good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men were un-
concerned, and not in the least apprehensive of dan r, bu
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of e sea;
but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased and we
had all hands at work to strike our top-masts and mal'ce every
thing snug and close. that the ship might ri e as easy as poe

sible. By noon the sea went ver high indeed, and our ship
rode forecastle in, ship ed sever seas, and we thought once
or twice our anchor h come home; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two an-
chors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I be-
gan to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the sea-
men themselves. The master though vigilant in the business
of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin
by me, I could hear him softly sa to himself several times
" Lord, be merciful to us! we sh be all lost; we shall be all
undone!" and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, 1 'ing still in my cabin, which was in the steer e, and
cannot escribe my temper: I could ill reassume e first
penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and
iardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death
had been past, and that this woul be nothin like the first;
but when the master himself came b me as said just now,
and said we should be all lost, I was readfully frighted: I got
up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight
I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke upon
us every three or four minutes: when I could look about, 1
could see nothing but distress around us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being
deep ladendeg and our men cried out, that a ship which ri
about a .mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships,
being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to
sea, at all adventures and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much laboring in the
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us.
running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening, the mate and boatswain begged the mas-
ter of our ship to at them cut away the fore-mast, which he
was very unwrllin'g to do ; but the boatswain protesting tohim
that if he did not, the Ship would founder, he consented; an
when they had cut away the foremast, the main-mast stood sonosmson causoa. 15

wee, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut
her away also, and make a clear deck. -
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor and who had been'in such
a.fright before at but a little. lint ii I can express" at this
distance the thou [its that I had about me at that time, I was
in tenfold more orror of mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to the resolup
tions I had wickedly taken at first than I was at death itself:
and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me in such
condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst
was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a .
worse. We had a ood ship, but she was deep laden, and
wallowed in the sea, t at the seamen every now and then cried
out, she would founder. It was my advantage in one res ect,
that I did not know what they meant by founder, till in-
quired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what
is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others
more sensible than the rest, at their prayers and expecting
ever moment when the ship would 0 to the bottom. In the
mid e of the night, and under all e rest of our distresses
one of the men that had been down on guilpose to see, cried
out, we had sprun a leak' another sai , ere was four foot
water in the hold. hen all hands were called to the pump.
At that very word, my heart, as I thought, died within me, and
I fell backwards upon the side of my bed, where I. sat, into the
cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that
was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
another; at which I stirred up, and went to the ump, and
worked very heartil . While this was doing, e master,
seeing some light col 'ers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea" and would not come
near us, ordered us to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I
thought the ship ail broke, or some dreadful thing had hap-

pened. In a word, I was so surprised, that I fell ilomf in a
swoon. As this was a time when every body had his own life
IC think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me;
but another man stepped up to the pum , and, thrusting me
aside with his foot let me he, thinking I ad been dead; and
it was a great wh' e before I came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasin in the hold, it was
apparent that the shi would founder; and though the storm
began to abate a lit e, yet as it was not possibe she could
swnn till we might run into a port, so the master continued
firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just
ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible
for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side,
till at last, the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern
with a buoy to it and then veered it out a rreat length, which
they, after great labor and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled
them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat to
think of reaching to their own ship; so all agreed to let er
drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we
could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was
staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so,
partly rowin and partly drivin , our boat went awa to the
northward, s oping towards the sghore almost as far as inter-
ton Ness.

We were not much more than a uarter of an hour out of
our ship but we saw her sink, and t en I understood for the
first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I
must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the sea-
men told me she was sinking; for from that moment they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go
in: my heart was, as it were, dead within me, artly with

fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thou ts of what
was yet before me.i

While we were in this condition the men yet laborin at
the oar to. bring the boat near the shore, we could see (w en
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore
a great many ulpeople running along the strand to assist us
when we sho d come near; but we made but slow way to-
wards the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the west-
ward, towards Cromer, and so the land broke ofi' splittle the
violence of the wind. Here we got in and, though not with-
out much difiicult , got all safe on s ore, and walked after-
wards on foot to armouth,_where, as unfortunate men, we
were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of shi s, and had moneihglilven as
sufficient to carry us either to ndon or back to , as we
thought fit. .

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull and
have gone home, I had been hap y and my father, an em em
of our blessed Savior's parable a even killed the fatted calf
for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away
in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any as-
surance that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinac that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times lou calls
from my reason, and my more com osed judgment, to go

' home, yet I had no power to do it. know not what to call

this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that
hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
even though it be before us, and that we rush u n it with our
eyes 0 en. Certainly, nothing but some suc decreed un-
avoida le misery attending, and which it was impossible for
me to escape, could have pushed me forward a ainst the calm
reasonings and rsuasions of my most re ' thoughts, and

against two suc visible instructions as I had met With in'my
first attempt.

was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first
time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town
to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it ap-
peared his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy, and
shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father
who I was, and how I had come this voyme only for a trial,
in order to go farther abroad: his father turning to me with a
very grave and concerned tone, " Young man," says he,
" you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea-
faring man."--" Why, srr," said I, " will you go to sea no
more? "--" That is another case," said he; " it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you made this vo age for a
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has a'iven you 0 what you
are to expect if you persist. Perha s t iis has all befallen us
on your account, like Jonah in the 5 1p of Tarshish. Pray,"
continues he, " what are you; and on what account did you
go to sea'l" Upon that I told him some of my story; at the
end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion;
" What had I done," says he, "that such an unhap y wretch
should come into my ship? I would not set my oot in the
same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This, in-
deed, was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were
yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he
could have authority to go. However he afterwards talked
very gravel to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and
not tempt rovidence to my ruin; to d me I might see a vis
ible hand of Heaven ainst me. "And, young man," said
he, " depend upon it, i you do not-go back wherever you go
you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments,
till our father's words are fulfilled upon you."

e parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and 1
saw him no more: which way he went I know not. As for
me 'having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London
Mind and there. as well as on the road, had many strug-
gles with myself, what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home, or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best notions that offers
ed to m thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at amon the neighbors, and should be
ashamed to see, not my fat ier and mother only, but even
every body else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruousnnd irrational the common temper of man-
kind is especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to
sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed of the action
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be es-
teemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncer-
tain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead.
An irresistible reluctance continued to oing home; and as I
staid awhile, the remembrance of the istress I had been in
wore off; and as that abated, the little notion I had in my de-
sires to a return wore off with it, til] at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That .evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house, that hurried me into the wild and indigeswd
notion of raising my fortune; and that impressed those con<
ceits so forcibl upon me, as to make me deaf to all good ad-
vice, and to e entreaties and even the commands of my
father; I say the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I
went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our
sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I
did not ship in self as a sailor - whereby, though I might in-
deed have wor ed a little bar er than ordinary, yet at the
same time I had learnt the duty and office of a foremast-man;
and in time might have qualified myself fo'r a mate or lieuten-
ant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate to

choose for the worse, so I did here, for, having money in my
pocket, and 'fiood clothes upon my back, I would always go
on board in e habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship or earnt to do any.

t was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and un-
guided young fellows as I then was; the devil generally-not
omitting to ay some snare for them veriy: eafly: but It was not
so with me. first fell acquainted wit the master of a shi
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having hag
very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who,
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis-
agreeable at that time, hearin me say I had a mind to see the
world, told me if I Would go t e voyage with him, I should be
at no ex use; I should be his messmate and his companion;
and if could carry any thing with me, I should have all the
advantage of it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I
might meet with some encouragement.

embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man,
I went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure
with me, which, y the disinterested honesty of my friend the
captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about
PS40 in such to s and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This PS40 I h mustered together b the assistance of some
of my relations whom I corresponde with, and who, I believe,

ot my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as
glint to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage in which I may sa I was success-
ful in all my adventures, and which I owe to e integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also I got a
competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of

_ navigation, learnt how to keep an account of the ship's

course, take an observation and, in short to understand some
things that were handful to be understood by a sailor; for as
he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; an , in
L word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which yielded me, in London, at my return, al-
most PS300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have so completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particu-
larly thatI was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal
trading being upon the coast, fi'om the latitude of la degrees
north even to the line itself.

I'wasnow set up for .a Guinea trader; and my friend, to
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved
to go the same voyage ain; and I embarked in the same
vessel with one who was 's mate in his former <<gage, and
had now got the command of the ship. This was e unhap-
piest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not car
quite PS100 of - m new-gained wealth, so that I had PS200 1e ,
and which I l C/red wrth my friend's widow, who Was very
just to me, yet I zl'ell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between thom islands and the
African shore, was surprised, in the gray of the morning by a
Turkish rover, of Sallee who gave chase to us with all the
sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as
our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear;.
but finding the pirate ained upon us, and would certainly
come up with us in a ew hours, we prepared to fight; our '
ship haying twelve guns, and the rover ei hteen. About three
in the afternoon, he came up with us, an bringing to, by mis-
take, just athwart our (garter, instead of athwart our stern as
he intended, we brouat eight of our guns to bear on that
side, and poured in a roadside upon him,'which made him
sheer off ain after returning our fire, and pouring m.also
his small-s ot om near 200 men which he had on -board.r
However we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
clam. IIe prepared to attack us again, and we to defend our-

selves , but laying us on board, the next time, upon our other
Quarter, he entered sixt men upon our decks, who imme.

iately fell to cuttinnr an hackintr the sails and rigging. We

lied them with sui -shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such
like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut
short this melancholy part of our story, our shi being dis'
abled, and three of our men killed and eight wouu ed, we were
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a
port belongin to the Moors.

The usage had there was not so dreadful as at first I a -
prehended; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor s
court, as the rest of our men were, but was ke t by the cap-
tain of the rover as his proper prize, and made us slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable, '
slave, l was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back
upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be
miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was
now so effectually brought to )ass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven iiad overtaken me, and I was un-
done without redemption; but, alas! this was but a taste of
the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would some time or other
be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war;
and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine
was soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he lefi me on
shore to look after his little garden, and do the common drudg-
ery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after
the ship.

Here 1 meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it: nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational ; for I had nobody to communicate II. to that would

'embark with me, no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman,
or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two years, though
I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had
the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my
liberty again in my hea . My patron lying at home longer
than usual without fitting out his shi , whic , as I heard, was
for want of money, he used constant y, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace, and go out into the road a--fishiug; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we
.made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catch-
ing fish; insomuch that sometimes he Would send me With a
Moor one of his kinsmen, and the youth of Moresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him. .

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark calm
mornin , a fog rose so thick, that, though we were not half a
league tom the shore, we lost sight of it; and, rowin we knew
not whither or which way, we labored all day, and l the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we had pulled
off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were
at least two leagues from the shore: however, we got well in
again, though with a reat deal of labor, and some danger;
for the wind began to low pretty fresh in the morning; but
particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned b this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the uture; and having lying by him
the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he
would not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some
provision: so he ordered the carpenter of .his ship, who also
was an English slave, to build a httle state-room, or cabm, m
the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, With a place
to stand behind H. to steer and haul home the mam-sheet; and
room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails: she

boom gibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug.
and low, and had in it room for him to he, with a slave or two,
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink; and particu-
larl his bread, rice, and coffee.

e went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as l
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with-
out me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this
boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors
of some distinction in that )lace, and for whom he had provi-
ded extraordinarily, and hail therefore sent on board the boat
over-ni ht a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had
order me to get ready three fuzees with powder and shot,,
which were on board his ship; for that they designed some
sport of fowling as well as fishinm A

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ensign and
pendants out, and every thing to accommodate his guests;
when, by and by, my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put off going, upon some business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to oout
with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his riends
were to sup at his house; and commanded that as soon as I
got some fish I should bring it home to his house; all which 1
pre ared to do.

his moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now 1 found I was like to have a little nhip at
my command; and my master bein gone, 1 prepared to fur-
nish myself, not for fishing business, ut for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did 1 so much as consider, whither 1
should steer; for any where, to get out of that place, was
my wa .

M rst contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to
this oor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for
I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread
he said, that was true; so he brought a lar e basket of rusk
or biscuit of their kind, and three jars wi fresh water, into
the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,
which, it was evident by the make, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for our
master: I conve ed also a great lump of bees-wax into the
boat, which weig led above half a hundred weight with a par-
cel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a,saw, and a hammer, all
which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax
to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he
innocently came into also: his name was Ismael whom the '
call Muley, or Moley; so I called him; "Moley," said i,
" our patron's guns are on board the boat; can you not get a
little powder and shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies
(a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps
the gunner's stores in the ship."--" Yes," says he, " I'll bring
some ' "
which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather
more; and another With shot, that had five or six pounds, with
some bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I had
found some owder of my master's in the great cabin with
which I filleclJ one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pourin r what was in it into another; and thus
furnished with every t ing needful, we sailed out of the port
to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port,
knew who we were, and took no notice of us: and we were
nm above a mile out of the ort before we hauled in our sail,
and set us down to fish. he wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow
which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place
where l was, and leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
him: I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he

might not see them,I said to the Moor, "This will not do,
our master Will not be thus served ; we must stand farther off."
He, thinking no harm agreed, and, being in the head of the
boat, set the sails; an as I had the helm, I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I would
fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to
where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him, I took him by sur rise with my arm under his
waist, and tossed him clear over ard into the sea. He rose
immediately, for he swam like a cork and called to me, begged
to be taken in, told me he would go ail over the world with me.
He swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there beinor but little wind; upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and etching one of the fowling-pieces,
I presented it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet, I would do him none: " But," said I,
" you swim well enough to reach to the 'shore, and the sea is
calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you
no harm; but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through
the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty :" so he turned
himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt
but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturin to
trust him. When he was one, I turned to the boy, w om
they called Xury, and said to him, "Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man; but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet
and his father's beard, " I must throw you into the sea too."
The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I
could not mistrust him; and swore to befaithful to me, and go
all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood
out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to wind-
ward, that they might think me one towards the Straits'
mouth (as indeed any one that ha been in their wi 2 mustRobin-om: nape from 8.1100.' 28 l{( )BINSUN cm ISUE.

have been supposed to do); for who would have supposed we
were sailed on to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast,
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with
the canoes, and destroy us; where we could never once go on
shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind?

But as soon as it rrew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered: directly south and by east, bendm my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in wit the
shore; and having a fair, fresh orale of wind, and a smooth,

uiet sea I made such sail that f believe by the next day at
311138 o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, 1
could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other
kin" thereabout, for we saw no e0 le.

Y'et such was the fright I hadp ta en at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor; the
wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five days ;.
and then the Wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and come
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or
where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or
what river: I neither saw, or desired to see any people; the
principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came Into this
creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it
was dark and discover the country; but, as soon as it was
quite dar , we heard such dreadful noises of the barking,
roaring, and howlin of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor y was ready to die with fear, and beg ed
of me not to go on shore till day. " Well, Xury," sai I,
" then I won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who
will be as bad to us as those lions."--" Then we give them the
shoot un," sa s Xury, lau hing, " make them run wey."
Such nglish ury spoke y conversing among us slaves.Rosmsorz CRUSOE. 29

However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him
a dram (out of ougdpatron's case of bottles) to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's vice was good, and I took it' we drop
our little anchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we ept
none; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures
(we knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to
the sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves for the leasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous owlings and yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more frightened when we heard one of these
mighty creatures come swunmin towards our boat; we could
not see him, but we might hear im by his blowing to be a
monstrous huge and furious beast; Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be 'so for aught I know; bultvpoor Xur cried to
me to wei h the anchor and row away :' " 0," says , " Xury;
we can sip our cable with the buoy to it, and go 03' to sea;
they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceived the creature (whatever it was}1 within two oars' length,
which something surprised me; owever, I immediately
stepped to the ca
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards
the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hid-
eous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well u on the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon 6 noise
or report of the un,_a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures ad never heard before: this convinced me
that there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that
coast, and how to venture on shore in the day.was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of
lions and tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.

where or other for water, for we had not a mt left in the boat :
when or where to get it, was the point: ury said, if I would
let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water and bring some to me. I asked him why he
would go; why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much affection, that made me love him
ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they eat me, you
go wey."----" VVeIl, Xur '," said I, " we will both go, and if the
wild mans come, we wil kill them; they shall eat neither of
us." 801 gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of our iatron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before;
and we hau ed the boat in as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and so waded to shore; carrying nothing but our arms,
and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy,
seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it;
and by and by I saw him come runnin r towards me. I thought
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast,
and I run forward towards him to help him; but when I came
nearer to him, I saw something hangin over his shoulders,
which was a creature that he had shot, li 'e a hare, but differ-
ent in color, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of
it and it was ,very good meat; but the great jo that poor
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found g water, and
seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards, that we need not take such pains
for water, for a little' hi her up the creek where we were, we
found the water fresh w en the tide was out, which flows but
a little way up ; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare
we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no
footste s of any human creature in that part of the country.

As had been one vo age to this coast before I knew very
well that the islands 0 the Canaries, and the eape de Verd
islands also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no

' Instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and not exactly knowin , or at least rememherm ,
what latitude they were in, and' Enew not where to look or
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise
I might now easily have found some of these islands. But my
hope was, that if I stood along this coast till Icame to that
part where the English traded, I should find some of their
vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve and
take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where 1 now was
must be that country, which,l ing between the emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the egroes, lies waste, and unin-
habited, exce t by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned
it, and gone arther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking)" worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness;
and indeed 0th forsaking it because of the 'prodigious num-
bers of tigers, lions, and leopards, and other urious creatures
which harbor there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting
only, where they 0 like an army, two or three thousand men
at a time; and in eed for near a hundred miles together upon
this coast, we saw nothing but a wasteraininhabited country
by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild
beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day-time I thou ht I saw the Pico of
Tenerifl'e, being the high top of the ountain Tenerifi'e in
the Canaries, and had a reat mind to venture out, in ho s
of reaching thither; but raving tried twice, I was for in
again by contrary winds the sea also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep
along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we
had left this place; and once in particular being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor under a ittle point of land
which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay
still to go farther in. Xury whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, cal s softly to me, and tells me that we
had best go farther off the shore; " for," says he," look, yonder
lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep."
I looked where he pointed, and saw adreadful monster indeed,
for it was a terrible great 'lion that lay on the side of the shore,
under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a
little over him. " Xury," says I, " you shall 0 on shore and
kill him." Xury looked frightened, and sai , "Me kill! he
eat me at one mouth 1" one mouthful he meant: however, I
said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our
biggest <<run, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good 'liarge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down;
then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for
we had three )ieces I loaded with live smaller bullets. I took
the best aim coal with the first piece to have shot him in
the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his
nose, that the slugs hit his len- about the knee, and broke the
bone. He started up, grouil'ing at first, but finding his 16
broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three Iegs, ant
gave the most hideous roar that ever heard. I was a little
surprised that 1 had not hit him on the head; however, I took
up the second piece immediately, and, though he began to
move off, fired again, and shot him in the. head, and had the
pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie
struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have
me Tet him go on shore; "Well, go," said I; so the boy
jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand,
swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and sho'
him in the head again, which despatched him quite.

This was game Indeed to us, but this was no food; and '
was very sorry to lose three charms of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury
said he would have mine of him; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. " For what, Xury?" said
I. " Me cut ofl' his head," said he. However, Xury could not
cut off his head, but he out off a foot, and brought it with him
and it was a monstrous great one.nonmsou cnuson. 33

l bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other he of some value to us; and I resolved
to take 011' his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work
with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us both up the
whole day, but at last we got oi? the hide of him, and 5 read.
ing it on the top of our cabin, the sun efi'ectually drie it in
two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually
for ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our rovisions,
which began to abatewcry much, and gomg no 0 tenet into
the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water: In design
in this was, to make the river Gambia or Senegal, t at is to
say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship; and if I did not I knew
not what course 1 had to take, but to seek for the islands, or -
perish there amon0r the Negroes. I knew that all the ships
from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea 01' to
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those isIands;
and in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this sin-
gle-pipint, either that I must meet with some ship or must

ens .
p When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said,I began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive
they were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better coun-
sellor, and said to me, " No <<3,0, no go." However, I hauled
in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I found they
run along the shore by me a good way: I observed they had
no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a lon slender
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they we (1 throw
them a great way with a good aim; so I kept at a distance,
but talked with them by Signs as well as I could; and' partic-
ularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to

me to stop my boat, and they would. fetch me some meat.
U on this 1 lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two
0 them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh and
some corn, such as IS the produce of their country; but we
neither knew what the one or the other was: however, we
were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and the
were as much afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us al
for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and went and
stood a great way off till we fetched it oh board, and then came
close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an o portunity offered that very in-
stant to oblige them wonderful y ; for while we were lying by
the shore came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other
alas we took it?1 with great fury from the mountains towards

e sea; whet er it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in s ort or in rage, we could not tell any
more than we could tel whether it was usual or strange, but I
believe it was the latter; because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and in
the second place we found the people terribly frightened, es-
pecially the women. The man that had the lance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
, into the sea and swam about, as if they had come for their di-
version : at last, one of them began to come nearer our boat than
I at first ex ected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun wit] all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both
the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired,
and shot him directly in the head : immediately he sunk down
into the water, but rose instantly, and plunoed up and down, as
if he was struggling for life; and so indeed he was: he imme-
diately made to the shore; but between the wound, which was, wwyv w. a..->> .,,... W"... 7.. n... .. 17-37:.th 7..."...

his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.

it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of m gun: some of them were
even ready to die for fear, and fell own as dead with the very
terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart, and came to the shore, and began to search
for the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water;
and b the help of a rope which I slung round him, and gave
the egroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found
that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and_fine to an ad
mirable degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and
the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran u directly to
the mountains from whence they came; nor co d I at that
distance, know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes
were for eatin the flesh of this creature; so I was willing to
have them ta e it as a favor from me; which, when I made
signs to them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him; and
though they had no knife, yet with a shar ened piece of wood,
they took ofl' his skin as readily, and muc more readily, than
we could have done with a knife. The offered me some of

the flesh, which I declined, making as i I would give it them, -

' but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freel ,
and brought me a great deal more of their provisions, whic

though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made
Signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to
them turning it bottom upward, to show that it was emp ,
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called immediate y
to some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I an ,

in the sun; this they set down to me, as before, and sent
0 .
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The
women were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was
and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward
for about eleven days more, without 0 'ering to go near the
shore, till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea
at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; an
the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing, to make this

oint. At length, doubling the oint, at about two leagues
tom the land, I saw plainly lan on the other side, to sea-
ward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Ca 0. de Verd, and those the islands, called, from
thence, Cape e Verd Islands. However, they were at a

reat distance, and I could not well tell what 1 had best to do;
or if I should be taken with a gale of wind, I might neither
reach one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the boy cried out, " Master, master, a shi with a
sail!" and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits,
thinking it must needs be some of 1113 master's ships sent to
pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of
their reach. I jum ed out of the cabin, and immediately
saw, not only the s ip, but what she was, viz. that it was a
Portuguese shi , and, as I thought, was bound to the coast
of Guinea, for egroes. But, when I observed the course she
steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some other
way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore;
upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, re-
solvin to speak with them, if ossible.

Wit all the sail I could m. e, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be one by before I
could make any signal to them; but after I iad crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which, they supposed, must beltng to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail, to let me come up.
I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign
on board, I made' a wait of it to them, for a signal of distress,
and fired a un, both which they saw; for they told me they
saw the smo e, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these
signals, they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and
in about three hours' time I came up With them. '

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but, at last, a
Scotch sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee: they then
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all
my goods.

It was an inex ressible joy to me, which any one will be-
lieve, that I was t us delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a
miserable, and almost hopeless condition, as I was in; and I
immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be de-
livered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. " For," sa 5
he, " I have saved your life on no other terms than I would
glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides," continued
he, "when I carry on to the Brazils, so great a way from
your own country, ity I should take from you what you have,
you will be starved there, and then I only take away that
lie I have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese" (Mr. English-
man), says he- " I will carry you thither in charity, and these
things will help to buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again." ,

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance, to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that none
should offer to touch any thing I had: then he took every
lhmg into his own possession, and gave me back an exact in-

i

ventory of them, that I might have them, even so much as my
three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use; an
asked me what I Would have for it. I told him, he had been
so generous to me in every thing, that I could not offer to
make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him: upon
which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also sixty ieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loth to ta 6; not that l was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very lotb to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it
to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give

' the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian: upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go
to him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to
do next with myself, I was now to consider.

The generous treatment the captain'gave me, I can never
enough remember : he would take nothing of me for mg'fpas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, an orty
for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused every
thing I had in the ship to be unctually delivered to me: and
what I was willing to sell, he%ought of me; such as the case
of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-
wax,--for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made _
about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo;
and with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the
house of a good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingeino,
'18 they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I
lived with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that
means, with the manner of planting and making of sugar; and
seeing how well the (planters lived, and how they got rich sud-
denly, I resolved, i I could get a license to settle there, I
would turn planter among them; endeavoring in the mean
time, to find out some way to et my money, which I had left
in London, remitted to me. '0 this purpose, getting a kind
of a letter of naturalization,l purchased as much land that
was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan
for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England.

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of

English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such -

circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably to-
gether. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather

lanted for food than any thing else, for about two years.

owever, we be an to increase, and our land began to come
into order; so tiat the third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of round read for plant-
ing canes in the year to come : but we oth wante help; and
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on : I had at into
an employment uite remote to my genius, and direc y con-
trary to the life deli hted in, and for which I forsook In
father's house, and .brofie throuvh all his good advice: nay,

was coming,into the very middl: station, or upper degree of
low life, which my father advised me to before: and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stand at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world, as [had done:
and I used ofien tosay to myself, I could have done this as
well In England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand

miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness
and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me.

In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbor; no work to be done, but by the labor of
my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men
reflect, that when they compare their resent conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicit ' by their
experience: I say, how just has it been, that the tru y solitary
life I reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be
my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life
which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the
ship remained there, in providing his Iading, and )reparing
for his voyage, near three months; when, telling him what
little stock Ithad left behind me in London, he gave me this
friendly and sincere advice: " Seignior Inglese," says he afar
so he always called me), " if you will give me letters, an a
procuration here in form to me, with orders to the person who

as your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon, to
such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are pro er
for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, od
willing, at my return; but, smce human afl'airs are all subject
to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders for but
one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first, so that if it come
safe, you may order the rest the same way; and; if i'. nns-
carry, you may have the other half to havc recourse to for
your supply."aonmsori Oliver>>. 41

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
[could not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom I left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain as he desired me. _

I wrote the English captain's Widow a full account of all my
adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behavior and
what condition Iwas now in, with all other necessary irec--
tions for my sup ly; and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he foun means, by" some of the English merchants
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant at London, who represented it efl'ect--
ua'ly to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money,
but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and c rarity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in'
English goods, such as the ca tain had wrote for, sent them
directl to him at Lisbon, and lie brought them all safe to me
at the razils; among which, without my direction (for I was
too yountr in my business to think of them), he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for
mwlantation, and which were of great use to me.

hen this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I
was sur rised at the joy of it; and my ood steward, the cap-
tain, ha laid out the five pounds, whicfii my friend had sent
him as a present for himse f, to purchase and bring me over a
servant, under bond for six years' service, and would not ac-
cept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which 1
would have hi"; awe t, being of my own produce.

Nsitirer was this all); but my oods being all English man-
ufactures, such as cloths, stuffs, aize, and things particularl '
valuable and desirable in the country 1 found means to se
them to a very great advantage; so that I might say,l had
more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond4my poor neighbor, I mean in the advance-

 

. .m...v--r-1'-i'-_-vm_~--._. . i
ment of my plantation; for the first thing 1 did, I bought
me a Negro slave, and a European servant also; I mean
another besides that which the captain brought me from
Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year
with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls
of' tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbors; and these fifty rolls, being
each of above a hundred weight, were well cured, and laid by
against the return of the fleet fi-om Lisbon; and now, increas-
ing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of
projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are
indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. Hadi
continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the
happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so
earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of;
but other things attended me, and l was still to be the wilful
agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which, in
my future sorrows,l should have leisure to make, all these
miscarri es were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering
to my foo ish inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing
that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doin
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and
those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred
to resent me with, and to make my duty.

5 I had once done thus in breakin away from my parents,
so I could not be content now, but lgmust go and leave the
happy view] bad of being a rich and thriving man in my new
plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of
rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus
I cast myself down 1 rain into the deepest ulf of human
misery that ever man fig" into, or perhaps couEl be consistent
with life. and a state of health in the world.~VW'T--.I'wx--~\WWF'W--n

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43

To come, then, byjust degrees, to the particulars of this
part of my story :----You may suppose, that having now lived
almost four years in the Brazils, and be inning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, had not only learned
the language, but had contracted an ac uaintance and
friendship, among my fellow-planters, as we] as among the
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in
my discourses among them,l had frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner
of trading With the Negroes there, and how easy it was to pur-
chase on the coast, for trifles--sucli as beads, toys, knives
scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only gold
dust, Guinea rains, elephants' teeth, &c., but Negroes, for
the service oft Ie Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the

buying Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not .

far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on b
the aSsientos, or permission of the kings of S ain and Portug
and engrossed lrom the public; so that ew Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my ac uaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three 0 them came to me the next mornin and
told me they had been musing very much upon what had
discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy,
they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Gumea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and were
straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a
trade that could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they de-
sired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among'their own lantations;' and,
in a word, the question was, whether I won! go their super-
: trgo m the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast

 

"I

of Guinea; and they offered me that 1 should have an equa.
share ofthe Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair pro osal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that iiad not a settlement and plantation of
his own to look after, which was in a fair way of comin to he
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But [for me,
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to
have sent for the other hundred ounds from England; and
who, in that time, and with that 'iittle addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds ster-
ling, and that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage,
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in such cir-
cumstances, could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more
resist the offer, than 1 could restrain my first rambling designs,
when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a word,

' I told them I would go with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my lantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such as should direct, if I miscarried. This
the all eng ed to do, and entered into writin s or covenants
to dvo so; an I made a formal will, disposin o my plantation
and effects, in case of my death, making t e captain of the
ship,that had saved my life. as before, my universal heir; but
obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my
will; one half of the produce being to himself, and the other
to be shipped to England.

In short, I took alT lpossible caution to preserve my effects,
and to keep up my 5) antation: had I used half as much pru-
dence to have looke into my own interest, and have made a
iudgment of what I ought to have done and not to have done,

had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an un'
dertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone a voyage to sea, attended with all its common

hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect partic
ular misfortunes to myself '
But 1 was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason; and accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, 'and the cargo furnished, and all ings done
as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an ev11 hour again, the lst of Se tember, 1659, bein
the same day eight years that I. went rom my father an
mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and
the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twent tons burden,
carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides t e master, his
boy, and myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the Negroes,
such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles especially
little looking-(glasses, kniv'es scissors, hatchets, and the like.

The same ay 1 wenton board, we set sail, standing awa
to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretc
over for the African coast. When they came about ten or
twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the
manner of their course in those days, we had very good
weather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast,
till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; from
whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and
steered as if we were- bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha,
holdin our course N.E. by N. and leaving those isles on the
east. n this course we passed the line in about twelve_days'
time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 minutes
northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took
as quite out of our knowledge: it began from the south-east,
came about to the north-west, and then settled in the north-
east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that, for
twelve days to ether, we could do nothing' but drive, and
scudding awayfiiefore it, let it carry us whi er ever fate and
the fury of the winds directed - and, during these twelve days
I need not sa that I expected every day to be swallowed up
nor, mdeed, 'd any in the ship expect to save their hves.

In this distress, we had, besrdes the terror of the storm, one

of our men died of the calenture and one man and a boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abat-
iug a little, the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about 11 de rees north latitude,' but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude dilirence, west from bape
St. Augustine; .0 that he found he was got upon the coast of
Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazons,
toward that of the river Oroon ue, commonly called the
Great River; and be an to cons twith me what course he
should take, for the sii was leaky and very much disabled,
and he was going dii c y back to the coast of Brazil. .

I was posrtively ag .inst that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited countr for us to have recourse to, till we came
within the circle 0 the Caribbee islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes; which lily keeping off to
sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay or ulf of exico, we might
eastly perform, as we ho ed, in about fieen days'sail; where-
as we could not possib y make our voyage to the coast of
Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N.W. by W., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise de-
termined; or being in the latitude of 12 e rees 18 minutes a
second storm came upon us, which carri us away with the
same im tuosity westward, and drove us so out of the ver
way of human commerce, that had all our lives been saved:
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by
savages than ever returnin to our own country.

In this distress, the windg still blowin very hard, one of our
men early in the morning cried out, " and ! " and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immedi-" ' "' "Y""NW'Je-t'rrtwwggyg

1:1er driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the
very foam and spray of the sea.

1: is not easy or any one, who has not been in the like con-
dition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in
such circumstances; we knew nothing where we were or
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island or
the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes, without breaking in pieces, unless the Wind, by a
kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In a word, we
sat lookinig upon one another, and eiggcting death every mo-
ment, an every man acting accor gly, as preparing for
another world; for there was little or nothing more for us to
do in this:_ that which was our present comfort, and all the
comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our ex tation the
ship did not break yet, and that the master sai the wind be-
gan to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking
too fast for us to expect her getting 01?, we were in a dreadfu
condition indeed, and had nothin to do but to think of
saving our lives as well as we coul . We had a boat atour
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke
away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea; so there-was
no hope from her: we had another boat on board, but how to
get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing' however, there
was no room to debate, for we fancied the 'p would break
in ieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
bro en already. '

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat,
and with the he] of the rest of the men, they got her film
over the ship's si e; and getting all into her, let her go, an
committed ourselves, bein eleven in number, to God's mercy,
and the wild sea: for tho h the storm was abated considers

ably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and
might be well called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea
in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail
we had none; nor, if we had, could we have done an thing with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, gou h with
heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we knew
that when the boat came nearer to the shore, she would be
dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest man-
ner ; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened
our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we
could towards land.

What the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep
or shoal--we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might hap-

en into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where
y great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this ap eared; and as we made nearer

and nearer the shore, the and looked more frightful than
the sea. '

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a le ue and a
half, as we reckoned it, a ra in wave, mountain-ll e, came
rolling astern of us, and plain y ade us expect the coup de
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset the
boat at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as from
one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " O God!" for
we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw my
breath, till that wave havin driven me, or rather carried me,
I vast way on towards the s ore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath left, that, seeing myself nearer the main land than
1 expected, I got u ion m ' feet, and endeavored to make on
towards the land as ast as could, before another wave should
return and take me u again; but I soon found it was impos-
sible to avoid it; for saw the sea come after me as high as a
great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with: my business was to hold 111 breath,
and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, y swim-
ming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the
shore, if possible' my greatest concern now being, that the
wave, as It would carry me a great way towards the shore
when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when

.it ave back towards the sea.

he wave that came upon me again buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body; and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force and swiitness towards the
shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready
to burst with holdin my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my imme iate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it re-
lieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new cour e. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so ong but I
held it out; and finding the water had spent itself and began
to return, I struck forward against the return 0 the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments, to recover breath, and till the water went from me
and then took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had
farther towards the shore. But neither would this eliver me
from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in afier me
again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and car-

ried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.

but myself - for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, a
any si 0 them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two
shoes at were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so far
elf--and considered, Lord. how was it possible I could get
on shore? '

Afier I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I be an to look round me to see what kind of a
place I was in, an what was next to he done; and I soon

ound my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful
deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shifi: me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see
any prospect before me, but that of erishing with hunger, or
being devoured by wild beasts: an that which wasparticu-
larly' afliicting to me, was, that I had no weapon, either to
hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend
myself against any other creature, that might desire to kill me
for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my
provision; and this threw me into such terrible agonies of
mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Ni ht
coming upon me, I-be an with a heavy heart, to consi er
what woul be my lot if ere were any ravenous beasts in that
country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their
rey.
p All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time,
was, to get up into a thick, bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny--
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night--
and consider the next day what death I should die, for as yet
I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlon from, the
shore, to see ' I could find any fresh water to drin , which 1
didto my great joy; and having drank, and put a little tobac-
co into my .mouth to (prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and
getting :8 into it, en eavored to place myself so as that, If I
shoul f asleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a shortnosmson censors,

nick, like a truncheon, for my. defence I took 11 my lodging;
and having been' excessively fatigued, I fell fast eep, and slept
as comfortabl'y as I believe, few could have done in my cot>>
dition' and ound myself the most refreshed with it that I
think ever was on such an occasion.

When I waked, it was broad. day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that. the sea did not rage and swell as before '
but that which surprised me most was, that the shi was lifled
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by e swelling
of the tide, and was driven u almost as far as the rock which
at first mentioned, where I ad been so bruised by the wave
dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to_stand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that at least might save some
necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my a artment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first ' g 1 found was the boat,-
which lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her I: , upon the
and, about two miles on my right hand. 'I walk as far as 1
could upon the shore to have got toher; but found a neck' or
inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about haif a
mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent

upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for
my present subsistence. '

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide
abbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile

)f the shi - and here I found a flesh renewm of my grief -
for I saw Evidently, that if we had kept on boardg,'we had. beer:

all safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and [had -

not been so miserable as to be lefi entirely destitute of all com-
fort and com any, as I now was. This forced tears from my
eyeSS_ ain; ut as there was little relief in that, I resolved, If
possib e, to get to the ship 5 so I gulled 011' my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity an took the water; but when
I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know-how
to get on board; for as she lay aground, and high out of the

water, there was nothing within my reach to by hold of. I
swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small ~
piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, han

own bly the fore-chains so low, as that with great difiiculty
got ho] of it, and by the he] of that rope ot into the fore-
castle of the shi . Here I ound that the s 31w" bulged,
and had a great eal of water in her hold; but at she lay so
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her
stern lay lifted u upon the bank, and her head low, almost to
the water. By t is means all her quarter was free, and all
that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what was
free: and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and being very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room, and fille my pockets with his-
cuit, and ate it as I went about other things, or I had no time
to lose. 1 also found some rum in the teat cabin, of which I
took a lar e dram, and which I had in eed need enough of to
spirit me or what was before me. Now I wanted nothing ut
a boat to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had, and this extremity roused my application: we had sev~
eral spare yards, and two or three lar e spars of wood, and a
spare top-mast or two in the ship: resolved to fall to work
with these and flung as many overboard as I could manage for
their weight, t ing every one with a rope, that they might not .
drive away. hen this was done, I went down the ship's
side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together
at both ends. as well as I could in the form of a raft, and lay-
ing two or three short pieces of plank upon them, crosswa s,
I ound I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not a le
to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light: so I went
to work, an with the.car nter's saw I cut a spare top-mast
.into three lengths, and ded them to m rafi, with a great
eal of labor and pains. But the bone 0 furnishinz mvaelf. -' , ' - >> nrv-vmwrmsv-'ss'ercrrrmmau

with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what 1 should
. have been able to have done upon another occasion. . .
M rafi was now strong enough to bear any reasonabk'
weig t. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon itifi-om the surf of the sea; but l
was not long considering this. I first laid all the dplanltsor
boards upon it that I could get, and having consi ered well
vhat I most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, which
I. had broken open and em tied, and lowered them down upon
my raft; these I filled wi provisions, vrz. bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five ieces of dried oats' flesh (which we
lived much upon), an a little remam er_ of European corn,
which had been laid-by for some fowls which we had brought
0 sea with us; but the fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat ther ; but, to my great disappoint-
ment, I found afterwards at_the rats had eaten or sporled it
all. As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging
to our skip 'r, in which were some cordial waters; an , in
all, about ve or six gallons of rack. These I. stowed by
themselves; them being no need to put them into the chests,
nor any room for them. WhileI was doin this I found the
tide began to flow, though very calm; and had the mortifi-
cation to see my coat, 'rt, and waistcoat, which 1 had left
on shore, upon the sand, swim away' as for my brooches,
which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in
them, and in stock' 8. However, this ut me upon rum-
agin for clot es, of w ich 1 found eno , but took no more
than wanted for present use, for 1 had 0 er things which my
eye was more u n; as, first, tools to work wi on shore;

and it was after on searching that 1 found the carpenter's '

chest, which was in eed a very useful oprize to me, and much
more valuable 'than a ship-lading of d would have been at

that time. I got it down to my r even whole as it was,
Without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what
It contained. .

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. Then

were two very ood fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these P secured first, with some powder-horns, and a .
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of owder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good; the third had taken water.
Those two I got to my rafi, with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should
get to shore with them, having nei er sail, oar, nor rudder;
and_the least cap-fun of wind would have overset all my nav-
ation. '
lgI had three encouragements: 1st, A smooth, calm sea:
2dlfly, The tide rising, and setting in to the shore: 3dly What
lit e wind there was, blew me towards the land. And thus,
having found two or three broken oars belongm to the boat,
and besides the tools which were in the chest, found two,
saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this cargc I ut to
sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, m rafi went very we , only
that I found it drive a little distant mm the lace where I had
landed before; by which I perceived that t ere was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
_ opening of the land and I found a strong! current of the tide
set into it; so I'guided my rafi as well I could, to get into
the middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran
aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at
the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped
off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water
I did my utmost, by setting in back against the chests, to kee
them in their places, but co (1 not thrust of the rafl with
my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in,
but. holdinz up the chests with all my might, I stood in that
manner near half an hour, in which time the risin of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and alit e after,
the water still rising, my raft floated ain, and I thrust her
off with the oar I had, into the channe , and then driving up
higher, 1 at lengh found myself in the mouth of a little river,
withde on bo sides, and a strong current or tide runningup.
I looked on both sides for a proper lace to get to shore, _or
was not willing to be driven too big up the river; hoping, in
time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to p ace
myself as near the coast as 1 could.

At length I spied a little cove on the rigIht shore of the creek
:0 which, with great pain and difficulty, guided my rafi, and
at last got 'so near, as that, reaching ground with my- oar, I
could thrust her directly in; but here 1 ad like to have dipped
all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty
steep, that is to say,' sloping there was no place to land, 'but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high,
and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cargo again. All that 1 could do was, to wait till the tide
was at' e highest, keegigig the raft with myoar like an anchor
tohold the side of it t to the shore,' near a flat piece 0*
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so
it did. As soon as I found water enough,--for my rafi drew
about a foot of water,--l thrust her upon, that flat piece of
ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two

token oars into the gfound; one on one side, near one end,
and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and lefi my rafi: and all my cargo
safe on shore.

My next work. was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to seem
them from whatever might happen. Where was, Iyet knew
not; whether on the continent, or on an island- whether in-
habrted, or not inhabited; whether in- danger of wild beasts,
or not. There was a hill,-not above a mile from me, which rose

uplevery steep and high,- and which seemed to overtop some
at r hills, which la as in a ridge from it, northward. 1 took
out one of the- fow in -pieces, and one of the pistols, and a
horn of powder; and t us armed, I travelled for discovery u
to the top of that hill; where alter 1 had, with greatlabor' an
difiiculty,tfiot up to the top, I saw my fate, to my great afflic-
tion, viz. at I was in an island, environed every way with
the sea, no land to be seen, exce t some rocks, which la a
great way off, and two small islan s, less than this, which ay
about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, '
of whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowl-
but knew not their kinds; neither, when I killed them, could
I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree,
on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first an that
had been fired there since the creation of the world: had no

sooner fired, but fiom all the parts of the wood there arow an

innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, makin a con-
fused screaming, and crying, every one according to ' usual
note; but not one of them of an kind that I knew. As for
the creature I killed, I took it to a kind of a hawk, its color
and beak resembling it, but had no talons or claws more than
common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to brin my cargo on shore, which took me up the
rest of that day: w at to do with myself at ni ht I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to ie down on the
rind, not knowing but some Wild beast might devour me;

t rough, as I afterwards found, there was re y no need for
those fears.

However, as well .as I could, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and
made a kind of a hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I
yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures, hke hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl. ' .
I now began to consider, that 1 might yet et a great many
thin out of the ship, which would. usef to me and par-
tic arly some of the riggin and sale, and such other things .
18 might come toland; and resolved to make anothervogage
on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I re-
solved to set all other things agar-t, till I got every thm'gout
of the ship that I could get. hen I called a council at is
to as , in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft;
but s appeared im racticable ' so I resolved to go as before
when the tide was own; and I did so, only that I .strrp
before I went from m hut; having nothin on but a- chec ed
shirt, a pair of linen rawers, and a pair 0 pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and repared a second
rail; and havin had experience of the st, I neither made
this so unwiel y, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me: as first, in the car.
penter's stores, I found two or three bags of nails and spikes,
a great screw-jack adozen or twoof hatchets; and, aboveall,
that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I as-
cured together, with several things, belonging to the gunner;
Earticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of mus-
et bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling- iece with
some small quantity of wder more; a large bag of small
shot, and a eat roll 0 sheet-lead; but this last was so heavy,
[ could not oist it up to get it over the ship's side. .
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could
find, and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and some bedding'
. and With this I loaded my second raft, and brought diam all
safe on shore, to my very great comfort. .
I was under some-apprehensions, duri my absence from
the land, that at least my revisions mi t be devoured on

only there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one ul' tie
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little dis-
tance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be ac uainted with me. I resented my un to her, but as
she di not understand it, s e was perfectIy unconcerne at
it, nor did she offer to stir away; 11 on which I tossed her a.
bit of biscuit, though, by the way, was not very free of it,
for my store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I say,
and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked (as
pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more: so she marched off.

Havinglgot my second cargo on shore--though I was fain
to open t e barrels of powder and brin them by parcels for
chK were too heavy, being large cas s--l went to work to
m e me a little tent, with the sail, and some ploles, which 1
cut for that purpose; and into this tent l broug t every thin
that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I pi]
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,
to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man or beast.
' When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end with-
out; and spreading one of the ds upon the ound, laying
my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at ength by me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very uietly all ni ht
for I was very weary and heavy; for the nig t before I Iiad

- slept little and had labored very hard all day, as well to fetch

all those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was
laid u , I believe, for one'man ;,but I was not satisfied still -
for w ile the ship sat upright in that 1posture, I thought I
ought to get every thing out of her that could; so every day,
at ow water, I went on board, and brought away something
or other; but particularly, the third time I went, I brought
away as much of the riggin as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I coul get, with a piece of spare can.

and brin as much at a time as I could; for they were no

such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work I could get- and having cut down the
spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yar , and every thing I could,
to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and
came away; but my fiood luck began now to leave me; for
Ibis raft was so unwie dy, and so overladen, that afier I was
entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not bein able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and t rew me and all my cargo into the water: as for
myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to
my cargo, it was a geat part of it loet, especially the iron, which .
I expected would ave been of great use to me: however,
when the tide was out, I tfiat most of the ieces of cable ashore,
and some of the iron, ough with ' nite labor; for I was
rain to dip for it into the water, a work which fati ed me
very much. After this I went every dav on board. an brought
away what I could get.

52 ROBINSON causes.

I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship; in which time I had brought away
all that one pair of hands could well be su posed capable to
briu ; though I believe verily, had the c in weather held, I
shouI havetbrought away the whole ship, iece by iece; but
pgeparing the twelfth time to go' on boar , I foun the Wind

gan to rise; however, at low water, I went on board' and
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually as
that nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and for s; in another -found about tliirt -six ounds
nice in money, some Euro can coin, some raz' , some
[neces of eight, some gold, an some silver.

l smiled to myself at the sight of this money: " 0 drug! "
said I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou art not worth
to me, no, not the takin off the ground: one of those knives
is worth all this heap :t have no manner'of use for thee; e'en
remain where thou al, and go to the bottom, as a creature
whose life is not worth savmg." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in a p.ece of
canvass, I began to think of makin another rafi; but while I
was preparing this, I found the s y overcast,and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in
vain to pretend to make a raft With the wind off shore; and
that it was my business tobe one before the tide of flood be-
gan, or otherwise 1. might not able to reach the shore at all

coordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam across
the channe' which lay between the ship and the sands, and
even that With difficulty enough partly with the-wei ht of the

_ artly the roughness of e water;
for t e Wind rose very has y, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm. .

But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all

my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that

r
night, and in the morning, when I looked out behold no more
ship was to be seen! I was a little surpri , but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no
time, nor abated no diligence, to et every thing outof her
that could be useful to me, and t at, indeed, there was lit-
tle left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had
more time. ' . '

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, hr of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore, from her
wreok' as, indeed, divers pieces of her aflerwards did; but
those things were of small use to me. .

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securin .
myself against either sav s, if an should appear, or wrl
beasts, if anfi were in the i and; an I had man thoughts of
the method ow to do this, and what kind of dwe ing to make,
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and
description of which- it may not be improper to give an ac-

I soon found the place I was in was ngt for my settlement,
particularly because it was i'llpon a low, moorish ground, near
. the sea, and I believed it wo d not be wholesome; and more

particularly because there was no fresh water near it;_so I
resolveid to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
groun .

I consulted several things in in situation, whichI found
would be pager for me: lst, He th and fresh water, I just
now mention : 2dly, Shelter from the heat of the sun: 8dly,
Securit from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts:
4th] , view to the sea, that 'if God sent any ship in sight, I .
nng t notlose any advant for my deliverance, of which I
was not Willing to banish my ex ectation yet.

Insearch for- aplace pro r for ' , I found alittle lain on
the side of a rising hill, w ose front towards this lit a lam
was steep as a house side, so that nothing could come own
upon me ti-om the top. On the side of this rock, there was a
hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door
of a cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the
rock, at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, !.
resolved to )itch my tent. This plain was not above a bun-
dred yards road, and about twice as lon", and lay like a green
before my door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly
every way down into the low round by the sea-side. It was
on the N .NJV. side of the hi] ; so that it was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or there-
abouts, Whlcli, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the ho]-
low place, which took in about ter. :ards in its semi-diameter
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its be-
giuuimr and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground about five feet
and a half, and sharpened on the to . The two rows did not
stand above six inches from one anot er.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the shi , and
laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and
a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong,
that neither man nor beast could get into it, or over it. This
cost me a great deal of time and labor, especially to cut the
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and dive them
Into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not b loor, but
by a. short ladder to go over the to ; which la der, when l
was in, I lifted over after me; and soil was com letely fenced
in and fortified, as I thought, from all the wor d, and conse-
quently slept secure in the night, which otherwis'. I could notCrusoe "fun; In his ladder.

have done; though, as it appeared afterwards there was no
need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended
danger from.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which
you have the account above; and I made a large tent, which,
to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with
a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all m provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; an havin thus inclosed all my
goods, I ma e up the entrance, which ti I now I had left open
and so passed and repassed as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my wa into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I ug down,
out, through my tent, I laid them up within m fence in the
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the groun within about
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to rant? house. It cost me
much labor and many days, before these things were
brought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of my thou hts. At the
same time it happened, after I had laid my sc eme for the
setting up my tent and making the cave, that a storm of rain
falling from a thic , dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning
hap ened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is nat-
ur y the effect of it. I was not so much sur rised with the
lightning, as I was with a thou lit, which dar into my mind
as swift as the lightning itself: I) my powder! M very heart
sunk Within me when I thought that at one b ast, all my
powder might be destroyed; on which, not my defence o ,

ut the provrding me food, as I thought, entirely depended.
l was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though,
had the powder took fire I had never known who had hurt me.'

Such im ression did this make upon me, that afier the storm
was over, laid aside all my works, my building and fortify-
ing, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate
the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a arcel, in
hope that whatever might come, it might not all e fire at
once; and to kee it so apart that it should not be posSible
to make one part re another. I finished this work in about a
fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about
240 lb. weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels.
As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
danger from that; so I laced it in my new cave, which in my
fancy, I called my kitc ien, and the rest I hid up and own in
holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doin , I went out at 0
least once every day with my gun, as well to 'vert myself, as
to see if I could kill any thing fit for food; and, as near as I
could, to acquaint myself With what the island roduced.
The first time I went out I presently discovered_ at there
were goats upon the island, w ich was a great satisfactionto
me; but then it-was attended with this misfortune to me, VIZ.
that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
it was the most difficult thin in the world to come at
them; but I was not discourage at this, not doubtin but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened; or after
I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for
them : 1 observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though they
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon
the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I conclu-
ded, that, by the position of their optics, their sight was so di-
rected downward, that they did not readil see objects that
were above them: so, afterwards. I took this method--I al-
rays climbed the rocks first,'tc get above them, and then had

frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made amon these
creatures, I killed a she- oat, which had a little kid y her,
which she gave suck to, w ich grieved me heartil ; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still b ' her, ' I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when carried the old one
with me, upon my shoulders the kid followed me quite to my
inclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid
in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in ho s to have
bred it up tame ; but it would not eat; so ] was orced to kill
it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
eat while, for I ate sparingly, and preserved in provisions
mfi bread especially) as much as possibly I coul . '
aving now fixed my habitation, I found it 'absolutely ne-
cessar to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn;
and w at I did for that, as also how I enlar ed my cave, and
what conveniences I made,l shall give a ull account of in
its pro er (place; but I must first give some little account of
mysel , an of my thoughts about living, which, it may well
be sup osed, were not a few.

I ha a dismal pros ct of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that is and without being driven, as is said, by
a violent storm, quite out of the course 0 our intended voy e,
and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues. out of e
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to consrder it as a determination of Heaven, that in this deso-
late place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.
The tears would run plentifully down my face, when I made
these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with my-
self why Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures,
and render them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned with
out help, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rationa.
to be thanka for such a life.

But something always returned swifi upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me; and articularly, one day,
walking With my gun in my hand, by t e sea-side, I was very
pensrve upon the subject of my' present condition, when rea-
son as it were, expostulated with me tne other way, thus>>.
" ell you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray
remember, where are the rest of you? Did not on come
eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten? _ h were
not they saved, and you lost? Why were you smgl out:
Is it better to be here or there? " And then I painted to_ the
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good thatis in
them, and with what worse attends them. ' -
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had
not ha pened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the
ship oated from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near to the shore, that 1 had time to get all these
things out of her; what would have been my case, if I had
been to have lived in the condition in which I at first came on
shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and
procure them? "Particularly," said I aloud (thong to my-
self), " what should I have done without a gun, Without ammu-
nition, without any tools to make any thing, or to workwith-g
without clothes, beddin , a tent, or any manner of covering? '
and that now I had all t ese to a sufficient quantity, and was
in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live
without my gun, when my ammunition was spent; so that I
had a tolerab e new of subsisting, without any want as long as
I lived; for I considered, from the beginning, how I should
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time
that was to come not only after my ammunition should he
spent, but even alier my health or strength should decay.
_ I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammuni-
tion being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so
surpnsmg to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I ob-
served just now. ' '
And now, bein toenter in to a melancholy relation ofa scene
of Silent life, suc , perhaps, as was never heard of in the World
before, 1 shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in It!

order. It was, by my account the 30th of September when,
an the manner as above said, I, first set my foot upon t is hor-
rid island; when the sun, being to us in its autumnal e uinox,
was almost just over my head; for I reckoned myself, y ob-
servation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north
of the Line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts that I should lose my reckonin of time for want
of books, and pen and ink, and should even orget the Sabbath
days from the working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it
into a eat cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed,
viz. " came on shore here on the 30th of Se tember, 1659.'
Upon the sides of this square post I out every ay a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as ong again as the
rest, and every first day of the month as long am as that
ion one; and thus I kept my calendar, or wee y, monthly,
an year! reckoning of time.

But it ap ened that among the many things which 1
brought out o the ship, in the several voyages which, as above
mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but
not at all less useful to me, which I found, some time after, in
rummaging the chests; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper;
several parcels in the captain s, mate's, gunner's, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical
instruments dials rs ctives, charts, and books of naviga-
tion; all which I ud ed together, whether 1 might want
them or no: also I found three very good Bibles, which came
to me in my cargo from England, an which 1 had packed up
among my thin 5; some Portuguese books also, and, among
them, two or ree p9 ish prayer books and several other
books, all which I care ull secured. And I must not forget,
that we had in the ship a 0g, and two cats, of whose eminent
history I may have occasion to say somethin , in its dplace;
for I carried both the cats with me; and as fonthe' 0g, he
.iumped out of the ship himself, and swam on shore to me the
day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was I, < r
trust servant to me. for many years: I wanted nothin that he
can] fetch me, nor any company that he could in e up-t'o
me; I only wanted to have him talk to me 5 but that would not
do. As I observed before, I found pen's, ink, and paper, and
I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show that while '
my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was
one I could not; for I coul not make any ink, by any means
at 1 could devise. ' _ ..
And this put me in mind that I wanted many thin not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and 0 these,
this of ink was one; as also a spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to
dig or remove the earth; needles, ins, and thread: as for
linen, I soon learned to want that W] outmuch difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did oon heavily;
and it was near awhole ear before I had entir y finished my
little pale, or surround my.habitation. The 'piles or stakes,
which were as heavy as'I could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in
brinfiing home; so that I 3 nt sometimes two days in cutting
and ringing home one of t ose posts, and a thir day in driv-
ing it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a hea piece
of wood at first, but at last bethou ht myself of one-of e_ iron
crows; which, however, though I ound it, yet it made driving
these posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. _But
what need I have been concerned at the tediousnesspf any
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enon h to do it in? nor
had any other employment, if that had een over, at least
that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for
food; which I did, more or less, every day.
' 1 now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and'I drew up the state of
my. affairs in writing, not so much to leave, them to any that
were to._come after me (for I was like to have but few heirs)
as todeliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to' 'maltet72

my despondency, l began to comfort myself as well as I could,
and to set the good against the evil, that I miirht have some
thing to distinguish my case from worse; and l .'tated very
impartially,like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed
against the miseries I suffered, thus :--

EVIL.

I am cast upon a horrible, deso-
late island, void of all hope of re-
covery.

I am singled out and separated,
as it were, from all the world, to
be miserable.

I am divided from mankind, a
solitaire; one banished from hu-
man society.

I have no clothes to cover me.

I am without any defence, or
means to resist any Violence of
man or beast.

l have no soul to speak to, or
relieve me.

Goon.

But I am alive ; and not drown
ed, as all my ship's company were

But I am singled out, too, from
all the ship's crew, to be spared
from death; and He that miracu-
lously saved me from death, can
deliver me from this condition.

But I am not starved, and :-
ishing in a barren place, afl'or ing
no sustenance.

But I am in a hot climate, where,
if I had clothes, I could hardly
wear them.

But I am east on an island
where I see no wild beast to hurt
me, as I saw on the coast of Af-
rica; and what if I had been ship-
wrecked there?

But God wonderfully sent the
ship in near enough to the shore
that I have got out so many neces-
sary things as will either supply
my wants, or enable me to supply
myself, even as long as I live.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that

there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction, from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world,
that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves
from, and to set, in the description of good and evil, of: tho
credit side of the account. _

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, 1 began to apply myself to ac-
commodate my way of living, and to make things as easy to
me as I could. -

I have alread described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side 0 a rock, surrounded with a strong ale of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, or I raised a
kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the out-
side; and after some time (I think it was a year and a half )
I raised rafters from it leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get,
to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of the year,
very Violent. _

I have already observed how I brou ht all my goods into
this ale, and into the cave which I Ead made behind me.
But Pmust observe, too, that at first this was a confused hea
of goods, which as they lay in no order, so they took 11
my place: I had no room to turn myself: so I set myse f to
enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it was
a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I be-
stowed on it; and when I found I was pretty safe as to the
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand, into the
rock, and then, turning to the right again, worked quite out,
and made me a door to come out In the outside of my pale or
fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back-
"ay to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to
slow my goods.

And now I began' to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, articularly a chair and a
table for,without these I was not ab e to enjoy the few comforts
I had in the world' I could not. write, or eat, or do several

things with so much pleasure, without a Iable' soI went to

,,
.L'L.' sku.lm~u1._-.... i >>.
work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason is the
substance and original of the mathematics, so, by stating and
squaring every thin by reason, and by making the mostra-
tional judgment of t ings every man ma be, in time, master
of every mechanic art. I had never han ed a tool in my life deg
and yet, in time, b labor application, and contrivance,
found, at last that wanted nothing but I could have made
especially if f had had tools. However, I made abundance 0
thin 5, even without tools; and some with no more tools than
an a ze and a hatchet, which erha s were never made that
way before, and that with in ite abor. For example, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with
my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then
club It smooth with my adze. It is true, b this method I
could make but one board of a whole tree; ut this I had no
remed for but atience any more than I had for a prodigious
deal 0 time an labor which it took me up to make a plank or
board; but m time or labor was little worth, and so it was as
well employe one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place; and this 1 did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my rafi from the ship. But when
I wrought out some boards as above, I made large shelves, of
the breadth of a foot and a alf, one over another, all alon one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-wor on;
and, in a word, to separate every thin at large in their places,
that I might easily come at them. Iinocked pieces into the
wall of the rock, to hang my guns; and all things that would
hang up; so that had my cave been seen, it looked like a en-
eral magazine of all necessary things; and I had every ing-
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of eve
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too muc
hurry, and not onl hurry as to labor, but in much-discompo-
sure of mind: an my journal would, too, have been fullof
many dull things; for example, I must 4 have said thus--
" Scpt. 30th. After I had got to shore, and had escaped drown-
ing, instead of being thankful toGod for my deliverance, having
first vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which was
gotten into my stomach, and recovering in self a little, I ran
about the shore, wringing my hands, an beating my head
and face, exclaimin at my misery, and cr ing out 'I was
undone, undone l ' ' , tired and faint, [was orced to lie down
on the. ground to repose, but durst not sleep, for fear of being
devoured",

Some days after this and after I had been on board the
ship, and got all that foould out'of her, I could not forbear-
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to
sea, in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy that,- at a vast dis-
tance I spied a sail, please myself With the hopes of it, and
after lookln steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and
git (low? find weep like a child, and thus increase my misery

But haviiig gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my householdastufi' and habitation, made me a

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food.
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair
of any relief, saw nothing but death be ore me ; that I should
either be devoured by Wlld beasts, murdered by savages, or
starved to death for want of food. At the agproach of night I
slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; ut slept soundly,
though it rained all night. .

October 1. In the morning]! saw, to my great surprise the
ship had floated with the big tide, and was driven on s ore
again much nearer the island; which, as it was some comfort
on one hand (for seeing her sit upright and not broken in
pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, and
get some food and necessaries out of her for mfy relief), so on
the other hand, it renewed m grief at the 10550 my comrades.
who, I ima ined, if we ha all staid on board, might have
saved the s i , or, at least, that they would not have been all
drowned, as t ey were; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. 1
s at great part of this day in erplexing myself on these
tjings; but, at length, seeing the s lip almost dry I went u n
the sand as near as 1 could, and then swam on board. his
dag; also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.

mm the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days entirely
spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of the
8 1p; which I brought on shore, everz tide of flood, upon rafts.
Much rain also in t ese days, thoug with some Intervals of
fair weather deg but it seems this was the rainy season.

. Oct. 20. l overset my raft, and all the oods I had got upon
It ;. but being in shoal water, and the t in 5 being chiefly
heavy, I recovered man of them when the ti e was out.

.Oct. '25._ it rained ni ht and all day, with some usts of
Wind; during which time e shi broke in pieces( e wind
blowmg a little harder than be ore), and was no more to be
<<ten. except the wreck of her, and the? only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I ha<<
saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26. Iwalked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a lace to fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure
myml?from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or
men. Towards night I fixed upon a rcper place, under a
rock, and marked out a semicircle or my encampment;
which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica-
tion, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and With
out with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carr 'ing
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part 0 the
time It rained exceedingly hard.

The 3lst, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country;
when I killed a she-<<oat, and her kid followed me home, which
1 afterwards killed ' so, because it would not feed.

November 1. I set u my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night; ma ing it as large as 1 could, with stakes
driven in to swmg my hammock upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts; and with them formed a fence
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my
fortification.

Nov. 3. 1 went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food; In the afternoon I went
to work to make me a table.

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun time of sleep, and time of diver-
Sion; vrz. every morning I'walked out With my gun for two
or three hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself
to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I had to live
on; and from twelve to twol lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive but; and then, in the evening, to work again.
The working part of this day and the next was wholly em-
ployed in making my table, for l was yet but I vovv sorry
workmn. , though time and necessity made me a complete
uaturlal mechanic soon after,.as I believe they would any
one e se.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my un and dog, and
killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but er flesh good for
nothing: of every creature that killed I took of the skins,
and preserved them. Comin back by the sea-shore, 1 saw
many sorts of sea-fowl which did not understand; but was
surprised and almost frightened, with two or three seals;
which, while I was glazing at them (not well knowrng what
they were), ot intot e sea, and esca ed me for that time.

Nov. 6. filter my morning walk, went to work with my
table afiin, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was
it long fore I learned to mend It.

Nov. '7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday,
according to my reckoning , I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and with much ado, rought it to a tolerable shape, but
never to please me; and, even in the making, I pulled it in
pieces several times. .

Note. I soon neglected my kee ing Sundays; for, omitting
my mark for them on my post I orgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceed
ingily, and cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with ter-
rib e thunder and li htning, which frightened me dreadfully,
for fear of my pow er. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hol about a pound, or
twolpounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder
m, stowed it in places as secure and as remote from one
another as possible. On one of these three da s I killed a
.ar e bll'd that was good to eat; but I knew not w rat to call it.
' av. 17. This da I began to dig behind my tent, into the
rock to make room or my farther convenience.

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work.
viz. a ickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; sol
desiste from m work, and began to consider how to supply
these wants, an make me some tools. As for a pickaxe, I
made use of the iron crows, which were proper enou 11, though
heav ; but the next thing was a shove or s ade; fins was so
abso utely necessary, that, indeed I could 0 nothing effect>>
u111 without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

00. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a
tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazfls, they call
the iron tree, from its exceeding hardness: of this, with great
labor, and almOSt spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought
it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my havin
no other way, made me a lon while upon this machine; for
worked it effectually, b lit e and little, into the form of a
shovel or s ade ; the ban le exactly shaped like ours in England,
only that t e broad part havin no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long: owever, it served well enough
for the uses which 1 had occasion to put it to; but never
was a shovel,I believe, made after that fashion, or solong
a-making.

I was still deficient; for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbar-
row. A basket I could not make by any means, having no
such things as twi s that would bend to make Wicker ware-
at least none yet ound out; and as to the wheelbarrow, I
fancied I could make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion
of; neither did I know how to go about it: besides, I had no
possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of
the wheel to run in: so I gave it over: and, for carrying away
the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like
a hod, which the laborers carry mortar in for the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel; and
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days;
I mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun

O
which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing
home something fit to eat.

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because of
my making these tools, when they were finished I went on"
and, working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.

Nate. During all this tune, I worked to make this room, or
cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or
magazme, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a
lodging, I kept to the tent; except that, sometimes, in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep my-
self dry; which caused me afterwards to cover all mp place
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, eaning
wrainst the rock, and loaded them with flags and largeleaves
oftrees, like a thatch.

December 10. I be an now to think my cave or vault fin-
ished'; when on a sud en it seems I had made it too large a
great quantity of earth fel down from the top and one si e;
so much, that, in short, it frightened me, and not without rea-i'
son too; for if I had been under it, I should never have want-
ed a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of
work to do over a rain, for I had the loose earth to carry out;
and, which was olmore importance, I had the ceiling to prop,
up so that I might be sure no more would come down.

bee. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of board across over each post: this I finished the next
day ; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a. week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows.
served me for partitions to part oil' my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts, to hang every thing up that
could be hung up: and now I began to be in some 1rder
within doors.

Dar. 2'). I carried every thing into the cave, and began to

furnish my house, and set up some ieces of boards, like a
dresser to order my victuals u on; but boards began to be
ver scarce with me: also I ma e me another table.

gee. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.

Dec. 25. Rain all day.

Dec. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanler.

Dar. 2?. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that
I catched it, and led it home in a string: when I had it home,
I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever; but, by nursingr it so long, it 0'rew
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not
go away. This was the first time that l entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food :
this time I spent in putting all my things in order wrthin doors.

January 1. Very hot still; but 1 went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the
centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to
try if I could not brin my dog to hunt them down. Accord-
ingly, the next dag? went out with my dog, and set him
upon the oats: but I was mistaken, for they all faced about
upon the 0g; and he knew his danger too well, for he would
not come near them.

Jan. 3. I began m fence or wall; which being still jealous
of my being attacke by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal : it is sufficient to observe, that l
was _no less time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall: though itCrusoe feeding his tune Goat.
was no more than about 25 yards in length, being a hall; :ircle,

from one place in the rock to another place, about twelve

ards lrom it, the door of the cave being in the centre,
hind it.

All this time I worked very hard; the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together: but I thou htI
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finisied;
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labor every thing
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground ; for I made them much big-
ger than I needet to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced,
with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself thai
if any people were to come on shore there, they would not er-
ceive any thing like a habitation; and it was very well . did
so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion. '

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for gait"
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made fre uer
discoveries, in these walks of something or other to my a van:-
tage; particularly, I found a kind of Wild pi eons, who built;
not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather asiouse-pigeons, in
the holes of the rocks: and, taking some young ones, I en-
deavored to breed them up tame, and did so: but when they

ew older they flew all away; which, perhaps, was at first
or want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them : how-
ever I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were very good meat. And ,now, In the managing my
household affairs, 1 found myself wanting in many things
which I thought at first it was impossible for rm to make , ai
indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance . could never
make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as l
observed before; but I could never arrive to the capacity of

could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true to one
another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also'ovort, _. , .'-----,,--v.v:, --.,r:--m-0WTK'=W"'1W"W""5"":5 \ "l- "J i'

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that as
soon as it was dark, which was generalldy; by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. Iremember ea lump of bees-wax
with whrchI made candles in my African adventure; butI
had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when
I had killed a goaL ' saved the tallow; and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added-a'
wick of some oakum I made me a lam ; and this gave me
light, though not a clear, steady light, li e a candle. .In the
middle of all my labors it happened, that, in rummaging my
things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted before, had
been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry; not for the
voyage, but before, as I sup ose, when the ship came from
Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been in the bag
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag
but husks and dust; and being willing to have the 'b for
some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when di-
nded it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook
the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification,
under the rock. -

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that ,
[threw this stufl' away; taking no notice of any thing, and ,
not so much as remembering that I had thrown any ' '
there; when about a month after I saw some few stalks
something green shootin out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I ha not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green
Barley, of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English

ar ey.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto acted upon
no re igious foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions of
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any
thin that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as
we ghtly say, what pleases God; without so much as in-
quiring mto t' .e end of Providence in these things, or his order
in governing. events in the world. But after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not roper for corn and
especially as I knew not how it came t ere, it startle me
strangely; and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to row wit out any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directe purely for my sustenance, on that wild,
miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brou ht bears out of my
eyes; and I began to bless myself that suc a prodig of na-
ture should happen upon my account: and this was t e more
strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side
of the rock, some other stragglin stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, cause I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure roductions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubtln t at there was more in the

lace, I went over all that part 0 the island where I had been
fore, searchin in every corner, and under every rock, for
more of it; but could not find any. At last it occurred to my
thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's-meat in that
place, and then the wonder be an to cease ; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to od's rovidence began to abate
too, upon the discovering that all t is was nothing but what
was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been mirac-
ulous; for it was really the work of Providence, asto me that
should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if
it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw
it out in that particular place, where, it being in the shade
of a high we , it sprang up immediately; w ereas, if I had
thrown it any where else, at that time, it would have been
burnt up and destro ed.

I carefully saved e ears of this corn, you may be sure, in

their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying upw .5. Mr, M" raw-r "(KV'W=FV"II[WW" "TWVVW'M'WWE'W

every corn, I resolved to sow them all again; hoping, in time,
to have some quantity sufficient to an ply me With bread.
oBut it was not till the fourth year that could allow myself
the least rain of this corn toeat, and even then, but sparingly
as I shallgshow afierwards, in its order; for I lost all that I
sowed the first season, by not observin the proper time; as I
sowed just before the .dry season, so at it never came up at
all at least not as it would have done; of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care; and
whose use was of the same kind or to the same purpose, viz.
to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it
up without baking, though I did that also after some time.--
But to return to my journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get
my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up; contriv-
ing to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder,
that there might be no sign on the outside of my ha itation.

April 16. I finished the ladder 5 so I went up with the
ladder to the top and then pulled it up after me, and let it
down in the inst e: this was a complete inclosure to me; for
within I had room enough and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very nen day after this wall was finished, I had almost
all my labor overthrown at once, and myself killed: the case
was thus :--As I was busy in the inside of it, behind in tent
just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribl fi-' tened
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; or, on a
sudden, I found the earth come crumb in down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the h' 1 over my head, and
two of the ]posts 1 had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful
manner. was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what
really was the cause, only thinkinv that the top of my cave was
falling in, as some of it had done before ' and for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking
myself safe there neither. I got over my wall for fear of the58 ltulslNSuN sztt's'ut':

ieces of the hill which I expected might roll down u on me.
fhad no sooner stepped down upon the firm groun , than!
plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground 10
stood on shook three times at about eight mmutes' distance,
with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth;
and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half
a mile from me, next the sea, fell down with such a terrible
noise as I never heard in all my life. I erceived also, that
the very sea was put into a violent motion y it; and I believe
the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.

1 was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never
felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had), that l was
like one dead or stupeficd; and the motion of the earth made
my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea: but the noise
of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rousing
me from the stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought 01 nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and
my household goods, and burying all at once: this sunk my,
very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take coura re; yet 1 had not heart enough to
go over my wall again, for ear of being buried alive but sat
still upon the ground, greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not
knowmg what to do. All this while, I had not the least serious
religious thought; nothing but the common Lord, have mercy
upon me! a when it was over, that went away too.

While 1 : thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy
as if it won d rain; and soon after the wind rose by little am
little, so th t in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea vas, all on a sudden, covered with foam
and froth; the shore was covered with a breach of the water;
the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it
was. _ This held about three hours, and then be an to abate;
and in two hours more it was quite calm, and gan to rain
very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very muchr. - ._. -- mph--mwxwvvmW-mvwrmw'mem

terrified and dejected; when, on_a sudden, it came' mto my
thoughts, that these winds and rain bemg the consequence of
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was's nt and over, and
[might venture into my cave again. Wit this thought my
spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade
me I went in, and sat down in my tent; but the ram was so
vio eat, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it;
and I was forced to get into my cave though ver much
afraid and uneas , for fear it should fall on my be . This
violent rain force me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole through
my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water 0 out,
which would else have drowned my cave. After I h been
in my cave for some time, and found no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now
to support my spirits, which, indeed, wanted it very much, I
went to m little store, and took a small sup of rum; which
however, did then, and always, very sqaringly,' knowingI
could have no more when that was gone. t continued ramm
all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I coul
not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed I began
to think of what I had best do; concluding, that if the island
was subject to these earthquakes there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me some ttle
hut in an oien place, which I might surroun with a wall, as
I had done ere, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men; for if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my t frOm the
place where it now stood being 'ust under the hanging preci-
pice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken ain, would
certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the two next age being
the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where an how ,to
remove my habitation. The fear of being swallowed alive
affected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the appre-
hensxon of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost equal

to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw how every thing ,

8

was ut' in order, how pleasantly l was concealed, and how
safe om danger, it made me very 10th to remove. In the
mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal
of time for me to do this; and that I must be contented to run
the risk where l was, till I had formed a convenient cam , and
secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion com-
posed myself for a time ; and resolved that 1 would go to work
with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c., in
a circle, as before, and set up my tent in it when it was fin-
ished; but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was
ready and fit to remove to. This was the 2lst.

April 22. The next morning, I be an to consider of means
to put this measure into execution; ut I was at a reat loss
about the tools. I had three lar e axes, and abun ance of
hatchets (for we carried the hate ets' for traffic with the In-
dians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty, hard wood,
they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This
caused me as much thought as a statesman would have be-
stowed upon a rand point of politics, or a judge upon the
life and death ofg a man. At length I contrived a wheel with
a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty.

Note. I had never seen any such thin!Ir in England, or, at
least, not to take notice how it was done; though Since, I have
observed it i very common there: besides that, my rindstone
was very l and heavy. This machine cost me a ull week's
work to bring it to erfection.

April 28, 29. T iese two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had been low a
great while, 1 now too a survey of it, and reduced myself t(
one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.

M'ay 1. 1n the morning, looking toward the sea-side, the

. tide being low, I saw something he on the shore bigger thar
ordinary, and it looked like a cask: when I came to it I found
a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
shi ,which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and
loo mg towards the wreck itself, I thou ht it seemed to he
higher out of the water than it used to o. I exammed the
barrel that was driven on shore, and soon found It was a barrel
of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was
caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled 1t farther on the
shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as
I could to the wreck of the ship,to look for more.

When I came down to the ship I found it strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand was
heaved up at least six feet; and the stern (which was broke to
pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force of the sea, soon
after I had left rummaging of her was tossed, as It were, up,
and cast on one side; and the san was thrown so high on that
side next her stern, that I could now walk quite up. to her
when the tide was dirt; whereas there was a great piece of
water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a
mile of the wreck without swimming. 1 was surprised wrth
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earth-
(wake; and as by this violence the ship was more broke open
t an formerly, so man ' thin 5 came daily on shore, which the
sea had loosened, an whic the winds and water rolled by
de rees to the land.

the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected 0 thin kind,
for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand.' How-
ever, as I had learned not to despair of an ' thin , I resolved
to pull every thing to ieces that I could o the s i conclu-
ding that every thing .could get from her would be 0 some use
or other to me.

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which thought held some of the upper part or quar-

ter-deck together; and when I had cut it through I cleared
away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay high
est; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for
that time.

IlIay 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that l
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, 'ust going to
leave all, I caught a young dolphin. I had ma e me along
line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks: yet I frequentl
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which
dried in the sun and ate them dry.

JlIay 5. Worked on the wreck ; out another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir-planks off from the decks; which
I tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of flood
came on. '

llIay 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked ver hard,
and came home very much tired, and had thoughts 0 giving
it over. '

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to
work; but found the weight 0 the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams bein cut; that several ieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose; an the inside of the ho d lay so open that
I could see into it; but almost full of water and sand.

llIay 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
and sand. wrenched u two planks, and brought them on
shore also the tide. left the iron crow in the wreck for
next day.

May 9. Went to the wreck and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt
also a roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it was too
heavy to remove.

May 10--14. Went every day to the wreck; and ot a
great many (pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, an two
or three hun red weight of iron.
May 15 I carried two hatchets, to try if 1 could not cut a
piece of the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and _a
half in the water,l could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.

M 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck ap-
ear more broken by the force of the water; but I_staid so
ong in the woods, to get pi eons for food, that the tide pre-

vented my going to the wrec that day.

Illa-y 17. 1 saw some ieces of the wreck blown on shore at
a great distance, two 111 es 011' me, but resolved to see what
they were and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy
for me to brin away. .

May 24. very da , to this day, I worked on the wreck;
and with hard labor I oosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first blowing tide, several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chestS' but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the
salt-water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work
ever day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to
get ood; which I always appointed, during this part of my
emplo ment, to be when the tide was up, that I mig the ready
when was ebbed out; and by this time I had gotten timber,
and plank, and iron-work, enough to have built a good boat,
If I had known how; and I also got, at several times, and in
several pieces, near one hundred weight of the t-lead.

torse, or turtle. his was the first I had seen; which, it
seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place or
scarcity; for hadI happened to be on the other side of the
island, I might have ha hundreds of them every day, as 1
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

June 17 I spent in cookm the turtle. I- found in her

exceeding thirsty: however, asl had no water in my whole
habitation, i was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleerli
again. In this second sleep, I had this terrible dream:

thought that 1 was sittin on the ground, on the outside of my
wall, where I sat when he storm blew after the earth uake,
and that I saw a man descend from a Treat black clou , in a
bright flame of fire, and light u on t e ground: he was all
over as bright as a flame, so that could but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dread-
ful, impossible for words to describe 2 when he stepped upon
the ground with his feet, I thought the earth tremb ed, just as
it had done before in the earth mike; and all the air looked,
to my apprehension, as if it had een filled with flashes of fire.
He had no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved for-
ward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand to
kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some dis-
tance, he spoke to me, or I heard a votce so terrible that it is
im ossible to express the terror of it: all that I can say 1
un erstood, was this: " Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at which
1:41)de I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to

1 me.

No one that shall ever read this account, will ex ect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at t is terrible
vision; I mean that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by
the good instruction of my father, was then worn out, by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with none but such as were, like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. Ido not re-
member that 1 had, in all that time, one thought that so much
as tended either to looking upward towards God, or inward
towards a reflection upon my mvn ways: but a certain stu-
ndity of soul, without desire of good, or consciousness of st i1,

ad entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that the most
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature, amon our common
sailors, can be supposed to be; not having e least sense,
either of the fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to him,
in deliverances.

1n the relatin what is alreadly East of my stor , this will be
the more easily Eelieved, when s all add, that ough all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me I never
had so much as one thought of its being the hand of, God, or
that it was a just punishment for my sin; either my rebellious
behavior against my father, or my resent sins, which were
great; or even as a unishment for t e general course of my
wicked life. When was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought
of what would become of me ; or one wish to God to direct me
whither I should 0 or to keep me from the danger which ap-
parently surroun ed me, as well from voracious creatures, as
cruel savages : but I was uite thoughtless of a God or a Prov-
idence; acted like a mere rute, from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates of common sense only; and, indeed,
uardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea, by
the Portuguese captain, well used and dealt with justly and
honorably, as well as charitably, had not the least thankful-
ness in m thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked,
mind, an in danger of drowning, on this island I was as far
from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment: I only said to
myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be
always miserable.

It IS true, when I first ot on shore here, and found all m
ship's creu drowned, ant? myself spared, l was surprised w:
a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God asststed might have come up to true thankful-
ness; but it ended where it began, in a mere common fli ht
of joy; or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without
least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand

served when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why
Providence had been thus merciful to me; just the same com'
mon sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are
at safe ashore from a shipwreck - which they drown all in
t e next bowl of punch, and forget most as soon as it is over;
and all the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was, af-
terwards, on due consrderation, made sensible of my condition
--how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of
human kind, out of all .hope of relief, or prospect of redemp-
tion,---as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and thatl
should not starve and )erish for hunger, all the sense of my
affliction wore off, and began to be very easy, applied In 'self
to the works pro er for my preservation and supply, an was
far enough from ing afflicted at my condition, as a judgment
from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were
thoughts which very seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had,
at first, some little influence u on me, and began to afi'ect me
with seriousness, as long as I t ought it had something mirac-
ulous in it; but as soon as that part of the thought was re-
moved, all the impression which was raised from it wore off
also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake, though
nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more imme-
diately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs
such thin 8, yet no sooner was the fri ht over, but the impres-
sion it ha made went of? also. I ha no more sense of God,
or his judgments, much less of the present affliction of my cir-
cumstances being from his hand, than if 1 had been in the
most rosperous condition of life. But now, when I began to
ne sic_ , and a leisure view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under
the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted
With the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, be an to awake; and I reproached myself with my past
life, in w ch I had so evxdently, by uncommon wickedness,
provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes,
and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflec:
tions oppressed me for the second or third day of my distem-
per; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful
reproaches of my conscience extorted from me some words
like praying to God; though l cannot say it was a prayer at-
tended either with desires or with hopes; it was rather the
voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were con-
fused; the convictions great upon my mind; and the horror
of (1 ing in such a miserable condition raised vapors in my
heady with the more apprehension; and in these hurries of my
soul, [ knew not what my ton ue mi ht express; but it was
rather exclamation, such as, "land w at a miserable cleature
am 1! ll' 1 should be sick, 1 shall certainly die for want of
help; and what will become of me?" Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and 1 could say no more for a good while. In
this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the be ' -
ning of this story, viz. that if I did take this foolish step, od
would not bless me; and I should have leisure hereafier to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I, aloud,
" my dear father's words are come to pass; God's justice has
overtaken me, and l have none to help or hear me. 1 rejected
the mice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a sta-
tion of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but 1
Would neither see it myself nor learn from my parents to know

now I am left to mourn under the conse uences of It: I refused
their help and assistance, who would (have pushed me in the
world, and would have made every thing easy to me; and now
l have difficulties to struggle with, too great for 'even nature
Itself to sup ort; and no assistance, no comfort, no adnce."
Then I crie out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in great dis-
!ress." This was the first rayer, if 1 may call ittso, thinl
had made for many years. ut I return to my journal

had had, and the t being entirely of, I got up; and though
the fri ht and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con
sider that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was in time to get something to_ refresh and
sup tt myself when should be ill. The first thing I did was
to a large square case-bottle with water, and set it u on
my table, in reach of my bed' and to take off the chi or
a uish disposition of the water, I put about a uarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together. hen [got me a
piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could
eat very little. I walked about; but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable
condition, dreading the return of my distem er the next day.
At night, I made my supper of three of tie turtle's eggs;
which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell;
and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's bless-
ing to, as I could remember, in my whole life. After I had
eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself so weak, that I could
hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that); so 1
went but a ittle way, and sat down u on the ground, looking
out upon the sea which was just be ore me, and very calm
and smooth. As l sat here, some such thoughts as these oc-
curred tn me: " What is this earth and sea, of which I have
seen so much? Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal"!
Whence are we? Surely, we are all made by some secret
Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sk . And
who is that?" Then it followed most naturally, " t is God
that has made all--Well, but then," it came on strangely, " it
God has made all these things, he guides and overns them all
and all things that concern them; for the ower that could
make all things, must certainly have power to guide and di-
rect them: if so, nothing can hap en in the great circuit of
his works, either without his know ed e or ap ointment.

that 1 am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if '

nothing ha pens without his. appointment, he has appointed
all this to fall me." Nothing occurred to my thought, to
contradict any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greatest force, that it must needs be that
God had ap ointed all this to befall me; that I was brought to
this misera le circumstance by his direction, he having the
sole power, not of me only, but of everY=vthing that ha pens in
the world. Immediately it follbwed, " hy '
to me '1 What have I done to be thus used?" Mb conscience
presently checked me in that inquiry, as if Iliad lasphemed;
and methought it 3 he to me like a voice,--"Wretch! dost
thou ask what thou ast done? Look back upon a dreadful
misspent life, and ask thyself wha't thou hast not done. Ask,
why is it that thou wert not lon ago destroyed? Why wert
thou not drowned in Yarmoutfi Roads; lulled in the~fight
when the shi was taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured
by the wild asts on the coast of Afi-ica' or drowned here.
when all the crew perished but th self? fiost thou ask what
thou hast done'l " I was struck umb with these reflections,
as one astonished, and had not a word to say; no, not to an-
swer to myself; and rising up pensive and sad, walked back
to my retreat, and went over my wall, as if I had been gomg
to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no
Inclination to sleep; so I sat down in the chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the apirehension of
the return of my distemper terrified me very muc , it occurred
to my thought, that the Brazilians take no physic but then
tobacco for almost all distempers; and 1 had a piece of a rol
of tobacco in one of the chests, which was uite cured; and
some also that was reen and not quite cur . _ .

I went, directed %)y IIeaven no doubt; for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul antibody. I opened the chest, and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the_ few
books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles

found leisure, or so much as inclination to look into. I say
I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me
to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, nor whether it was 0'ood for it or not; but 1
tried several experiments with it, as ifl was resolved it should
hit one way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed
it in my mouth; which, indeed, at first, almost stupefied my
brain; the tobacco being teen and strong, and suc as I had
not been much used to. ' hen I took some and stee ed it an
hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a ose of' it
when I lay down: and lastly, I burnt some u on a pan of
coals and held my nose close over the smoke o it as long as I
could bear it; as well for the heat, as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and be-
gan to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having
opened the book casualIy, the first words that occurred to me
were these: "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
liver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These words were very
apt to my case, and made some impression upon my thoughts
at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did
afterwards; for, as for bein delivered, the word had no sound,
as I may say, to me; the t ing was so remote so impossible
in my apprehension of things, that, as the children of Israel
said when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a
table in the wilderness? " so I began to say, " Can even God
himself deliver me from this place?" And as it was not for
many years that any hopes ap eared, this prevailed very
often upon my thoughts: but, owever, the words made 8
eat impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often.

t now grew late; and the tobacco had, as I said dozed my
head_ so much, that I inclined to sleep: so I is my lamp
burning in the cave, lest I should want any thin in the night,
and went to bed. But before I lay down, I di what 1 never
had done in all my life; I kneeled down, and rayed to God
to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon 'm in the day
of trouble, he would deliver me. After in broken and . mperfect
prayer was over, I drank the--rum in w 'ch I had steeped the
tr bacco- which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that

indeed, l could scarce get it down: immediately upon this I.
went to bed. I found presently the rum flew up into my head

violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, ,

till, by the sun, it must necessaril .be near three o'clock in the

afternoon the next day: nay, to t 5 hour I am partly of opin-
ion, that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise, I know not how I should
[cse a da out of my reckoning in the da 5 of the week, as it
appeare , some years after, I ad done; or if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than
one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never
knew which way. Be that, however, one wa or the other,

when I awaked, I found myself exceedingly re shed, and my .

spirits lively and cheerful: when I got up, I was stron r than
1 was the day before, and m stomach better, for l was ungry;
and, in short, I had no fit t e next day but continued much
altered for the better. This was the 29 .

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose and brought
them home; but was not very forward to eat em; so I ate
some more of the turtle's e gs, which were very g . This
evening I renewed the me icine, which I had supposed did
me good the da'y before, viz. the tobacco stee ed in rum; only
1 did not take so much as before, nor did chew any of the
leaf, or hold my head over the smoke: however I was not so
well the next day, which was the 1st of July as I hopedI
should have been; for I had a little of the cod fit, but it we:
...ot much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity

which I drank. .
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not

thus gathering stren , my thoughts ran exceedmglynpon
this scripture, " I w' deliver thee; " and the impossmihty of
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of any ever
expecting it: but as I was discouraging myself With such
thou hts, it occurred to my mind that l pored so much upon
in dgeliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the
deIi erance I had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask
myself such questions as these, viz. " Have I not been de-
livered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so fri htful to
me? and what notice have I taken of it'! Have I one my
part'! God has delivered me, but I have not glorified him;
that is to say, I have not owned and been thankful for that as
a deliverance; and how can I expect a eater deliverance? "
This touched my heart very much; an? immediately I knelt
down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickness.

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at
the New Testament, I be an seriously to read it; an imposed
upon myself to read aw rile every morning and every night;
not binding In self to the number of chapters, but as lon as
my thoughts stould engage me. It was not long afier lgsel
seriously to this work, that I found m ' heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wicke ness of my past hfe
The impression of my dream revived; and the words, "Al
these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran scri
ously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give
me re ntance, when it ha pened provrdentiall , the very
same . ay, that reading the cripture, I came to t xese words,
_" He ls_exalted a prince and a Savior; to ive re entance,
and to give remission." I threw down the boo ; an , with in
heart as well as my'hands lifted u to heaven, in a kind of'
ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, "gesus, thou Son of David
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Savior! give me repentance! "

sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I prayed with a
sense of my condition, and with a true Scri ture View of ho ,
founded on the encou ement of the wort? of God; and from
{his time, I may say, 1 gm to have hope that God would
near me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above," Call
on me, and will deliver thee," in a difl'erent sense from what
I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of andyething
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from cap-
tivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the
worst sense in the world. But now I learned to take it in
another sense; now I looked back upon my past life with such
horror, and lay sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothin of G but de iverance from the Idad of guilt that bore
down . 1 my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing '7
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or' think of
it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison with this.

My condition began now to be;though not less miserable as
to my wa of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my
thoughts ing directed, by constantly reading the Scripture
and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had _a great
deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of;
also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred me to:
furnish myself with every thing that l wanted, apd makenmy,

l'zrom the 4th of uly to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at
a time, as a man that was athenng up his strengthafier a fit
of sickness; for it is har y to be imagined how low I was;

I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never
cured an ague before; neither can I recommend -it to any one
to practise, by this experiment; and though it did carrly off
the fit, yet it ,rather contributed to weakening me; for had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time: I
learned from it, also, this, in particular; that being abroad in
the rain season, was the most pernicious thing to my health
that con d be, especially in those rains which came attended
with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which
came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with
such storms, so I found that this rain was much more danger-
ous than the rain which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months;
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from ine; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had 'ever set foot u on that place. Having secured my
habitation, as I thought, frilly to my mind, I had a great desire
to make a more perfect discovery of the island and to see
what other productions I might find, which I yet knew
nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more ar-
ticular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek fii'st,
where, as I hinted, I brought my rafis on shore. I found, after
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, very fresh and good: but this being the dry season,
there was hardly any water in some parts of it' at east not
any stream. On the banks of this brook I found many leas-
ant savannahs or meadows, plain smooth, and coveredp with
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher

rounds {where the water, as it might be supposed, never over-
owed), found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growin to
a very great and strong stalk; and there were divers ot er
plants, which I had no nowledge of, or understanding about
and that mi ht, perhaps, have virtues of their own, whichI
could not fin. out. I searched for the cassava root. which the

could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but di not un-
aerstand them. .-I saw several su ar-canes, but wild; and for
want of cultivation, imperfect. contented myself with sea
discoveries for this time; and came back, musing with myself
what course I might take to know the virtue an goodness of
any ofthe fruits or lants which'I should discover; but could
bring it to no conc usion; for in short, I had made solittle
observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the
plants in the field; at least, very little that mightserve me to
any purpose now in my distress. '

' he next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and
after going something farther than had gone the day before,
[ found the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, and the 2'
countr become more woody than before. In this part I
found ifi'erent fruits; and articularly I found melons upon
the ground, in rest abun ance, and grapes upon the trees:
the vines, inde , had spread over the trees, and the clusters
of grapes were now just in their prime, very ripe and =rich..
Tlus was a surprising discovery, and I was exce ' 1y. glad
of them, but I was warned by my experience to eat anngly
of them; rememberinE that when I was ashore in arbar ,.
the eating of grapes illcd several of _our Englishmen w 0
were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and evers.
I found, however, an excellent use for these gra s; and that
was, to cure or dry them in the sun and keep em as dried.
Era s or raisins are kept; which I thought would be (as m-

e they were) as wholesome and as agreeable to eat, when:
no grapes were tobe had. -

I spent all that evening there, and went not back tolmy
habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might
say, I had lain from home. At night, I took my first contri-
vance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well; and the next

north. with a ridge of hills on the south and north si es of mar
At the end of this march 1 came to an o ning, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; an a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant
verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked ike a planted
garden. I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale,
surveyin it with a secret kind of leasure (though mixed with
other cting thou hts): to thin that this was all m own'
that I was kin and ord of all this country indefensib y, and
had a right 0 possession; and, if I could convey it, I might
have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, and orange,
lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, and very few bearin any
link; at least, not then. However, the green limes t at I
gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
and 1 mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it
ver wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found nowI
h business enough to lgather and carry home ' and I resolved
to lay u store as we of grapes as limes an lemons, to fur-
nish myse f for the wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place
a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes an
melons in another ghee ; and, taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homewar ; and resolved to come again, and bring a
bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (So must now call my tent and my cave); but before I
got thither, the gra s were spoiled; the richness of the fruits,
and the weight of t e juice, aving broken and bruised them,
they were lgood for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but could bring only a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised
when, coming to my heap of apes, which were so rich an
fine when I gathered them, found them all spread about
trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there
were some Wild creatures thereabouts which had done this, but
what they were I knew not. However, as 1 found there was
no laying them up in heaps, and no carrying them away in a
sack; but that one way they would be destroyed and .the
other way they would be crushed with their own weight; I took
another course : I then gathered a large uantity of the gra s,
and hung them upon the out-branches o the trees, that ey
might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons
I carried as man , back as I could well stand under. .
When I came ome from this 'ourney I contemplated with
great leasure the fruitfulness 0 that valley, and the leasant-
ness 0 the situation; the security from storms on at side '
the water and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched

upon a lace to fix in abode in which 'was by far the worst.

part of t 6 country. pon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally
safe as where I was 'now situate; if possible, in that pleasant,
fiuitful part of the island.' a - ,-

This thought ran lon in my head; and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, tghe pleasantness of the place temdpting
me; but when I came to a nearer view of it,-I considere that
l was now by the sea-side, where it was at least 'ble that
something might happen to my advantage, and, y the same
ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other um
happy wretches to the same place; and though itwas scarce
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to en-

close myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the '

island, was to under ate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only impro able, but impossible; and that, therefore,
I ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so en.
amored of this place, that I spent much of in time there for
thewhole remainin part of the month ofJ y; and though,-
upon second thong ts, I resolved, as above stated, not to re-
move, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded

it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge,"
high as 1 could reach, well staked, and filled between wrth
brushwood. Here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights tolgether; always going over it with a ladder, as before;
so that fancied now I had my country and m sea-coast
house. This work took me up till the be inning 0 August.

I had but newly-finished my fence, an began to enjoy my
labor when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my
first habitation; for though I had made a tent, like the other,
with a piece of sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. -

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and be an toenjoy myself. The 3d of August, I found
the grapes 1 ad hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed
were excellent good raisins of the sun: so I began to take
them down from the trees; and it was very happy that I did
so, as the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and 1
should have lost the best part of in winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches 0 them. No sooner had ]
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
cave, but it began to rain; and from hence, which was the
14th of Au st, it rained, more or less, every day till the mid-
dle of Octo r; and sometimes so violently, that I could not
stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought had been dead;
and I heard no more of her till, to my astonishment, she came
home with three kittens. 'I'his was the more strarlilge to me
because about the end of August, thou h I had k" ed a wild
cat as l called it, with my gun, yet I t ought it was quite a
diffetent kind from our European cats: yet the youn cats
were the same kind of house breed as the old one; an both
of my cats bein females, I thought it very strange. But
from these three, afterwards came to be so pestercd with cats,
that l was forced to kill them like vermin or Wild beasts, and
to drive them from my house as much as possible. '

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this confinement I began to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, Ione day killed a goat, and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me. My food was now regulated thus: I ate a'
bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, broiled, for my dinner (for, to In great misfor-
tune, Ihad no vessel to borl or stew any thing , and two or
three of the turtle's eggs for my supper. _

During this confinement in my cover by the rain- I worked
daily two or three hours at enlar 'ng my cave, and by degrees
wor ed it on towards one side, ' I came to the outmde of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which--came befiond my
fence or wall; and so I'camein and out this waif: ' ml was
not perfectly easy at lying so open ;' for as- 1 ad .managed
myself before, I was in "a Eerfect inclosure; Whereas, now,.I

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary .
of gay landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found
I h been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept
this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for rehgious exercise,
prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious humil-
iation, confessing my sms to God, acknowledging his nghteons'
judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me,
throu h Jesus Christ; and havin not tasted the least refresh-
ment or twelve hours, even till e gomg down of the sun, I
then ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, tin-
ishing the day as I began it. I had all this time observed not
Sabbath-da ; for, as at first I had no 'sense of religion upon ,

weeks, by making a longer notch thanordinary, for the Sub-

bath-day, and so did not really know what any of the das
were; but now, having cast u the days as above,,I foun I
had been there a year; so I ivided it into weeks, and set
apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the.
end of my account, I had lost a day or two in my reclioning.
A little afier this, my ink beginning to fail me, I contented
myself to use it more sparing y, an to write down only the
most remarkable events of my ife, without continuing a daily;
memorandum of other things. ,

The rainy season and the dry season began now to a pear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provi e for
them accordingly" but I bought all iiiyexperience beforeI '
lizid it; and what am going to relate,,was one of the most 0
discouraging eaperiments that I had made at all. ' '

I have mentioned that I had saved. the few. ears of'barley .-
and rice which I had so surprismglv found sprung up as] ,5
thought, of themselves. I behave there were about thirty '

stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought ,

it a roper time to sow it after the rains, the--sun being in its
sout ern position going from me. Accordingly, I dug a piece

of ground, as we as I could, With my wooden 5 ads; and, dis
vidiug .it into two parts, I sowed my gram; ut as. I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I' would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the rope:
time for it; so I sowed about two thirds of the seed, eavmag
about a handful of each; and it was a great comfort to me ;
terwards that I did so, for not one gram of what I wed this
time came to any thing; for the dry month followin , and the
earth having thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had

no moisture to assist its growth, and never .came up at all till
the wet season had come- again, and then it e_w as if it had ~
been but newly sown. Finding my first did not grow,
which I easily imagined was from the drought,' I sought for a
moister pieceof ground, to make another trial in ;. and I dug .'
u a piece of ground near 111 new bower, and sowedthe rest

olp my seed in fiebruary, a itltile before the vernal. (equinox,' ' " zu-i-W'I'wwwr

I .4 ROBINSON causos.

This, having the rainy month of March and April to water it,
sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop' but
having only art of the seed left, and not daring to sow all that
I- had, I got at a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amountin to above half a peck of each kind. But by this ex-
periment was made master of my business, and knew exactly
when was the pro r time to sow; and that I might expect
two seed-times an two harvests every year. .

While this corn was rowin , I 'made a little discovery,
which was of use to me erwar s. As soon as the rains were
over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower; where, though I had not been some months, yet 1
found all things just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts
were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow--tree usuall shoots the first ear after lopping its head;
but I could not tel what tree to c it that these stakes were
cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see
the young trees grow; and I runed them, and led them to

ow as much alike as I coal 5 and it is scarce credible how

autiful a' figure they grew into in three years; so that,
though the h ge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in
diameter, yet the trees--for such I might now call them--soon
covered it; and it was a complete s ade, sufficient to lodge
under alkhe dry season. This made me resolve to cut some
more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle
round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did'
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight
yards' distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and
were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.
_ I_ found now that the. seasons of the year mi ht generally be
dinded, not into summer and winter, as in urope, but into
the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally
thus: From the middle of February lathe middle of April,
rains}; the sun hem then on or near the equinox. From the
mid e of April till e middle of August dry; the sun being
then north of the line. From the middle of August till the
middle of October, rain ; the sun bein then come back to

shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this was the gen-
eral observation I made. After I had_ found, by experience,
the ill consequences of being abroad In the rain, I took care
to furnish myself with provisnons beforehand, that I might not
be obliged to 0 out; and I sat within doors as much as pos-
sible during e wet months. In this time I found much em-
ployment, and very suitable also to the time ;. for I found great
occasion for many thin .which I had no wa tofurnish my-
self with, but by hard'la r and constant a p ication-z artic-
ularly,I tried many ways to make myse a basket; at all
the twigs I could at (hr the pur ' proved so brittle, that
they would do no ing. It rove of excellent. advantage to
me now, that when l was a J, I used to take great d ight

father liv , to see them make their wicker-ware; 31d
being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, an a
great observer of the manner how they worked those things
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means all
knowledge of the met ods of it, so that I wanted nothing but
the materials; when it came into my mind, that the. twigs of
that tree from whence I cut in stakes that grew, might
possibly be as tough as the ows, willows, and osiers,
in England; and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next
day, I went to my country-house, as I called it; and, cutting
some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the nexttime pre-

ared with a hatchet, to cut down a quantity, which Isoon

dry within my circle or hedge; and when they were fit for
use, I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next
season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, sev-
eral baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any
thing, as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them
very handsomely,.yet I made them sufiiciently serviceable for
my purpose; and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be
Without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more;
especially stron , dee askets, to place my corn in, instead
of sacks, when shou (1 come to have'any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and emplo ed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if ossi le, how to sup-

ply two other wants. I had no vessel to old any thin that -

was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full 0 rum,
and some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
(which were case-bottles) square, for the holdinn' of waters,
spirits, doc. I had not so much as a pot to boif any thing;
except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which
was too bi for such use as I desired it, viz. to make broth,
and stew afiit of meat by itself. The second thing I would faiu
have had was a tobacco- ire; but it was impossible for me
to make one: however, found a contrivance for that too, at
lafit. I employed myself in planting my second row of stakes
or piles, and also in this wicker-working, all the summer or
dry season; when another business took me up more time than
it could be im ined I could spare.

I mentioned fore, that I had a great mind to see the whole
island; and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to
where I had built my bower, and where I had an openin quite
to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now reso ved to
travel uite across to the sea-shore, on that side; so, taking my
gun, a atchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch
of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey
When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above,

I came within view of the sea, to the west; and it being a very
clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or conti

nent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from W.
to W .S.W., at a very great distance; by my guess, it could.
not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of t e world this might be; other
wise than that I knew it must be part .of America, and, as I
concluded, by all 111 observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and per a s was all inhabited by savages, where
if I should have lande , I had been in a worse condition thanI
was now. I therefore acquiesced in the dispositions of Provi-
dence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this, and
left off afllicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides afler some pause upon this affair, I consrdered that
if this Ian was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time
or other, see some vessel pass or regeass one way or other; but
if not, then it was the savage coast tween the Spanish coun-
try and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of
sav <<res; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to
mur er and devour all human beingsthat fall into their hands.

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, I
found this side of the island, where I now was, much pleasant-
er than mine; the open or savannah fields sweetl adorned
with flowers and grass, and full of very fine w' s.' I saw
abundance of parrots, and fain would have caught one if
possible to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to "speak to
me. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young parrot; for
I knocked it down With a stick, and, having recovered it I
brought it home; but it was some years before I could in 0
him speak: however, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. Butthe accident that followed, thong
it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. ' .

l was exceedingly amused with this journey. , I found, in the
low. grounds hares, as I thou ht them to be,-and foxes;_but
they differed greatly from all t e other kinds I had met mm;
nor could I satisfy myself to eat them. though I killed several. -r-.., -.-..._.-,- .v.-_.~.L

But I ban no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; especially these
three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise. With
these, added to my grapes, Leaden-hall-Market could not have
furnished a table better than I, in roportion to the company;
and though in case was deplorab e enough, yet I had great
cause for than fulness ; as I was not driven to any extremities
for food, but had rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled on thls journey above two miles outright in
a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns,
to see what discoveries I could make, that 1 came weary
enou h to the pl we where I resolved to sit down for the night;
and t en I either re osed myself in a tree, or surrounded my-
self with a row of st es, set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at
me without waking ,me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island; for
here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles '
whereas, on the other side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many
kinds; some of which I had seen, and some of which [had not
seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such as I
knew not the names of, except those called nguins.

I could have shot as many as l leased, ut was very spar-
inrfi of my powder and shot; and erefore had more mind to
k' avshe-goat, if I could, whichI could better feed on. But
thou h there were many goats here more than on my side the
islan yet it was with much more difficulty that 1 could come
near em; the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was upon a hill.

I confess this side of the countr was much pleasanter than
mine; yet I had not the least inc ination to remove; for as]
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me, and]
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the sea-shore
towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and then set- .;
ting up a reat pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I '
would 0 ome again; and that the next journey I took should i
be on e other Side of the island, east from m dwellin , and '3
so round till I came to my post again; of whic in its ace. 5

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinkin 1
I could easily keep so much of the island in my view, hat
could not miss my first dwellinieby viewing the country; but
I found myself mistaken; for ing come about two or three
miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, but
so surrounded With hills, and those bills covered with wood,
that I could not see which was my way, by any direction but that
of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the ition
of the sun at that time of the day. And it happene to my
further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or
four days while I was in this valley; and not bein able to see

obliwed to find out the sea-side, look for my post, and come
back the same way I went; and then by easy joume s I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, an my

In this journey, my dog sur rised a young kid, an seized
upon it; and running to take old of it, I caught it, and saved
it alive from the do . I had a great mind to bring it home if I
could; for I had 0 ten been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame ats,
which might su ply me when my wder and shot sho _d be

carried about me, I led him along, thou with some difficulty
till I came to my bower, and there inclosed him and lef'i

had been absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This
little wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had

been so unpleasant to me that my own house, as i called it to
myself was a perfect,settlement to me, compared to that; and
It rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that Ire-
solved I would never go a reat way from It again, whlle it
should be my lot to stay on t e island.

I reposed myself here a week to rest and regale myself after
my lon journey; during whic , most of the time was taken
up in are wei hty affair of making a on e for_ my Pol Who
began now to more domestic, and to . mighty we ac- _
quainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kld
which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to
fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went, and
found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out)',
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before
to lead it away; but it was so tame with bein hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me ike a dog; and
as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics
also and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September, in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island;
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first da I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thank ul acknowledgments for the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was at-
tended with, and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I ave humble and hearty thanks to God for
havrng been please to discover to me, that it was possible 1
might be more happy even in this solitary condition, than]
should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the

. eficiencles of my solitary state, and the want of human so-
ciety, by his presence, and the communications of his grace

to my soul; supportin , comforting, and encouraging me to-
depend u n his prowl ence here, and to hope for his eternal
presence ereafter. ' ' '

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now le was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days; and now I changed both my sorrows
and my joys: my ver desires altered; my afi'ections chan d
their gusts; and my elights were perfect] new from w at
they were at my first coming, or indeed for t e two years past.

efore, as I walked about, either on m hunting, or for
viewinglthe country, the anguish of my so at my condition
would reak out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart
would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the
deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wil-
derness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon me hke a
storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like'a child ._
sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together:_this was still worse to
me; but if I could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelin
by words, it would go off; and my grief, being exhaus ,
would abate. '

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts' I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts oil it
to mv present state. One mornivrfil being very sad, I opened
the Bible u' 11 these words--" I never leave thee, nor for-
sake thee: immediately it occurred that these words were to
me; why else should they be directed in such a manner, just
at the moment when I was mournin over my condition as
one forsaken ofGod and man 2 " We 1, then," said I, "ifdod
does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it- be, or what

matters it, though the world should forsake me; seeing, on the
other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favor and
oleissing of God, there would be no comHarison in the loss 2"

From this moment I began to conclu e in my mind, that it
was ossible for me to be more ha py in this forsaken, solitary
con ition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any
other particular state in the world; and with this thought
was gomg to ive thanks to God for bringing me to this p ace.
[ know not w at it was, but something shocked m mind at
that thought, and I durst not s )eak the words. " ow canst
thou be such a hypocrite," sai I, even audibly, " to pretend
to be thankful for a condition, which, however thou mayest
endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldest rather pra
heartildy to be delivered from?" Here I stopped; but thou
I coul not say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerefiy
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by w latever afilict--
ing providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, but in very soul within me blessed God for
directing my friend in 0:ifiland, without any order of mine, to
pack it up amon my g s; and for assisting me afterwards
to save it out of e wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, 1 be an my third
year; and though I have not given the reader the trouble of
so particular an account of my works this year as the first,
get in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle ;

ut having regularly divided my time, accordin to the several
daily em loyments that were before me; such as, first, My
duty to 0d, and the reading the Scriptures, which 1 con-
stantly set a art some time or, thrice every day' secondly,
Going abroa With my gun for food, which general y took me
up three hours every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly
Ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed
or catched for myesupply; these took up great part of the
day: also it is to considered, that in the middle of the day,
rhen the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was
100 great to stir out; so that about four hours in the evening
was all the time I could be supposed to work in ' with this ex-
ception, that sometimes I chan ed my hours of: huntin and
worlring, and went to work in e mormng, and abr with
my gun in the afiernoon.

To this short time allowed for labor, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the man hours
which for want of tools, want of help, and want of sk' , evgm
thing I did took up out of my time; for example I was
two-and-forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which
I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, With their tools
and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree
in half a day.

My case was this: it was a lar e tree which waa'to be cut
down because my board was to a broad one. his tree 1
was three days cutting down and two more in cuttin off the
boughs, and reducing it to a iog, or piece of timber. ith in-
expressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it
into chi 3, till it was light enough to move; then I turned it
and m e one side of it smooth and flat as a board, from en
to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other side
till I brought the lank to be about three inches thick, an
smooth on both si es. Any one may judge the labor of my
hands in such a piece of work; but labor and patience carried
me through that, and many other things: I only observe this
in particular, to show the reason why so much of my time
went away with so little work, viz. that what might be a little
to be done With help and tools, was a vast labor, and required
a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding
this, _Wltl1 atience and labor 1 went through manythings;
and, ind , every thin that my circumstances made neces
sary for me to do, as ' appear by what follows.

1 was now, in the months of November and December, ex-
pecting m crop of barley and rice. The ground I had me-
nured or ug u for them was not great; for, as I observed,

having lost one whole crop by sowin in the dry season: but
now my crop promised very well ; w en, on a sudden I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several
sorts, which it was scarce possible to kee from it; as, first|
the goats and wild creatures which I called ares, who, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as
it came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to
shoot up into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this, but by makin an enclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a reat eal of toil; and the
more, because it required speed; owever as my arable land
was but small, suited to my cr0p,l got it tolerably well fenced
in about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures
in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him
up to a stake at the gate, where he would stam and bark all
night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place,
and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
a ace.

pBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in

the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it
was in the ear; for oing along by the place to see how it
throve,l saw my litfie crop surrounded with fowls, I know
not of how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watchin till I
should be gone. I immediate! let fly among them ( or I al-
ways had my un with me); I ad no sooner shot, but there
rose up a lit e cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and
never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not
tell: however I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible
though I should watch it night and day. In the first place,
went amon it, to see what damage was already done, and
found they ad spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was
yet too n for them, the loss was not so great but that the
remain er was likely to be a good crop, if it could be saved.

~ 3'".
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was one away; and the event proved
it to be so; for as I walked 0 , as ifgone, I was no sooner out of
their si ht, than they drop d down, one by one, into the com
a ain. was soprovoked, at I could not have patience to stay
t' more came on, knowing that every grain they ate now was,
as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; so,
. coming up to the hedge I fired again, and killed three of them.

This was what I wished for; so I took them u , and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in Englan , viz. hanged
them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to im-
agine that this should have such an effect as it had; for the
fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they for-
sook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. This 1
was very lad of, you may be sure; and about the latter end
of Decem r. which was our second harvest of the year, I
reaped my corn. ' .

I was sadly put to-it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down'
and all I could do was to make one as well as 1 could, out of
one of the broad-swords or cutlasses, which I savedamong the
arms out of the shgi). I-Iowever, as my first cm was but small,
I had no reat di culty to cut it down: in s art, I reaped it
my way, or I cut nothin off but the ears, and carried it awa
in a great basket which had made, and so rubbed it out .wi
my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting I found am
out of my half peek of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and
above two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my
guess, for I had no measure.

However, this was great encouragement to me; and I fore-
saw that, in time, it would please God to sup lyr me With
bread; and yet here I was per lexed again; or I neither
knew how to rind, or make me of my corn, or indeed how
to clam it an part it; nor, if made into meal, how tomake
bread of it: and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake

it.

it: these things bein added to my desire of having a ood
quantity for store, an to secure a constant supply, 1 reso ved
not to taste any of this cro , but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season; an , in the mean time to employ all
my stud and hours of working to accomplish this great work
of rovi inv myself with corn and bread.

t mightlbe truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It
is a little wonderful, and whatI believe few people have thought
much upon, viz. the strange multitude of little things necessary
in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and
finishing this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to
my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it
every hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-
corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a surprise.

First, I had no plou h to turn up the earth; no spade or
shovel to dig it: well, t is I conquered by makin a wooden
spade, as Iobserved before; but this did my wor but in a
wooden manner ; and though it cost me a great many days to
make it yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner,
but made my work the harder, and performed it much worse.
However, this I bore with and was content to work it out-
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance.
When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to
go over it myself, and dra a great heav bough of a tree over
it, to scratch it, as it maygbe called rat er than rake or bar-
row it. When it was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow
or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the
chaff, and save it: then I wanted a mill to rind it, sieves to
dress it, yeast and salt to make it into brea , and an oven to
bake it; and et all these things I did without, as shall be ob-
served; and t e corn was an inestimable comfort and advana .
ta e to me: all this as I said, made every thing laborious and
te ions to me, but that there was no help for; neither was my

time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain a
part cf it was every day appointed to these works; and as I i
resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater Q:
quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself a
wholly, by labor and mvention to furnish myself with utensils 1
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for 2}
making corn fit or my use. . 3
But now I was to prepare more land; for I had seed enou h 1
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I h a i
week's work, at least, to make me a s ade; which, when it was
done was but a sorry one indeed an very heavy, and required
double labor to work with it: owever, I went through that.
and sowed my seed in two large, flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as could find them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut off that "i
wood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, 3
in one year's time, I knew I should have a quick or living ,
hedge that would want but little repair. This work took me
up all three months; because a great art of the time-was in
the wet season, when I could not a road. Within doors,
that is, when it rained, and I coul not go out I found em-
ployment on the following occasions; always oliserving, 'that
while I was at work, I iverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learned him

studied, b some means or other, to make m self some earthen '

in the lpreparing corn meal, &c. which was the thing I was
upon, resolved to malre some as ar e as Icould, and fit only
to stand like jars, to hold what shoul be put into them.

It would make the reader pit me, or rather laugh at me to
tell how many awkward_ways took to raise this pastil; w at
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them ten
in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stifl' enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of the sun, bemg set_out too hastily; and how many fell
in pieces with only removmg, as well before as after they were
dried; and, in a. word, how, after having. labored hard to
find the clay, to dirt, to temper it, to bring it home, and work
it, I could not m e above two large earthen ugly things (1
cannot call them ~ jars) in about two months' labor.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard
I lifted them very gently u , and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, w 'ch I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as' between the pot and
the basket there was a little room to spare, I stufl'ed it full of
the rice and barley-straw;. and these two pots, bein to stand '
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, an perhaps
the meal, when the corn was bruised.) . .

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success; such
as little round pots, flat dishes glitchers, and pipkins and any
thinghmydhand turned to; and e heat of the sun baked them
ver ar .

Byut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of
these could do. It happened, some time after, making a pretty
large fire for cookin my meat, when I wentto put it out, after.
I had done with it, found a broken piece of one of my earth- _
en-ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as
a tile. I was a eeably surprised to see it; and said to myself

that certainly ev might be made to burn whole, if they would
burn broken. V

IHr -. "--qm -

130 ROBINSON cRusoi;

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn some pots. 1 had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazin them with lead, thou h I had
some lead to do it_with; but placed three_ large $11) in and
two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, an placed my
fire-wood all round it, with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire thh fresh fue round the outside, and upon the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all: when I saw them
clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours,
till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt'or
run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into glass, if I
had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the ots be-

an to abate of the red color; and watching them night
shat I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morningl
had three ver good, I will not say handsome, ipkins, and
two other eart en pots, as hard burnt as could be esired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the runnin of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that wanted no sort
of earthen-ware for my use; butl must needs say, as to the
shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may
suppose,'as I had no way of making them but as the children
make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies that never
learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear
the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold,
before I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil'me some meat, which it did admirably well; and with
a piece of a kid I made some very 00d broth; though I
wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre ients requisite to make
it so good as I would have had it been.

My next convern was to get a stone mortar to stam or beat
some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thong t of ar-
riving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To

sup ly this want I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the
wor d, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for
at y whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I
spent man a day to find out a great stone bignenough to cut
hollow, an make fit for a mortar; but could (1 none at all,
except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no wa to -
dig or cut out ' nor, indeed, were the rocks in the islan of
sufficient hardness, as they were all of a sand , crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a eavy pestle,
nor would brezfl: the corn without filling it with sand: so, alter
a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over
and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood, which I
found indeed much easier; and fgettin one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and arm it on the outside with
my axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of .fire, and infi-
nite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil
make their canoes. After this, I made a great, heavy pestle, or
heater, of the wood called iron--wood; an this I prepared and
laid by afidinst I had my next crop of corn, when I pro
to mysel to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to
make my bread. ' "
My next difficulty was, to make a sieve or scarce, to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran an the husk, without
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread.
This was a most difficult thing, even but to think on; for I
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; 1 meandine
thin canvass or stuff, to searce the meal throu h. Here I was
at a full sto for many months; nor did I re y know what to
do: linen had none left, but what was mere'rags: I had
oats'-hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor spin it; and
ad I known how, here were no tools to work it With; all the
remedy I found for this was, at last 'recollecting I had, among
the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the Shlp some
neckcloths of calico or muslin, with some pieces of these I
made three. small sieves, proper enouih for the work ' and thus
I made shift for some years: how did mamas, I shall

The baking part was the next thing to be considered. and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first,
Ihad no tyl'east: as to that part there was no supplyin the
want' so did not concern myself much about it; ut or an
oven I was indeed puzzled. At length I found out an expe-
dient for that also, which was this: I made some earthen ves-
sels, very broad, 'but not deep, that is to say, about two feet
diameter, and not above nine inches deep: these I burned in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when
I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon mrhearth, which
I had paved with some sguare tiles, of my own making and
burning also; but I shoul not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burned into embers, or live coals, I
drew them forward upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over,
and there let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then sweep<
ing away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and
covering them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all round
the outs1de of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked in
barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-coo
into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and pudv
dings of the rice; but made no pies, as I had nothing to put
into them except the flesh of fowls or cats.

It need not be wondered at if all t ese things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, in the intervals of these things I had my new bar-
vest and husbandry to manage. I reaped my corn in its sea-
son,and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it u in
the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; or I
had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted aedplace to lay it
up in; for the increase of the corn now yield me so much,
that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and of rice as
much or more,'insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use
it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while: I
resolved also to see what quantity would be sufiicient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could. consume in ayear; so]
resolved to sow just the same quantity ever'y year that I sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity wo d fully provide me
with bread, &c.

'All the while these things were doing, you may be sure m
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which
had seen from the other side of the island; and I was not with.
out some secret wishes that I was on shore there; fancyinlg,
that seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I mig t
find some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps
at last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of sava es,
and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse an
the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came in their Power,
I should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one 0 being
killed, and erhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the
people of e Caribbean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters;
and I knew, 'lIJ'y the latitude, that I could not be far off from
that shore. hen supposing the were not cannibals, yet that
they might kill me as they ha many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands, even when they have been ten or twenty
together; much more I, who was but one, and could make
little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I ought to
have considerul well of, and did cast up in my thoughts after-
wards, took up none of my apprehensions at that yet my head
ran mightily upon the thought of gettin over to the shore.

Now I wrshed for my boy Xury, an the long-boat with the '
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in-vain: then I
thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore a reat wa , in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She a near y where '
she did at first, but not quite; having turned, y the force at

the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against 8
hi h ridge of beachy rough sand; but no water about her as
beore. If I had ha hands to have refitted her, and to have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done very
well, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her
easily enough; but I might have foreseen, that I could no
more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I
could remove the island; however, I went to the woods and
cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving
to try what I could do; suggesting to myself, that if I coul
but turn her down, and repair the damage she had received,
shei1 would be a very good boat, and I might venture to sea
in er.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it: at last, finding it
impossible to heave her up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand, to undermine her, and so as to make
her fal down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her
ri ht in the fall. '

ut when I had done this, 1 was unable to stir her up again,
or to get under her, much less to move her forward towards
the water; so I was forced to give it over; and yet, though
1 gave over the ho es of the boat, my desire to venture over
the main increase , rather than diminished, as the means for
it seemed im ossible.

At length, began to'think whether it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say, without
hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not on y thought
possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the idea
of making it, and with my havin0r much more convenience for
it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at all consider-
ing the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
the Indians did, viz. the want of hands to move it into the water
when it was made--a difficulty much harder for me to sur-
mount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to

hem; for what could it avail me, if, after I had chosen my{c--p--mmwrwgmmwn, _.;7Wr".'_l<<" 37;" 3""! ,, _'

tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be able;
_with my tools to hew and dub the outside into. the pro 1

shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it 01-

low, so as make a boat of it; if, afier all this, I must leave it

inst where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the

water

One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection upon-
my mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, -
I should have immediately thought how I was to get it into the
sea; but my thoughts were so intent u n my vctiiyage in it,
that I never once considered how I sho d get it o the land; .

_ and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide
it over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty-five fathoms of
land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. '

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determinin whether I was able to
undertake it; not but that the difiic ty of launching my boat
came often into in head ; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it, by this foo ish answer: Let me first make it; I warrant
I will find some way or other to get it along when it IS done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, .
and I uestion much whether Solomon ever had such a one
for the uilding of the Temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
where it lessened, and then arted into branches. It was not
without infinite labor that I clled this tree; I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen more . ttmg

brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to
have carried six and twenty men, and consequently big
enou h to have carried me and all my car 0.

W en I had one through this work, was extremely de-
lighted with it. he boat was really much bigger than ever
I saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a wear stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
there remained no ' g but to get it into the water; which,
had I accomplished, I make no uestion but I should have
begun the maddest voy e, and e most unlikely to be per-
' formed, that ever was un ertaken.

But all my devices to et it into the water failed me though
they cost me inexpressib e labor too. It lay about one undred
yards from the water, and not more; but-the first inconve-
nience was, it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away
this discouragement, I resolved to di into the surface of the

earth, and so make a declivity: this be an, and it cost me a'

prodigious deal of pains; (but who gru ge pains that have
their deliverance in viewe? when this was worked through
and this difficulty manag , it was still much the same, for
could no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then
I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could
not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I be an this
work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calc ate how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be
thrown out, I found by the number of hands I had, having
none but in own that it must have been ten or twelve

ears before could have gone through with It; for the shore
ay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty feet deep : this attempt, thou h with great reluctaucy,
I was. at length obliged to ive over so. _

This grieved me he ' y; and now I saw, thougn too late
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and

place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much comfort as before; for, by a constant study and
serious application to the word of God and by the assistance
of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before; I entertained different notions of t 'ngs ' I looked now
upon the world as a thing remote which I had nothing to do
With no espectation fiom, and, indeed, no desires about: 'in a
word, .I h nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have;
I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafier
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and we
might I say, as father Abraham to Dives, " Between me and
thee is a reat ulf fixed." _ -' .
In the first p ace I was here removed from all the wicked-
ness of the world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust

of the 'eye, nor Che pride oi" life. I had nothing to covet, for l '

had all that I was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the
whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might ca myself kin or em-

peror over the whole country which I had possession o ; there'

were no rivals; I had no com etitor, none tohdispute'so've-
reignt or command with me: might have raised ship-load-
in s o u, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as
l on h enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle
enoug , but now and then one was' as much as I could put to

any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships-4
and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cared

mto raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: {I had
enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was the rest to
me? IfI killed more flesh than 1 could eat, the dog must eat
it, or vermin - if I sowed more com than I could eat, it must
be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot'on the
round; I could make no more use of them than for fuel, am
at I had no other occasion for but to dress my food. ,
In a word, the nature and efierience of things dictated to
me, u 11 just reflection, that the good things of this world
are 0 no further ' good to us than for our use; and that what-

ever we may ligap up to give,others, we enjoy only as much

as we can use, and no more. The most covetous iping
miser in the world would have been cured of the vice o covet-
ousness, if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely
. more than I knew what to do with. 1 had no room for desire,
except it was for things which I had not, and they were com-
paratively but trifles, tough indeed of great use to me. I had,
asI hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorr , use-
less stufi' lay: 'I had no manner of business for it; and often
thought within myself, that I would have given a handful of it
for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my
corn; nay, 1 would have iven it all for six nn -worth of tur-
nip and carrot seed from ngland, or for a and ul of as and
beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the east ad-
vantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a.drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet sea-
sons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been
the same case,-they had been of no manner of value to me,
because of no use. '

I had now brou ht my state of life to be much more com-
fortable in itself t an it was at first, and much easi to my
mind, as well as to my body. I fre uently sat down to meat
with thankfulness, and admired the and of God's providence
which had thus spread my table in the wilderness; I learne
tolook more upon the bright side of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I'wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret
comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take notice
of here, to put those discontented people in mind of it, who
cannot enjo comfortably what God has given them, because
they see an covet something that he has not iven them. All
our discontents about what we want appeare to me to spring
from the want of thankfulness for w at we have.

Another reflection was of rent use to me, and doubtless
would be so to an one that s ould fall into such distress as
mine was; and t is was, to compare my present condition
with what] at first expected itwould be; nay, with what it

Would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderful] ordered the ship to be cast up near to the
shore, where not only could come at .her, but could bring
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief 'and comfort;
without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for
defence, and unpowder and shot for etting my food.

I spent who e hours, I may say wh e days, in representin
to rfi'self, in the most lively colors, how I must have acted i
I h got nothing out of the ship. I could not have so much
as get any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was
long before I found any of them, I must have perished; that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savafie '
that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I .
no way to flay or open it, or gart the flesh from the skin and
the bowels, or to cut it up; ut must gnaw it with my teeth,
and ull it with my claws, like a beast. ' ' '

T ese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness .

of Providence to me and very thankful for my C/present condi-
tion, with all its hardshi s and misfortunes; an this part also,
1 cannot. but recommen to the reflection of those who are apt,
in their misery, to say, Is any affliction like mine'l Let them.
consider how much worse the cases of some people are, and
their case might have been, if Providence had, thought fit. '
I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my present
condition with what I had deserved, and bad therefore reason
to expect from the hand of Providence. 1 had lived a dreadful
life rfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God.' I

mates , by a hardened dezpising of dangers, and the views ol
death, which rew habitu to me; by my long absence from
all manner 0 opportunities to converse with any thing but
what was like myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or
tending towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliver-
ances I en'ipyed (such as my escape from Sullee, my being
taken up y the Portuvuese master of a ship, my being

lanted so well in the razils, my receivin the car ofrom

n land, and the like), I never had once t e words, hank
Gog, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray to him,
or so much as to say, Lord, have mercy upon me! no, nor to
mfntion the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blas-

eme it.

p I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months,
as I have already observed, on account of my wicked and
hardened life past; and when I looked about 'me, and consid-
ered what particular providences had attended me since my
coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully
with me,--had not only punished me less than my iniquity
had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me,--this

ave me reat hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
t lat God ad yet mercies in store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to a
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con~
dition; and that I, who was yet a living man, on ht not to
comlilain, seeing I had not the due punishment 0 my sins;
that en'oyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expect in that place, that I ought never more to re ine at
my'condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks or that
daily bread which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed by a miracle,
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a
long series of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a.- W'Wfiwxqwfi-'IWWflU--gv--va'w'vw'vfi .7 .. ,

Lilace in the uninhabitable art of the world where I could
ave been cast re to my a 'vantage; a place where, as I had
no society whi was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my
life; no venomous or poisonous creatures which I might feed
on to my hurt; no sav s to murder and devour me. In a
word, as my life was a ife of sorrow one way, so it was a life
of mercy another; and I wanted nothinato make it a life of
comfort, but to make myself sensible of od's goodness to me,
and care over me in this condition; and after I did make a
just imgrovement of these things, 1 went away, and was no
more sa .

I had now been here so long, that many things which I
lnought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very
much wasted, and near spent. .

My ink as I observed, had been gone for some time,.all but
a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little,
till it was so ale, it scarce lefi any appearance of black upon
the paper. 5 long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute
down t e days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me; and, first, by casting up times past, I re-
member that there was a stran e concurrence of_da s in the
various providences which bef me, and which, if I ad been
superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I
- might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal

of curiosity. .

First, I ad observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and m friends, and ran away to Hull in order
to go to sea, the same ay afterwards I was taken by the Sallee
man-of-war, and made a slave: the same da of the ear that
[escaped out of the wreck of the ship in armou Roads,
that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee
in the boat; and the same day of the year I was born on, viz.
the 30th of September, that same day had my life so miracu-
lously saved twenty-six years after when I was cast on shore
in this island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life be-
gan both on one day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread ' I mean the biscuit which I brought ou" the ship : this
I had husbanded to the last degree, :11 owin myself but one
cake of bread a day for above a year; an yet I was uitc
without bread for near a year before I ot any com o my
own; and great reason I had to be thank ii! that I had any at
all, the getting it, being, as has been already observed, next to

miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay mi htily: as to linen', I had
none for a great while, exce t some c eckered shirts, which 1
found in the chests of the ot er seamen, and which I carefully
preserved, because many times I could bear no. clothes on but
a shirt; and it was a ver great help to me, that I had, among
all the men's clothes of t e ship almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also, indeed several thick watch-coats of the sea-
men's which were left, but they were too hot to wear; and
though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that
there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked;
no, thou h I had been inclined to it, which 1 was not; nor
could I a ide the thought of it, though I was all alone. The
reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear
the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some
clothes on; nay, the very lieat frequently blistered my skin ;
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made 'some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it.
No more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun beating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the head-
ache presently, by darting so directly upon my head without
11 ca or hat on so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on
my} at, it would presently go away.

pon these views, I began to consider about puttin the
few rags I had, which I c led clothes, into some order: had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to

try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
that I had b me, and With such other materials as I had ' so

made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make
two or'three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a

rent while : as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry
gliitt indeed till afterwards. '

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them
up, stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which means
some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little;
but others I found very useful. The first thing I made of these
was a great cap for in head, with the hair on the outside, to
shoot off the ram; an this I lperformed so well, that after this
I made me a suit of clothes w olly of the skins; that is to say,
a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose;
for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than warm. I must
not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for
ifI was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However they
were such as I made very good shift with; and when was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and
cap hem uppermost, I was kept very dry. . '

After t is s nt a great deal of time and pains to make me
an umbrella: was indeed in great want of one, and had a

great mind to make one: I had seen them made in the Brazils, ,

where the were very useful in the great heats which are

hottest of the weather with renter advantage than I could
before in the coolest ; and w en I had no need of it, could
close it, and carry it under my arm. ,

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed by resiglpingl to the will of God, and throwing mg-
self wholly upon t e 's 05:11 of his providence. This ma e
my life better than socia le- for when I began to re ret the
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether t us con-
versing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may
say, With even God himself, by ejaculations2 was not better
than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in
the same posture and lace, just as before: the chief thin s 1
was employed in besi es my yearly labor of planting may ar-
ley and rice, an curin my raisins, of both which I ways -
kept ugeiust enough to ave sufiiclent stock of one year's pro-
vision forehand; I say, besides this yearly labor, and my
daily pursuit of going out with my un, I had one labor to
make me a canoe which at last I finis ed; so that by digging a
canal to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into
the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so
vastly big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it, so, never being
ab e to brin it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was
obliged to et it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser the next time; indeed, the next time, though I
could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a lace where 1
could not et the water to it at any less distance t an, as I have
said, near alf a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I

never g'ave.it over; and though 1 was near two years about it,

yet I never udged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go
OK to sea at ast.

However, though my little periagua was finished, et the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design whic I had
in view when I made the first; I mean, of. venturing over to
the tarrafirma, where it was above forty miles broad; accord-~ , m, 1-:st

ingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put an em to that
design, and now I thoug t no 'more of it. \ As I had a boat
my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as
1 had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as 'I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that little journey made me very eager to see other parts
of the coasti and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but
sailing round the island. f

For this purpose, that 1 might do every thing with discretion
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and
made a sail to it out of some of the ieces of the ship's sails
which lay in store, and of which I ad a greatvstock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,I found she
would sail very well: then I made little lockers, or boxes, at
each end of my boat, to put pronsions, necessaries, ammu-
nition, 650. into, to be kept dry either from rain or the spray
of the sea; and a little long,'hoilow place I cut in the insi e of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang
down over it, to kee it dry. _

I fixed my umbre a also in a she at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep 9. heat of the sun of _me,
like an awnin ; and thus I every now and then took a little,
voyage u on e sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little cree . , At last, being e r to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, l resolv upon my cruise; and accord-
ingly I victual ed my shi for the voyage, uttmg in two
dozen of loaves (cakes I s ould rather c em) of barley
bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great
deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those
which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cont
me in the night. ; .

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth ear of my reign,
or my captivrty which you please, that _ set out on Is
voyage, and I {hand it much longer than I e cted; for
though the island itself was "fit very large, yet w n I came

to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about
two leagues into the sea, some above water some under it; and
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so
thatI was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double
the int.

hen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and 'come back again, not knowin how far it
might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, oubtin how
I s ould get back again; so I came to an anchor; for had
made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grap-
pling which I got out of the ship.

Having seemed in boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up on a h' l, which seemed to overlook that point,
where 1 saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, l per-
ceived a stron , and indeed a most furious current which ran
to the east, an even came close to the point; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the
stren of it, and not be able to make the island again ; and
indee , had 1 not got first upon this hill, I believe it would
have been so; for ere was the same current on the other side
the island, only that it set off at a further distance, and I saw
there was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to
do but to t out of the first current, and 1 should presently
be in an e dy.

I lay here, however, two day): because the wind blowin
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that ing just contrary to the said
current, made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so
that it was not sa e for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far ofi' because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
over night, the sea was calm, andI ventured; butI am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my boat's
length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my

not keep er so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hur-
ried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
my lefl hand. There was no wind stirring to help me and all
I could do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I
began to give myself over for lost; for as the current was on
both sides of the island, I knew in _a few leagues' distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverablfi one; nor did
I see any ossibility of avoiding it; so that I a no prospect
before me at of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving or hunger. I had, indeed, found a
tortorse on the shore, as bi almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I ad a great jar of fresh water, that

is to say, one of my earthen pots; but whatwas all this to'

sun passed the meridian, l thoughtl felt a little breeze ol
wind'in 111 face springiarliF up from S.S.E. This cheered my
heart a lit e, an especi y, when, in about half an hour more,
it blew a pretty fgentle gale. By this time I was ot at a
frightful distance om the island; and had the least 0 oudy or
haz weather intervened, I had been undone another way too;
for {had no compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost
sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself
to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away
to the north as much as possible, to lget out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sa' , and the boat began to
stretch awa , I saw, even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration o the current was near; for where the current was
so strong, the water was foul; but perceivin the water clear,
I, found the current abate; and presently I ound to the east,
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks;
these rocks I found caused the current to art a ain, and as
the main stress of it ran away more sout erly, eaving the
rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse
of the rocks, and made a strontr eddy, which ran back' again
to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them u n the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going
to mur er them, or who have been in such like extremities,
may guess what my present surprise of ioy was, and how
gladly 1 put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the
wind also freshenin , how glad] I' spread my sail to it, run-
ning cheerfully be ore the win , and with a strong tide or
edd under foot. .

his eddy carried me about a le ue in my way back
again, directly towards the island, but flout two leagues more
to the northward than the current which carried me away at
first; sothat, when I came near the island, I found myself
0 n to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end
the island, opposite to that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of way by

the help of this current or eddy I found it was spent, and
served me no further: However, I found that being between
two great currents, Viz. that on the south side, which had hur-
ried me away, and that on the north
on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake of
the island, I found the water at least still, and running no
way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making such fresh
way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks wluch oc-
casroned this disaster stretchin out, as is described before,
to the southward, and casting ofi' the current more southerly
had, of course, made another eddy to the north; and this-
found very strong. but not directly settigfilthe way in course
lay, which was ue west, but almost north. owever,
having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west; and m about 'an hour came within about a mile
of the shore, where, it being smooth .water, I soon at to land.

When I was on shore I fell on my knees, an ave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolvin to lay aside thoughts
if my deliverance by my boat; an refreshing myself with
such things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore In a
little cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down
to sleep, being quite spent with the labor and fatigue of the
vo age.

I was now at a great loss which wa to get home with my
boat: I had run so much hazard an knew too much of the
-.ase, to think of attempting it by the way I went out' and
what mi ht be at the other side (I mean the west side) I new
not, nor ad I any mind to run any more ventures ' so I only
unsolved in the morning to make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there wasno cree where I might la up my
fi'lgate in safet , so as to have her again, if I wanted 'er. In

about three m' es, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came>>

to a_ very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed
till it came to a very lit a rivulet or brook, where I found a

ver convenient harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she
h been in alittle dock made on purpose for her. Here]
put in and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to lookhabout me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so,
taking nothing out of my boat but my un and umbrella,--for
it was exceeding hot,--I began my marc . The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,
being, as I said before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my imbs, for I was ver weary, and fell asleep: but judgg
you, if you can, that rea my story what a surprise I must
in, when I was awaked out of mlyosleep by a vorce, calling me
by in name several times, " bin, Robin, Robin Crusoe;
poor bin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
are you? Where have you been?" .

I was so dead aslee at first, being fatigued with rowrng or
paddling, as it is calle , the first part of the day, and with walk-
Ing the atter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ; but dozing
between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that some-
body spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly,
and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up in the
utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but
I saw my Pol sittin on the top of the hedge; and immediate-
ly knew it was he t at spoke to me; for just in such bemoan-
ing lan uage I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and ,
he had earned it so perfectly, that he would sit u n m fin-
ger, and laSShis bill close to ray face, and cry, " oor bin

rusoe! here are you? here have you been? How
came you here? " and such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the arrot, and that
indeed it could be nobod else it was a g while before I
could compose myself. irst, was amazed how the creatur-i

got thither, and then how he should just kee about the lace,
and no where else; but as I was well satisfiped it could no-
body but honest Pol _I got over it; and holding out my hand,
and calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable creature came
to me, an sat upon my thumb, as he usedto do, and contin-
ued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come
here; and where had I been ;. just as if he had been overjoyed
to see me 3am ; and so I carried him home along with me.

I now h enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had
enough to do for many days, to sit still and reflect upon the
danger I had been in. I would have been very lad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island; but knew not
how it was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of
the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there
was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and
mg very blood run chill, but to think of it ; and as-to the other
si e of the island, I did not know how it mi ht be there; but
supposin the current ran with the same area against the
shore at e east as it (passed by it on the other, I might run
the same risk of being riven down the stream, and carried by
the island, as I had been before of being carried away from it;
so, with these thoughts, I contented myself to be.without any
boat, though it had been the product of so many months' la-
bor to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; an
my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the disposrtlons 01'
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society. . .

I improved mysel in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me u n appl ing myself to; and I .

sides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in m-
earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make them W1

made things round and shapable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I was never. more vain
of my own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a' tobacco-pipe; and
though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done
and only burnt red, like other earthen-ware, yet as it was hard
and firm, an? would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly com-
forted with i , for 1 had been always used to smoke; an there
were ipes in the ship, but] for ot_them at first, not think
ing at there was tobacco in t 16 Island; and afterwards,
when I selarched the ship again, I could not come at any

i s at a .
p n my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed
r though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
v. y handy and convenient for in laying things up in, or
fetching things home. For examp e, if I killed a gom abroad,
I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in

ieCes and bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle;

could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the
flesh, which was enough for me and bring them home in
a basket, and leave the rest behin me. Also large deep bas-
kets were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
baskets.

'I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably : this
was a want which it was impossible for me to supply and I be-
gan seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no
more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats.
I had, as is observed, in the third year of my being here, kept
ayoung kid, and bred her 11 tame, and I was in hopes of
getting a h oat; but I coul not by any means bring it to
pass, till my idifirew an old. goat; am:' as I could never find
in my heart to k her, she died at last of mere age.

But bemg_now in the eleventh year of my residence, and,
as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself tn
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I

.1 . .-. . a"... l_.\'12m.--fli_lAlefim1m
could not catch some of them alive ; and particularly I wanted
a she-goat great w1th (young. _For this purpose, I made snares _
to hamper them; an I do believe they were more than once ~'

taken in them; but my tackle was not ood, for I had no
wire, and I always found them broken, an my bait devoured.

At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several large
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats
used to feed, ahd over those pits I placed hurdles, of my own
making too, with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap,
and I could easily rceive that the goats had gone in and
eaten u the corn, or I_ could see the marks of their feet. At
length set three traps in one mght, and going the next mom-
ing, I found them all standing, and et the bait eaten and
gone: this was very discouraging._ owever, I altered my
traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one
morning to see my tra s, I found in one of them a large old
ire-gsat, and in one o the others three kids, a male and two
em es.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was
so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him'; that is to say, to

0 about to brin him away alive, which was what I wanted:

could have k' ed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer 111 end' so I even let him out, and he ran
away, as if he had 11 [lightened out of his wits. But I did
not then know, what I afterwards learnt, that hun r will tame
a lion. If I had let him sta there three or four ays without
food, and then have carried im some water to drink and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of, the kids;
for the are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are we] used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at
that time: then I went to the three kids, and taking them one
by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some difli~
culty brought them all home. ' .

It was a good while before they would feed; at throwmg
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and ey began to_ . .7 V w. v. ,.,..~.------. w.-- "a

be tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply my
seh' with goat's flesh when I had no powder or shot left
- breeding some up tame was my only way; when, perhaps, I
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But
then it occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the
wild, or else they would always run wild when they dgrew up '

1nd the on] way for this was, ,to have some inclose piece 0
ground, wel fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them
in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or_
those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as
I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first
work was to find out a proper piece of ground, where there
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper
for all these (being a plain open piece of meadow land, or sa-
vannah, as our peo ile call it in the western colonies), which
had two or three litt e drills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast when
I shall tell them, I began by inclosing this piece of ground
in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at
least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as
to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have
time enough to do it in; but I did not consider that m oats
would be as wild in so much compass as if they had ad the
whole island, and I should have so much room to chase them
in, that I should never catch them. '

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe aboutfifiy
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently
stopped short, and for the first beginnin , I resolved to in--
close a piece of about 150 Iyams in lengt , and 100 ards in
breadth; which, as it wou d maintain as many as should
have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased,l could
add more ground to my inclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work

. -. "an... _._......-_,mu.n__.a.2_.s.g;h~m--anm_a.
with cour . I was about three months hedging in the firs
iecc; an ,' till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it and used them to feed as near me as possible, to
make them familiar; and very ofien I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand; so that after my inclosure was finished, and
I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating '
after me for a handful of corn.

This answered my end; and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats kids and all - and in two
years more, I had three and forty, besides several that I took
and killed for my food. After that I inclosed five several
pieces of ound to feed them in, with little pens to drive them
into, to t e them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all ' for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on whenl please , but milk too--a thino' which, indeed,
in the beginning, I did not so much as mini of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable sure
prise; for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a. gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies
of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it so I, that had never milked a cow much less a cat,
or seen butter or cheese made, only when f was a boy, r a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and
cheese at last, and also salt'(though I found it artly made to
my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of rocks of the
sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can
our. Creator treat his creatures, even in those conditions in
which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destructionl How
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to
praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my , 3;!

ittle family sit down to dinner: there was my majesty the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command; 1 could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away; and no rebels among all my sub-
jects. Then to see how like a kinv I dined too, all alone, at-
tended by my servants! Pol, as i he had been my favorite,
was the only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who
was now grown very old and crazy, and had found no 3 cies
to multiply his kind upon, sat alwa s at my right han ; and
two cats, one on one side of the ta le, and one on the other

expectin now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of
special avor. '

But these were not the two cats which I brou ht on shore at
first, for they were both of them dead, and hat? been interred
near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were
two which I had reserved tame; whereas the rest run wild
in the woods, andp became indeed troublesome to me at last;
for they would often come into my house, and lunder me too,
till atlast I was obliged to shoot them, and did ki a great many :
at len h they left me.--VVith this attendance and in this
plenti ul manner, I lived; neither could I be said to want any
thing but society; and of that, some time after this, I was
like to have too much. -

I was something impatient as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards;
and, therefore, sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her
about the island, and at other times I sat myself down con-
tented enough without her. But I had a stran e uneasiness
in my mind to go down to the point of the islan , where, as l
have said, in my last ramble, I went u the hill to see how the
more lay, and how the current set, tliat I might see what I
had to do: this inclination increased 11 on me every day, and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the
edge of the shore. I did so; but had any one in En land
been to meet such a man as I was, it must either have right-
ened him, or raised a reat deal of laughter; and as I fre-
tgueently stood still to loo at myself, I could not but smile at

eguip e, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch
0 my gure, as follows :--

I had a great, high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin.
with a flap hanging down behind, as well'to keep the sun
from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck:
nothing bein so hurtful in these climates as e rain upon the
flesh, under e clothes. V

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts comin down to
about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-knee breeches
of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-

oat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that,
nice pantaloons it reached to the middle of my le 5: stockings
and shoes 1 had none, but had made me a pair 0 somethings,
l scarce know what to call them, like buskms, to flap over my
legs, and lace on either side like s atterdashes; but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried which I drew to-
gether with two'thongs of the same instead of buckles; and
in a kind of afrog oneither-side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side and
one on the other. I had another belt, not so broad and fas-
tened in the same manner, which hun over my shoulder; and
at the end of it under my left arm, ungl two pouches both
made of goat's skin too; in one of which ung my powder, in
the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on
my shoulder my gun; and over my head, a eat, clumsy,
ugly, goat's skin umbrella, but which, after , was the most'
necessary thing I had about me, next to my un. As formy
face, the color of it was really not so mulatto- the as one nigh;
egrpect from a man not at all careful of it, and hung w:
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heard I had once

[will Mt say they were long enough to hang my hat upon
them, but u-ey were of a length and shape monstrous enough,
and such as, in England, would have passed for fri htful.

But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I ad so few
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence ; .so I
say no more to that part. In this kind of figure I went my
new journey, and was out five or six days. EI travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to an anchor, to <<rot upon the rocks; and having no
bout now to take care of Iwent over the land, a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before; when, lookin for-
ward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which was
obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was sur-
prised to see the sea all smooth and quiet; no ri )pling, no
motion, no current, any more there than in any ot er places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to'spend
some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets
of the tide had occasione it; but I was presently convinced
how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great river on the
shore, must be the occasion of this current; and that accord-
ing as the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the
north, this current came nearer, or went farther from the
shore; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went u to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, plainly
saw the c'urrent again as before, only that it ran farther of,
being near half a league from the shore; whereas in my case,
it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe
along with it; which, at another time, it would not have done

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I
might very easily bring my boat about the island again; but
when I began to think of utting it in practice, I had such a
terror upon m spirits at t e remembrance of the danger I had
been in, that could not think of it again with any patience)
but, on the contrary, I took up another resolutiou,'whic'h was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was, that I would

g.
build, or rather make me another periagua or canoe; and so
have one for one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it,
two plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or
tent with the wall about it, under the rock, with the. cave be-
hind me, which, by this time, I had enlarged into several
apartments or caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall
or fortification, that is to say beyond where my wall joined to
the rock, was all filled up With the large earthen pots, of which
[have given an account, and with tourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or 51:: bushels each, wherel
laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the
ear, cut 06' short from the straw, and the other rubbed out
with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown
so big, and spread so very much that there was not the least
ap arance, to any one's view, of: any habitation behind them.

ear this dwelling of mine but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two (pieces of corn land,
which I kept duly cultivated and sowe , and which duly
yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had
occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat; and I had now a tol-
erableafilantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower,
asI 0 ed it, which I ke t in repair; that is to say, I kept
the hedge which encircle it in, constantly fitted up to its
usual height the ladder standing always in the inside: I kept
the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but
were now grown very firm and tall, always out so, that they
might s read and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeab e shade ;' w ich they did efi'ectually to my mind. I:

the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece

of a sail spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which
never wanted any repair or renewing- and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I

had killed, and with other soft things; and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved
and a great watch--coat to cover me; and here whenever
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats; and as 1 had taken an inconceivable deal
of pains to fence and inclose this ground, I was so anxious to
see it he )t entire, lest the goats should break through, that 1
never le t off, till, with inlinite labor, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce
room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy sea-
son, made the inclosure strong like a wall,--indeed, stronger
than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever ap eared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considere the kee ing up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a iving magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in
the place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them
in my reach depended entirely upon my perfectin my in-
closures to such a degree, that I mi ht be sure 0 keeping
them together; which, by this meth , indeed, I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of
them up again. -

In tlns place also 1 had my grapes growing; which I rin-
cipally dfiended on for my winter store of raisins, and w ich
I never f ' ed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not
only agreeable but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and re<<
freshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation
and the lace where I had laid up me boat, I generally staid
and lay ere, in my way thither; or used frequently to visit
  
  

my coat; and 1 kept all thines about, or belonging to her, in
very good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert myself; .
but no more hazardous voyages would I 0, nor scarce ever "

sire of being hurried out of my knowled 0 again by e cur- -
rents or winds, or any other accident. at now I come to a
new scene of my life.

 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat :1
l was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked ,3
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. '1
I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an appari- #1.
tion : I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, i393
nor see any thing: I went up to a rising ground to look far- :1
ther; I went up the shore! and down the shore, but it was all "'51
one; I could see no other unpression but that one. I went to . 7'!
it again to see if there were any more,--and to observe if it a?
might not be my fancy; but there was no 'room for. that, for 12'
there was exactly the print of a foot--toes, heel, and every part' .14
of a foot: how it came thither I knew" not, nor could I in the 4
least imagine; but, after innumerable fluttenn thoughts, like if
a man perfectly confused and out of myself, came home to 2;:
my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ound I went on, 5-}
but terrified to the last degree; Iookin be rind me at every "'5

two or three steps, mistaking every bus and tree, and fame -.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I call it ever
after this), I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over
by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole In the
rock, which I had called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor
could I remember the next morning; for never frighfened hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than 1

of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is
somethin contrary to the nature of such things, and espe-
cially to t e usual ractice of all creatures in fear' but I was
so embarrassed wit my own frightful ideas of the thing, that 1
formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even thou h
I was now a reat way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must
the devil ' an reason 'oined in with me upon this supposition,
for how should any other thing in human shape come into the
place? Where was the vessel that brought them? What
marks were there of any other footste 8? And how was it
ossible a man should come there? ut then to think that
atan should take human shape upon him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but Weave
the print of his foot behind him and that even for no purpose
too, for he could not be sure should see it,--thi_s was an
amusement the other way. I considered that the devil might

have found out abundance of other ways to 'have terrified me-

than this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on
the other side of the island, he would never have been so simple
as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one
whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too,-which
the first sur e of the sea, upon a high wind, would have de-
faced entire y: all this seemed inconsistent with the thing it-
self, and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtilty
of the devil.

Abundance of such thin s as these assisted to ar e me out
of all ap rehensions of it s being the devil ; and presently
conclude , then, that it must be some more dangerous creature,
VIZ. that it must be some of the savages of the main land over
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and,
either driven by the currents, or by contrary Winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were one awaxefiain
to sea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stai in this ate
Island as I would have been to have had them. _

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was
very thankful in my thoughts that l was so happy as not to be

thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by.

whir b they would have concluded that some inhalatants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me;
then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their
having found my boat, and that there were people here; and
that it so, I should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so that they
should not find me, yet they would find my inclosure, destroy
all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I
should perish at last for mere want. '

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that for-
mer confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonder-
ful ex erience as I had had of his goodness, as if he that had
fed m by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his power
the provision which he had made for me by Ins goodness. I
reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any
more com one year than would just serve me till the next sea-
son, as if no accident would intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground; and this I thought so just
a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two or three
years' corn beforehand; so that whatever might come, I might
not erish for want of bread.

ow strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret dill'ercnt springs are the afl'ections
hurried about, as dilferent circumstances present! To--day
we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-
morrow we shun; to--day we desire what to-morrow we fear,
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of; this was exem li-
fied in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginab e;
for 1, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from
human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the bound-
less ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what 1
called silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among
the rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own
species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to
life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the
supreme blessing 9f salvation, could bestow; I say, that

should now tremble. at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to smk into the ground at but the shadow or
silentappearance of a man's liavmg set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first surpriSe. I considered that this was
the station of life the infinitely wise and lflood providence of
God had determined for me; that as I co (1 not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to
dis iute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an
um oubted right, by creation, to overn and dispose of me ab-
solutely as he thought fit; and w o, as l was a creature that
had ofi'ended him, had likewise a 'udicial right to condemn me
to what punishment he thought t; and that it was my part
to submit to bear his indignation, because 1 had sinned against
him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not on! giggiwous,
but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to unish an ct me,
so he was able to deliver me; that if he id not think fit to do
so, it was my unquestioned duty to resi n myself absolutely
and entirely to his will; and, on the other hand it was my
duty also to ho in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates an directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of my 1-
tations on this occasion I cannot omit: One morning ear y,
lying in my' bed, and filled with thoughts about my dariger
tom the appearances of savages, I found it discomposed me
very much; upon'which these words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts--" Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I
Will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this,
risin cheerfully out of my bed, myheart was not only coni-
forte , but I was guided and encouraged to prayi earnestly to
God for deliverance: when I had done priming, took up my
Bible, and o ening it to read, the first wor at resented to
me were--" ait on the Lord, and be of good c ear, and. he
shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say on the Lord." It isim-
possible 'to "press the comfort this gave me. In answer, I

thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least,
on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and re-
flections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might
be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the
print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat:
this cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade my-
self it was all a delusion; that it was not ring else but my own
foot: and why might I not come that way from the boat, as
well as I was oing that way to the boat? Again, I consid-
ered also, thath could by no means tell, for certain, where I
had trod, and where I had not ' and that if, at last, this was
only the print of m own foot, I had played the part of those
foo 5 who try to ma e stories of spectres and apparitions, and
then are frightened at them more than any body.

Now I began to take courage, and to pee abroad again, for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three a s and nights, so
that I began to starve for provisions; for I ha little or nothing
within doors but some barley-cakes and water: then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening iversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried u their milk. Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the
print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to
start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad ag'ain, and went
to my country-house to milk me flock: but to see with what
fear went forward, how often looked behind me, how I was
ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run
for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was
haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most
terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, as I
went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I
began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really noth-
ing in it but my own imagination: but I could not persuade
myself fully of this till I s ould go down to the shore again,
and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, an."
see if there was any similitude or fitness, that l m' ht be as
sured it was my own foot: but when I came to the p ace, first
it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I cbuld
not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts: secondly
when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, I found
my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things filled
my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors
again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one
in an ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that
some man or men had been on shore there; or, in short that
the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I
was aware; and what course to take for my security I
knew not.

0, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was
to throw down my inclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild
into the woods, lest the enem should find them, and then fre-
quent the island in pros ct o the same or the like booty; then
to the simple thing of igging up in two cornfields, lest they
should find such a grain there, an still be prompted to tie-
quent the island ; then to demolish my bower and tent, that they
might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to
loo farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after I
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full
of vapors, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrif ing than dancer itself, when apparent to the eyes;
and we find, the burden o? anxiety greater, much, than the
evil which we are anxious about: and, wliic was worse than
all this, I had not that relief in this trouble, from the re3i ation
I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked'J. ought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were
ufion him, but that God had forsaken him ;.for I did not now
t' e due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
iistress. and resting upon his providence, as I had done before

for my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, 1 hau
at least been more cheerfully supported under this new sur--
prise, and, perhaps, carried through it with more rewlution.
This con usion of my thoughts ke it me awake all night;
but in the morning I'fell asleep; an havin , by the amuse-
ment of my mind, been, as it were, tired an my spirits ex-
hausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better com-
posed than I had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I con-
cluded that this island, which was so exoeedin pleasant,
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as 'had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that al-
thou h there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot,
yet t at there min-ht sometimes come boats ofi' from the shore,
who either with diasivrn, or ierhaps never but when they were
driven by cross wind's, miglit come to this place; that I had
lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least
shadow or fi are of any people yet; and that if at any time
they should )e driven here, it was )rohable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
thou ht fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most 1
coal suggest any danger from, was from any casual, acci-
dental lan ing of straggLIing people from the main, who, as it
was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their
Wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again with all

possible speed; seldom staying one ni ht on shore, lest they
should not have the help of the tides an'd7 daylight back again '

and that, therefore,I had nothing to do but to consider 0
$1118 safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon

e spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dugmy cave so
large as to bring a door throuo'h again, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my lbrtification joined to the rock:
upon maturelv considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw .
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle.
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made men-' "We - i . xww, KW WW. Brew-"e outvraiwem,>> - 'v-'"'-""PS"v-.h.,37:>>zama,, "3m.

non: these trees having been planted so thick before, they
wanted but few piles to be driven between them that they>>
might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon
finished; so that I had now a double wall ' and my outer wall
was thickened with 'pieces of timber, old cableshand every
thing I could think 0 , to make it strong; having in it seven
little holes, about as big as I might ut in arm out at. In the
inside of this, I thickened my w to a ut ten feet thick,
with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it
at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and throu h the
seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which took
notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these I
planted like my cannon, and, fitted them into frames, that held
them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month-in
finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done>> .

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my.
wall, for a gre t length every way, as full With stakes, or sticks,
of the osier-li a wood, which I found so a t to w,'as they
could well stand;- insomuch that I believe mig t set in near

so monstrous thick and strong, that it was ind perfectly
impassable; and no men of w at kind soever would ever im-
agine that there was any thing beyond it, much less a habita-
tion. As for the way which proposed to myself toa'Fo in
and out (for I lefi no avenue), it was by setting two 1 ders,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,
and left room to place another ladder upon that ' so when the
two ladders were taken down, no man livin could come down

iest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at length
t at they were not altogether without just reason; though I
foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear sug-
gested to me

While this was doin , l was not altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I h a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a ready supply to me on
every occasion, and be an to be sufficient for me, without the
expense of powder an shot, but also without the fati ue of
hunting after the wild ones; and Iwas loath to lose e ad-
vantage of them, and 'to have them all to nurse up over ain.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could thin of
but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another
convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive
them into it every night; and the other was, to inclose two or
three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each aplace; so that if any disaster happened
to the flock in ener , I might be able to raise them again
with little troub e and time; and this, though it would require
3 great deal of time and labor, I thought was the most rational

esrgn.

Accordingly I 5 cut some time to find out the most retired
parts of the rslang; and I pitched upon one, which was as
Hrivate, indeed, as m heart could wish for: it was a little,

am piece of groun , in the middle of the hollow and thick
w s, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before
endeavoring to come back that way from the eastern part of1
the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three
acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an inclo-
sure by nature; at least, it did not want near so much labor
ho usake it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so

ar at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and
in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my
flock, or herd,--call it which you please,--who were notso wild
now as at first they might be supposed to he, were well enougha " "W~W;'F"'WC/WV71WT\"EWWW

secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten
young she-goats and two_h oats to this piece' and when
ting were there, I continu to perfect the fiance, till I
h made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did
at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great
deal. All this labor I was at the expense of, purely from m
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot whic ,
1 ad seen' for, as yet, I never saw any human creature come
near the island; and I had now lived two years under this un-
easiness, which, indeed, made In life much less comfortable -
than it was before, as may be we imagined by any who know
what it is to live in the constant snare o the fear of man. And
this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of
my mind had too great impressions also upon the religious
part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into
the hands of sav s and cannibals lay so upon my spirits,
that I seldom foun myself in a due temper for application to
my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and res' a;-
tions of soul which I was wont to do: I rather rayed to

my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love and
affection is much the more proper frame for ra er than that
of terror and discomposure; and that under e read of ~mis- ;_

mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the

body, and much greater; mymg to God being properly an

act of the mind, not of the y. , -

But to go on: after I had thus secured one art of my little

living stock, I went about the whole islan , searching for :

upon the sea_ at a great distance. I had found. a perspective
g ass or two in one of_ the seamen's chests, which I saved out
of our Shl but I had it not about me : and this was so remote,

. that I co d not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it

till my eggs were not able to hold to look any longer : whether
it was a at or not, I do not know, but as I descended from
the hill I could see no more of it; so I gave it over; only I re-
solved to a? no more out without a pers ective-glass in my
pocket. hen I was come down the hil to the end of the
island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently
convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not
such a strange thing in the is and as I imagined; and, but
that it was a special providence that I was cast u on the side
of the island wlmre the savages never came, 1 s ould easily
have known that nothin was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when t ey happened to be a little too far out
at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor; like-
wise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors,
having taken any prisoners, would brin them over to this
shore, where, according to their dreadf customs, being all
cannibals they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter. -

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was perfectly con-
founded an amazed; nor is it possible for me to ex ress the
horror of my mind, at seeing the shore 5 read wit skulls,

Fased the savawe wretches had sat down to their inhuman
eastings upon are bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that 1 en-
tertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a Ion
while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts 0
such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of
the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard
of it o n, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short,
I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my stomach

grew sick, and I was 'ust at the point of faintindg when nature
'scharged the timer er from my stomach; .an having vomit-
ed with uncommon violence, I was a little 1e1ieved,.but could
not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the
hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
in own habitation.

. hen I came a little out of that part of the island I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then, recover' myself, I looked
up with the utmost affection of my soul, an , With a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot
in a art of the world where I was distinguished from such
drea ful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition ver miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it, that had still more to 've thanks for
than to complain of; and this, above all, that had, even. in
this miserab e condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself, and the hope of His blessing]; which was a felicity
more than sufficiently equivalent to all e
suffered, or could suffer. .

In this frame of thankfulness, 1 went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of m circum-
stances, than ever I was before; for I observed at these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
Sit ; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any

'ng here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the cov-
ered, woody part of it, without finding any thing to their pur-
pow. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and
never saw the least footsteps of human creature there before;
and 'I might be e' hteen years more as entirely concealed as
I u as now, if I di not discover myself to them, which I had
no manner of occasion to (lot; it being my onllj' busmess to
keep myself entirely concealed where was 11 ass I found a
better sort of creatures than cannibals to make in self known
to. Yet I entertained such an abhdrrence o the.>> savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched,
Inhuman custom of their devourin and eating one another up,
that I continued pensive and sad? and kept close wrthlnmy

own circle, for almost two years after this: when 1 say my
own circle, I mean, by it my three plantations, viz. my castle
my country~seat, which I called my bower, and my inclosure
in the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than
as an inclosure for my oats; for the aversion which nature
gave me to these helliSi wretches was such, that I was as
fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. I did
not so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but be-
g-in rather to think of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more attempts to brin the other
boat round the island to me, lest I should meet wit some of
these creatures at sea; in which, if I had happened to have
f illen into their hands I knew what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
d niger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the
sune composed manner as before; only with this difference,
that I use more caution and kept my eyes more about me
thm I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and tparticularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun,
lost any of em, being on the island, should happen to hear it.
It was therefore a very good providence to me that I had fur-
nished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no
need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them;
and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, 'as I had done before; so that for two years after this,
I believe I never fired my gun once off, thou h I never went
out without it; and, which was more, as I ad saved three
pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or
at least two of them, sticking them in my oat-skin belt. I
also furbished up one of the great cutlasses t at I had out of
the ship, and made me a belt to ban it on also- so that I was
now a most formidable fellow to loo at, when I went abroad,
if you add to the former description of myself, the particular
of two istols, and a great broadsword hanging at my side in
a belt, at without a scabbard. '

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I

secmed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to in former
calm, sedate way of living. All these things tended to s ow me,
more and more how far my condition was from being miser-
able, com ared to some others; nay, to many other partic-
ulars of li e, which it mi ht have pleased God to have made my
lot. It put me upon re ecting how little re ining there would
be among mankind at any condition of lie, if people would
rather compare their condition with those that were worse, in
order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with
those which are better, to assist their murmurings and com-
plainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things
which 1 wanted, so, indeed,i thought that the frights I had
been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had
been in for my own preservation, had taken oflthe edge of my
invention for m own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which had onte bent my thoughts too much upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make some of in barley
into malt, and then try to brew in self some beer. his was
really a whimsical thought, and reproved myself often for
the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would b the
want of several thinos necessary to the making my beer at
it would be impossible for me to supply' as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that as l have observed al-
ready, I could never compass; no, though I spent not only
many days, but weeks, nay, months in attempting it, but to
no purpose.- In the next place, I had no hops to make itkeep,
no ({east to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it be -

too; for I seldom ave any thin over without accompl' ing
it, when once I h it in my be to begin it. But my inven-
tion now ran quite another way; for, night and da , I could .
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of ese mon-
sters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possible save
the victim they should bring hither to destroy. t would take

up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be, to
set down all the contrivanees I hatched, or rather brooded
upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures or
at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hit er
any more; but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible
to take effect, unless I was to be there to o it myself; ann
what could one man do among them, when perhaps there
might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true
to a mark as I could with my gun '1

Sometimes I thought of diggin-r a hone under the place
where they made their lire, an putting in five or six
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their
tire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all that was
near it; but as, in the first placefi should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon t em, my store being now within
the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its
going off at any certain time, when it might sur rise them;
and, at best, that it would do little more than just low the fire
about their ears, and fright them, but not sufficient to make
them forsake the place : so I laid it aside ; and then proposed

place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle

I made no doubt but that if there were twenty I should kill
them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks;
and'f was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and some-
times that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep. I
went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself
several days to find out proper places to ut myself in ambus-
cade, as I said, to watch for them; and went frequently to
the place itself, which was now grown more famiLar to me:

I may call it, the horror I had at the place. and at the signals

of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my
malice. Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill where I was satisfied I mi ht securely wait till I saw any
of their boats coming ; and mig t then, even before they would
be ready to come on shore, conve myself, unseen, into some
thickets of trees, in one of whic there was a hollow lar
enough to conceal me entirely; and there I mi ht sit and o
serve all their bloody doings and take my fu aim at their
heads, when they were so close together as that it would be
next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could
fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this
place, then,I resalved to fix my design; and, accordingly 1
prepared two muskets and my ordinar fowlin -piece. he
two muskets I loaded with a brace of ugs eac , and four or
five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of
the largest size: I also loaded my pistols with about four bul-
lets each; and in this osture, well provided with ammunition
for a second and thir charge, I prepared myself for my ex-
pedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour
ever mornin u to the top of the hill, which was from my
cas e, as I c le it, about three miles, or more, to see if
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island
or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of' this bar
duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my
watch, but came always back without any discovery; there
having not, in all that time, been the least appearance not
only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so a: as
my eyes or glasses could reach every way. _

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so
long also I he t up the vigor of my design, and my spirit!
seemed to be the while in a suitab e form for so outrageous
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence which I had not at all entered into a discussion of

in my thoughts, any further t'hlau my passions were at first
fired by the horror 1 conceived at the unnatural custom of the
ple of that country; who, it seems, had been suffered by
mvidence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no
other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been
so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such
dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began
to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so
long and so far every morning in vain, so my 0 inion of the
action itself began to alter ; and I began, wit cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what I was 0mg to en age in;
what authority or call I had to pretend toie judge an execu-
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thou ht
fit, for so many ages, to suffer, un unished, to go on, an to
be, as it were, the executioners 0 his judgments one upon
another. How far these people were offenders against me,
and what right I had to enga e in the quarrel of that blood
which they shed promiscuous y upon one another, I debated
this very often with myself, thus: How do I know what God
himself judges in this particular case? It is certain these peo-
ple do not commit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them; they
do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance
of divine 'ustice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.
They thin it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to
eat mutton.
When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that
I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these eople were not
murderers in the sense that I had before con emned them in
my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle ; 'or more
frequentl ', upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to
the wor , Without givin uarter, though they threw down
their arms and submittef. qln the next place, it occurred to

me, that although the usage they gave one another was thus
brutish and inhuman, yet it was real] nothing to me: these
people had done me no injury : that ' they attempted me, or
saw It necessary, for my immediate preservation to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that 1' was yet out
of their power, and they. really had no knowledge of me, and
consequently no design upon me, and therefore it could not
be just for me to fall upon them : that this would justify the
conduct of the Stfianiards in all their barbarities practised in
America, where ey destroyed millions of these ple ; ' who
however they were idolaters and barbarians, an had sever
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacri-
ficing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Span-
iards, very innocent people 5 and that the rooting them out of
the country is spoken 0 With the utmost abhorrence and de-
testation by even the Spaniards themselves at this time and
by all other Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery,
1 bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to
God or man' and for w 'ch the very name of a S aniard-'is
reckoned to he frightful and terrible to all people of umanity,

particularly eminent for the produce 0 a race'of men who
were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels
of pity'to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of
generous temper in the mind. ' ' _'
These considerations really put me to a ease, and to a
kind of a full stop; and I bevan, by little an little,.to be off

my reso ution to attack the sav es; and that it was not my

I shoul onl bring upon myself a certain destruction) which,
at present, had no manner of occasion for._ Upon the whole,
I concluded, that neither in princi le nor in policy, I ought,
one way or other, to concern myself in this affair; that my
business was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to uess by that
there were any living creatures upon the islan , I mean of
human sha e. Religion joined in with this prudential resolu-
tion ; and was convinced now, many ways, that I was per-
fectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to
me. As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another

I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I
ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor
of nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make
a just retribution for national offences, and to bring public
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by such
ways as best please him. This appeared so clear to me now

that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had
not been sufi'ered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of
wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I ave most humble
thanks on my knees to God, that had thus Eelivered me from
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to rant me the protection
of his providence, that I might not f into the hands of the
barbarians, or that I might not la ' my hands upon them un-
less I had a more clear call from eaven to do it, in de ence
of my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a {year after this;
md so far was I from desiring an occasion or falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went u the
hill, to see whether there were any of them in sight, or toli)now
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that 1

:tself, to fall upon them: only this I did, I went and removed
my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and car-
ried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it
into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and
where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, ,
at least would not come, with their boats, upon any account.
whatever. With my boat I carried away every thing that I
had lefi there belonging to her, though not necessary for the
bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not
be called either anchor or rapnel ' however, it was the best I
could make of its kind : all these I removed, that there might
not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any a pearance
of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon e island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever,
and seldom went from my cell other than upon my constant
employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, and manage my little
flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the ot er part of
the island, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these
savage people, 'who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding any thing here and consequently
never wandered 03' from the coast; and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions
of them had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I
looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what mdy con
dition would have been if I had chopped upon them'an been
discovered before that when, naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot, I walked
every where, peeping and peering about the island to see .what
1 could get: what a sur rise should I have been in, if, when I
discovered the print 0 a man's foot, I had, instead _of that,
seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them ursuing me,
and by the swiltness of their running, no possib' ity of my es-
caping them ! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk in very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much, that could
not soon recover it to think what I should have done, and how
[should not only have been unable to resist them, but even -

 

mama. A.#4.>>;me.Lfliirmiksiimifiimam;wmnma..-.. .. a." t..s.-'t-..c.'..<<..':>-'t,
should not have had presence of mind enough to do what]
might have done; much less what now, after so much consid-
eration and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after
serious thinking of these things, I would be very melanchol ,
and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it ' I,
at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had deliv-
ered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept from me
those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in
delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of
any such thing depending, or the least supposition of its bein'r
possible. This renewet a contemplation which often ha
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I began to see
the merciful dis iositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run
through in this ifc; how wonderfully we are delivered when
we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary
(as we call it), a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way,
or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we
intended to 0 that way; nay, when sense, our own inclina-
tion, and per laps business, has called to go the other way, yet
a strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what
springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us
to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we should have gone, and even to our
Ima rination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined
and ost. Upon these and many like reflections, I afterwards
made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found
those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not
doing any thin<<r that presented, or oing this way or that
way, I never fai ed to obey the secret dictate ; though I knew
no other reason for it than that such a pressure, or such a
hint, hung upon my mind. I could give many examples
of the success of this- conduct in the course of my life, but
more es cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this un-
haflipy is and; besides many occasions which it is very like-
ly might have taken notice of if I had seen with the same
eyes then that I see with now. but it is never too late to be
wise; and 1 cannot but advise all considering men, whose

lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine,
or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible
intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps
cannot account for; but certainly they are a proof of the con-
verse of spirits, and a secret communication between those
imbodied and those unimbodied, and such a proof as can
never be withstood; of which I shall have occasion to give
some very remarkable instances in the remainder of my soli-
tary residence in this dismal place.

1 believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con-
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I hved in, and
the concern that was now upon me, ut an end to.all inven-
tion, and to all the contrivances that had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of m
safety more now upon my hands than that of my food.
cared not to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood now, for fiaar
the noise I might make should be heard; much less would 1
fire a gun, for the same reason; and, above all, I was intolerr.
ably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible
at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this
reason I removed that part of my business which required fire,
such as burning of pots and pipes &.c., into my newapart-
ment in the woods; where,' after I had been some time,.l
found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in
the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare sa ,
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so ha: y
as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a. safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things now to Prondence), I
was cutting down some thick branches of trees to'rnake char-
coal; and before I 50 on, I must observe the reason of my
making this charco which was thus: I was afraid of making
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I coul
not live there Without baking- my bread, cooking my meat: -
&,c.; so; contrived to burn some wood here, as [had seen
done in England, under turf, till it became chark, or dry- coal;
and then Hitting the tire out,,l preserved the coal to carry
home, am perform the other services for which lire was \vant<<
ing, without danger ot'smoke. But this is by the by.--VVhile
I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind
a very thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place : I was curious to look in it, and,
getting with dilliculty into the mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large; that Is to say, sullietent lhr me to stand upright
11] it, and perhaps another with me; but 1 must confess to
you that I made more haste out than I did in, when, looking
farther into tltc place, aml which was perfectly dark,I saw
two broad, shining eyes of sortie creature, whether devil or man
I knew not, which twmkled like two stars; the dim light from
tlte cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the reflec-
tion. However, after some pause, l recovered myself, am]
began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he
that was afraid to see the devil was not lit to live twenty years
in an island all alone; and that] might well think there was
nothinn' in this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, pfucking up my courage, I took up a firebraud, aml m I
rushed again, With the stick [taming in my hand: I had not
gone three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as I
was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words
htdfexpressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it mt me
into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will
not answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it otl'.
But still, plucking up my spirits as well as 1 could, and en-
couraging myself a little with considering that the power and
presence of God was every where, and was able to protect me,
upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the the
brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the

round a most monstrous, frightful, old lie-goat, just makin '
Eis will, as we say, and gasping for life; and dying, indeed, OI

mere old age. 1 stirred him a little, to see if I could get lnm
out, and he essayed to get up but was not able to raise him-
self; and I thought with myself he might even lie there; for
if he had frightened me, so he would certainly fright any of
the savages, if any one of them should be so hardy as to come
in there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was but very small, that is
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner
of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever been
employed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed
also that there was a )lace at the farther side of it that went
in further, but was sollow that it required me to cree upon
my hands and knees to 0 into it, and whither it wentll knew
not: so, having no cand e, I gave it over for that time , but re-
solved to come again the next day, rovided with candles and
a tinder-box, which I had made of t ie lock of one of the mus-
kets, with some wild-fire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now
of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using some-
times rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a
weed like ncttles ; and goimr into this low place, I was obliged
to cree) upon al fours, asaI have said, almost ten ar'lls;
which, )y the way, I thought was a venture bold enoug , con-
sidering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was be-
yond it. When I had got through the strait, I found the roof
rose higher 11 ),I believe near twenty feet; but never was such
a glorious sight seen in the island,l dare say, as it was, to look
round the sides and roof of this vault or cave : the wall reflect-
ed a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles.
What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other
precious stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be, [

new not. The place fwas in was a most delightful cavity
or grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though erfectlv
dafit; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort 0 a small

loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venom
16
on creature to be seen, neither was there any dam] or we
on the sides or roof: the only ditliculty in it was the entrance;
which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a re'
treat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious
about to this place; particularly,l resolved to bring hither
my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two
fowling--pieces (for I had three in all), and three muskets (for
of them I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my out
most fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expe-
dition. Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,l
hap )ened to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out
of t to sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder
on every srde, which, cakin , and "Towing; hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in t e shell; so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask: this
was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I car--
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds
of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any
kind : I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here,
that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or, if they did, the would not venture to attack
me here. The old goat, whom found ex iring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery:
and I found it much easier to' die a great hole there, and throw
him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so]
interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this
island; and was so naturalized to the lace, and the manner
of living, that could I have but enjoyed) the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could haves

been ccntent to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down
and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to

some little diversions and amusements, which made the time.

pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before:
as, first, I had taught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak; and
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and (plain,
that it was very pleasant to me; for I believe no bir ever
spoke plainer; and he lived with me no less than six-and-
twenty years: how long he might have lived. afterwards I know
not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they
live a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and lovin

companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, an

then died of mere old age. As for my cats they multiplied, as
l have observed, to that degree, that I was 0 liged to shoot seve-
ral of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I
had ; but, at length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving them from
me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild
into the woods, except two, or three favorites, which I kept
tame, and whose young, when they had any I always drown-
ed ; and these were part of my family. Besrdes these, I always
kept two or three household kids about me, whom I taught to
feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, ,which
talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none
like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of
them that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-
fowls, whose names I knew not, that I caught upon the shore
and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had lante

before my castle wall bein now grown up to a g thick

grove, these fowls all live among these low trees, and bred,
there, which was very agreeable to me- so that, as land-

above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led,
if I could have been secured from the dread of the_savages.-
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all,
people who shall meet with my story, to make this just obser-.
vation from it, viz. How frequently, in the course of our hves_

the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when
we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the
very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I
could ive many examples of this in the course of my unac-
counta le life; but in nothing was it more particularly re-
markable than in the circumstances of my-last years of solitary
residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year;.and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields ; . when

oing out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
t orough dayli ht, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the sliore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island where I had observed some sav-
ages had been, as before, and not on the other side; but to
my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
' short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I mi rht be
surprised, and yet I had. no more peace within from t e a -
pre ensrons I had that If these savages, 1n rambling over t 1e
island, should find my corn standin or cut, or any of my
works and improvements, they woulfi immediately conclude
that there were peo le in the place, and would then never give
over till they had ound me out. In this extremity, I went
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me and
made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I pre )ared myself within, puttin myself in a posture
of defenm: Illoaded all my cannon, as called them, that is
to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new for-
tification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to
the divine rotection, and earnestly to pra to God to deliver
me out of t e hands of the barbarians. chontinued in this

ture about two hours; and began to be mighty impatient
or intelligence abroad, for l had no spies to send out. After
sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do in this, I
was not able to bear sitting in ignorance an longer; so set-
ting up my ladder to the side of the hill, w ere there was a
flat place, as I observed before and then pulling the laddeiI-nililp
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the ' ;
and pulling out my pers active-glass, which I had taken on
ggrpose, I laid me down at on my belly on the ground, and
gan to look for the place. lpresently found there were no
less than nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had
made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that the
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress
some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which the had
brought with them, whether alive or dead, I could not te .
The had two canoes with them, which they had hauled u
upon t e shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seem
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight ut me into,
especially seeing them come on my side' of the is and, and so
near me too; but when I considered their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, 1 be an, afterwards, to be
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied t rat I might go abroad
with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if the were not on
shore before; and having made this observation, went abroad
about my harvest-work with the more composure. _ 0
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row or paddle,
as we call it away. I should have observed, that 'or an hour
or more be ore they went off, they went a dancing; and I
could easily~discern their postures and tures by my glass.
I could not perceive, b my nicest observ tion, but that they
were stark naked, and ad not the least covering upon them;
but whether they were men or women I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped an gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my mile, and my great
sword by my side, without a scabbard an With all the speed
I was able to make, went awa to the hill where I had discow
ered the first appearance of ; and as' soon as I got thither
which was not in less than two hours (for I could not 0 apace
being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived t ere had
been three canoes more ol'savages at that place; and looking
out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, makin over
for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especi' ly as, ,
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror,
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it,
viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies,
eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now
began to remeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let t em be whom or how many soever. It seemed evi-
dent to me that the visits which the ' made? thus to this island
were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before
any more of them came on shore there again; that is to say,
I neither saw them, nor any footsteps or Signals of them, in all
that time; for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not
to come abroad, at least not so far; .yet all this while I lived
uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of
their coming upon me by surprise: from whence I observe,
that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering,
especially if there is no room to shake off that expectation, or
glose apprehensions. '

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better em-
ployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them,
the very next time I should see them; especially if they should
be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties: nor
did I consider at afl, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or
a dozen, I was still, the next da ', or week, or month to kill
another, and so another, even infinitum, till I should be at
length no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters,
an erhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great

rp exit and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one
I ay or at er, fall into the hands of these merciless creatures;
and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not Without

nable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it
was that I had provided a' tame flock or herd of oats; for l
durst not, upon any account, fire my gun, especi y near that
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm
the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to
have them come again, with perha 3 two or three hundred
canoes with them in a few days, an then I knew what to ex-
pect. However, lwore out a year and three months more he-
tore I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them
again, as I shall soon observe. ' It is true, they might have
been there once or twice, but either they made no stay,.or at
least I did not see them: but in the month of May, as near as
I could calculate; and in my four and tWentieth year, I had a
very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months interval, was very great;.I slept unquiet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in
the night: in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mmd'
and in the night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, an
of the reasons why I might justify the domg of it. But to
wave all this for a while--It was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, It
was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very at storm of
wind all day, with a great ea] of ii htning an thunder, and
a very foul night it' was after it. knew not what was. the
particular occasion of it, but as I was reading m the Bible,
and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite
of a different nature from any I had met With before ;' for'the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up In the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trace,
clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and tiler
it after me; and mounting it the second time, at to top

heard ; and, by the sound, knew that it was from that part of
the sea wherel was driven down the current in my boat. I
immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress,
and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in com-
pany, and tired these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain

elp. I had the presence of mind, at that minute, to think,
that though I could not heI them, it might be they might
help me so I brought toget er all the dry wood I could et
at hand, and, making a good, handsome pile, I set it on ire
upon the hill The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and
though the Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that

was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must
needs see it. and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my
fire blazed up I heard another gun, and after that Several
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till daybreak; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up. I saw something at a great distance at sea, full
east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distin-

uish, no, not With my glass; the distance was so great, and
t e weather still something hazy also; at least it was so out
at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that da , and soon perceived that
it did not move so I presently concfiided that it was a ship at
anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, 1
took my uu m rnv hand, and ran towards the south side of
the islan , to the rocks where I had formerly been carried
away with the .current ; and getting up there, the weather by
this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great
sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those
concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream,
and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion
of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition
that ever I had been in, all my life. Thus, what is one man's
safety is another man's destruction; for it seems these men,
whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the
rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them
in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. N. E. Had they seen -

the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they
must, as I thought have endeavored to have saved themselves
on slmre by the help of their boat; but their firing ofl' guns for
help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my lire, filled
me with many thoughts : first, I imagined that upon seein my
light, they might have ut themselves into their boat, an en-
deavored to make the s ore; but that the sea gloing very hi h,
they might have been cast away: other times imagined that
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case
many ways; as, particularly, b the breaking of the sea upon
their shi , which many times 0 liges men to stave, or take in
pieces, t ieir boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with
their own hands : other times I imagined they had some other
ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them 11 and carried them off;

other times I fancied they were al gone 05' to sea in their

boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there
was nothin but misery and perishing; and that perhaps,
they mightily this time think of starvmg, and of bemg In a
condition to eat one another. '

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condi-
tion I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery

of the poor men, and pity them; which had still this good '

effect on my side, that it gave me more and more cause' to give
thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortabl .proyided
for me in my desolate condition; and that of two 5 ips' com-
panies who were now cast away upon this part of the world,

not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again

to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any miseiglso great
but we may see something or other to be thank for, an

may see others in worse circumstances than our own. Such
certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not' so
much as see room to suppose any of them were saved: nothing
could make it ;ational so mucll'} as to ml] or expect that they

did not all perish there, exce t the possibility onl of their
being taken 11 by another i in company; an' tlns was
but mere possibility indeed, for saw not the east Sign or ap-
pearance of any such thing. I cannot explain, by any pos-
sible ener of words, what a strange longing or hankering of
desires I tilt in my soul upon this sitrht, breaking out some-
times thus: " 0 that there had been Lbut one or two nay, or
but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me,
that I might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature
to have spoken to me, and to have conversed with! " In all
the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or sodeep a
reY=et at the want of it. . _ . _
here are some secret movmg springs in the affections,
which, when they are set a roin r by some object in view, or,
though not in view, yet ren ere present to the mind by the
power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its
impetuosity, to such Violent, eager embracmgs of the object,
that the absence of it is insupportable. Such were these ear-
nest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe 1
repeated the words, " O that it had been but one 5 " a thousand
times; and my desrres were so moved by it, that when I spoke
the words, in hands would clinch together, and my fingers
would press t e aims of my hands, so that if I had had any
soft thing in my liand, it would have crushed it involuntarily ,
and the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against
one another so strong, that for some time I could not art
them again. Let the naturalists ex )lain these things, an the
reason and manner of them: all can say to them is to de-
scribe the fact, which was even surprising to me, when I found
it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded : it was doubt-
less the efl'ect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in
my mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation of one
of my fellow Christians would have been to me. But it was
not to be; either their fate or mine, or both forbade it' for,
till the last year of my bein on this islan , I never new
whether any were saved out 0 that ship or no; and had only
he affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seamen's waistcoat,
a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothin to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was
of: be ad nothin 'in his pockets but two pieces of eight and
a tobacco-pipe;---- e last was to me of ten times more value
than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me: but that did not
altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might
be yet some living creature on board whose life I might not
only save, but might, by savin that ife, comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thoug t clung so to my heart, that I
could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my
boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's
providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my
mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting .to myself if I
did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity
of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by a
bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), an a
basket of raisins; and, thus loading myself with every thing
necessary I went down to my boat, at the water out of her,
put her alloat, loaded all my cargo in er, and then went home
again for more. My second cargo was a great b of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, anot er large pot
of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk
and a cheese; all which, with reat labor and sweat, I carried
to my boat ;. and prayin to 0d to direct my voyage, I put
out; and rowing, or pad in , the canoe along the shore, came
at last to the utmost point 0 the island on' the north-east side.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either' to

venture, or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance,
and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance
of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail
me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those cur
rents, I should be carried a rent wa out to sea and perhaps
out of my reach, or si ht of t e islan again; and that then, as
my boat was but sm 1, if any little gale of wind should rise, I
should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed in mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having auled my boat Into alittle
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a
risin bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear
and esire, about Ill voyage; when, as I was musing, I could,
perceive that the ti e was turned, and the flood come on; up-
on which my going was impracticable for so many hours.
Upon this presentlty it occurred to me, that I should 0 up to
the hi best piece 0 ground I could find, and observe, i I could,
how e sets of the tide, or currents, lay when the flood came '
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out I
might not expect. to be driven another wa home, with e
same rapidness of the currents. This thoug t was no sooner
in mg head than I cast my eye upon a little bill, which sufii-
cien y overlooked the sea both ways and from whence I had
a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way
I was to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south int of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by t e shore of
the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the

north side of the island in my'return, and I should do well
enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morn-
ing, to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself
for the night in my canoe under the great watch-coat I men-
tioned, I aunched out. Ifirst made a little out to sea full
north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set
eastward. and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did

not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done be
fore, so as to take from menu government of the boat; but.
havu'iig a strong steerage With my paddle, I went at a great
rate irectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came
up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the shi , which, by
its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in tween two
rocks' all the stern and uarter of her were beaten to pieces
with the sea; and as her orecastle, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremust
were brought by re board, that is to say, broken short ofl"
but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me; I took him
into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it
like a ravenous wolf that had been starvmg a fortnight in the
snow; Ithen gave the roar creature some fresh water, with
which, if I would have et him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as isin-
deed probable, that when the ship struck, it bein in a storm, "
the sea broke so high, and so continually over r, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the cone

that had life; nor any g s, that I could see, but what were
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor,
whether wme or brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but
they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which
I believed belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of ,
them into the boat, without examining what was in them. Had
the stern of the ship been fixed and the forepart broken ofi', I
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage; for, by what
I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship

nad'a great deal of wealth on board; and, if 1 may guess from
the course she steered she must have been bound from Buenos
Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata in the south part of America,
beyond the Brazils, to the IIavanna, in the Gulf of Mexico,
and so gerha s to Spain. She had, no doubt a great treasure
in her, ut o no use, at that time, to any bod ; and what he-
came of her crew, I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests a little cask full of ligpor, of
about tweiitv gallons, which I got into my boat wi much
difficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a
great powder~horn, with about four pounds of powder in it:
as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I lefi them,
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,
a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and With
this cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning
to make home again; and the same evening, about an
hour within night, I reached the island again, weary and
fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the
boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbor what I had fit
in my new cave and not carry it home to my castle. A r
refreshing myself, I got all my car 0 on shore and began to
examine the articulars. The cas of ligluor Ifound to bet:
kind of rum, at not such as we had at e Brazils, and, in a
word not at all good; but when I came to open the chests, I
found several things of teat use to me: for example, I found
in one a fine case of bott es, of an extraordinary kind, and filled
with cordial'waters, fine and very ood; the bottles held about
three ints each, and were tip with silver. I found two
puts 0 very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on
the top, that the salt water had not hurt them; and two more
of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me' and about a

ozen and a half of white [men handkerchiefs and colored
iieckcloths; the former were also very welcome, bemg_ex-
ceedin refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides
this, w en I came to the till in the chest, I found there three,_,,,' t'wfm, . wwxw-quw

great bags of pieces-of-eight, which held about eleven hundred

ieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper six

oubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I
suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In the other
chest were some clothes, but of little value; but by the cir-
cumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate;
though there was no powder in it, exec t two pounds of fine
glazed powder, in three small flasks, ept suppose, for
charging their fowling--pieces on occasron. Upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for,
as to the money,I had no manner of occasion for it; it was
to me as the dirt under in feet; and I would have given it all
for three or four pair of nglish shoes and stockings, which
were things] greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for
many years. I had indeed got two pair of shoes now, which
I took off the feet of the two drowned men whoml saw in
the wreck, and Ifound two pair more in one of the chests,
which were very welcome to me; but they were not like our
EleIiSh shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
c pumps than shoes. 1 found in this seaman's chest about
fifty pieces-of-eight in rials, but no gold: I suppose this be-
longed to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong
to some officer. Well, however, I lagged this money home to
my cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before, which ]
brought from our own ship : but it was :2 great pity, as I
said that the other part of this ship had not come to my share;
for I am satisfied 1 mi ht have loaded my canoe several times
over with money; an , thought 1, if I ever escape to England
it might lie here safe enough till I may come again an
fetch it.

Having now brought all my things on shore and secured
them I went back to m boat and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old har r, w ere I laid her up. and made the
best of my way to m old habitation, where I found every
thing safe and quiet. began now to repose myself, live after
mingld fashion, and take care of my family afi'airs; and, for a
w , l hved easy enough, only that I was more Vigilant than
I used to be looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so
much; and III at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
alwaysto the east part of the island, where ,was retty well
satisfied the savages_never came, and where I co d o with-
out so many recautions, and such a load of arms an ammu-
nition as I ways carried with me if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky
head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my
body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects
and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from
- this island; for sometimes I was for making another vo a
to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was no iii;
lefi there worth the hazard of my voy e; sometimes for a
ramble one way, sometimes another; an I believe verily, if I
. had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ven~
tured to sea, bound any where, I knew not whither. I have
been, in all my circumstances, a nurmento to those who are
touched with the neral plague of mankind whence, for
aught I know, one alf of their miseries flow: I'mean that of
not being satisfied with the station wherein God and nature
hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my primitive
condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the 0 position
to which was, as I ma call it, my original sin, m ~su sequent

able planters m the razils; nay,I am persuaded, that by the
Improvements I had made in that little time I lived there,'and

I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores; and

them at our own door from those whose business it was to
fetch them? and though it had cost us something more, yet
the difference of that rice was by no means worth saving at
so reat a hazard. lgut as this is usually the fate of young
hea s, so reflection upon the folly of it is as commonly the ex-
ercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex erience of time '
so it was with me now; and yet so deep had PSe mistake taken
root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means and possrbil-
ity of my escape from this place; and that I may, with the
greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part
of my story, it may not be improper to ive some account of
my first conceptions on the subject of t is foolish scheme for
my escape, and how, and u on what foundation, I acted.

am now to be suppose retired into my castle, after my
late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid u and secured under
water, as usual, and in condition restore to what it was be-
fore: I had more we th, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than the
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island
of solitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake; very
well in health, had no pain, no istemper, no uneasiness of
boduly nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but
co d by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no,
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows :--It is im-
possible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that
whirled through- that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
memory, in this night's time. I ran over the whole history of
my life in miniature or b abrid ment, as I may call it, to my
coming to this islan , an also 0 that part of my life since l
came to this island. In my reflections 'upon the state of my
case since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing
the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of m hab.
itation here comdpared to the life of anxiety, fear, an care,

e

which I had live in. ever since I had seen print of a foo'

in the sand; not that 1 did not believe the savages had fre-
quented the island even all the while,.and might have been

several hundreds of them, at times on shore there; but I had
never known it, and was incaFable of an apprehensions about
it: my satisfaction was per ect, thong my danger was the
same, and I was as happy in not knowingrmy danger as if 1
had never really been exposed to it. his furnished my
thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particu-
larly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which
has provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow
bounds to his sight and knowled of things; and 'thou h
he walks in the midst of so many t ousand dangers, the sig t
of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink
his spirits he is kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dan-
gers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me,_l
came to reflect seriousldv; upon the real dan r I had been in
for so many years in is very island, and ow I had walked
about in the greatest security, and With all possible tranquil-
lity, even when perhaps nothm but the brow of a bill, a great
tree, or the casual a proach 0 night, had been between me
and the worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and sav es, who would have seized on me
with_the same view as I wo d on a goat or a turtle, and have
thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I did
of a pigegn or curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, If I
should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver,
to whose singular rotection I acknowledged with rest hu-
milit , all these unknown deliverances were due, an Without
whic I must have inevitably fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creature i,
I mean the savages, and how it came to pass in the world, that
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his creag
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to somethin so much below

even brutality imelf, as to devour its own ' d; but as this-

ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to in uire, what part of the world these wretches lived in ;
how far otI'l the coast was, from whence they came; what they
ventured over so far from home for; what kind of boats they
had; and -why I might not order myself and my business so,
that I might be as able to go over thither as they were to
come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I went thither; what would be-
come of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I
should escape from them, if they attacked me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attacked by some or other of them, without any possi-
bilit of delivering in 'self; and if I should not fall into their
ban 5, what I shoul do for provision, or whither I should
bend my course: none of these thoughts, I say, so much as
came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent u n the no-
tion of my passing over in my boat to the main lan . I looked
upon my present condition as the most miserable that could
possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into any thing,

ut death, that could be called worse; and if I reached the
shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might
coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to some
inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian. ship
that might take me in; and if the worst came to the worst,ll
could but die, which would put an end to all these iseries at
once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbe mind, an
impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long con-
tinuance of my troubles, and the disap ointments I had met
in the wreck I had been on board of an where I had been so
near obtaining what I so earnestly lon ed for, viz. somebody
to speak to, and to learn some knowle ge from them of the
place where I was, and of the probable means of my deliver-
ance: l was agitated wholly by these thoughts: all my calm
pf mind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the
Issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended
and I had, as it were, no war to turn my thoughts to any
thing but to the project 0 a voyage to the main; which came
upon me with such foice, and such an impetuosity of desire,
that it was not to be resisted. V

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment,
and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely With
the extraordinary fervor of .my mind about it, nature as if. I
had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thou ht of it

should have dreamed of it; but 1 did not, nor of any thing rela-

ting to it: but I dreamed that as I was goinglout in the morn-'

ing, as usual, from my castle, I saw u n e shore two ca-
noes and eleven savages coming to Ian , and that they brought
with them another savage, whom they were going to lull, in
order to eat him' when, on a sudden, the savage that the

were oing to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and

thong t, in m sleep, that he came running into my little
thick grove be ore my fortification, to hide himself; and, that
I, seeing him alone, and not Perceiving that the others sought
him that way, showed mysel to him and smiling upon him,
encouraged him; that he kneeled down to me, seeming to
praag me to assist him; upon which I showed him my ladder,
m e him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he be-
came my servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, 1
said to myself "Now~I may certainly venture to the main
land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me
what to do, and whither. to go for provisions, and whither not
to for fear of being devoured; what places to venture into,
an what to shun". waked with this thought; and was um

threw me into a very great ejection of s irits. ~
Upon thisgthowever, I made this conc usion; that my only

a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should brin hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with t is difficulty, that it was imposstble to efl'ect
this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killin
them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and
might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scruplctl
.ne lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the
houghts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my de-
liverance. I need not repeat the arguments which occurred
.0 me a ainst this, they being the same mentioned before; but
though had other reasons to offer now, viz. that those men
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could;
that it was self-preservation in the highest degree, to deliver
myself from this death of a ife, and was acting in my own de-
fence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the
like; I say, though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts
of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very ter-
rible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile my-
self to for a great while. However, at last, after many secret
disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for
all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my
head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of de Iverance at
length mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to et
one of those savages into my hands, cost what It would. Iy
next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was
very difficult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no
probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the
watch, to see them when they came on' shore, and leave the
rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity
shouid present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon
the scout as ofien as ossible, and indeed so often, that I was
heartily tired of it; or it was above a year and a half that I
waited; and for great part of that 'time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost every
day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was very

..r,.-.3_dxtwrm1w
discouragn , and began to trouble me much ; tnough I cannot
say that it 'd in this case (as it had done some time before)
wear off the ed e of my destre to the thing; but the longer it
seemed to be de ayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word,
I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, as'I was now eager to be upon
them. Besides, I fancied m self able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I ha them, so as to make them en-
tirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and
'o_ prevent their being able at an time to do me any hurt. It
was a great while that I lease myself with this affair; but
nothing still presented: my fancies and schemes. came to
nothing, for no sav es came near me for a_great while. _
About a year an a half after I entertained these notions
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them allunto
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execution),
I was surprised, one morning early, with seein no less than
five canoes all on shore together on my side e island and
the peo le who belonged to them all landed, and out 01' my
sight. be number of them broke all my measures; for see-
ing so many, and knowing that the alwayscame four or six
or sometimes more, in a boat, I co d not tell what to think 0
it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty
men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and
discomforted: however, I put myself into all the same postures
for an attack that I had formerly provided and was just ready
for action, if any thing had presented. Having waited a good
while, listening to hear if they made any noise at len ,
being ver im atient, I set my guns at the foot of, my lad er,
and clam re up to the top of the hill, by my _two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they couldnot perceive me by any
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective-glass
that they were no less than thirty in number; that they had
a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they
had cooked it, I.knew_not, or what it was; but they were. , ,ywtmwfl'rw'

figpvres, their own way, round the fire. _

'hile l was thus looking on them 1 perceived, by mid?!-
spective, two miserable wretches dragged from the ts,
where, it seems, the were laid by, and were now brou ht out
for the slau hter. perceived one of them immediate y fall,
being knoc ed down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword,
--for that was their way,--and two or three others were at work
immediately, cuttin him open for their cookery, while the
other victim was le standing by himself, till they should be
ready for him. In that very moment, this poor wretch seeing
himself a little at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired him
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran
with incredible swiftness alon the sands, directly towards me;
I mean towards that part of the coast where m habitation
was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknow edge, when
I perceived him run my way, and especially when, as I
thought, I saw him fpursued by the whoe body: and now I
expected that part 0 my dream was coming to pass, and that
he would certainly take shelter in my grove: but I could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it viz.
that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits be-
gan to recover, when I found that there was not above three
men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged when
I found that he outstrigped them exceedingly in running,
and gained ound of em; so that if he could but hold it
{fit haifi an our, I saw easily he would fairly get away from

em .

There was between them and m'y castle the creek, which I
mentioned often in the first part 0 my story, where I landed
my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must
necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken
there: but when the savage escaping came thither, he made

and ran on with exceedina strength and swrfiness. When the
three persons came to the creek, I found that two of them
could swim, but the third could not, and that, standin on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no far r, and
soon after went softly back ain ; which, as it ha pened, was
very well for him in the en . I observed, that e two who
swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that
now was the time to get me a servant, and perha s a com-
panion or assistant, an thatI was called plainl by rovidence
to save this poor creature's life. I immediate y ran down the
ladders with all possible ex dition, fetched m two ns,--for
the were both at the foot 0 the ladders, as I o serve abtfle,--

hill,I crosse towards the sea, and having'a very short cut,
and all down hill, placed myself in .the way between the pur-
suers and the pursued hallooing aloud to him 'that fled, who,
looking back, was at first, perhaps, as much frightened at me
as at them: but I beckoned with my hand to him to' come

I knocked him down with the stock of my iece. I was
loath to fire, because I Would not have the rest ear' thou h,

down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been

nearer,I perceived presently he had a bow and anew, and
was fitting it to shoot at me: sb I was then necessitated to
shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.

at the man, as if I would shoot him; upon this my savage (for
so I call him now), made a motion to me to lend- him my sword,
which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no:

heads even with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow
too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me, in
sign of trium h, and brou ht me the sword again, and with
abundance o gestures, w "ch I did not understand, laid it
down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just
before me. But that which astonished him most, was to
know how I killed the other Indian so far off: so, pointing
to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade
him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one side,
then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had made,
which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made
a hole, and no great uantity of blood had followed; but he
had bled inwardly, or he was quite dead. He took up
his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me, makinn' signs to him
that more might come after them. Upon this, he made signs
to me that he should bury them with sand, that the might
not be seen by the rest, if the followed ; and so I ma e signs
to him again-to do so. He fel to work; and in an instant he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to
bury the first in, and then drag ed him into it, and covered
him; and did so by the other so: I believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, 1
carried him, not to my castle, but uite away to my cave, on
the farther fpart of the island; so I did not let my dream come
to pass in t at part, viz. that he came into my grove for shel-
ter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of rajsms to eat, and'
' a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis-
tress for, by his running; zuid having refreshed him, I made
si us for him to o and lie down to sleep, showing him to a
p ace where I ha laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it,
which 1 used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the poor crea-
ture lay down, and went to sleep.

.He was a comer .handsome fellow, perfect] well made,
mth straight, strong lunbs, not too large, tall, an well shaped;
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had I"'9' 52';.'-,:.~deg"""SS-:':'rWM:"WG"WWMW' "" "'"msstwmrmawymw'a

seemed to have somethin very manly in his face; and yet he
had all the sweetness an softness of an Euro an in his coun-
tenance too, especiall when he smiled. 5 hair was Inn
and black not curl like wool ' his forehead very high an
large; and a reat vivacity and sparkling shar ness in his 3
eyes. The co or of his skin was not quite blac , but vary 3

Brazdians and Vir nians and other natives of America are,
but of a bright kin of a dun olive color, that had in it some-
thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe." His

face was round angoglump' his nose small, not flat like the g...'
Negroes; a very g mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well ifi
set, and as white as ivory. _ f,'

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an .gl
hour, he awoke again, and came out ,of the cave to me, for l "'1

had been milking my goats, which I had in the inclosure just
, by: when he espied me, he came runnizilg to me, laying him-
self down ain upon the ground, with the posmble signs
of an humb e, thankful disposition, making a great many antic
gestures to show it. {it last, he lays his head flat upon the
ground, close to in? foot, and sets my other foot upon his head,
as he had dope be ore; and after this, made all the signs to me
of sub'ection, servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me
know _ow he would serve me so long as he lived. I under-
stood him in many thinks, and let him know I was very well
pleased with him. In aalittle time I began to s ak tohim,
and teach him to speak to me; and first, I let 'm know his
name should be meur, which was the day I saved his life; I
called him so for the memory of- the time. I likewise taught
him to sa Master ; and then let him know that was to be my
name: I fkewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know
the meanin of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen
pot, and let ' see me drink it before him, and sop in bread
in it' and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, w 'ch he
uickly complied with, and made si s that it wasvery good
or him. I kept there with him all at night ; but as soon as. WT" "'.'YW---mv'---

it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him
know I would glve him some clothes; at which he seemed very

lad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where
he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place,
and showed me the marks that he had made to find them ain.
making signs to me that we should dig them up again, an eat
them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhor-
rence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away; which he did
immediately, with great submission. I then led him up to the
top of the hill to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw lainly the place'where they
had been, but no appearance of em or their canoes; so that
it was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades
behind them, Without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but havin now
more 'courage, and consequently more curiosity, I too m
man Friday with me, givin him the sword in his hand, wi
the bow and arrows at his ack, which I fbund he could use
very dextrousl , making him carry one gun for me, and I
two for mysel ; and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to et some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the p ace, my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk Within
me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful
sight at least it was so to me, though Fridagomade nothing of
it. 'I'he place was covered with uman nes, the ground
dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and
there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all
the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victor over their enemies. I saw three skulls
live hands, and the nes of three or four le 3 and feet, and
abundance of other parts of the bodies: an Friday, by his
signs, made me understand that they brought over our pris-
oners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and
that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next king, whee~

subject, it seems, he had been one of, and that they had taken
a great number of prisoners; all which were carried to several

laces by those who had taken them in the fight, in order to
east 11 n them as .was done here by these wretches upon
those ey brought hither.

I caused Fri ay to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together in a hea , and
make a great fire 11 on it, and burn them all to as es. 1
' found Friday had ' a hankerin stomach after some of the
. flesh, and was still a cannibal 'm is nature; but I discovered
'so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least
appearance of. it, that he durst not discover it' for I .had,

by some means, let him know, that I would kiil him if he
offered it. > n '

When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and
there I fell to work for my man Friday; and, first of all, I
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor
gunner's chest I mentionefiwhich I found in the wreck and
which, with a little alteratrOn, fitted him very well; and then I
made him a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill would
allow (for I was now grown a tolerable good tailor) ;, and 1
gave him a ca , which I made of hare's skin, very convenient
and fashionab e enou h; and thus he was clothed for the pres-
ent, tolerably Well, an was mighty well pleased to see himself
almost as well clothed as his master. It is true,~he went awki

wardly in these clothes at first; wearin the drawers was very . .

awkward to him, and the sleeves of e waistcoat galled his
shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them
where he complained they hurt him, and using. himself to
them, he took to them at length very well. '

The next da after I came home to my hutch with him, I
began to consi er where I should lod e him; and that I might
do well for him, and aft be perfec y easy myself, I made a
httle tent for him in e vacant place betw'veen'my two fortifia
cations, in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first,
As there was a door or entrance there intomy cave, Imade _a
formal framed door-case. and a door'to it of boards, and set It
up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and, causing
the door to 0 en in the inside, I barred. it up in the night,
taking in my adders too; so that Frida could no way come
at me in the inside of my innermost wal , without making so
much noise in getting over that it must needs waken me; for
my first wall had now a complete roof over it of Ion poles,
covering all my tent, and leaning u to the Side of t e bill;
which was again laid across with sm ler sticks, instead of laths,
and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw,
which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which
was lefi to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
trap-door, which, if it had been attem ted on the outside
would not have opened at all, but would ave fzdlen down, and
made a great norse: as to weapons, I took them all into my
side every night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or designs
perfectly obliged and eng ed; Es very affections were tie

to me like those of a chil to a father; and I dare say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the savin mine, upon any
occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies e ave me of this
put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me t at I needed to
use no precautions, as to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that, however it had pleased God, in his providence,
and in the government of the works of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the
same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kind-
ness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of
wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all
the capacities of doing good, and receivin good, that he has
given to us; and that when he pleases to of er them occasions
of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply
them to the right uses for which they were bestowed, than we
are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting' 5 '- "maceranwfrvw

ROBINSON CRUSOE. , 217

 

as theseveial occasions presented how mean a use we make
of all these, even though we have these powers enlightened by
the great lam of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the g
knowledge of 's word added to our understanding; and why
it has pleased God to hide the like savmg knowledge frdm so
many millions of souls, who if I might judge by this poor .~,
savage, would make a muc better use of it than we did. 43
From hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the'sove-
reignty of Providence, and as it were arraign the justice of so. ii
arbitrary a. dis ition of things, that should hide that hght a;
from some, an reveal it to others, and et expect a hke dirt ,a
from both; but I shut it up, and chec ed my thou hts,wi
this conclusion : first That we did not know by w at light
and law these should be condemned; but that as God was ne-'
cessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely hol and
just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were sen-
tenced to absence from himself, it was on account of sinning
against that light which, as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would ac-
knowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discov-'
ered to us; and, secondly,
the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, " Why ast
thou formed me thus? "

. But to return to my new comgianion :--I was greatly de-
lighted with him, and made it my usiness to teach him eveli'rly
thing that was proper to.make him useful, handy, and helpf '
but especially to make him speak, and understand me when
spoke: and he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and par-
ticularly wasso merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk tohim. Now, my life
began to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could
I but have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place where I lived.

After I had'been two or three da 5 returned to my castle,'I J

thought that, in order to bring Fri ay of from his horrid way "
of feeding, antligfi'om the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought j

hatstill'asweallarethecla in
to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending tokill a kid out
of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but as I was
going, I saw a she- oat lying down in the shade, and two
youn kids sitting by er. I catched hold of Friday ;--" Hold
said ; stand 5 ' ;' and made signs to him not to stir : imme-
diately I presented my piece shot, and killed one of the kids.
The poor creature, who had at a distance, indeed, seen me
kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know nor'could im-
agine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised trembled and
shook, and looked so amazed, that thought he Would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or rceive 1
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel w ether he
was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was
resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down to me,
and embracin Inf knees, said a great many things I did not
understand; at could easily see the meaning was, to pray
me not to kill him.

I soon'found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed I loaded my gun
again. By and b , I saw a great fowl like a hawk, sitting
upon a tree, wi in shot - so, to let I'riday understand a
little what I would do, 1 called him to me ain, ointed at the
fiiwl, which was indeed a parrot, though I t oug t it had been
a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot and to my gun, and to
the ound under the parrot, to let him see I would make it
fall made him understand that I would shoot and kill that
bird; accordingly I fired and bade him look, and immediately
he saw the garrot fall. He. stood like one frightened again,
notwithstan ingeall I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, cause he did-- not see me put any thin into
the gun, but thought that there must be some wonder fund
of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,
bird," any thing near or far of; and- the astonishment this

:fimamw his... Augsmwfi.-WmWat-.mgnnnrmasmf than";
treated in him was such as could not wear of for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have wor-
shipped me and my on. As for the on itself, he would not
so much as touch it r several days her; but he would speak
to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him,when he was by
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of ' him, was to desire
it not to kill him. Well after his astonishment was a little
over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch thebird I had
shot, which he did, but staid some time; for the parrot, not
being quite dead, had fluttered away a distance from the
lace where she fell: however he foun her, took her .up,~and
rought her to me; and as I had" perceived his ignorance
about the gunbefore, I took this advantage to charge the gun
again, and not tolet him see me do it, that I might be ready for
any other mark that might present - but nothing more offered at
that time; so I brou ht home the kid and the, same evening I
took the skin ofi', an out it out as well as I could ;- 'and havrng , .
a pot fit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh,
and made'some very good broth. After I had begun to eat-
some I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, '
and like it very well 5 but that which-was strangest'to him,
was to see me eat salt With it. He made a sign to me thatthe salt
was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own month,
he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputterat it,
washin his mouth with fresh water after it': on the>> other
hand, took some meat into my month without salt, and l
retended to s it and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had
one at the_s ta but it would not do; he would never care for
salt With his meat or in his.broth; at least, not for a great
while, and then but a very little; . '; J . 5 "-
, Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was re-
solved to feast him the next day with wasting a piece of the
End; this I did, by hanging it before the fire on a striflg, as I
nad seen many people do in England, setting two poles up '
one on each _side of the 'fire, and one- across on the top','-an
tying the string to . cross stick, letting the' meat turn con- ,
Imually. This Fri ay admired very-much? but when ihe._>>*'.
came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand him: and at
last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out,
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of; for after thatI let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed in-
stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked
out alarger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very will-
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I told
him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough
for him and myself too. He a peared very sensible of that

art, and let me know that he ought I had much more la-
bor upon me on his account, than I had for myself; and that
he svould work the harder tor me, if I would tell him what
to o.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place: Friday began to talk retty well, and understand the
names of almost every thing I ad occasmn to call for and of
every place I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me ;
so that, in short, I began now tohave some use for my ton ue
again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, t at
is to say, about speech. Besides the tpleasure of talking to
him, I had a singular satisfaction in e fellow himself: his
simple unfeigned honesty a peared to me more and more
every da , and I began re y to love the creature; and, on
his side, m'ieve he loved me more than it was possible for
him ever to iove any thing before.

I had a mind once to try if he had anyhankering inclination

to his own country again; and having taught him En lish so
well that he could answer me almost any question, asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle? At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we al-
ways fight the better; " that is, he meant, always get the bet-
ter in fight; and so we began the followin discourse :--

Master. You alwa 5 fight the better ; ow came you to be
taken risoner, then, riday'i

Fri ay. My nation beat much for all that.

lilastcr. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken?

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me: my nation
overbeat them in the yonder place, where me no was: there
my nation take one, two great thousand.

Master. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then'l

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go
in the canoe - m nation have no canoe that time.

Master. We , Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them,
as these did?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up.

Master. Where do the carry them?

Fri . Go to other p ace where they think. '

Master. Do they come hither?

IFriday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
p ace.

Master. Have ou' been here with them?

Friday. Yes, have been here (points to the N. W. side
of the island, which, it seems, was their sideg.

By this I understood that my man Friday ad former] been
among the savages who used to come on shore on the arther
part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions he was
now brought for; and, some time after, when I took the cour-
age to carry him to thatside, being the same I formerly men-
tioned, he presently knew the place, and told mehe was there {

once when they ate it) twenty men, two women, and one
child : he could not tcllI twenty in English, but he numbered
them, by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me
to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows,
that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him how far
it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes
were not often lost. He told me there was no danger, nc
canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out to sea, there
was a current and wind, always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no more than
the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux
ofthe mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which
river, as I found afterwards, on; island lay; and that this land
which I terceived to the \V. and N. W. was the great island
Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhab-
it mts, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he told
me all he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. I
asked him the names of the several nations of his sorLof people,
but could get no other name than Caribs: ti'om whence I
easily understood, that these were the Caribhees, which our
maps place on the part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Qroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St.
Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the moon.
that was, beyond the settin of the moon, which must be west
from their country, there welt white-bearded men, like me,
and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans that was his word); b '
all which I understood, he meant the )aniards, whose cruel-
ties in America had been spread over the whole country, and
were remembered by all the nations, from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me howI might go from this island
and get among those white men: he told me, " Yes, yes, you
may 0 in two canoe." 1 could not understand what he meant,
or mgke him describe to me what he meant by two canoe:WWW\WWWWV.':H 'zl -- v r~<- - , ~~ ~

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2533

till, at last, with great difficulty, I found he. meant it must be
in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Frida 's
discourse began to relish with me very well; and from t is
time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might
lind' an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind: particularly I asked him, one time, who made him.
The oor creature did not understand me at all, but thou ht
l hail) asked him who was his father: but 1 took it up y
another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground
we walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me, it was

one old Benamuckee, that li. :d beyond all; he could describe ,

nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, much
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the
stars. I asked him, then, if this old person had made all things,
why did not all things worship him. He looked very grave,
and with a erfect look of innocence said, " All things say 0
to him." asked him if the people who die in his country
went away any where. He said, yes; they all went to
Benamuckee: then I asked him whether these they eat up
went thither too. He said, yes.

From these thin s I began to instruct him in the knowledge of
the true God : I to d him that the great Maker of all things ived
up there ( ointing up towards heaven) ;' that be governed the
world by t e same power and providence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, an could do every thing for us,
Ewe every thing to us, take "all? thing from us; and thus,

y degrees, I opened his eyes. e listened with great atten-
tion, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ
being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our
irayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even in heaven.

e told me one day, that if our God could hear us up be and

] ende: IIorI-Il to cle 1r up this i'r' 111d to 1111' man Friday; and
told him, that the pretence oi their old men going up to the
mountains tos sa) 0 to their god Benalnuckee 11 as I1 cheat;
and their brillLtilifl' word irom thence what he said was tnucli
more so: that it theI met with any I111s11er,or s )ake with any
one there, it must he with an evil spirit. and t Ieu I entered
into I1 lon<<r discourse with him about the deIil, the original of
hint, his rebellion against God, his I. umitI' to man, the reason

of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to
he \Iorship 10d instead oi God, and as God, and the mam"
stratagems 1e1111de use of to delude mankind to their ruin;
how he had a secret access to our passions and to our aii'ec-
tions, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to
cause us men to be our own tempters, and run upon our de-
struction l)_\' our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the IleIil, as it was about the being of a God. na-
ture assisted all 1111 arguments to eIiIlence to him even the
necessity of a "re It First Cause, and merruling, goverrin
Power, a secret directinn' Pr'oIidence, and of the a uity an

ustice of [111) ill'_',' homage to him that made us, and the like;
but there appeared nothing oi this kind 111 the notion of an evil
spirit; oi his orig nal, his being, his nature, and, above all.
of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do sotoo;
and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by
a question merely natural'and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the power of God, his omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his
being a consuming fire to the workers of ini uity ; how, as he
had made us all, he could destroy us and ' the world in a
moment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while. oAi'ter this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enem ' in the hearts of men, and used all his malice
and skill to de eat the good designs of Providence, and to
ruin the kintrdom of Christ in the world, and the like.
" Well," saysit'riday, " but you say God is so strong, so great;
is he not much strong, much might as the devil "-- ' Yes,
)'( s," says I, " Friday, God is stronger than the devil : God is
above the devil; and therefore we pray to God to tread him
down under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations
and quench his fiery darts."--" But," says he gain, " if God
much stronger, much might as the devil, why 0d no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked?" I was strangely
surprised at this question ; and, after all, thou h I was now an
old man. yet I was but a young doctor, and il qualified for a
casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and, at first, 1 could not tell
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him
what he said; but he was too earnest for an answer, to forget his
question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and 1
said, " God will at last punish him severely ; he is reserved for
the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell
with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday; but he
returns upon me, repeating my words, " Reserve at last! me
no understand: but why not kill the devil now; not kill great
ago'!"--" You may as well ask me," said I, " why God does
not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here that ofi'end
him : we are preserved to re ent and be pardoned." He
mused some time on this: " well, well," says he, mighty af-

fection itely, " that well : so y<i)u, I, devil, all wicked, all pro-
serve, repent, God pardon all." Here I was run down gain
by him to the last degree ; and it was a testimony to me, ow
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable
creatures to the knowledge of a (rod, and of a worship or hom-
age due to the supreme being of God, as the consequence of
our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowled e of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for
us, of a gladiator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor
at the footstool of God's throne; I say, nothing but a revelation
from Heaven can form these in the soul; and that therefore,
the G05 el of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I mean the
Word 0 God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide
and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary in-
structors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God,
and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of
going out; then sendin him for somethin a good way off, I
seriously rayed to G that he would ena le me to instruct
savinglyt is poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit, the heart
of the oor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowl-
edge 0 God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his con-
science might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul
saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long dis-
course with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by
the Savior of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel

reached from heaven, viz. of re entance towards God, and

aith in our blessed Lord Jesus. Ithen explained to him, as
well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on him
the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for
that reason, the allen angels had no share in the redem tron;
thatllie came only to the ost sheep of the house of Isr , and
t e 1 e.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this r creature's instruction, and must
acknowledge, what I b 'eve all that act upon the same prin-
ciple will find, that, in layin things open to him, I reall in-
formed and instructed myse f in many thin s that either did
not know, or had not fully considered be ore, but which oc-
curred naturally to my mind upon searchin into them, for
the information of this poor savage; and I h more affection
in my inquiry alter things upon this occasion than ever I felt
before; so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better
for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me' my habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I reflect,-
ed, that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had
not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek
to the hand that had brou ht me here, but was nowto be
made an instrument, under firovidence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him tothe
true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine that
he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; f say,
when reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through
ever part of my soul, and I frequenatliy rejoiced that ever I
was rought to this place, which I h so often thought the
most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have be-
fallen me.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which em loyed the hours between
Friday and me was such as made Ere three'years which we
lived there together perfectly and com letely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can formed in a sublu-
nary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much
better than I; though have reason to hope, and blessGod
for it, that we were equal] penitent and comforted, restored
penitents. We had here t ie word of God to read and no far-
ther off from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in
England. I always applied meself in reading the Scripture
to at him know, as well as could, the meaning of what
read; and he again, b his serious inquiries and questionings;
made me, as I said he ore, a much better scholar in the Scrip-
ture knowledge than I should ever have been by my own men

private reading. Another thing 1 cannot refrain from observ-
ing here also, rom experience in this retired part .of my life,
viz. how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the
knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ
Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to
be received and understood, that as the bare reading~ the
Scripture made me capable of understanding enough 0 my
duty to carry me directly on to the reat work of sincere re-
pentance for my sins, and laying ho] of a Savior for hfe and
salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to
all God's commands, and this without any teacher or instruct-
or, I mean human ; so the same plain instruction sufficiently
served to the enlirrhtening this savage creature, and bringing
him to be such a Eliristian, as I have known few equal to im
in my life.

As to all the disputes, wranglin , strife, and contention,
which have happened in the worl about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church government, they
were all perfectly useless to us and, for aught I can yet see,
they have been so to the rest oil the world. We had the sure

uide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had, blessed be

ad, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teachin and in-
structing us by his word, leading us into all truth, an makin
us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his wor .
And I cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of .
the disputed points of religion, which have made such confu-
sions in the world, would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it.--But I must go on with the historical part of things,
and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak

retty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted

'm with my own history, or at least so much ofat as related to
my coming to this place; how I had lived here, and how long : I
let him Into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder
and bullet, and tau ht him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was won erfully delighted with; and I made him I
belt, with a fr hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in; an in the fr , instead of a hanger, I gave him a -'
hatchet, which was not on y as good a weapon, in some cases,-
but much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Euro , particularly
England, which I came from; how we live , how we wor-
shi ped God, how we behaved to one another, and how' we '
tra ed in ships to all arts of the world. I gave him ah account a
of the wreck which had been on board of, and showed him, as '
near as I could, the (place where she lay ; butshe was all beaten '
in pieces before, an gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat, 3
which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir 1'
with my whole strength then; but was now fallen almost all "
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a i
great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he 1
studied upon. At last, says e, " Me see such boat like come I
to lace at m nation." 1 did not understand him a food a:
wh e; but, at ast when I had examined farther'into it, un- '
derstood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on g
shore upon the country where he lived; that is, as be ex- a;
plained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I'pres- .51
ently imagined that some Euro can ship must have been cast 35
away 11 on their coast, and tile boat might get loose, and 5
drive as lore; but was so dull, that I never once thou ht of t
men making their escape from a wreck thither, muc less '3
whence they might come : so I only inquired after a descrip- 5
tion of the boat. . - , f!

Friday described the boat to me well enou h; but brought 3'-
me better to understand him when he ded with some
' warmth, "We save the white mans from drown."' Then I
presently asked him, if there were any white mans (as he
called them) in the boat. "Yes," he said' " the .'boat full
of white mans." I asked him how many. he told u n his
fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became 0 them.
He told me, " They live, they dwell at my nation.'.' . . a;

This ut new thou hts into my head ; for I presently nn-A

agnned t at these mig t be the men belonging to the ship that
was cast away in the sight of my island (as I now called it) ;
and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw
her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat and
were landed upon that wild shore among the sav es. lilpon
this, I inquired of him more critical] what was come of
them; he assured me they lived stilly there; that they had
been there about four. ears; that the savagles let them alone,
and gave them victu s to live on. 1 aske him how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them. He said, " No,
they make brother with them ; " that is, as I understood him,
a truce; and then he added, " They no eat mans but when
make the war fight; " that is to say, the never eat any men
but such as come to fight with them, an are taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that being upon
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence,
as I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or
continent of America, Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind
of surprise, falls ajumping and dancing, and calls out to me--
for l was at some distance from him. I asked him what was
the matter. " 0 joy ! " says he; " 0 glad! there see my
country, there my nation ! " 1 observed an extraordinary
sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled,
and his countenance discovered a strange ea erness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again. 'I'his observation
of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me
at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his reli ion, but
all his obligation to me, and would be forward eno'ug to give
his countrymen an account of me, and come back perhaps
with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast u on me, at
which he might be as merry as he used to be with t ose of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the
poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry
afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held me
tome weeks, I was a little more crrcumspect, and not so'1'" "31""??va

Familiar 'and kind tohim as before; in which Iwas certainlyin
the wron too; the honest, grateful creature, having no
thought a ut it, but what conSisted With the best principles,
both as a religious-Christian and as a grateful friend; as ap-
peared afterwards, to my full satisfaction. '

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day umping him, to see if he would discover an of the
new thoug ts which I suspected were in him; but found
every thing he said was so honest and so innocent,.that I could
find nothing' to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he, in the least, rceive that I was uneasy, and therefore
I could not sus iect im of deceit. '

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to
him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself in our own
countr , your own nation'l"--"Yes," he said, "I much
0 gla to be at my own nation."--"What would you do
there'! " said I; " would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh

sin, and be a savzfie, as you were before?" He looked full
0 concern, and sh ing his head, said, " No, no, Friday tell
them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat
corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no eat man ain."--" Why
then," said I to him, " they will kill you." e looked grave
at that, and then said, " No, no; they no kill me' they Willing
love learn." He meant b this, they would be willing to ,
learn. He added "They earn much of the bearded mans
that came in the boat." Then I asked him if he would go
back to them. , He smiled at that and told me that he could not
smm so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. He-
told me he woulwddgo, if I would go with him. " I go!" says
i, " why, they ' eat me if I come there."--3'No, no," says'
he, "me make they no eat you; me make they much love
you."_ He meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them love
me Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they

were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called
them, who came on shore there in distress.

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over and
see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, I
made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portu uese; not doubting
but if I could, we might find some me ad to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good company to
gether, better t an I could from an island forty miles oil
the shore, and alone, without help. So, alter some dAys, I
took Friday to work again by wa of discourse ; and told him
I would give him a boat to go baclt to his own nation; and ac-
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always
kept it sunk in water) I brou ht it out, showed it him, and
we both went into it. I found he was a most dextrous fellow
at managing it, and would make it 0 almost as swift again as
I could. So when he was in, I sai to him. " Well, now, Fri-
day, shall we go to your nation? " He looked very dull at my
saying so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat
too small to go so far: I then told him I had a bi ger; so the
next day I went to the place where the first boat ay which 1
had made, but which I could not get into the water. He said
that was big enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it,
and it had ain two or three and twenty years there, the sun
had so split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday

told me such a boat would do veg well, and would carry
alriiuch enough vittle, drink, bre :" that was his way of
mg.
_Upon the whole, 1 was by this time so fixed upon in de-
sign of oing over with him to the continent, that l-tol him
we wo. dgo and make one as big as that, and he should go
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave
and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. He
asked me again, " Why you angry mad with Friday? what
me done?" _ I asked him what e meant; I told him I was
not angry With him at all. " No angry ! " says he,-repeating.:.'~r' 7" --'

the words several times; " why send Frida home away tr my .,
nation?"--" Why," says I, "Friday, di not on say you ",3"
wished you were there'i"--" Yes, yes," says e, "Wish be
both there; no wish Friday there, no master there." Ina
word, he would not think of goin there Without me. " I go 1
there, Friday !" says I, " what s all I do there? " He re- ;
turned very quick upon me at this: "You do great deal _]
much good," says he; " you teach Wild mans be good, sober,
tame mans ' you tell them know God, pray God, and hve new '
life."--" Alas! Friday," says I, " thou knowest not what thou
sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself."--" Yes, yes,"
sails he, " vou teachee me ood, you teachee them good."--
" o, no, Frida ," says I, ' you shall go Without me; leave
me here to live y myself, as I did before." He looked con-'
fused again at that word; and running to one of the hatchets
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to
me. " What must I do with this?" says I. to him. "You
take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kill you for?" said
[again. He returns ver quick, " What you send Friday .
away for 'l Take kill Fri a , no send Friday away." This he
spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes: in a
word, I so (plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to
me, and a rm resolution in him, that I told him then, and
often after, that I would never send him away from me, if_ he
was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled
afi'ection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so
I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own coun-
try was laid in his ardent affection to the pea le, and his hopes
of my doin them good; a thin , which, as had no notion of
myself, so had not the least ought, or intention, or desire
of undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an esca , as above, founded on the supposition

athered rain the 'scourse, viz. that there were seventeen

arded men there; and, therefore, without any more delay,-
I went to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to

tell, and make 23 large periagua, or canoe, to undertake. the
m am. There were recs enough in the island to have built
a itije fleet, not of periaguas, or canoes, but even of good
large vessels; but the main thin I looked at was, to get one
so near the water that we might aunch it when it was made,
to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Frida
pitched u on a tree; for I found he knew much better thanI
what kin of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day,
what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the-Ni-
caragua wood, for it was much of the same color and smell.
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out,
to make it for a boat,.butI showed him how to cut it with
tools, which alter I had showed him how to use, he did very
handily; and in about a month's hard labor we finished it, and
made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes,
which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, however, it
cost us near a fortnight's time to et her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into tie water; but when she was
in, she would have carried twenty men with reat ease.
When she was in the water, and though 5 ie was so big, It
amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man
Friday would manage her, turn her, and addle her along.
So I' asked him if he would, and if we mig 1t venture over in
her. "Yes," he said, "we venture over in her very well,
thou h reat bloWind." However, I had a further desi n
that e new nothing of, and that was to make a mast an a
sail, and to fit her With an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to et: so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar tree, which I; found near the place, and which
there were great plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to
work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I
knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough; bu
as I had had them now six-and-twenty years by me, and hat:
not been very careful to reserve them, not imagining that l
Jiould ever have this kind) of use for them, I did not doubt but. _ .. --,.v.._-. vvv --.~vr.>>u--u~,m--q--wm:ryw'-ivr"ryrr - v

they were all rotten, and, indeed most of them were so. How-
ever,l found two pieces, which apt-geared pretty good, and
with these Iwent to work; and M a great deal of pains,
and awkward stitchin , you may be sure, for want of needles,
I, at length, made a nee-cornered, ugly thing, like what we
call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom
at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top such as usually
our ships' long-boats sail with, and such asI best knewhow
to manage, as it was such a one I had to the boat in which I
made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of
my story. ' .

l was near two months performing this last work Vlz. ng-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, makm a small stay, and a sail, or fore-sail, to it, to
assist, if we sho d turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I
was but a bungling shipwright yet, as I knew the usefulness,
and even necessity of such a thing, I ag'plied myself With so
much pains to do it, that at last I roug t it to pass; though,
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed,
I think it cost me almost'as much labor as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to
what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he
knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what
belen d to a sail and a rudder; and was the most amazed
when e saw me work the boat to and ain in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail ibbed, and filed this way, or that
way, as the course we 3 ed chan ed; I say, when he saw
this, he stood like one astonished ant? amazed. However, with
a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he be-
came an expert sailor, exce t that as to the compass, I could
make him understand very ittle oi that. On the other hand,
as there was very little c oudy weather, and seldom or never
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a com-~
pass, seem the stars were always to be seen by hi ht, and
the shore y day, except in the rainy seasons, and. en no
body cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

1 was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be lelt out of the account.
my habitation being uite of another kind than in all the rest
of the time. I kept t e anniversary of my landing here with
the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first; and
if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much
more so now, having such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being ef-
fectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible im-
pression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand,
and that I should not be another year in this place. I went
on, however, with my husbandr ' ; di rging, planting, and
fencing, as usual. I gathered an cure my grapes, and did
ever necessary thing as before.

T e rainy season was, in the mean time, u on me, when 1
kept more within doors than at other times. e had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringin her up into the
creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I anded my rafts
from the shi ; and haulimr her up to the shore, at 'high-water
mark, I made: my man Fri ay dig a little dock, just big enough
to hold her, and just deep enou 1 to give her water enough to
float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she
lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain-oil;
we laid a reat many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as
well thatc red as a house; and thus we waited for the months

of November and December, in whichI designed to' make my
adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of
my design returned with the fair weather, I was re arinp, daily
for the voyage ; and the first thing I did was to ay y a czrtain
quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and in~
tended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock and
launch out our boat. I was busy one mornin unon something
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid im go to the sea-
shore and see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which
we generally ot once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well
as the flesh. riday had not been long one, when he came run-
ning back, and flew over my outer w l, _or fence, hke one that
felt not the ground, or the see 5 he set his feet on; and before
I had time to speak to him, e cries out to me, "0 master!
0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 bad ! "--" What's the matter, Fri-
day? "says I. " O yonder, there," says he " one, two three
canoe; one, two, three!" By this way of speaking, con-
cluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was but
three. " Well, Friday," sa 5 I " do not be frightened."
So I heartened him up as wel asI could: however, saw the
poor fellow was most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his
head but that they were come to look for him, an would cut
him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so,
that I scarce new what to do with him. I comforted him as
well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him. " But " says I,
" Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you light, Fri-
day '! "--" Me shoot," says he; " but there come many great
number.";" No matter for that," said I, a ain; "our guns
will fright them that we do not kill." So I ed him whether,
if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as I bid him. He said, " Me die when you
bid die, master." So I went and fetched a ood dram of rum
and ave him; for I had been so good a bus and of myrum,
that had a great deal lefi. When he drank it, I made him
take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and .
loaded them with larfif swan-shot, as bi as small pistol-bullets: 3
then I took four mus ets, and loaded em with two slugs and 1
five small bullets each' and my two pistols I loaded with a 4
brace of bullets each : fhung my eat sword as usual, naked i
by my side, and gave Friday his atchet. When I had thus .i
prepared myself, took my perspectiveaglass, and went up to ~ :i
the side of the hill, to see what I could iscover; and I found 1
Erickly,' by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages, %
t ree prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole busi- 7;.
ness seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these'three fl

human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed! but nothing more
than, as I had observed, was usual with them. I observed,
also that they were landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek ' where the
shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close
down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretches came about filled me with such'indig--
nation, that I came down again to li'riday, and told him I was
resolved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him
if he would stand by me. He had now at over his fright, and
his spirits bein a little raised with the {dram I had given him,
he was very cieerful, and told me, as before, he would die
when I bid die.

In this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had
charged as before, between us: I gave Friday one pistol to
stick in is girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; andI
took one pistol, and the other three guns, myself; and in this
posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my

ocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
Bullets; and, asto orders, I charged him to keep cl'ose behind
me and not to stir, or shoot, or 0 any thing, till I bid him;
an , in the mean time, not to speak a word. In this posture,
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might
come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which
I had seen, by my ailass, it was easy to do.

While I was in ing this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I be an to abate my resolution: I do not mean that
I entertaine any fear of their number; for, as they were
naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them;
nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done or intended me any wrong; who, as
to me were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster; being, in them, a token indeed of God's having
left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, inw'Tnpn'

such stu idity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not call
me to ta e upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less
an executioner of his justice ; that, whenever he thought ii>>
he would take the cause into his own hands, and, by nation
vengeance, punish them as a people, for national crimes; but
that, in the mean time, it was _none of my busrness;,that it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war With those very particular people,
and it was lawful hr him to attack them; but I could not say
the same with respect to myself; These tlungs were so warm-
ly pressed upon my thoughts all the wa as I went, that I
resolved I would onl go and lace myse f near them, that I
"Dig" observe their arbarous east, and that Ilwould act then '
as od should direct; but that, unless somethtn offered that
was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I wo d not meddle
with them. ~

With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all pos-
sible wariness and silence, Friday following close. at my
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
side which-was next to them, only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday and
showin him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, bade him go to the tree, and bring- me word if he
could see there plainly what they were domg. He did so;
and came_immediately back to me, and told me they mg}:
be plainly viewed there' that they were all about thein ,
eatin the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay
boun u on the sand, a little from them, which, he said, thfiy
would k next, and which fired the .very soul Within me. e
told me it was not one of their nation but one of the bearded
men he had told me of, that came to their countryin the boat.
1 was filled with horror at the very namin the white bearded
man; and, goinf to the tree, I saw lai y, by my glass, a
white man, who ay upon the beach 0 the sea, with his hands

and his feet tied with fla s or things like rushes, and. that he
was a European, and h c othes on.

There was another tree, ant? a. little thicket; beyond; it
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was,
which, by going a little wa about, 1 saw I mi ht come at undis-
covered and that then I s ould be within h f a shot of them :
so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the
highest degree; and oing has about twenty aces, I got be-
hind some bushes w ich held all the way til I came to the
other tree; and then came to a little rising round, which
gavg me a full View of them, at the distance 0 about eighty
yar s.

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat u on the ground, all close huddled together, and
had just sent t e other two to butcher the oor Christian, ana
bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their re; and they were
stoopingvdown to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
da --" ow, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee." Friday
said he would. " Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly as you'
see me do; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the mus-
kets and the fowlintg-piece upon the ground and Friday did
the like by his; an With the other musket I) took my_a1m at
the sava s, biddin him to do the like : then asking him if he
was rea y, he sai , " Yes." "Then fire at them," said I ;.
and the same moment I fired also. .

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more ;
and on my side, I killed one and wounded two. They were,
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them
who were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not imme-
diately know which way to run, or which way to look, for
they knew not from whence their - destruction came. Friday
kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might
observe what I did; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I
threw down the piece. and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like: he saw me cock and present; he did the
same again. " Are you ready, Friday?" said I.--" Yes,"
says he. "Let fly, then," says I, " in the name of God!"
and with that, I fired again . among the amazed wretches, and
I0 did Friday; and as our pYeces were now loaden with whatnu . ' -- -qrww--a-wyvy--'Nm-wmwvuntjwM--- ".7

I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we 'ound only two
dro , but so many were wounded, that they ran about yellin
andp screamin like mad creatures, all bloody, and most 0
them miserab y wounded, whereof three more fell quickly
after, thou h not quite dead.-

" Now, riday,' says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaden, " follow me ; "
which he and with a great deal of coura e: unon which I
rushed out of the wood, and showed mysel , and Friday close
at my foot. As soon as l perceived they saw me, I shouted as
loud asl could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as
fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being
loaded with arms asI was, I made directly towards the poor
victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach', or shore, be-
tween the place where they sat and the sea. The two hutch-
ers, who were just going to work with him, had left him at the
surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-
side, and had jumped into a canoe and three more of the est
made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him p
forwards, and fire at them: he understood me immediately,
and runnm about forty yards to be nearer them, he shot at
them, and thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all
fall of a heap into the boat, thoughl saw two of them u again
apickly: however, he killed two of them, and woun ed the

ird so, that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he
had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor vicnm; and loosing his
hands and feet, I lifted him u , and asked him in the Portu-
guese ton ue, what he was. e answered in Latin, " Chris
tianus ; " at was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand
or speak._ I took my bottle out of my ocket, and gave it him,
makingsngns that he should drink, w ich he did; and I gave
him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what
countryman he was; and he said Espagniole; and bein a
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possi ly
make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance
"Seignior," said 1, with as much Spanish as I coald make
up, " we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now; if you
have any strength left. take this Eistol and sword, and lay
about you." He took them vergt aiikfully; and no sooner
had he the arms in his hands, at, as if they had ut new
vigor into him, he flew upon his murderers like a ury, and
had out two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is,
as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces, that
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no
more power to attem it their own escape, than their flesh had
to resist our shot; an that was the case with those five that
Frida shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the
hurt t iey received, so the other two fell with the fri ht.

I ke t my piece in my hand still without firing, Eein will-
ing to eep my charge ready, because I had given the paw
iard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him
run up to the tree from whence we first fire , and fetch the
arms which lay there that had been discharged, which he did

With great swfitness; and then, giving him my musket,I sat
down myself to load all the rest sin, and bade them come to
me when they wanted". While was loading these pieces
there happened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard
and one of the savages, who made at him with one of theii
great wooden swords the same-like wea n that was to have

illed him before, if l had not prevente it. The Spaniard,
who was as bold and brave as could be im ined thou h weak,
had fought this Indian a ood while, an had out im two
great wounds on his head; at the sav e, being a stout, lusty
ellow, closmg in with him, had thrown im down, being faint,
and was wringin my sword out of his hand; when the Span-
iard, though_un_ermost, wisely quittin the sword, drew the
Eistol from his girdle, shot the savage fincugh the body, and

illed him upon the spot, before I (who was running to help
him) could come near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, "pursued the flyin
wretches. With no weapon in his nand but his hatchet; an

with that be despatched those three, who, as I said before
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could
come up with; and the S aniard cominIr to me for a gun, i
gave him one of the fow ing- ieces, witi which he pursued
two of the savages, and woun ed them both; but, as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into the wood, where
Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other was
too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all his might,
off to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in the
canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died
or no, were all that escaped our hands of one and twenty. The
account of the whole is as follows: three killed at our first shot
from the tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday
in the boat; two killed by Friday of those at first wounded ;
one killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard ,
four killed, being found drop red here and there, of their wounds,
or killed by Friday in his 0 use of them; four escaped in the
boat whereof one wounded, if not dead.--Twenty-one in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of un-
shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them, did
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had
me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and, indeed, l
was very anxious about their esca e, lest, carrying the news
home to their people, they shoul come back perhaps with
two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere
multitude; so 1 consented to pursue them by sea and running
to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow
'me; but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another oor creature lie there bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniar was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear,
not knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able
to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really but
little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he--r:'"wfl'm,'-ilw;1--WWW "'5 .~. ---v - ' ' - , ~-;.r~ - '- W 'i v

' ROBINSON Citvsos, 245

could not stand or asleak but groani'id most iteuusly, believ-
in , it seems, still, at he was only unboun in order to be
k' led. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and, pullin out my bottle,
made him give the poor wretch adram ' whic , With the news
of his bein delivered, revived him, and he sat us in the boat.
But when riday came IL near him speak, an look in his
face it would have moved an one to tears _to have seen how
Friday kissed him, embraced 'm hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sun; ' then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face an ead; and then sung
and 'umped about again like a distracted creature. It was a
good1 while before I could make him speak_to me, or tell me
what was the matter 3 but when he came a little to himself, he
told me that it was his father. .

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to' see
what ecstasy and filial afl'ection had worked in this poor sav-
age at the sight of his father, and of his bemg delivered from
death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagances of
his afi'ection after this; for he went into the boat, and out of

the boat, a great many times: when he .went in to him, he -

would sit down b him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish
it 5 then he took his arms and- ankles, which were numbed and
stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed themwith his
hands; and I, rceiving vfliat the case was, gave him some
rum out of my ttle to rub them with, which did them a great
deal of good.

This affair put an end to our ursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now got most out of sight; and it was
happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two
hours after, and before they could be 01: a quarter of their
way, and continued blowing so hard night and that from
the north-west, which .was. against them, that 1"oould not sup-
posetuieir boat could live, or that they ever reached their own
eoas

But to return to Friday: he' was so busy about his father,

that I could no. find in my heart to take him off for some time;
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme: then I asked him If he had iven his father
any bread. He shook his head, and said, " one; ugly dog
eat all up self." lthen gave him a cake 8f bread, out of a
little pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for
himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in m ocket two or three bunches of raisins; so I gave
him a handyflS of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and
run away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a rate
for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw): I say,
e ran at such a rate, that he was out of si ht, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hall out too, after him,
it was all onehaway he went; and in a uarter of an hourI
saw him come back again, though not so ast as he went; and
as he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he had
something in his hand. When Ie came up to me, I found he
had been quite home for an earthen 'u , or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water, and that he hag two more cakes or
loaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried
to his father; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little
sup of it. The water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him, for he was just faintin with thirst,
hen his father had drank,I (filled to him to now if there
was any water left: he said, " Yes; " and I bade him give it
to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his
father; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the
Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposin
hmrself u on a green place under the shade of a tree; an
whose lim 3 were also very stiff, and ver * much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. hen I saw that, upon
Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up and drank,
and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, and gave
him a handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear~ - - w--mmv'ww. sswmmwm--w

in any countenance : but was so weak, notwithstandin he
had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stan up
upon his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to
him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his firther's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every month:-
ates, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his' head
about, to see if his father was in the same place and posture
as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he was not to be
seen; at which he started up, and, without s ing a word,
flew with that swiflness to him, that one coul scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ound as he went; but When he came,
he only found he had aid himself down to ease his limbs; so
Friday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling,
where I would take care of him; but Frida , a lusty, strap
fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his ack, and c.
him away to the boat, and set him down soft] upon theside or
Funnel of the canoe, with his feet in the insi eof it; and then
ifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and res-
ently steppin out again, launched.the boat off, and dled
it along the s ore faster than I could walk, though t e wind
olew prett hard too: so he brought them both safe into our
creek, an leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the oth-
er canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him
whither he went. He told me, "Go fetch more boatz" so
away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran
like him; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as
soon as I got to it by land; so he waited me over, and then
went to he p our new guests out of the boat, which he did;
but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Fm
day knew not what to do. ' ,
To remedy this, I went to work in my thoufiht, and calling
.0 Friday to bid them sit down on the bank'w ' 9 he came-to

are, I soon made a kind of a hand-barrow to lay themton.
and Friday and I carried them both up together upon Lt,
between us.

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortifi-
cation, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was im 5-
sible to get them over, and Iwas resolved not to brea it
down: so I set to work again; and Friday and I, in about
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old
sails, and above that with bou hs of trees, being in the space
without our outward fence, an between that an the rove of
young wood which I had lanted; and here we ma e them
two beds of such things as Iliad, viz. of good rice straw, with
blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on
each bed. ' '

M island was now peopled, and I thought in 'self very rich
in an jects; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently
made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country
was my own mere property, so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected;
l was absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives
to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had
been occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had
but three sulejects, and they were of three different religions:
my man Fri ay was a Protestant, his father was a pagan and
a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I al-
lowed hberty of conscience throughout my dominions:_--But
this is by the way.

As'soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I be-
at]? to think of makin some provision for them ; and the first

11. I did, I ordered riday to take a yearling goat, betwixt
a In and a flgoat, out of my particular flock, to be killed;
when I cut 0 the hinder uarter, and chopping it into smaL
pieces, I set Frida .towor to boiling and stewmg, and madeI
them a very good ish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, hav-
ing put some barle and rice also into the broth; and as I
cooked it Without _oors (for I made no fire within my inner
wall), so I carried it all into the new tent, and having set a.7 .a . , .wrrnrvvm-HW'F'

table there for them, I sat down, and ate my dinner a so with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and,
indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the lan-
guage of the sava es pretty well. _

Alter we had ine , or rather supiped, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go an fetch our muskets and
other fire-arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the

lace of battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and
Bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the
sun, and would resently be ofi'ensive. I also ordered him to
bury the horridp remains of their barbarous feast, which I
knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing
in self; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that way;
ally which he punctually performed, and elfaced the very ap-
pearance of t e savages being] there; so that when I went
again, I could scarce know w ere it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a ittle conversation. with in two
new subjects; and, first, I set Frida to inquire of his ther
what he thought of the escape of t e savages'in that canoe,
and whether we might expect a return of them, with a power
too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the sav-
ages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew
that night the went oli', but must, of necessity, be drowned,
or driven sout to those other shores, where they were as sure
to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but, as to what they would do, if they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they
were so dreadfully fiightened with the manner of their bein
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they woulg
tell the people the were all killed by thunder and lightnin ,
not b _t e and 0 man; and that the two which appeare
v12. riday and I, were two heavenly s irits, or fiiries, come
down to destroy them, and not men wit weapons. This, he
said, he knew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their
Language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to

conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and
kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done
now: and this old savage was in the right; for, as I under-
stood since, by other hands, the savages never attempted to
go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with
the accounts given by those four men (for, It seems, they did
escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that en-
chanted island would be destro 'ed with fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not; an therefore was under contin-
ual a prehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my

uar , with all my army; for, as there were new four of us,

would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the
open field, at any time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the
fear of their coming were off; and I began to take my for-
mer thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; be-
ing likewrse assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend
upon ood' as e from their nation, on his account, if I would
go. ut myt oughts were a little suspended when I had
a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countr men and Portu-

uese, who, having been cast away, and ma e their escape to
t at side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the sava es, but
were very sore ut to it for necessaries, and indeed for ife. I
asked him all t 1e articulars of their v0 age, and found they
were a Spanish 5 iip, bound from the i0 de la Plata to the
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there; that they had five Portu-
guese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck;
t tat five of their own men were drowned, when first the shi was
lost, and that these escaped, through infinite dan ers an haz--
ards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannib coast, where
the expected to have been devoured every moment. He
tol me they had some arms with them, but they were per-
fectly useless, for that they had neither powder norvball, the
washing of the sea having sporled all their powder, but a little,
which they used, at their first landing, to provide themselVes
some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if they had formed any design of makin their esca
He said they had many consultations about it; ut that havmg
neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions -of an
kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair.
asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from
me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if _
they were all here, it might not be done. I told him with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me,
if I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square
their dealings by the obligations they had received, so much
as the did by the advan es they expected. I told him it
wouldhe very hard that I s ould be the instrument of their
deliverance, and that they should afierwards make me their

made a sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever
brought him thither; and that I had rather he delivered u to
the sava es, and be devoured alive, than fall into the mere: ess
claws o- the riests, and be carried into the inquisition. 1
added, that at erwise I was rsuaded, if the were all here,
we might, with so many han s, build a bark arge' enough to
carry us all away, either to the Brazils, southward, or to the
islands, or Spanish coast, northward; but that if, in requital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me
by force among their own people, I might be ill used for my
kindness to them, and make m caseworse than it was before.

He answered, with a great eal of candor and in enuous-
ness, that their condition was so miserable, and that t ey were
so sensible of it, that, he believed, they would abhor 'the
thought of using anv man unkindly that should contribute to
their deliverance; and that if 1 pleased, hewauld go to them
With the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return
again, and bring me their answer; that he would make con-
ditions With them upon their solemn oath, that they should be
abmlutely under my leading, as their commander and ca tair .
and that they should swear upon the holy sacraments an Gos-
pel, to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as that I
should agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in such coun-
try as I intended; and that he would bring a contract from
them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me
he Would first swear to me himself, that he would never stir
from me as long as he lived, till I ave him orders; and that
he would take my side to the last rop of his blood, if there
should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.
He told me the were all of them very civil, honest men, and
they were un er the eatest distress imaginable, having
neither weapons or clot es, nor any food, but at the mercy
and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever return-
ing to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would
undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Span-
iard over to them to treat. But when we had at all things in
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself start an objection,
which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerit on the other hand, that I could not but be very well
satisfi in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of
his comrades for at east half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month, durin which time
I had let him see in what manner I had provi ed, with the
assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evi-
dently what stock of corn and rice had laid up; which,
though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not
suflicient, without ood husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to four; ut much less would it be sufiicient if his
countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should
come over; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual
our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the
Christian colonies of America; so he told me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to
sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree,or
not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one
difficult into another. " You know," says he, "the children
of Israe , though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered
out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that
delivered t em, when they came to want bread in the wil-
derness."
His caution was so seasonahle, and his advice so good, that
I could not but be very well fipleased with his Hmposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his delity: so we fe to digging, all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with
permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of which
it was seed-time,.we had got as much land cured and trimmed
up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and six-
teen jars of rice; which was, in short, all the med we had to 1
spare; nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley suflicient for i
our own food, for the six months that we had to expect our
crop; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed
asi e for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months
in the ground in that country. _
Havmg now society enough, and our number being suficient
to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come (unless
their number had been very great), we went freely all over the
island, whenever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have e means of it out of mine. . Forthis
pur , I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our
war , and I set Frida and his father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the p'aniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts
on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. -I showed
them with what indefati able pains I had hewed a lar'jfie tree
into single planks, and caused them to do the like, they;
had made about a dozen large planks of good oak,-near two

inches thick: what prodigious labor it took up, any :ne may
imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock
of tame nroats as much as I could; and, for this purpose, I
made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself
with Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and b
this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up wit:
the rest; for whenever we shot the (am, we saved the kids,
and added them to our flock. But above all, the season for
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quan-
tity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at
Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have
lillod sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and was very good living too, I assure
you, for it is exceeding nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how-
ever, it was enough to answer our end; tor from twenty-two
bushels of barley we brou ht in and threshed out above two
hundred and twenty bushe s, and the like in proportion of the
rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest,
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me;
or, it we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the
world, that is to say, any part ofAmerica. When we had thus
housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-ware, viz. reat baskets, in which we kept
it; and the Spaniard was ver ghandy and dextrous at this part,
and often blamed me that I id not make some things for de-
fence of this kind of work: but I saw no need of it.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I
expected, I gave the Spaniar eave to 0 over to the main, to
see what he could do wrth those he had eft behind them there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring an man with him who
would not first swear, in the presence 0 himself and the old
savage, that he would.no way injure, fight with, or attack the
person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send"-"WYLMW g,

for themin order to their deliverance; but that they would stand
by him, and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever
they went, would be entirely under and subjected to his com-
mand; and that this should be put in writin , and signed with
their hands. How they were to have done is, when I knew
they had neither pen nor_ ink, was a question which we never.
asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old
savave, the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes
whic they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in
when the came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I
gave eac of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about
eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very
good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but
upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seventiears and
some days. I gave them rovisions of ,bread, an of dried
grapes, sufficient for thems'e ves for many days, and suficient
.or all the Spaniards for about eight days' time; and Wishing
them a ood voyage I saw them go; agreeing with them about
a si 11 they should han out at their return, by which I
sho d know them again, w en they came back, at a distance,
before they came on shore. They went away with a fair gale,
on the day that the moon was at full, by my account, in the
month of October ; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after
I had once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I
kept even the number of years. so punctually as to be sure I
was right; though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined
my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight daysI had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the
like has not rhaps been heard of in history. I was fast
asleep in my utch one morning, when my man Frida came
running in to me, and called aloud, " Master, master, t y are
come, they are come I" I jum u , and, regardless of
danger I went out as soon as could get my clothes on,

throng my lige grove, which, by the way, was by this time

grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I
went without my arms (which was not my custom to do): but
I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently
saw a boat at about a league and a hall' distance, standin r in
for the shore, with a shoulder-ollmutton sail, as they cal it,
and the wind blowing irettj.' fair 10 bring them in; also I ob-
served presently, that t 10y dial not come from that side which
the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island
Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close; for these
were not the )COplC we looked for, and that we mi rht not
know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In tie next
place I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see whatI
could make ol'them ; and, having; taken the ladder out, I climbed
up to the top ol'the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehen-
sive of any thing, and to take my view the plainer, without
being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hilf,
when my eye plainly-discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at
about two leagues and a hall' distance li'om me, S. S. 13., he
not above a league and a ball' from the shore. By my obser
vation, it appeared )lainly to be an English ship, and the hon
appeared to be an 'nglish long-boat. .
cannot express the confusion I was in; though'the joy 01
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such
as I cannot describe: but yet I had some secret doubts hung
about me,--I cannot tell from whence they came,--bidding me
keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have in that
part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part
of the world where the English had any traffic; and I knew
there had been no storms to drive them in there, as in distress;
and that if they were really English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design; and thatl had better con-
tinue asI was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger,
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is
no possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices
are given us, I believe few that have made any observations
ol things can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an in-
visible world, and a converse ofs )irits, we cannot doubt; and
if the tendency ofthem seems to )e to warn us of (Ian er, why
should we not suppose they are from some friend y agent
(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the
question), and that they are given for our good? i
The present question abundantly confirms me in the jus-
tice of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by
this secret admonition, come it ti'om whence it will, I had been
undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before,
as you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in this
)osture, but 1 saw the boat draw near the shore, as if the
looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of lan -
ing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but run
their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very hap )y for me; for otherwise the ' would have
landed just at my ( oor, as [may say, and we d soon have
beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me
of all 1 had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were En lishmen, at least most of them; one or two I
thought were utch, but it (lid not prove .so: there were in all
eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed
and, as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five 0
them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat, as prisoners . one of the three I could perceive using the
most passionate gestures of entreaty, aflliction, and despair,
even to a kind of extravagance; the other two,I could per-
ceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con-
cerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was
perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English,
as well as he could, "0 master! you see English mans eat
prisoner as well as savage mans."----" Why, Friday," sa 3 I
"do vou think they are going to eat ,them then?"--" es,'
says Friday, " they will eat thript."--" No. no," says I, " F' .

day ; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, exfilect-
ing every moment when the three prisoners should be 1: ed
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift a his arm with a eat
cutlass, as the seamen call it, or swor , to strike one o the
poor men; and 1 expected to see him fall every moment; at
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my
veins. I wished heartily now for my S )aniard, and the sav-
age that was gone with him, or that I ad any way to have
come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have res-
cued the three mcn, for I saw no fire-arms they had amon
them; but it fell out to my mind another way. After I hag
observed the outrageous usa e of the three men by the inso-
lent seamen, I observed the ellows run scatterin about the
island, as if they wanted to see the country. I 0 served that
the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased;
but they sat down all three u'pon the ground, very pensive,
and looked like men in des air. This put me in mind of the
first time when I came on s ore, and began to look about me'
how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked roun
me; what dreadful apprehensions 1 had; and how I lodged
in the tree all night, for fear of bein devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothin , that night, of t e supply I was to receive
by the providenti drivin of the ship nearer the land by the
storms and tide, by whicth have since been so lon nourished
and supported; so these three poor desolate men new noth-
ing how certain of deliverance and supply the were, how
near it was to them, and how effectually and re. l the were
in a condition of safety, at the same time that t ey ought

themselves lost, and their case desperate. So little do we see.

imagine; nay, are even brou ht to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of'high water when these people came
on shore; and partly while they rambled about to see what
kind of a place they were in, they rad carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leav'
ing their boat avround. They had left two men in the boat,
who, asI foumf afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell aslee ; however, one of them waking a little
sooner than the 0 er, and finding the boat too fast 'aground
for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling
about ' u on which they all soon came to the boat: but It was
past all t ieir stren th to launch her, the boat bein very heavy,
and the shore on t at side being a soft, oozy san , almost like
a.quicksand. In this condition like true seamen, who are
perhaps the least of all mankin dgiven to forethought, they
gave it over, and away they strolle about the country again'
and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them 0
from the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack can't you? she'll
float next tide: " by which I was fully confirmed in the main ,
mquir of what countrymen they were. All this while I kept
mysel very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle, any
farther than to mgrlplace of observation, near the top of the
hill; and very gla was to think how well it was fortified. I
knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be
at more libert to see their motions, and to hear their dis-
course, if they ad any. In the mean tune, I fitted myself up for
a battle, as before (though with more caution), knowing I had
todo With another kin of enemy than I had at first. I or'
dered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman
wrth_ lus gun, to load himself with arms. I took in self two
fowlin -p1eces, and I gave him three muskets. 1i y figure,
1nd _, was very fierce: I had my formidable oat-skin coat
on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a 11' ed sword by
at side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun u n each shoulder.

t was my esign, as I said above, not to ave made any at-
tern t till it was dark 1 but about two o'clock, being the heat
of t e day, I found that, in short, they were all gone stragc

ling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition
to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as
I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved
to discover myself to them, and learn something of their con-
dition. Immediately I marched in the figure as above my
man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formida e_for
his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could,

and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them,

in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?" They started up
at the noise ' but were ten times more confounded when they
saw me, and the uncouth li ure that I made. They made no
answer at all, but I thought perceived them just going to fly
from me, when I spoke' to them in ~En lish: "Gentlemen, '
said I, " do not be surprised at me: per aps on may have a
friend near, when you did not expect it."--" e must be sent
directly from heaven, then," said one of them very gravely to
me, and pulling 01? his hat at the same time to me; " for our
condition is past the help of man."--" All help is from
Heaven, sir," said I: " but can you put a stranger in the way
how to help Iyl'ou 'l for you seem to be in some great distress.
I saw you w en you landed; and when you seemed to-make-
application to the brutes that came with you, I saw one .of
them lift up his sword to kill you."

The poor man, with tears running down his face and
trembling looking like one astonished, returned, " Am I, talk-
ing to God or man? Is it'a real man or an angel'l"--" Be In

no fear about 'that, sir," said I; " if God had sent an- angel to
relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed
after another manner than you see me: ray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, an disposed to assist
you; you see'I have one servant only; we have arms and am-
munition; tell' as freely, can we serve you? What rayon

case'l"--"Our case," said he, " sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near us: but, in short, sir, I was
commander of that ship; my men have mutinled against me ;
they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me ;- and at
last have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we"
expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and
know not yet what to think of it."--" Where are these
brutes, your enemies?" said I: " do you know where they
are gone?"--"There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a
thicket of trees; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen
us, and heard you s eak; if they have, they will certain]
murder us all. '--" ave they any fire-arms?" said 1. e
answered, " They had only two pieces, one of which they
lefi in the boat." " Well then," said I, " leave the rest to me;
I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all : but
shall we rather take them prisoners?" He told me there
were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any mercy to; but if they were secured he believed
all the rest would return to their duty. I asked him which
they were. He told me he could not at that distance distin-
guish them but he would obey my orders in any thing I would

uect. Well," says I, "let us retreat out of their view or
hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So
they wrllingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them.

_"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon our deliver-
ance, are you willing to make two conditions wit me? " He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the
ship, If- recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded
by me 1_n every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
would hve and die With me in what part of the world soever
I would send him; and the two other men said the same.
"Well," says I, " my conditions are but two: first, That
while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to
any authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will,
upon all occasrons, give them up to me, and do no prejudic"
home or mine upon this island; and, in the mean time, be
overned by my orders: secondly, That if the ship is or ma
recovered, you Will carry me and my man to Englan ,
passage free." _

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life to me,
and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he lived.
"Well then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with
powder and ball: tell me next what you think is pro r to be :
done." He showed all the testimonies of his gratitu e that he '
was able, but offered to be wholly guided b me. I told him I
thought it was hard venturing any thing; at the best method .
I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay, and I
if any were not killed at the hrst volley, and offered to submit, E

' we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi- i
deuce to direct the shot. He said ver modest! , that he was
loath to kill them, if he could help it; ut that t ose ttvo were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still; ,3
for the would go on board and bring the whole ship's compa- ,1;
ny,.an destroy us all. f' Well then," says I, "necessity le- 35
itimates my advice, for it is the only we. to save our lives." "'
flowever, seein him' still cautious of s edding blood, I told %
him they shoul go themselves, and manage as they tbund 5
convenient. _ >> 3
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon afier we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny. He
said, "' No." " Well then," said I, " you may let them escape; .
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to
save themselves. "Now," says I, " if the rest escape you, it
is your fault." Animated with this, he took the musket-I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two-
comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; the two
men who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which
one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing

them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then,
for the moment he cried out they fired; I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so wel.
aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them was
killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded; but, not
being dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for
help to the other; but the ca tain ste'pping to him, to (1 him it
was too late to cry for help; e shoul call upon God to forgive
his villany; and with that word knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never 8 oke more: there were
three more in the company, and one 0 them was also slightly
wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw
their dan er, and that it was in vain to resist, the begged for
mercy. he ca tain told them he would spare t eir lives, if
they would give rim any assurance of their abhorrence of the
treachery they had been uiltv of, and would swear to be faith-
ful to him in recovering tie ship, and afterwards in carrying
her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. The gave
him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be esrred,
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which
I was not against, 011] that I obliged him to keep them bound,
hand and foot, while t iey were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars
and sails, which the did; andby and by three straggling men,
that were (happily or them) parted from the rest, came back,
upon hearing t 1e guns fired ; and seeing the captain, who before
was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be
bound also; and so our victory was com lete.

It now remained that the ca tain and should in uire into
one mother's circumstances: began first, and to] him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment; and particularly at the wonderful manner of m being
fumished wrth provisions and ammunition; and, indee , as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply.
But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his
ms, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more. ' Alter this communication was at an end, I carried burn
and his two men into my apartment, leadin them in just
where I came out, viz. at the top of the house, w ere I refreshed
them with such p'rovisions as I had, and showed them.all
the contrivanees I ad made, during my long, long mhabitmg
that lace.

A I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly ama-
zing; but, above all, the captain admired my fortification, and
how perfectly I had conce ed my retreat with a grove of trees,
whic , having been now planted near twenty gears, and 'the
trees growing much faster than in England, was come a httle
wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in any part of It, but
at that one side where I had reserved my little wmdin passage
into it. I told' him this was my castle and my resi ence, but
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither
I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too
another time; but at present our business was to consider how
to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told'
me, he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that
there were still six-and-twenty hands, on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all for-
feited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by
desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were
subdued, the would be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to Eng and, or to any 0 the English colonies; and that,
therefore, there would be up attacking them with so small a-
number as we were.

I mused for_ some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something
was to.be resolved on slpeedily, as welldo draw the men on
board into some snare or their surprise, as to prevent their
landing upon us, and' destroyin us. U n this, it presently
occurred to me, that in splittle w ' e the s ip's crew, wondering
what.was become of their comrades, and of the boat, wonl
certainly come on shore in' their other boat, to look for them;
and that then, pghaps, they might come armed, and be too?

stron for us: this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told
him t e first thin<r we had to do was to stave t 1e boat, which
la upon the beadh, so that they might not carry her off; and
ta ing every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim: accordingly we went on board, took the arms
which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we
found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum,
a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar in a piece of cat vass (the sugar was five or six pounds);
all which was very we come to me, especially the brandy and
an ar, of which 1 had non left for many years.

hen we had carried afi these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before,
as above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they
had come strong enough to master us, yet they could not
carry ofi' the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts
that we could be able to recover the shi ; but my view was,
that if they went away without the boat,lIJ did not much ques-
tion to make her fit again to carry us to the Leeward Islands,
and call upon our friends, the Spaniards, in my way ; for I had
then still in my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach so high, that
the'tide would not float her 01? at high water mark, and be

stirred; and they fired several times, making other signals for
the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved
fruitless, and they forfid the boat did, not stir, we saw them,
by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out,'aud row
towards the shore; and we found, as the approached, that
there were no less than ten men in her, an that they had fire-
arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of' - l

their faces; because the tide having set them a little to the
cast of the other bout, they rowed u under shore, to come to
the same lace where the other had ended, and where the boat
lay; by t is means, I say, we had a full view of them, and
the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in o
the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fel-
lows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the
rest, being overpowered and frightened; but that as for the
boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer among them,
and all the rest, the were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew, and were no oubt made des rate in their new enter-
prise; and terribly ap rehensive e was that they would be
too powerful for us. smiled at him, and told him that men
in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that
seeing almost every condition that could be was better than
that which we were su posed to be in, we on ht toexpect that 1
the consequence, whet er death or life, woul be sure to be a j
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum- '.j
stances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth 5
venturing for. " And where, sir,". said I, " is your belief of my
bein preserved here on pur ose to save your life, which ele-
vate you a little while ago. For my part," said I, "there
seems to me but one thing amiss in all the respect of it."
" What is that? " says he. " Why," said , "it is, that as
you say there are three or four honest fellows among them,
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked art
of the crew, I should have thought God's providence ad -
singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for depend :
upon it, every man that comes ashore are our own, and shall -
die or live as they behave to us." As I spoke this With a
raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found_ it greatly en- '
couraged him '; so we set vigorously to our busrness. ' . '-
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming a.
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and we 1
had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom
the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent vmh Frnday,
and one of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they

were remote enou h, and out of danger of bein heard or dis-
covered, or of fin mg their way out of the w s if they could
have delivered themselves: here they left them bound, but
gave them rovisions, and promised them, if they continued
there uie y, to give them their liberty in a. day or two, but
that,i they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They (promised faithful] to bear their
confinement with patience, an were very than ful that they
had such good usage'as to have provisions and light left them;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for
their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel
over them at the entrance.

The other (prisoners had better usage; two of them were
kept inione , indeed, because the ca tain was not free to
trust tiem; but the other two were ta en into my service,
upon the captain's recommendation, and u on their solemnly
engaging to live and die With us; so \Vlth t em and the three
honest men, we were seven men well armed; and I made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were coming, considering that the captain had said there were
three or four honest men among them also. As soon as they
got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat
into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid the would
rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance mm the
shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should
'ot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing

.ey did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was eas to

te they were under a'great snyrise to find her strip , as
above, of all that was in her, an a great hole in her gottom.
After they had mused a while u on this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing wit all their might, to try if they
could make their companions hear; but all was tono purpose:
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a. volley of their
small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the
Woods ring]; but it was all one: those in the cave we were sure
could not ear, and those in our keeping, though they heard
it well enon h, yet durst give no answer to them. They were
so astonish at the surprise of this, that, as they told us after'
wards, they resolved to go all on board again, to their shi
and let them know that- the men were all murdered, and t e
long-boat stared; accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believin they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving t ieir comrades over for lost, and so he should still
lose t e ship, which he was in ho s we should have recovered;
but he was quickly as much frig tened the other way.

They had not been long put OH with the boat,_ but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but With this new
measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted to-
gether upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat and the rest
to llgo on shore, and go up into the country to iook for their
fe ows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we
were at a loss what to do; as our seizing those seven men on
shore would be no advantage to us, if we let the boat escape;
because they would then row away to the ship, and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and so our
recovering the shi would be lost. However, we had no rem-
edy but to wait an see what the issue of things might present;
The seven men came on shore and the three who remained in
the boat put her 03' to a good distance from the shore, and
came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible
for us to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore
kept close together, marching towards the top of the little hill
under which at habitation lay; and we could see them
willy, though ey could not perceive Yrs. We could have

n very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther _
off, that we might have come abroad. But when they were

down together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they
thought tit to have gone to sleei there, as the other part of
them had done, they had done t 0 job for us; but they were
too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to o to sleep,
though they could not tell what the danger was t ey had to
fear, neither. -

The captain made a very just roposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs, viz. that perliaps they would all fire a vol-
ley again to endeavor to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their
pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this iro-
posal, provided it was done while we were near enou'r to
come up to them before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen; and we lay still a lon time,
very irresolute what course to take. At length I tol them
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use
some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their re-
moving, and were very uneasy, when, after long consultations,
we saw them all start u , and march down towards the sea:
it seems they had such readful apprehensions upon them of
the danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
shi again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
wit their intended voya e with the ship.

As soon as I perceive them to go towards the shore, I im-
agined it to be, as '1! really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain, as
soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the appre-
hensions of it , but I resently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and) which answered my end to a tittle. I
ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little
creek westward towards the place where the saw 3 came on
shore when Friday was rescued; and as soon umy came to
alittle rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade
them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the
seamen answer them, they should return it again; and then,
keeping out of si ht, take a round, always answering when
the others hall , to draw them as far into the' island, and

among the woods, as Ipossible, and then wheel about again to
me by such Ways as directed them. .

They were just oing into the boat, when Friday and the
mate hallooed; an they presently heard them, and_answer-
ing, run alon the shore westward, towards the vorce they i
heard, when ey were presently stopped by the creek where, -'
the water being up, they could not get over, and>> called for the
boat to come up and set them over' as, indeed, I ex ected.
When they had set themselves over,.I observed that e boat
being gone a ood way into the creek and, as it were, in a
harbor within t e land they took one of the three men out of
her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, hav-
ing fastened her to the stump of a little tree onwthe shore.
T is was what I wished for; and immediately leavmg Fridai
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the .rest wi
me, and crossin the creek out of their sight, we surprised
the two men be ore they were aware; one of them 1 ing on
the shore, and the other being in the boat. The fe low on

V shore was between slee ing an waking, and going to start up:
the captain, who was oremost, ran in upon him, and knocked
him down; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or
i: vas a dead man. Th needed very few arguments to
flsuade a single man to yi ld, when he saw five men upon

, and his comrade knocked 'down; besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny
as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily [persuaded
not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with
us. In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest 'that they drew them by
hallooznfi and answeritflF, from one hill to another, and fiom
one .w to another, ' they not only heartily tired them, but

left them where they were very sure they ctuld not reach
back to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they were
heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back
to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in. the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to
those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer,
and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to
come any faster; which was very welcome news to us. At
length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to ex-
press their confusion when they found the boat fast aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.
We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits
in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times; but no answer. After some time,
we could see them, by the little light there was, run about,
wringing their hands like men in des )air; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the oat, to rest themselves;
then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the
same thin" over a am. My men would fain have had me
give them leave to lg]! upon then at once in the dark; but I
was willing to take them at sometdvantage, so to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was un-
willing to hazard the killing any of our men, knowin the
others were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see i they
did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the cap-
".ain to cree upon their hands and feet, as clase to the ground
as the co d, that the might not be discovered, and et as
near em as they c (1 possibly, before they offered to re.
They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal riu leader of the mutin , and
had now shown himself the most ejected and dispirite of all
the rest came walking towards them, with two more of the
crew: the captain was soe er at haVing this principalrdgu'e
so much in his power, that e could hardly have patienceto
let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only
heard his ton ue before; but when they came nearer,'the cap-
tain and Fri ay, startin up on their feet, let fly at them.
'The boatswain was kille upon the. Spot; the next man was
shot in the body, and fell just b him, though he did 'not die
till an hour or two after; and e third run for it. At the
noise of the fire, I immediawa advanced With my whole army,
which was now eight men, viz. myself, eneralissimo; Frida ,
my lieutenant-general; the captain an his two men, and 't 6
three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with arms. We
came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not
see our number; and I made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, to calltheni by name, to try if I
could bring them to a arley, and so might perha s reduce
them to terms; which ell out just as we desired; or indeed

it was ez'i'siyl to think, as their condition then was, theywould,

be very ing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he
could, to one of them, "Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom
Smith answered immediately, "Is that Robinson?" For it
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, " A , ay; for

God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms an yield, or '

you are all dead men this moment."--" Whom must we yield
to? Where are they? " says Smith again. " Here they are,"
says he; "here's our captain and fty en With him have
been hunting you these two hours; the boatswam is killed,
Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not
yield on are all lost."----" Will the we as quarter, then 'lf.'
says om Smith, " and we will yie d. '--"'I'll go and ask, if
you promise to yield," says Robinson: so he asked the ca
taiii; and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Sim ,

you know my voice; if you lay down your armsimmedately,
and submit, ou shall have your lives all but Will Atkins."_
Upon this ill Atkins cried out, " For God's sake captain,
give me quarter; what have I done? They have all been as
bad as 1;" which, by the way, was not true neither ' for, it
seems, this Will Atkins was the. first man that laid hold of the
captain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously,
in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. How-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at dlS<
cretion, and trust to the governor's mercy ; by which he meant
me, for they all called me overnor. In a word, they all laid
down their arms, and begge their lives; and I sent the man that
had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all;

and then my great army of fifty men, which, particularl with
those three, were in all but er ht, came up and seize upon
them, and upon their boat; on y that I kept myself and one
more out of sight for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with~him and at length upon the further wickedness
of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to miser
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the lows. They
appeared very dpenitent, and begged hard or their lives As
for that, he to] them they were none of his prisoners, but the
commander's of the island; that they thought they had set
him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island ; but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that
the overnor was an En lishman; that he might hang them
all ere, if he pleased; ut as he had given them all quarter,
be supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as I{ustice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
manded y the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the mornin .

Though this. was . but a fiction of {his own, yet it had its
desired effect : _Atkins fell upon his knees to be the captain
to mtercede With the governor for his litze ; an all the rest
cc of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent
to ngland.

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in gettin possession of the ship; so I
retired in the dark from them that they might not.see what
kind of a afiovernor they had), and called the captain to me.
when I c ed as at a good distance, one of the men was or-
dered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the
commander calls for you; " and presently the ca tain re-
plied, " Tell his excellency I am alluSt a coming." his more
perfectly amazed them, and they believed that the command-
er was just by with his fifly men. Upon the captain's coming,
to me; I told him in project for seizing the 5 ip, which he
liked wonderful] we , and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. ut, in order to execute it with more art, and
to be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prison-
ers, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of
the worst of them, and send them inioued to the cave where
the others lay. This was committ to Friday, and the two men
who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them
to the cave, as to a prison; and it was, indeed, a dismal place
especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered
to my bower as I called it), of which I have given a full de-
scription; an as it was enced in, and they pinioned, the

ilicewas secure enough, considering they were upon their
avror.

To these, in the morning, I sent the captain who was to
enter into a arley with them; in a word, to tr them, and tell
me whether Ilie thought they might be tru or no to go on
board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury
done him, of the condition they were brought to, and that,
though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as
to the present action, yet that if they were sent to En land
they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but at if
they would join in so Just an attempt as to recover the ship,
he would have the governor's engagement for their pardon>> ..
Any one may guess how readily such a roposal would be
accepted by men in their condition: they ell down on tl eir
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impre-
cations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with
him all over the world; that they would own him as a father
as lon as they lived. " Well," says the captain, " I must go
and tefi the governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an account of
the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed the
would be faithful. However, that we mi rht be very secure,
told him he should o-back again and c oose out those five,
and tell them, that t iey might see he did not want men, that
he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the
governor would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent risoners to the castle my cave) as hostages for the fidel-
ity 0 those five; and that i they proved unfaithful in the ex-
ecution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on
the shore. This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest: however, they had no way left them

ut to accept it; and it was now the business of the risoners,
as much as of the captain, to persuade the other ve to do
their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first,
The captain, his mate, and passenger; second, Then the two

risoners of the first gang, to whom, having their character
in the captain, I ha given their liberty and trusted them
with arms; third, The other two that I had kept till now in
my bower pinioned, but, on the ca tain's motion, had now re.
leased; fourth, These five. relea at last; so that they were
twelve in all, besides five we kept- prisoners in the cave for
hostages. '

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these

In the cave, I resolved to kee them fast, but Friday went'in;
twice a day to them, to supp y them with necessaries; and I
made the other two carry .proVIsions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two h es, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person e governor had or-
dered to look after them; and that it was the governor's
pleasure they should ,not stir anywhere but by my direction;
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that, as we never suffered them to see me as a
governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the
governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon, all
occasnons. _

The captain -now had no difliculty before him, but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of 'one, and man them. He
made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men; and
himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they
contrived their business very well, for they came upto the
ship about midni ht. As soon as they came within call of the
ship, he made Iahinson hail them, and tell them they had.
brought olf the men and the boat but that-it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like, holding them in a
chat till they came to the shi '5 side; when the captain and
the mate entering first, with. eir arms, immediately knocked
down the'second mate and carpenter With the butt end of their
muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men: they
secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter--
decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down
that were below; when the other boat and their mam-entering
at the forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three
men they found there prisoners. When this was .done, and
all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three
men, to break into the roundohouse, where the new rebel cap-
tain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and, With

wo men and a boy, had got fire-arms in their ands; and when
he mate, With a crow, split open the door, the new captain
and his men fired boldly amon them, and wounded the mate
with a musket-ball, which bro e his arm, and wounded two
more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling for
help, rushed, however, into the round-house (wounded as he
was , and with his pistol shot the new captain through the
hea , the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out a ain be-
hind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a wor more,
in n which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectu-
afiy), without any more lives lost.

As soon as the shi was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fire , which was the signal agreed upon With
me to give me notice of his success, w iich you may be sure
I was very glad to hear, having sat- watching upon the shore
for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus
heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been
a day of great iati rue to me,I slept very sound, till I was
something surprise with the noise of a gun; and resently
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of " overnor,
governor; " and presently I knew the captain's voice; when,
climbin up to the top of the hill, there he stood and pointin
tothe 5 ip, he embraced me in his arms. " iy dear frien
and deliverer," says he, "there's your shi ), for she is all
yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her." I cast my
eyes to the ship, and there she rode Within little more than
half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as
soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being fair,
had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the
little cree ; and the tide'beiug up, he captain had brought
the pinnace in near the place where I at first landed my ratts,
and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink
down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed,
visibly put into my hands, all thinws easy, and alarge ship
'ust ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At

st, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word deg
but as he had taken me in his arms 1 held fast by him, or i
should have fallen to the round. He perceived the surprise,
and immediately pulls a gottle out of his pocket, and gave me, V- vF'r "(DRYMW

After I had drank it, I sat down upon t e ground; and though
it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before 1 con (1
speak a word to him. AJl this time the poor man was in as
great an ecstasy as I, only not under an surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind and tender t in'g's to me, to com-
pose and bring me to m self; but such was e flood ofjoy in
my breast, that it put my 5 irits into confusion; at'last
broke out into tears; and in a ittle while after I recovered my
speech. I then took my turn, and embraced him as my de-
hverer, and we rejoiced t ether. I told him I looked upon
him as a man sent from eaven to deliver me, and that the
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the
e e of an infinite wer could search into the remotest corner
0 the world an send hel to the miserable whenever he
pleased. I for at not to li u my heart in thankfulness to
eaven; and w at heart could orbear to bless him, who had
not only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a
wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but- from whom
ever deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.
hen we had talked a while, the ca tain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, sac as the shi afi'orded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long is masters
had not lundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to the
boat, an bade his men bring the things ashore that were for
the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been
one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had
been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me
a case of bottles full of excellent cordial Waters, six large bottles
of Madeira wme (the bottles held two quits each), two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship s beef;
and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a bum
dred weight of biscuit: he also brou ht me a box of sugar, a
box of flour, a b full of lemons, an two bottles of lime Juice
and abundance 0 other things. But, besides these, and wha

was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six

new clean shirts, six veryvgood neckcloths, two pair of gloves,'

one air of shoes, a hat, and one air of stockings, with a very

suit of clothes of his own, w iich had been worn but very
ittle; in a word, he clothed me from head to foot._ lt_was a
ve.y kind and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to
one in my circumstances; but never was any thing in the world
of that kind so un leasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to
me to wear such 0 otlies at first. .

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it
was worth considering whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, es ecially two of them, whom he knew to
be incorrigible and re actory to the last degree; and the cap-
tain said he knew the were such rogues, that there was no
obliging them; and i he did carry them away, it must be in
irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first
English colony he could come at; and I found that the_captain
himself was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that
if he desired it, I you" undertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them
upon the island. "I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, "with all in heart."---" Well, ' says I, "I will send
for them up, and La] ' with them for you." So I caused Fri-
day and the two hostages,--for they .were now discharged, their
comrades havmg performed their promise ;--I say, Icaused
them to go to the cave, and brin up the five men, inioned
as they were, to the bower, and fieep them there ' I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and
now 1 'was called governor again. Being all met, and the ca
tam With me, I caused the men to be brought before me, an I
told them I had got a fiill account of their villanous behavior
to the captain, and how they had run away with the shin, and
were preparing to commit fiirther robberies, but that Providence
had ensnared them in their oivn ways, and that they were
Ellen into the pierhich they had dug for others. I let them

' know that b my direction the ship had been seized; that she
lay now in tre road; and they might see, by and by, that their
new captain had received the reward of his villany, and that
they would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that as to them,
I wanted to know what they had to say why 1 should not execute
[hem as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they
could not doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mer-
cy. But I told them I knew not what merc to show them;
for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the is and with all my
men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for Eng-
land; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to Eng-
land other than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried for mutin ,
and running awa with the ship; the consequence of whic ,
they must needs now, would be the gallows; so that I could
not tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take
their fate in the island; if they desired that, as I had liberty to
leave the island, I had some inclination to give them their lives,
if they thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to stay
there than be carried to England to be hanged: so I left it on
that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the ca tain, and told him that they were in
prisoners, not his; an that seeingI had ofl'ered them so muc

avor, I would be as good as m word; and that if he did not
think fit to consent to it, I won d set them at liberty, as I found
them; and if he did not like it, he might take them again if
he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very thankful,
and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods to the place whence they came, and I would
leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some direc
tions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. Upon
this I prepared to go on board the ship; ut told the captain
I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him -
to go on board, in t e mean time, and keep all right in the
ship, and send the boat on shore next day for ,me; ordering
him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to
be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.

When the captain was one, I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entere seriously into discourse with them
on their circumstances. I told them I thou ht they had made
a ri rht choice; that if the captain had carried them away, they
wou d certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to ex ect.

When they ha all declared their willingness to stay, I then
told them I would let them into the story of my living there,
and put them into the wa of making it easy to them; accord--
ingly, I gave them the w ole history of the place, and of my
coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
in bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ' and,in a word,
a] that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the
story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to beexpected,
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them
in common with themselves. Here it may be noted, that the
captain had ink on board, who was greatly sur rised that I
never hit it on a way of-making ink of char and water,
or of something else, as I had done things much more diflicult.

I left them my fire-arms, viz. five muskets, three fowling-
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of
powder left; for afier the first year or two, I used but littlei
and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way
mana ed the oats, an directions to milk and fatten them, and
to ma e both utter and cheese: in a word,I gave them ever
part of my own story; and told them I should prevail wit
the captain to leave t em two barrels of gun owder' more, and
some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very
glad of: also I gave them the ha of which the ca tam

ad brought me to eat, and bade em sure to sow an in-
crease them. -

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did
not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of the
five men came swimming to the ship's Side, and malEinga m'ost
lamentable complaint of the other three, be ged to be taken
into the ship, for God's sake, for they shculd be murdered, and
begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them immediately. Upon this, the ca tain pretended to have
no power without me; but after some ifliculty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and
were some time after soundly whipped and pickled; after
which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some tune after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being'up, with the things promised to the men; to which
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes
to be added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I
also encourawed them, by telling them that if it lay in my
power to send any vessel to take them in, I would not for-
get them.

When' 1 took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
reliques, the great goat-skin ca I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also 1 orgot not to take the money I
formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless, that
it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardl ' pass for sil-
ver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled; as also the
money I found in the wreck of the Spanish shi . And thus
I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship's
account, in the year 1036, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered
from this second captivity the same day of the month that I
first made my escape in the long-boat, from amon the Moors
of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, lg arrived in
England the llth of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-
five ears absent.

hen I came to England. I was as perfect a stranger to all
the world as if I had never been known there. My benefactor
and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in trust with.
was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was
become a widow the second time, and very low in the world.
I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I
would give her no trouble; but pn the contrary, in atituda
for her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieve her as
my little stock would afi'ord; which, at that time, would in-
deed allow me to do but little for,her; but I assured her I would
never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I for et her
when I had suflicient to help her, as shall be observ in its
proper place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ;. but my
tather was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, ex-
cept that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of
my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,
there had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word,
I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in
the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had
so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship
and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the own-

ers of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and _.
the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other'

merchants concerned, and all to ether made me a ver hand-
some compliment upon the subJect, and a present 0 almost
PS200 sterling.

But after making several reflections u n the circumstances
of my life, and how little way this woul go towards settling
me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the state of my plantation in
the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I
had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for
dead. With this view I took shippin for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following; my man riday accompanying
me very honestly in all these ramblin , and proving a most
faithful servant upon all occasions. \fis en I came to Lisbon.

old friend the ca tain of the ship who first took me u at sea
of the shore of ffiica. He was now grown old, and ad left
off going to sea, havinv put his son, who was far from a young
man, into his shi ,deg an who still used the Brazil trade. The
old man did not 'now me; and, indeed, I hardly knew him;
but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon
IIJrought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who
was.

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us, I Inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation
and my partner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Brazrls for about nine years; but that he could assure me,
that when he came away, my partner was living; but the trus-
tees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my
part, were both dead; that, however, he believed I would have
a very good account of the improvement of the plantation; for
that upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce
of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had
appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one third to
the king, and two thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to
oe expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion
of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or
any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored;
on y that the improvement or annual production, being dis-
tributed to charitable uses, could not be restored; but he
assured me that the steward of the king's revenue from lands,
and the provedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken
great care all along that the incumbent, that IS to say, my
partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of
which they had duly received my moiet . I asked him if he
knew to what height of im rovement he liad brought the lan-
tation, and whether he t ought it might be worth loo ing
after; or whether, on my going thither, should meet with_any
obstruction to my ssessing my just right in the morety.
He told me he couldptiiot tell exactly to what degree the plan-
tation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner wasrown exceeding rich upon the enjoyin his art of it; and
t at, to the best of his remembrance, e h heard that the
king's third of my part, which. was, it seems, granted away to
some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above
two hundred moidores a year; that as to my bemfiestored to
a quiet possession of it, there was no question to made of
that, m partner being alive to Witness my title, and my name
being also enrolled in the register of the country: also he told
me, that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
ple, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only '
ave their assistance for puttin me in possession, but would
find a ver considerable sum 0 money in their hands for my
account, ing the produce of the farm while their fathers held
the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he
remembered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this ac-
count, and inquired of the old captain how it came to ass that
the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when e knew
that I had-made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese
ca tain, my universal heir, &c.

e told me that was true; but that as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some
certain account should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it
was true he had registered my will, and ut in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive,
he would have acted by rocuration,' and taken possession of '
the ingeino (so they cal ed the sugar-house), and have iven
his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. " ut,"
says the old man, "I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhagies may not be so acceptable to you as the rest;
and that is, lieving you were lost, and all the world [believing
so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with me,
in your name, for six or eight of the first years' profits, which
I received. There being at that time great disbursements is:
increasing the works, building an ingeino, and buying slaves,-
It did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced
however," says the old man, " I shall give you a true account
of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it."

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend,

he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my
lantation, signed by .my partner and the merchant-trustees,
ing always delivered in goods, viz.' tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the consequence
of'a sugar-work; and I found, by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased ; but, as above, the disburse-
ments being large, the sum at first was small: however, the
old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and
fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his shi ; he
having been shi )wrecked coming home to Lisbon, aboute even
years after my caving the place. The good man then began
to complain of his nnsfortunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him
a share in a new ship. "However, my old friend," says he,
" you shall not want a su )ply in your necessity; and as soon
as my son returns, ou srall be fully satisfied." Upon this
he pulls out an ol pouch, and gives me one hundred and
sixty Portu al moidores in gold; and giving the writin s of
his title to t re ship, which lns son was gone tothe Braz s in,
of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son another, he
nuts them both into my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the
cor man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he
lad done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly

ow sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if
his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at
that time, and if it would not straiten him. He told me he
could not say but it mi ht straiten him a little; but, however,
it was my money, and fmight want it more than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of affection and 1

could hardly refrarn from tears while he spoke: in short, 1
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a en and
ink to give him a receipt for them: then I returned ' the
rest, and told him if ever] had possession of the plantation,
1 would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards
did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's
ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted
the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if
l did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to ex-
pect, I would never have a penny more lrorn him.

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put
me into a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told
him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so
if I please ; but that if I did not, there were ways enou h to
secure my ri-rht, and immediately to appropriate the re ts to
my use; and as there were ships in the river of Lis u just
ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a.
public register, with his affidavit, aflirmin , upon oath that I
was alive, and that I was the same person w 0 took upethe land
for the planting the said plantation at first. This infi refi-
ularly attested bv a notary, and a procuration affixed, e -
rected me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant
of his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed my stay-
in with him till an account came of the return. .

ever was any thing more honorable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I re-
ceived a lar 6 packet from the survivors of my trustees, the
merchants, or whose account I went to sea, in which were the
i'ollowin articular letters and papers inclosed. _

Firstfilphere was the account-current of the produce of my
farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal ca tain, being for Six years:
the balance appeared to be one t ousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favor. .

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while
they kept the effects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person

not to be found, which they cailed civil death; and the hal--
25 ' ' .
ance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted
to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes,
bein about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.

Tiiirdly, There was the prior ol'Augustine's account, who
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not
being to account tor what was dis )osed of by the hospital,
very honestly declared he had eight tundred and seventy-two
mordores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my ac-
count: as to the king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter ol'my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving,r me an account how
the estate was Improved, and what it produced a year; with
a particular of the number of squares or acres that it con-
tained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it, and
making two-and-twent)' crosses lbr blessings, told me he had
said so many A no lilo/'1'!" to thank the blessed Virgin that l
was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and
take possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to give
him orders to whom he should deliver my etl'ects, if I did not
come myself; concludirm with a hearty tender of his friend-
ship, and that of his litmfiy; and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and who,
it seems, had made a better voyage than 1. He sent me also
five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of
field uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same

eet in two merchant-trustees ship )ed me one thousand two
hundred, chests of sugar, eight hun red rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to ex ress the
flutterings of m ver heart when I found all my we th about
me; for as the raz' ships come all in fleets, the same ships

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29'.

prise of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot '
nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause
of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe,
if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the
spirits, I should have died.

I was new master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well
call it, in the lirazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in Entrland; and, in a word, I was
'm a condition which I scarce linew how to understand or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first
thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good
old ca Hill", who had been first charitable to me in my dis-
tress, 'iud to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the
end. I showed him all that was sent to me: I told him, that
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all'things
it was owin to him; and that it now lay on me to reward
him, which would do a hundred-fold; soI first returned to
nim the hundred moidores I had received of him; then-I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or
discharge from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which
he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest
manner possible; after which I caused a_procuration to be
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to ac-
count with him, and make the returns y the usual fleets to
him in my name; and a clause in the end, bein a grant of
one hundred moidores a year to him during his Iii, out of the
effects, and fit moidores a year to his son afier him, for his
life; and thus requited my old man". -

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands and, indeed, I had-more care u on my head
now than I had in my silent state oflife in the ' and, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what]

wanted , whereas 1 had now a great charge upon me, and
my business was how to secure it. I had no cave now to hide
my money in, or a lace where it min'ht lie without lock or
key, till it rew mou dy and tarnished before any body would
meddle wit it: on the contrary, I knew not where to put it,
or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and thaf was the only refuge I had. In the next
place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thith-
er; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I
had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the widow,
who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then'
she was in years, and but poor and, for aught I knew, might
be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with me.

It was some months, however before I resolved u on this;
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain f , and to
his satisfaction who had been my former benefactor, so I be-

an to think of my dpoor widow, whose husband had been my

st benefactor, an she, while it was in her power my faith-
ful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did I got a
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London,
not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I
lived, have a further supply : at the same time I sent my two
sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one
havin been married and left a wrdow; and the other havin
a bus and not so kind to her as he should be. But among
my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet itch u on one
to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock that might
a: away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and

's greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have
settled myself there, for" I was, as it were, naturalized tothc
nlace; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion.
much insensibly drew me back. However, it was not re-
ligion that kept me from going there for the resent; and as I
had made no scru le of being openly of t 8 religion of the
country all the w ' e I was among them, so neither did I yet;
only that, now and then, having of. late thought more of it
than formerly, when I began to think of living and dying
amon them, I be an to regret my havmg gofessed my-
self a apist, and ought it might not be the st religion to
die with. " ' '

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know
with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I resolved at
last, to o to England with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded
I shoulf make some acquaintance, or find some relations that
would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go
to England with all my wealth. _ '.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the
Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of thin s I had from
thence; and, first, to the prior of St. Augustinefi wrote a let-
ter full of thanks for their just dealings, and the ofl'er of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor,
as the prior should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers
for me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my
two trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much jus-
tice and honesty called for; as for sending them any present
they were far above having any occasion for it. .Lastly, I
wrote to.my artner, acknowledging his industry mthe im-
proving the p antation, and his Integrity in increasing the
stock of the works; giving him instructions for his future gov-
ernment of my part, according to the powers I had left Wlth
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever he:
came due to me, till he should hear from me more partic-
ularly; assuring him that it was my intention not _only to
tome to him, but to settle myself there for the remamderof

my life. To this! added a very handsome resent of some
Italian silks for his'wife and two daughters, or such the cap-
tain's son informed me he had; with two pieces affine En lish
broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces of b ack
baize, and some Flanders lace ol'a good value.

Havin thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all my e sets into good bills of exchange, my next difliculty
was, which way to go to England: I tad been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aVersion to go to
England by sea at that time; and though I could give 'no
reason for it yet the ditficulty increased upon me so much,
that thoughI had once shi ped my baggage in order to go,
yet I altered my mind, an that not once, but two or three
times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea,ctnd this
might be some of the reasons; but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment: two
of the ships which I had singled out to go in--I mean more
particularly singled out than any other, having put my thin s
on board one of them, and in the other to have agreed with a
captain--I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was
taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot
(to whom I communicated every thing) Ipressed me earnestly
not to go by sea, but either to go by Inn to the Groyne, and
cross over the Ba of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an eas' an safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and over; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way
by land through France. In a word,l was so prepossessed
against m gomg by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover,
that I reso ved to travel all the way by land; which, as I Was
not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
Kleasmter way '_ and to make it more so, my old captain.

rought an Eng rsh gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lis-
!bon, who was willing to travel with me; alter which n"
-cked up two more English merchants also, and two young

ortuguese gentlemen, the last oing to Paris only; sothat
in all there were six of us, and %ve servants; the two mer-
chants and the two Portuguese cementing themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides
my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable
of sup lying the place of a servant on the road.

In t is manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company
being very well mounted and armed we made a little troop,
whereof they did me the honor to call me captain, as well be-
cause I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants,
and, indeed, was the original of the whole journey. ,

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I
shall'trouble Iyou now with none of my land journal; but some
adventures t at happened to us in this tedious and difficult
journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of iis stran ers_to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of am,
and to see what was worth observing; but it being the atter

' part of the summer we hastened away, and set out from Ms-
drid about the middle of October; but when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the
way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains, that several travellers were
obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted,
at an extreme hazard to pass on. _ .

When we came to l'ampeluna itself, we found .It so indeed;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to
countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold
was insufi'erable; nor,'indeed, was it more ainful .than sut-
prising, to come but ten days before out of 0 d Castile, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and immediately
to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so
severely cold, as to be intolerable, and toendanger benumbm;
Ind perishing of our fin ers and toes.

Poor Friday was re y frightened when he saw the moun-

 

m gamma. 2.x" 42235.. skiert'm'l-- ' 'Lm'hduwmmmmmimkmxhflAEnm-L
tains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he
had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the matter,
when we came to Pam eluna, it continued snowing with so
much violence, and so ong, that the people said Winter was
come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult be-
fore, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay
in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard
frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no
going without being in danger of being buried alive every
step. We staid no less than twent ' days at Fampeluna; when,
seeing the winter coming on, an no likelihood of its bemr
better--for it was the severest winter all over Europe that ha

been known in the memory of man--I proposed that we should
all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bour-
deaux, which was a very little voyage. But while I was con-
sidering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, hav-
ing been stopped on the French side of t 1e asses, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a guide, w 10, traversing the
country near the head of Lanruedoc, had brought them over
the mountains by such ways, t at they were not much incom-
Inoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them
and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he
would undertake to carry us the same way with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to ro-
tect ourselves from wild beasts; " For," he said, " upon t ese
great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show them-
selves at the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for
want of food, the round being covered w1th snow." We told
him we were we] enough 'prepared for such creatures as
they were if he would ensure us from a kind of two-le ged
wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger 50m.
especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied
us that there was no danger of ,that kind in the way that wt
were to 0: so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also
twelve 0 er gentlemen, with their servants, some French
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were
obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was sur rised, when,
instead of going forward, he came directly bacK with us on
the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty
miles; when, havin passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we ound ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but
on a sudden, turnin to his left, he ap roached the mountains
another way; and Slough it is true t e hills and precipices
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders
and led us by such winding ways, that we msensibly passed
the height of the mountains without bein much encumbered
with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he s wed us the pleas-
ant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green
an flourishm , though, indeed, at a great distance, and we
had some rou way to pass still.

We were afiittle uneas , however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a nig t so fast that we could not travel;
but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past itall: we
found, indeed,'that we be an to descend ever day, and to
come more north than be ore; and so, depen ing upon our
guide, we went on. a '

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood: two of the wolves made at the
guide, and had he been far before us he would have been de-
voured before we-could have helped him ' one of them fast--

up to the. poo: man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that at-
tacked him in the head.

It was happy for the oer man that It was my man Frida ;
for he having been used) to such creatures in his country, 8
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him,
as above; whereas any other of us would have fired at a far
ther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or en-
dangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I
and indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most disma
howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the
mountains, a peared to us as if there had been a rodigious
number of tiem; and perhaps there was not sucli afew as
that we had no cause of apprehensions; however, as Friday
had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse
left him immediately, and fled, without doing him any dam-
age, havin hap ily fastened upon his head, where the bosses
o the bri e ha stuck in his teeth. But the man was most
hurt; for the racing creature had bit him twice, once in the
arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and though
he had made some defence, he was 'ust as it were tumblin
down, by the disorder of his horse, w en Friday came up and
shot the wolf.

It is eas to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mende our ace, and rode up as fast as the way, which
was very difliculli, would give us leave, to see what was the
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded
us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide, thou h_ we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was e had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday and
the bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surprised
and afrad for him) the greatest diversion imaginable. A

qualities wmcn generallyare the rule of his actions; first, as
to men, who are not his roper prey (he does not usually at-
tempt them, exce t they t attack him, unless he be est--
sive hungry, whic it is robable might now be the case, the

ound bein covered wit snow), if on do not meddle with

im, he wil not meddle with you; {mt then you must take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a
very nice gentleman; he will not go a. step out of his way for
a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, 'your best way is to
look another way, and keep going on; or sometimes if you
stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes' it
for an affront; but if you throw or toss any thing at him, and it
hits him (though it were but a bit of stick as h' as your finger),
he thinks himself abused, and sets .all otherlfimsines asi e to
pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of

onor ;--'this is his first quality: the next is, if he be once
afl'ronted, he will never leave you, night nor day, till he ha
his revenge, but follows, at a good round rate, till he over-
takes you.

My man Friday had delivered our ide, and when we came
up to him he was helping him 0 his horse--for the man
was both hurt and frightened--when, on a sudden, we espied
the bear come out of the wood; and a vast monstrous one it
was, the bi <<rest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little
surprised w en we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it
was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance:
" 0, 0, 0 ! " says Frida , three times pointing to him; " 0,
master! you give me be eave me shakes to hand with him;
me makee you good laugh."

I was sur rised to see the fellow so well pleased: " You
fool," says , " he will eat you up."--" Eatec me u ! eatse
me up ! " says Friday, twice over strain; " me eatee im up;
me makce you ood laugh; you afi stay bore, me show you
good laugh." down he sits, and gets off his boots in a
moment, and puts on a air of pumps (as we call the flat
shoes they wear, and whic he had in his pocket), gives my

other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like
the wind.

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to muddle with
nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him--"llark ye, hark ye," says Friday,
" me spcakee with you." We followed at a distance; for now
being come down on the Gaseony side of the mountains, we
wore entered a vast, great forest, where the country was plain
and pretty 0 )en, though it had many trees in it scattered here
and there. riday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a reat stone and
throws it at him, and hit him just on the leadeut did him no
more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he
did it purely to make the bear follow him, and .show us some
laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and
saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking devilish
long strides, and shufllin on at a strange rate, so as would
have put a horse to a mi dling gallop; away runs Friday, and
takes his course as if he ran towards us for help; so we all
resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the hear back
upon us, when he was going about his awn business another
way; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear
upon us, and then run awa ; and I called out, "You dog, is
this your making us laugh' Come away, and take your horse,
that we may shoot the creature." He heard me, and cried
out, "No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you t much
laugh; " and as the nimble creature ran two feet for t e bear's
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a
great oak tree fit for his pur use, he beckoned to us to fol-
low: and doubling his pace, ie gets nimbly up the tree,-lay-
ing his gun down upon the ground, at about fire or six yards
from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance; the first thing he did, he
stopped at the gun, smelt to it. but let it lie, and up he scram-
bles into the tree, climbin like a cat, thou h so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at t e folly, as I thoug t it, of my man,
and could not for my hfe see any thin to laugh at yet, till see-
in the bear get up the tree, we all ro< e near to him.

Vhen we came to the tree, there was Friday at out to the
small end of a large branch, and the bear got a ut half way _,
to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the I
limb of the tree was weaker,--"Ha!" sa 3 he to us, "now '1
you see me teachee the bear dance; " so e falls a jumping
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should
get back; then, indeed, we did lau h heartily. But Friday

ad not done with him by a great dezfi; when, seeing him stand
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear
could speak English, " hat, you come no farther? pray
you come farther: " so he left jumping and shaking the tree;
and the bear, just as it'he understood what he said, did come
a little farther; then he fell a jumping again, and the bear
stopped again. We thou ht now was a good time.to knock
himin the head, and calfed to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly, " O pray!
O gray! no shoot; me shoot by and then;" he would have
sai by and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday
danced sq much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough, but still could not ima ine what the_ fellow
would do; for first we thou ht he depen ed upon shaking the
bear 011'; and we found the ar was too cunning for that too;
for he would not 0 out far enough to be thrown down, but
clings fast with is great broad claws and feet, so that we
could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what.the
'est would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quick-
y; for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he
would not be persuaded to come any farther, "Well, well,"
says Friday, "you no come farther, me go; you no come to
me, me cometo oug" and upon this he goes out to_ the
smaller end of the ugh, where it would bend wrth~ his weight,
and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the bough, till
he came near enough to jump down on is feet, and away he
runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands still. " Well," said I
to him, "Friday, what will you do now? Why don't you
shoot him ? "---" No shoot," says Friday, " no yet; me shoot
now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:" and
indeed, so he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he
stood, but did it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every
step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the
tree; then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
lltc tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a
time, very leisurel'. At this juncture, and just belbre he
could set his hind out on the ground, Friday stepped up close
to him. clapped the muzzle of his flew into his ear, and shot
Inm dead. I'hen the rogue turne about to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he
falls a laughing himself very loud. "So we kill bear in my
country," says Friday, " So you kill them? " says I: " why,
you have no guns."--"No," says he, "no un, but shoot
rreat much lon arrow." This was a good iversion to us;
ut we were sti in a wild lace, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling of wolves
ran much in my head; and, indeed, exce t the noise I once
heard on the shore of Africa, of which I ave said somethin
zltlready, I never heard any thing that filled me with so muc

iorror.

These things, and the ap roach of night, called us ofi', or
else, as Friday would have liad us, we should certainly have
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth
saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide
hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward on our

Journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures,
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest ana* ------~----_--

piaut country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had
done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they sur-
prised the country people, killed a great many of their sheep
and horses, and some people too. \Vc had one dangerous
place to pass, which our guide told us, if there were more.
wolves in the country, we should lind them there; and this was
a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long,
narrow delile, or lane, which we were to )ass to get through
the wood, and then we should come to tie village where we
were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the lirst wood, and a little after sunset when we came
into the plain: we met with nothing in the lirst wood, except
that, in a little plain within the wood, which was not above
two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some
prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were
gone out of sight in a few moments, Upon this, our guide,
~ who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep
in a ready osture, for he believed there were more wolves a
comin'r. e kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood,
which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon
as we came into the plain, we had occasion euou h to look
about us; the first object we met with was a dead iorse, that
is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen oftbem at work, we could not say eating of him,
but picking of his bones, rather; lbr they had eaten up all the
flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means;
for I found we were like to have more business upon our hand.~l
than we were aware of. We were not gone halfover the plan].
when we began to hear the wolves bowl in the wood on our left
in a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a bun-
dred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most
cf them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by_expc
rienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to reeeiva
them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the nly
way ; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should
fire, and that the others who had not fired should stand ready
to give them a second volley immediately, if they continued to
advance upon us; and then that those who had fired at first
should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready
every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee
and a pair of pisto 5 each man; so we were, by this method,

able to fire Six volleys, half of us at a time: however, at present
we had no necessity ; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy
made a full sto , bein terrified as well with the noise as wit

the fire; four 0 them, ing shot in the head, dropped; several

others were wounded, and went bleeding ofi', as we could see

by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately '

retreat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that
the fiercest creatures were, terrified at the voice of a man, I
caused all the compan to halloo as loud as we could; and I
found the notion not together mistaken: for upon our shout
they began to retire, and turn about. I then ordered a second
volley to be fired in their rear, which ut them to the. gallop,
and away they went to the woods. 'his gave us leisure to
charge our pieces again ; and that we might lose no time, we
kept going: but we had but little more than loaded our fitsees,
and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible neise
in the same wood, on our left, only that it was farther onward,
the same way we were toga. _

The ni ht was coming on, and the h ht began to be_dusky,
which m e it worse on our side; butt ie nmse increasing, we
could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, we rceived two
or three troo s of wolves, one on our left, one hind us, and
one in our fiiont, so that we seemed to be surrounded With
them: however, as they did not fiill upon us, we kept our way
forward, as fags; as we could make our horses go, which, the

U '
way being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this
manner we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through
which we were to pass, at the farther_ side of the lain; but
we were greatly surprised, when, coming nearer t e lane or
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the
entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a
horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, fiyin like the wind,
and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, f speed; indeed
the horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed that he
could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would
get up with him at last; no question but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous crea-
tures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we
heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but as to the man his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they athered about us resently, in hopes of prey; and I
verily lieve there were t ree hundred of them. It happened
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some lar e timber-
trees, which had been cut down the summer be ore, and I
suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troo in
among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behin one
lon tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree
beore us for a breastwork, to stand in a trian le, or three
fronts, inclosin our horses in the centre. We id so, and it
was well we di ; for never was a more furious charge than
the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on
With a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of tim-
ber which, as said, was our breastwork as if they were only
rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was
principally occasroned by their seeing our horses behind us"N ,_.V away

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 307

I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and they
took their aim so sure, that they killed several of the wolves
at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a contin-
ual firing for they came on like devils, those behind pushing
on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off,
but it was but a moment, for others came forward again; so
we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four
firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed
twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to spend
our shot too hastily; so I called Indy servant (not my man
Friday, for he was better em loye for, with the eatest
dexterity imaginable, 'he had 0 arge my fusee and ' own
while we were engaged); but, as I said, I called my other
man, and iving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train
all along e piece of timber, and let it be alarge train. He
did so; and had but just time to get away, when the wolves .
came u to it and some got upon it, when , snapping an un-
charge pistol close to the powder, set it on fire;_those that
were upon the timber were scorched with it, and an or seven
of them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire; we despatched these in an instant, and the
rest were so frightened With the light, which the night (for it
was now very near dark) made more terrible, that ey drew
back a little; upon which I ordered our last istols to be fired
011' in one volley, and afier that we ave a out: upon this
the wolves turned tail, and we sallie immediately upon near
twenty lame ones, that we found struggling on the ground, .
and fell a cutting them with our swor s, which answered our
expectation; for the crying and howling they made was bet-
ltea understood by their ellows ; so that they all tied and
e us. .

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and
had it been daylight, we had killed many more. . The field of
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had
still near a .eague to go. We heard the ravenous creatures how.
and yell in the woods as we went, several times, and some-
times we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour more we
came to the town where We were to lodge, which we found in
a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, the night be-
fore, the wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and
put them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle, and, indeed, their peo le.

The next morning our gui e was so ill, and his limbs sWelled
so much with the ranklin" of his two wounds, that he could go
no farther; so we were 0 zliged to take a new guide here, and
go to Thoulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor any thing like
them; but when we told our story at Thoulouse, they told us
it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the
foot of the mountains, es ecially when the snow lay on the
ground ; but they inquire much what kind of a guide we had
got, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe
season; and told us it was surprisin we were not all devoured.
When we told them how we place ourselves, and the horses
in the middle, they blamed us exceedin ly, and told us it was
fifty to one but we had been all destroyegl; for it was the sight
of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their
grey; and that, at other times, they are really afraid of a gun;

at bemg excessive hungry, and racing on that account, the
eagerness to come at the horses ha made them senseless of
danger; and that if we had not, by the continued fire, and at
last y the stratagem of the train of wder, mastered them, it
had been great odds but,that we ad been torn to pieces;
whereas had we been content to have sat still on horseback,
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as
otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood
all together. and left our horses, they would have been so
eager to nave devoured them, that we might have come 03
sate, especially havmg our firearms in our hands, and bein
so many in number. For my art,I was never so sensible o
danger in my life; for seeing a ove three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and .having nothing
to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as
it was, I believel shall never care to cross those mountains
again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by
sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France,--nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advanta re than I can. I
travelled from 'I'houlouse to Paris, and wit out any consider-
able stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th
ol'January, alter havin'r a severe cold season to travel in.

l was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a
little time all my new-discovered estate safe about me; the
hills of exchange which] brought with me having been very
currently" paid. .

My principal uide and priv counsellor was in good an-
cient widow; w o, in gratitu e for the money had sent
her, thought no pains too much, nor care too great to employ
for me ;' and I trusted her so entirely with every thing, that I
was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, in-
deed, l was very happy from the beginning, and now to the
end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the
Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having

offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees '

who lived in the Bra'zils, they accepted the ofi'er, and remit
thirty~three thousand pieces-of-eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to ay for it. .
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form-which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent
me the bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces-of-eight for the es-

tate; reserving the payment of 100 moidores ayear to hill _->>-r*--v----- ~w--v'wvwwm-wr I, w -.--

the old man) durinr his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to
is son for his life, w rich 1 had promised them; and which the
plantation was to make good as a rent-char 6.

And thus I have riven the first part of a h e of fortune and
adventure--a life 0 rovidence's checker-work, and of a vari-
ety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of;
beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this state of complicated 00d
fortune, I was past running any more hazards, and so in eed
[ had been, if other circumstances had concurred; but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relationS'
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not
keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be
upon the win arain; especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I 1a to see my island, and to know if the cor
Spaniards were in bein there. My true friend the wi ow,
earnestly dissuaded me Iiom it, .and so far prevailed with me,
that, for almost seven years, she prevented m running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews, t e children of one
of my brothers into my care : the eldest, having something of
his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and ave him a settlement
of some addition to his estate, after my ecease. The other I
put out to :1 ca tain of a ship; and alter five years, finding

im a sensible, )ld, enterprismg young fellow, 1 put him into
a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow
afterwfards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures
m se .

n the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or'dis-
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one daugh-
ter; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home With ,
good success from a voyage to Spam, m inclination to go
abroad, and his importunity, prevailed an engaged me to go
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies: this was in
the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited In new colony in the island, saw
my successors the Spaniar 3, had the whole story of their
lives, and of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards; how the ' alterwards agreed, disagreed, uni-
ted, separated; and how at ast the Spaniards were obliged to
use violence with them; how they were subjected to the Span-
mds; how honestly the Spaniards used them; a history, if it
were entered into, as full at variety and wonderful accidentsas
my own part; particularly also as to their battles With the Ca-
ribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the
improvt:ment they made upon the island itself; and how five
of them made an attempt upon the main land, and brought
away eleven men and five women prisoners; by which, at my
coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.

llere l staid about twenty days; left them supplies of all
necessary things, and articularly of arms, powder, shot,
clothes, tools, and two wor men, which I brought from England
with me; viz. a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved
to myself the pro erty of the whole, but gave them such Iparts
respectively, as t Iey agreed on; and, having settled all t ings
th1 them, and engaged them not to .eave the place, I left
them there.

From thence I touched at the Brales, from whence I. sent a
hark, which I bought there, with more people, to the island;
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, bemg
such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to
send them some women from En land, with a . cargo .of
necessaries, if the would apply t emselvesto p antmg; which
I afterwards coul not perform: the fellows proved. very honest
and diligent, after they were mastered, and had their propsrtws
set apart for them. I sent them also from the Braz five
cows, three of them beingI big with calf, some shee , and

some $158, which, when came again, were mnsi erably
