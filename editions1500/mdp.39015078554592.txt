FOREWORD
Here, at last, after two hundred years, the immortal Robinson
Crusoe, and his man, Friday, appear in the flesh, as the illustrations
from the Universal Film version of this old favorite will testify.
Many more of the classics of English literature would be
filmed for the screen were it not for the great difference in the
technique of literature and motion pictures. Only those who have
studied the new art of motion photography realize the peculiar
demands that it makes on a story which is perfectly acceptable as
literature.
Those who read this specially revised edition of "Robinson
Crusoe" and see the Universal's serial version of it will find many
differences which are explained solely on the ground of this radical
difference. A moving picture requires a story. Daniel DeFoe's
classic was a diary. A moving picture also demands a love interest,
whereas DeFoe's "Robinson Crusoe" had none. Realizing this,
those who witness "Robinson Crusoe" on the screen will easily find
it in their hearts to forgive the director for his additions to the
original text.
Universal went to a great deal of expense in the filming of
"Robinson Crusoe." In the first place, the Scenario Department
dug deeply into all the facts bearing upon the Alexander Selkirk
incident, and in their research work enjoyed the advantage of the
very first edition of the Daniel DeFoe book. This work contains
a number of incidents which are left out of later editions, although
its intensely religious tone differs in no respect from the edition
which is available today. The wholesome lesson which "Robinson
Crusoe" teaches, that of absolute dependence upon the Divine
Will and the ordering of events by Providence, is scrupulously
carried out in the film version. It seemed, however, advisable to
inject a wholesome love interest and this has been accomplished
without violating the spirit of the DeFoe book. "Robinson
Crusoe" acquires not only a sweetheart before he left England, but
also a wife in the person of one of the survivors of the Spanish crew
which were wrecked on an adjoining island.
Through illustrations and historical works a vessel of exactly
the type used at the time was constructed. One of the main
peculiarities of this vessel is that it is erected on dry land and on
one of the highest points of Universal City to get an unobstructed
horizon. This is one of the secrets of the film that should not be
explained, but anyone who saw the filming of the picture at
Universal City would doubtless wonder at a sailor jumping
overboard from a doomed vessel into a net, then going forty miles
away to have the next shot of him made, jumping into the ocean.
In every other respect the film is as nearly a duplication of the
original story as it is possible to make. The costumes, properties,
paraphernalia and even the scenery of the island and its environs,
as described in Daniel DeFoe's narrative, have been reproduced
with fidelity to the original.
In the hands of Harry Myers, the character of Crusoe takes
on a new human vitality; Noble Johnson plays with simplicity
and naturalness the part of Friday; while Tote Du Crow assumes
the role of his father, captured by the cannibals and rescued by
Crusoe and Friday. Gertrude Olmstead plays the role of Crusoe's
earlier sweetheart, while Margaret Livingston assumes the other
imaginative role, that of the Spanish girl.

ROBINSON CRUSOE
WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country,
my father being a foreigner, of Bremen, who
settled first at Hull; he got a good estate by
merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived
afterward at York; from whence he had married
my mother, whose relations were named Robin-
son, a very good family in that country, and from
whom I was called Robinson.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts; my
father had given me a competent share of learning, and designed
me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to
sea, and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will
of my father, and entreaties of my mother, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propension of nature, tending directly to
the life of misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me
one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout,
and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject, asking
me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had
for leaving my father's house and my native country.
And though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet
he would venture to say to me that if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be
none to assist in my recovery.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and I resolved
not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home
according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days wore it all
off; and a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little
more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were
entirely bent upon seeing the world, and that my father had better
give me his consent than force me to go without it; and if she would
speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home
again, and did not like it, I would go no more.
But this my mother refused to do, saying "she knew it would
be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject."
It was not till almost a year after this, being one day at Hull,
that, meeting one of my companions about to go by sea to London
in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them, I consulted
neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word
of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking
God's blessing or my father's, on the 1st of September, 1651,1 went
on board a ship bound for London. Never any young adventurer's
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner or continued longer than mine.
The ship was no sooner got out of the Humber than the wind began
to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I
had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body
and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what
I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning
my duty.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor
what I saw a few days after. I expected every wave would have
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought
it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more;
in this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions that if it
would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got
my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the
wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured
to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little

seasick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was
quite over, and a charming fine evening followed. The sun went
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; having little
or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was,
as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and
so pleasant in so little a time after.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth
Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we
had made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to
come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary,
for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships
from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common harbor
where the ships might wait for a wind for the River.
But the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and
we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make every-
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible.
By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle
in, shipped several seas, and we
thought once or twice our anchor
had come home.
By this time it blew a terri-
ble storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amaze-
ment in the faces even of the
seamen themselves. The master,
though vigilant in the business
of preserving the ship, yet as he
went in and out of his cabin by
me, I could hear him softly to
himself say, several times, "Lord,
be merciful to us! We shall be
all lost! We shall be all un-
done I"

Toward evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of
our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very un-
willing to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not
the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away
the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so
much, they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a clear
deck.
And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all this,
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright
before at but a little. But the worst was not come yet; the storm
continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was
deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now
and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder, till I
inquired. However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is
not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment
when the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night,
and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men, that had
been down to see, cried out we had sprung a leak; another said
there was four feet of water in the hold. Then all hands were
called to the pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, died
within me; and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed, where I
sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me
that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump
as another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily.
But the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that the
ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little,
yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any
port, so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light
ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to
help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us;
but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and
venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over
the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length,
which they after much labor and hazard took hold of, and we hauled
them close under our stern, and got all into their boat; and partly
rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward,
sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our
ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time
what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea.
We made but slow way, nor were we able to reach the shore
till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the
westward, towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the
violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though not without
much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot
to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great
humanity, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to
London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have
gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our
blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me;
for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth
Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I
was not drowned. But my ill fate pushed me on now with an
obstinacy that nothing could resist; having some money in my
pocket, I traveled to London by land; and there, as well as on the
road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should
take, and whether I should go home or go to sea.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of lif e to lead. An irresist-
ible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed a while,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; and as that
abated, the little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with
it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out
for a voyage.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and misguided
young fellows as I then was, the devil generally not omitting to lay
some snare for them very early; but it was not so with me. I first
got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coast
of Guinea, and who, having had very good success there, was resolved
to go again. This captain, taking a fancy to my conversation,
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I
had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with
him I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and his
companion; and if I could carry anything with me I should have
all the advantage of it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I
might meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer; and this was the only voyage which I
may say was successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the
integrity and honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also
I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of
navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ."hip's course, take
an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that were
needful to be understood by a sailor. For, as he took delight to
instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage
made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded
me in London, at my return, almost £300; and this filled me with
those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the
same voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever
man made; for though I did not carry quite £100 of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had £200 left which I had lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes
in this voyage. And the first was this, viz., our ship making her
course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the gray of the morning
by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail
she could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards

would spread, or our masts cany, to have got clear; but finding the
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a
few hours, we prepared to fight, our ship having twelve guns and
the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up with
us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead
of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns
to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring in
also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on
board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves;
but laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he
entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting
and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small-shot,
half-pikes, powder chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of
them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our
story, our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners
into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre-
hended; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as
the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover
as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble,
and fit for his business.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house,
so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to
sea again, believing that it would some time or other be his fate
to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war; and that then
I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken
away; for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look after his
little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves about his
house; and when he came home again from his cruise he ordered me
to lie in the cabin to look after the ship. Here I meditated nothing
but my escape, and what method I might take to effect it, but found
no way that had the least probability in it.
After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty
again in my head. It happened one time that, going a-fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick that though we were not
half a league from the shore we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we labored all day, and all the next night.
And when the morning came we found we had pulled out to sea
instead of pulling in for shore; and that we were at least two leagues
from the land. However, we got well in again, though with a great
deal of labor and some danger, for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the morning.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more
care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the long
boat of our English ship which he had taken, he resolved he would
not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some provisions.
So he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English
slave, to build a little stateroom, or cabin, in the middle of the long
boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer
and haul home the mainsheet, and room before for a hand or two
to stand and work the sails.
We went frequently out with this "boat a-fishing; and as I was
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me.
It happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in
that place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had
therefore sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of pro-
visions than usual; and had ordered me to get ready three muskets
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship, for that they
designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed; when by and by my
patron came on board alone, and told me his guests had put off
going, from some business that fell out, and ordered me, with the
Moor and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some
fish, and that his friends were to sup at his house. He commanded
me, too, that as soon as I had got some fish I should bring it home
to his house; all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my
command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself
not for fishing business but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither
did I so much as consider, whither I would steer; for anywhere to
get out of that place was my desire.
My first contrivance was to make a pretense to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him
we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread.
He said that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat.
I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which
weighed about half an hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great
use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make candles. Another
trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also; his name
was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely; so I called to him:
"Moely," said I, "our patron's guns are all on board the boat; can
you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we may kill some
alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps
the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says he, "111 bring some."
Accordingly, he brought a great leather pouch, which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with shot,
that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the
boat. At the same time I had found some powder of my master's
in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the
case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another;
and thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the
port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a
mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and sat us down to
fish.
After we had fished some time and caught nothing, I said to
the Moor, "This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we
must stand farther off." He, thinking no harm, set the sails; and,
as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league farther, and
then brought her to as if I would fish; when, giving the boy the
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as
if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise with
my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea.
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to
me, begged to be taken in, telling me he would go all over the world
with me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have
reached me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling pieces, I
presented it at him and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he
would be quiet I would do him none. "But," said I, "you swim
well enough to reach the shore, and the sea is calm; make the best
of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you come
near the boat I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to
have my liberty." So he turned himself about, and swam for the
shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was
an excellent swimmer.
When he was gone I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury,
and said to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you
a great man; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me,"
that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard, "I must throw
you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so
innocently that I could not mistrust him, and swore to be faithful to
me and go all over the world with me.
While I was in the view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea, that they might think me gone towards the
Straits'1 mouth. But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I
changed my course, and steered directly south and by east, bending
*Slraiti. The Straits of Gibraltar.
my course a little towards the east that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet
sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock
in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than
one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee. Yet such was the
fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful apprehensions i
had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or go on
shore, or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had
sailed in that manner five days.
Then, the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me they also would now
give over. So I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an
anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what nor where;
neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what river.
I neither saw nor desired to see any people; the principal thing I
wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the
country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we
knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with
fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. After all, Xury's
advice was good, and I took it. We dropped our little anchor, and
lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frighted when we heard one mighty creature
come swimming toward our boat. However, I immediately stepped
to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which
he immediately turned about, and swam towards the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous
cries and bowlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of a
gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those creatures had never
heard before. This convinced me that there was no going on shore
for us in the night upon that coast; and how to venture on shore
in the day was another question too; for to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the paws
of lions and tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere
or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat. When
or where to get it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him
go on shore with one of the jars he would find if there was any
water and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? Why
I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy answered with
so much affection that made me love him ever after. Says he, "If
wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey." "Well, Xury," said
I, "we will both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them.
They shall eat neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-
bread to eat, and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on shore, carrying nothing but our
arms and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming
of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy, seeing a low
place about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by and by I
saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by
some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward
towards him to help him; but when I came nearer to him I saw
something hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had shot, like a hare but different in color, and longer legs; how-
ever, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the
great joy poor Xury came with was to tell me he had found good
water, and seen no wild mans; so we filled our jars, and feasted on
the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having
seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.
After this stop we made on to the southward continually for
ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which
began to abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore than
we were obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make
the River Gambia or Senegal; that is to say, anywhere about the
Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European
ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take but
to seek for the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I knew
19
that all the ships from Europe which sailed either to the coast of
Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those
islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the
shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to
them; but Xury was my better counselor, and said to me, "No go,
no go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk
to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way:
I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who
had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they
could throw them a great way with good aim. So I kept at a dis-
tance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and par-
ticularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to
stop my boat and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this, I
lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into
the country, and in less than half an hour came back, and brought
with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the
produce of their country; but we neither knew what the one nor
the other was. However, we were willing to accept it, but how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore
to them, and they were as much afraid of us. But they took a safe
way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it down,
and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and
then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make
them amends. But an opportunity offered that very instant to
oblige them wonderfully, for while we were lying on the shore, came
two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with
great fury from the mountains towards the sea. The man that
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, as the rest did; how-
ever, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not
offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into
the sea, and swam about. At last one of them began to come nearer
our boat that at first I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as
he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly in
the head; immediately he sank down into the water, but rose in-
stantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life,
and so indeed he was. He immediately made to the shore; but be-
tween the wound and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun. Some of them were ready
even to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror.
But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk into the water,
and that I made signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart
and began to search for the creature. I found him by his blood
staining the water: and by the help of a rope, which I slung round
him, and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an
admirable degree; and the negroes held up their hands with admira-
tion to think what it was I killed him with. The other creature,
frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun, swam to the
shore, and disappeared.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about
eleven days more, till I saw the land run out a great length into
the sea. Doubling the point at about two leagues from the land,
I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I concluded,
as it was indeed, the Cape de V«rd Islands. However, they were
at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best do;
for if I should be taken with a fresh gale of wind, I might neither
reach one nor other.
In this dilemma, I stepped into the cabin, and sat me down,
Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,
"Master, master, a ship with a sail!" and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his mas-
ter's ships sent to pursue us. I jumped out of the cabin, and imme-
diately saw not only the ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship;
upon which I stretched out to the sea as much as I could, resolving
to speak with them if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could
make any signal to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
glasses, and that it was some European boat, which they supposed
must belong to some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to
let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my
patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these
signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours' time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch
sailor, who was on board, called to me: and I answered him, and
told him I was an Englishman that had made my escape out of
slavery from the Moors at Sallee. They then bade me come on
board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable
and almost hopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliv-
erance. But he generously told me he would take nothing from
me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when I came
to the Brazils. "For," says he, "I have saved your life on no other
terms than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one
time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Be-
sides," said he, "when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way
from your own country, if I should take from you what you have
you will be starved there, and then I only take away that life I
have given. No, no," says he, "Seignor Inglese (Mr. Englishman),
I will carry you thither in charity, and these things will help you
to buy your subsistence there, and you passage home again."
As to my boat, he told me he would pay me eighty pieces of
eight for it. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for
my boy Xury; but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty,
who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However,
he said that he would set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian.
Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the
captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived about
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered from
the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next
with myself I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never
enough remember. He would take nothing of me for my passage,
and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered
to me. And what I was willing to sell he bought of me: such as
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax, for I had
made candles of the rest. In a word, I made about two hundred
and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I
went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house
of a good, honest man, I lived with him some time, and acquainted
myself, by that means, with the manner of their planting and mak-
ing of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how
they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settle
there, I would turn planter among them, resolving in the mean-
time to find out some way to get my money, which I had left in
London, remitted to me. To this purpose, I purchased land and
formed a plan for my plantation and settlement.
23

I had a neighbor, whose
name was Wells, and in much
such circumstances as I was.
My stock but was low, as well as
his; and we had rather planted
for food than anything else,
for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our
land began to come in order, so
that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of *-..
us a large piece of ground ready ^
for planting canes in the year to
come. But we both wanted
help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong
in parting with my boy Xury.
I was, in some degree, settled, before my kind friend, the cap-
tain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship
remained there near three months; when, telling him what little
stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice: "Seignor Inglese," says he, "if you will give
me letters, with orders to the person who has your money in Lon-
don, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct,
and in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you
the produce of them, God willing, at my return; but I would have
you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you
say, is half your stock; and if it miscarry, you may have the other
half to have recourse to for your supply."
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take; so
I accordingly prepared letters to the gentleman with whom I had
left my money.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my
adventures, and when this honest captain came to Lisbon he found
means to send over not the order only, but a full account of my
story, to a merchant in London, who represented it effectually to
her. Whereupon she not only delivered the money, but out of her
own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present
for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vested this hundred pounds in Eng-
lish goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them directly
to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made; for I was
surprised with the joy of it; and my good steward the captain had
laid out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present
for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant.
Neither was this all; for my goods being all English manu-
facture, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valu-
able and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them at a
very great advantage. The first thing I did, I bought me a negro
slave, and an European servant also: I mean another besides that
which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next
year with great success in my plantation. And now increasing in
business and wealth, my head began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed often the ruin
of the best heads in business.
To come, then, by just degrees to the particulars of this part
of my story: You may suppose, that having now lived almost
four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-
planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which
was our port; and that, in my discourse among them I had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast
of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes there, and how
easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles—such as beads,
toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like—not only
gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but negroes, for
the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.
It happened, being in company one day with some merchants
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning and told me
they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed of
with them the last night, and they came to make a secret proposal
to me; and after enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that they
had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plan-
tations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as
servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because
they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so
they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own plantations; and, in
a word, the question was whether I would go their supercargo in
the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and
they offered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes,
without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made
to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of his own
to look after, which could scarce have failed of being worth three
or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too—for me
to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever
man in such circumstances could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more
resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when
my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
I would go with all my heart if they would undertake to look after
my plantation in my absence. This they all engaged to do, and
entered into writings to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing
of my plantation and effects in case of my death, making the cap-
tain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my heir, but
obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will;
one-half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.
Accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo finished,
and all things done as by agreement by my partners in the voyage,
I went on board in an evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1659
being the same day eight years that I went from my father and
mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority and the
fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden,
carried six guns, and fourteen men besides the master, his boy, and
myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods, except of such
toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits
of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking glasses,
knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to
the northward upon our own coasts. In this course we passed the
line in about twelve days' time, and were, by our last observation,
in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a
violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge.
It blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we
could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it
carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds directed.
About the twelth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found that he was
gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond
the river Amazones; and now he began to consult with me what
course he should take; for the ship was leaky, and very much dis-
abled, and he was for going directly back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; so we changed our course, and steered
away N.W. by W., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise determined;
for a second storm came upon us, which carried us away with the
same impetuosity westward, and drove us out of the way of all
human commerce.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early one morning cried out, "Land!" and we had no sooner
run out of the cabin than the ship struck upon the sand, and in a
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in
such a manner that we expected we should all have perished imme-
diately. It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
27
circumstances. We could not hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of
miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking
one upon another, and expecting death every moment.
Now, though we thought the wind did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to
expect her getting off. We had a boat at our stern just before the
storm, but she had either sunk, or was driven off to sea. We had
another boat on board; but how to get her off into the sea -was a
doubtful thing. In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her
flung over the ship's side; and getting all into her, we let go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy and
the wild sea.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not escape, and
that we should be inevitably drowned. However, we committed
our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and, the wind driving
us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. But as we made
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than
the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling
astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace. In a
word, it took us with such a fury that it overset the boat at once;
and separating us as well from the boat as from one another, gave
us not time hardly to say, "O God!" for we were all swallowed up
in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I
could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till
that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me
upon the land, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so
much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself
nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and
endeavored to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before
another wave should return and take me up again.
The next wave that came upon me buried me at once twenty or
thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with
a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way;
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with
all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when
as I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and
though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so,
yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but no so long but I held
it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return,
I struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath,
and till the waters went from me, and then took to my heels, and
ran with what strength I had, farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came
pouring in after me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the
waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me; for
the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather
dashed me, against a piece of rock, and that with such force as it
left me senseless. But I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with water, I resolved
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if
possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so
high as at first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near
the shore that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not
so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I
got to the mainland, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up
the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and
thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some
minutes before scarce any room to hope. I walked about on the
shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I may say,
wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousand
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon all
my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one
soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards,
or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two
shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off;
and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place I
was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts
abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance, for I was
wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink,
to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me but that
of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and
that which was particularly afflicting to me was that I had no
weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or
to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill
me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a
tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my pro-
vision; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a
while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began,
with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they always
come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was
to get up into a thick, bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny, which grew
near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next
day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I
walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any
fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great joy; and having
drunk, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I
went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself
so that if I should sleep I might not fall. And having cut me a
short stick, like a trucheon, for my defense, I took up my lodging;
and being excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as com-
fortably as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and
found myself more refreshed with it than I think I ever was on such
an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but
that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the
night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned,
where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against it.
This being within about a mile from the shore where I was, and the
ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that
at least I might save some necessary things for my use.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the
ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw
evidently that, if we had kept on board, we had been all safe; that
is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable
as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now
was. This forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was little
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship. So I pulled
off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took to
the water. But when I came to the ship my difficulty was still
greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground, and
high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I espied a small
31

piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging down
by the fore-chains so low that with great difficulty I got hold of it,
and by the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of
water in her hold; but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard
sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted upon the bank,
and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quar-
ter was free and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be
sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and
what was free. And, first, I found that all the ship's provisions
were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed
to eat, I went to the bread room, and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had;
and this extremity roused my application. We had several spare
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast
or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with them, and I flung
as many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight,
tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling them
to me, I tied four of them together at both ends, as well as I could,
in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them, crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but
that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being to&
light. So I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a
spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a
great deal of labor and pains.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.
My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what
I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was not long in con-
sidering this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I
could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I first
got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these
I filled with provisions—viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five
pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little
remainder of European corn. While I was doing this, I found the
tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification
to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon
the sand, swim away. As for my breeches, which were only linen,
and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings. How-
ever, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon; as, first, tools to work
with on shore; and it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols. These I secured first, with some powder horns, a small
bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three
barrels of powder in the ship, and with much search I found them.
And thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to
the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, two saws, an
ax and a hammer. With this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or
thereabouts, my raft went very well. But here I had like to have
suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would
have broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft
ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground
at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped
off towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep

them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my
strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding
up the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half
an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little
more upon a level; and, a little after, the water still rising, my raft
floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel,
and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth
of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide
running up.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,
but here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again;
for that shore lying pretty steep, there was no place to land, but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and
the other sink lower. All that I could do was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to
hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground. As
soon as I found water enough, I thrust her upon that flat piece of
ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two
broken oars into the ground, till the water ebbed away, and left my
raft and cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to seek a proper place for my habitation,
and where to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever might
happen. There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up
very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills.
I took out one of the fowling pieces, and one of the pistols, and a
horn of powder; and thus armed I traveled for discovery up to the
top of that hill, where, after I had with great labor and difficulty
got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction—viz., that I was
in an island environed every way with the sea; no land to be seen
except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands,
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of which,
however, I saw none. At my coming back I shot at a great bird
which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the side of a great wood. I
aelieve it was the first gun that had been fired there since the creation
of the world. I had no sooner fired but from all the parts of the
wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls of many sorts,
making a confused screaming and crying, but not one of them of
any kind that I knew; as for the creature I killed, I took it to be a
kind of a hawk.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft and fell
to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of
the day. What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed
where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not know-
ing but some wild beast might devour me; though, as I afterwards
found, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could I barricaded myself round with
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind
of hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which
way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures,
like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly
some of the rigging and sails, and I resolved to make another voyage
on board the vessel, if possible, as I knew that the first storm that
blew must necessarily break her all in pieces. I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped
before I went from my hut, having nothing on but a checkered shirt,
a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft;
and, having had experience of the first, I neither made this so un-
wieldy nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's stores I found two or
three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or
two of hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a
grindstone. All these I secured, together with several things be-
longing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling
piece, with some small quantity of powder and a large bagful of
small shot. Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that
I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding;
35
and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on
shore, to my very great comfort.
Having got my second cargo on shore—though I was obliged
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large casks—I went to work to make me a
little tent, with the sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil
either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty chests and casks
up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt,
either from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and
spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols
just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed the first
time, and slept very quietly all night.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid
up, I believe, for one man; but still I was not satisfied, for while the
ship sat upright in that posture I thought I ought to get everything
out of her that I could; so every day, at low water, I went on board,
and brought away something or other; but particularly, the third
time I went, I brought away as
much of the rigging as I could,
as also all the small ropes and
rope twine I could get, with a
piece of spare canvas, which was
to mend the sails upon occasion,
and the barrel of wet gunpowder.
In a word, I brought away all
the sails. But that which com-
forted me more still was, that at
last of all, after I had made five
or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to
except from the ship that was
worth my meddling with—I say,
after all thus, I found a great

hogshead of bread, a hox of fine sugar, and a barrel of fine flour;
this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any
more provisions except what was spoiled by the water.
I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship, in which tune I had brought away all that
one pair of hands could well be supposed capable of bringing; but
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind began
to rise; however, at low water I went on board, and though I
thought I had rummaged the cabin effectually, yet I discovered a
locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of
good knives and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds'
value hi money. I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "Oh
drug!" said I aloud, "what are thou good for?" However, upon
second thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all in a piece of
canvas, I began to think of making another raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to
rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore.
It presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make
a raft with the wind offshore; and that it was my business to be
gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able
to reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I let myself down into the
water, and swam across the channel which lay between the ship and
the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the
weight of the things I had about me, and partly from the roughness
of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay, with all
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night,
and in the morning, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was
to be seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this
satisfactory reflection, that I had lost no time, nor abated any
diligence, to get everything out of her that could be useful to me;
and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to bring
away, if I had had more time.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about what kind of
I Am Indeed a Strange Sight.
dwelling to make—whether I should make me a cave in the earth,
or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both; the
manner and description of which it may not be improper to give
an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement,
so I resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground. I consulted several things; first, health and fresh water;
secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, security
from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast; fourthly, a view
to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight I might not lose any
advantage for my deliverance.
In search of a proper place for this I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was
steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me
from the top. On the side of the rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave; but there
was not really any cave, or way into the rock, at all.
On the flat of the green, just below this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before
my door; and, at the end of it, descending irregularly every way
down into the low ground by the seaside.
Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the
rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and
ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the ground till they stood very firm, like piles, the
biggest end being put out of the ground above five feet and a half,
and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows, upon one another, within the circle, between
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong that neither man
nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of
time and labor, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them
to the place, and drive them into th- earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but
by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in,
I lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in and
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and consequently slept
secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done; though,
as it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all this caution
from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor I carried all my
riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you
have the account above; and I made me a large tent also, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there. I made it double—viz., one smaller tent within, and
one larger tent above it; and covered the uppermost part of it with
a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus inclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and
so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down, out
through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the nature
of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and
a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which
served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labor and many days before all these things
were brought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same
time it occurred, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up the
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a
thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after
that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was
not so much surprised with the lightning, as I was with the
thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself.
"Oh, my powder!" My very heart sank within me, when I thought
that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on which
not my defense only, but the providing me food, as I thought,
entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own
danger; though, had the powder took fire, I had never known who
had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me that, after the storm
was over, I laid aside all my work, my building and fortifying,
and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate my
powder; to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make
one part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight;
and I think my powder, which in all was about one hundred and
forty pounds' weight was divided into no less than a hundred
parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend
any danger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in
my fancy, I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in
holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking
very carefully where I had laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at
least once every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to
see if I could kill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could,
to acquaint myself with what the island produced. The first time
I went out I presently discovered that there were goats in the
island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was

attended with this misfortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so
subtle, and so swift of foot that it was the most difficult thing in
the world to come at them; but I was not discouraged at this, not
doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened.
The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a she-goat,
which had a little kid by her, which grieved me heartily. These
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and
saved my provisions, my bread especially, as much as I possibly
could.
But I must now give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed, were not
a few. I had a dismal prospect of my condition, for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a
violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage,
and a great way, viz., some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordi-
nary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to con-
sider it as a determination of Heaven that in this desolate place,
and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would
run plentifully down my face when I made these reflections: and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence
should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render them so
absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, and so entirely
depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such
a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking
with my gun in my hand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon
the subject of my present condition, when Reason, as it were, put
in expostulating with me the other way, thus: "Well, you are in
a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember, where are the
rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you into the boat? Where
are the ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why are
you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?"
Then it occurred to me again how well I was furnished for
my subsistence. What should I have done without a gun, without
ammunition, without any tools to make anything, or to work
with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of coverings?
And now, being about to enter into a melancholy relation of
a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, when,
in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island;
when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just
over my head; for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line.
After I had been there ten or twelve days it came into my
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of
books, and pen, and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath day
from the working days; but to prevent this I cut it with my knife
upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great
cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz., "I came on
shore here on the 30th of September, 1659."
Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the
rest, and every first day of the .month as long again as that long
one; and thus I kept my calender, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe that, among the many
things which I brought from the ship, I got several things of less
value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper; several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping;
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectives, charts and books of navigation; all which I huddled
together, whether I might want them or no; also I found three
very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England,
and which I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese
books also; and several other books; all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats,
of whose eminent history I must have occasion to say something
in its place, for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog,
he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty
servant to me many years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch
me, nor any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted
to have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I observed
before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted I kept things
very exact; but after that was gone, I could not, for I could not
make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these, ink
was one: as also a spade, pick-ax, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned to
want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little
pale, or surrounded habitation. The piles or stakes, which were
as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more, by far, in bringing home; so that I
spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of
those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last be-
thought myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though
I found it, yet made driving those posts or piles very laborious
and tedious work. But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to
do it in? Nor had I any other employment, if that had been over,
at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food, which I did, more or less, every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstances I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that were
to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver
my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting my mind.
And as my reason began now to master my despondency, I began
to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good against
the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case from

worse, and I stated it very im-
partially, like debtor and cred-
itor, the comfort I enjoyed,
against the miseries I suffered,
thus:
EVIL
I am cast upon a horrible,
desolate island; void of all hope
of recovery.
I am singled out and separ-
ated, as it were, from all the
world, to be miserable.
I am divided from mankind,
a solitary; one banished from human society.
I have no clothes to cover me.
I am without any defense, or means to resist any violence of
man or beast.
I have no soul to speak to or relieve me.
GOOD
But I am alive, and not drowned, as all my ship's company
was.
But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's crew to be
spared from death; and He that miraculously saved me from
death can deliver me from this condition.
But I am not starved and perishing on a barren place, afford-
ing no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate, where if I had clothes I could
hardly wear them.
But I am cast on an island where I see no wild beasts to hurt
me, as I saw on the coast of Africa; and what if I had been ship-
wrecked there?
But God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the
shore, that I have got out so many necessary things as will either
supply my wants or enable me to supply myself even as long as I
live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there
was something negative, or something positive, to be thankful for
in it: and let this stand as a direction, from the experience of the
most miserable of all conditions in this world—that we may always
find in it something to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the
description of good and evil, on the credit side of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and giving over looking out to sea to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to accom-
modate my way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I
could.
I have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a
kind of wall up against it of turfs about two feet thick on the
outside: and after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered
it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must
observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which,
as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I had no room
to turn myself. So I set myself to enlarge my cave, and worked
farther into the earth; for it was a loose, sandy rock, which yielded
easily to the labor I bestowed on it: and so when I found I was
pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right
hand, into the rock; and then turning to the right again, worked
quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of my
pale or fortification.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted. So I went to work; and here
I must needs observe that every man may be, in time, master of
every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life; and
yet in time by labor, application, and contrivance I found at last
that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had
had tools. However, I made abundance of things, even without
tools; and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet
which, perhaps, were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other
way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew
it flat on either side with my ax till I had brought it to be as thin
as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree, but
my time and labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed
one way as another.
When I had wrought out some boards as above, I made
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and an half, one over an-
other, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails and
ironwork on; also I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to
hang my guns and all things that would hang up: so that had my
cave been to be seen, it looked like a general magazine of all ne-
cessary things; and I had everything so ready at my hand that it
was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and
especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry,
and not only a hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of
mind; and my journal would have been full of many dull things;
for example, I must have said thus:
"September 30. After I had got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
I ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my head and
face, exclaiming at my misery and crying out I was undone, till
tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground for repose."
But having gotten over these things in some measure, and hav-
ing settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a table and
a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began, I say, to
keep my journal; of which I shall here give you the copy (though
in it will be told all these particulars over again), as long as it
lasted; for at last, having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659.—I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe,
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on
shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I called "The Island
of Despair," all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and
myself almost dead.
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal
circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither food, house,
clothes, weapon, or place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw
nothing but death before me; either that I should be devoured by
wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of
food. At the approach of night, I slept in a tree for fear of wild
creatures, but slept soundly, though it rained all night.
Oct. 1.—In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much
nearer the island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand, for
seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and necessaries out
of her for my relief; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that they would not
have been all drowned as they were; and that had the men been
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but at
length seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as
I could, and then swam on board; this day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th.—All these days entirely
spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship,
which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much
rain also in those days, though with some intervals of fair weather;
but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 24.—I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon
it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I
recovered many of them when the tide was out.
47
Oct. 25.—It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of
wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing
a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the
wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in
covering and securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain
might not spoil them.
Oct. 26.—I walked about the shore almost all day to find out a
place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from
any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked out a
semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with
a work, wall, or fortification made of double piles, lined within with
cables, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all
my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it
rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my
gun to seek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed
a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.
Nov. 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there the first
night, making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing
my hammock upon.
Nov. 2.—I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of
timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round
me, a little within the place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3.—I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like

ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to work
to make me a table.
Nov. 4.—This morning I began to order my times of work, of
going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion, viz.,
every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if
it did not rain; then employed myself to work till about eleven
o'clock; then eat what I had to live on; and from twelve to two I
lay down to sleep, the weather being excessive hot; and then in the
evening to work again. The working part of this day and of the
next were wholly employed in making my table; for I was yet but
a very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a
complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do to
any one else.
Nov. 5.—This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and
killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing.
Every creature I killed, I took off the skins and preserved them.
Coming back by the seashore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which
I did not understand; but was surprised, and almost frighted, with
two or three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing
what they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 6.—After my morning walk, I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it
long before I learned to mend it.
Nov. 7.—Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th, (for the llth was Sunday ac-
cording to my reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a chair, and
with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making, I pulled it in pieces several times.
NOTE, I soon neglected keeping Sundays; for, omitting my
mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13.—This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly,
and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder
and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my powder.
As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder
into as many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16.—These three days I spent in making little
With but My Dog for Company, I Am Separated From All the World.
square chests or boses, which might hold about a pound, or two
pound at most, of powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed
it in places as secure and remote from one another as possible. On
one of these three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but
I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my further conveniency.
NOTE, three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz., a
pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy; but the next thing was a
shovel or spade. This was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I
could do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of one to
make, I knew not.
Nov. 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree
of that wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron tree,
for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labor, and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with diffi-
culty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way,
made me a long while upon this machine, for I worked it effectually,
by little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the board part hav-
ing no iron shod upon it at the bottom, it would not last me so long.
However, it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion,
or so long making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow.
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such things as
twigs that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found
out. And as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the
wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I know how to go
about it; besides I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons
for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and
so for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made
me a thing like a hod which the laborers carry mortar in.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel; and
yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to
make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days; I mean
always, excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to
Nov. 23.—My other work having now stood still because of my
making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working
every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my
goods commodiously.
NOTE.—During all this time I worked to make this room or
cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or maga-
zine, a kitchen, a dining room, and a cellar; as for a lodging, I
kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of the year
it rained so hard, that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me
afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in
the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with
flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.
Dec. 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault finished,
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quan-
tity of earth fell down from the top and one side, so much, that, in
short, it frighted me, and not without reason too; for if I had been
under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster I
had a great deal of work to do over again; for I had the loose earth
to carry out; and, which was of more importance, I had the ceiling
to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11.—This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces
of boards across over each post. This I finished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the
roof secure; and the posts standing in rows, served me for partitions
to part of my house.
Dec. 17.—From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up that could be
hung up; and now I began to be in some order within doors.

Dec. 20.—Now I carried everything into the cave, and began
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of board, like a dresser,
to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with
me; also I made me another table.
Dec. 24.—Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.
Dec. 25.—Rain all day.
Dec. 26.—No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and
pleasanter.
Dec. 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I
caught it, and led it home in a string. When I had it at home, I
bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.
N. B.—I took such good care of it that it lived; and the leg
grew well and as strong as ever; but by my nursing it so long it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would
not go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31.—Great heats and no breeze, so that there
was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food. This time I
spent in putting all my things in order within doors.
Jan. 1.—Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late with
my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going
farther into the valleys which lay towards the center of the island, I
found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to
come at. However, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to
hunt them down.
Jan. 2.—Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog,
and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced
about upon the dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he would
not come near them.
Jan. 3.—I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of
my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and
strong.
N. B.—This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal. It is sufficient to observe that I was
no less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of April work-
ing, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no more than
about twenty-four yards in length, being a half circle from one
place in the rock to another place about eight yards from it, the
door of the cave being in the center behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many
days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never
be perfectly secure till this wall was finished. And it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labor everything was done with,
especially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving them
into the ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to
have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced
with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any
people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive any-
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be
observed afterward upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I made rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discov-
eries in these walks of something or other to my advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, which build, not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes of
rocks. And taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed them
up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew all away,
which, perhaps, was at first for want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them. However, I frequently found their nests,
and got their young ones, which were very good meat.
And now in the managing my household affairs % found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it was. For
instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped; I had a small
runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about
it. I could neither put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one
another, as to make them hold water; so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that as
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax with
which I made candles in my African adventure, but I had none of
that now. The only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a
goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I
baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made
me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light
like a candle.
In the middle of all my labors it happened, that rummaging
my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been
filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but
before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. What little
remainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured with the
rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use, I think it was to put
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such
use, I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortifica-
tion, under the rock. It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of
anything, and not so much as remembering that I had thrown
anything there; when, about a month after, or thereabout, I saw
some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,
which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was
surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,
I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green
barley of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English!
barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of
my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious
foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen
me otherwise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God; without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in
these things, or His order in governing events in the world. But
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not
proper for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it
startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miracu-
lously caused this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild,
miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes; and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of Nature
should happen on my account; and this was the more strange to me,
because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some
other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which
I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore
there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubting but that there was more in the
place, I went all over that part of the island where I had been
before, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see for
more of it; but I could not find any. At last it occurred to my
thoughts that I had shook a bag of chickens' meat out in that place,
and then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my
religious thankfulness to God's providence began to abate too, upon
the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common";
though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unfore-
seen providence, as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work of Providence as to me, that should order or appoint, that ten
or twelve grains of corn should remain unsoiled (when the rats had
destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from heaven; as
also that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it
being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang out immediately;
55
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had heen
burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their
season, which was about the end of June; and laying up every corn,
I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some
quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to
eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not observing
the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it
never came up at all, at least not as it would have done; of which in
its place.
Besides this barley, there was, as above, twenty or thirty stalks
of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose use was of
the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though
I did that also after some time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my
wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go
into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there might
be no sign in the outside of my
habitation.
April 16.—I finished the
ladder, so I went up with the
ladder to the top, and then
pulled it up after me, and let it
down on the inside. This was a
complete enclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from
without, unless it could first
mount my wall.
The very next day after this
wall was finished, I had almost
had all my labor overthrown at
once, and myself killed. The

case was thus: As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent,
just in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the
earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the
edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared, but
thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had done before; and
for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and
not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me.
I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, but I plainly
saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook
three times at about eight minutes distance, with three such shocks,
as would have overturned the strongest building that could be sup-
posed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a
rock, which stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible noise, as I never heard in all my life. I
perceived also the very sea was put in violent motion by it; and I
believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,
or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or
stupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like
one that was tossed at sea. But the noise of the falling of the rock
awakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied
condition I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods,
and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a
second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go
over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon
the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what
to do. All this while I had not the least serious religious thought,
nothing but the common, "Lord, have mercy upon me!" and when it
was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as
if it would rain. Soon after that the wind rose by little and little,
so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane.
The sea was all on a sudden covered with foam and froth; the shore
was covered with the breach of the water; the trees were torn up
by the roots; and a terrible storm it was: and this held about three
hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours more it was stark
cnl.ni, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and
dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these
winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the
earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my
cave again. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the
rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent.
But the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it, and I was forced to go into my cave, though very
much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole
through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out,
which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in my
cave some time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake
follow, I began to be more composed. And now to support my
spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small stimulant, which, however, I did then, and always
very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night and great part of the next
day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more
composed, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding that
if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no
living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building me some
little hut in an open place, which I might surround with a wall, as
I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or
men; but concluded, if I stayed where I was, I should certainly,
one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of
the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall
upon my tent; and I spent the next two days, being the 19th and the
20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habita-
tion.
The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never
slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any
fence was almost equal to it. But still, when I looked about and
saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I
was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loth to remove.
In the meantime it occurred to me that it would require a vast
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run
the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and
had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I
composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to work
with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, etc., in a
circle as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished, but
that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and fit
to remove to. This was the 21st.
April 22.—The next morning I began to consider of means to
put this resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my
tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we
carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of
notches and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn
it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a
judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I contrived a
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both
my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen any such thing in
England, or at least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it is very common there; besides that, my
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full
week's work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29.—These two whole days I took up in grinding my
tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.
April 30.—Having perceived my bread had been low a great
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit a
a day, which made my heart very heavy.
May 1.—In the morning, looking towards the seaside the tide
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary,
and it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small barrel,
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven
on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself,
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do.
I examined the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found
it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the
powder was caked as hard as stone. However, I rolled it farther on
shore for the present, and went on upon the sands as near as I could
to the wreck of the ship to look for more.
When I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed.
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at
least six feet; and the stern, which was broken to pieces, and parted
from the rest by the force of the sea soon after I had left rummaging
her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand
thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a
great place of water before, so that I could not come within a
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at
first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake. And
as by this violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing
my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially,
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship. But I
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the
inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had
learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I could
get from her would be of some use or other to me.
May 3.—I began with my saw, and cut a piece of beam
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-
deck together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the
sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest; but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time.
May 4.—I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst
eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off,
I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-
yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as
much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and eat them
dry.
May 5.—Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder, and
brought three great fir-planks off from the decks, which I tied
together, and made swim on shore, when the tide of flood came on.
May 6.—Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of
her, and other pieces of ironwork; worked very hard, and came
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7.—Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the
beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose,
and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but
almost full of water and sand.
May 8.—Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand.
I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore also with
the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for the next day.
May 9.—Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into
the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with
the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also the roll of
English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove.
May 10,11,12,13,14.—Went every day to the wreck, and got
a great deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or
three hundredweight of iron.
May 15.—I carried two hatchets to try if I could not cut a
piece off of the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the
water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16.—It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed so
long in the woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented
me going to the wreck that day.
May 17.—I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a
great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they
were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24.—Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and
with hard labor I loosened some things so much with the crow, that
the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the sea-
men's chests. But the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came
to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had
some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except the
time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this
part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be
ready when it was ebbed out. And by this time I had gotten timber
and plank, and ironwork enough to have builded a good boat, if I
had known how; and also, I got at several times, and in several
pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.
June 16.—Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise,
or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which it seems was only my
misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I
happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had
hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards.
June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore
eggs; and her flesh was to me most savoury.

June 18.—Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at
this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I
knew was not usual in that latitude.
June 19.—Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been
cold.
June 20.—No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and
feverish.
June 21.—Very ill, frightened almost to death with the appre-
hensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help. Prayed to
God for the first time since the storm off of Hull, but scarce knew
what I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22.—A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions of
sickness.
June 23.—Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.
June 24.—Much better.
June 25.—An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours;
cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26.—Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun,
but found myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and
with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat. I
would fain have stewed it and made some broth, but had no pot.
June 27.—The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day,
and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so
weak, I had no strength to stand up, or to get myself any water
to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I
was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say, only I lay
and cried: "Lord, look upon me! Lord pity mel Lord have mercy
upon me!" I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours, till
the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the
night. When I waked, I found myself much refreshed, but weak
and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no water in my whole
habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.
In this second sleep I had this terrible dream.
I thought that I was sitting on the ground and saw a man come
down from a great black cloud in a flame of light. When he stood
on the earth, it shook as it had done a few days since; and all the
world to me was full of fire. He came up and said: "As I see that
all these things have not brought thee to pray, now thou shalt die."
Then I woke and found it was a dream. Weak and faint, I was in
dread all day lest my fit should come on.
Too ill to get out with my gun, I sat on the shore to think, and
thus ran my thoughts: "What is this sea which is all round me?
And whence is it? There can be no doubt that the hand that made
it made the air, the earth, the sky. And who is that? It is God,
who hath made all things. Well, then, if God hath made all things,
it must be He who guides them; and if so, no one thing in the whole
range of His works can take place and He not know it. Then God
must know how sick and sad I am, and He wills me to be here. Oh,
why hath God done this to me?"
Then some voice would seem to say: "Dost thou ask why God
hath done this to thee? Ask why thou wert not shot by the Moors,
who came on board the ship, and took the lives of thy mates. Ask
why thou wert not torn by the beasts of prey on the coasts. Ask
why thou didst not go down in the deep sea with the rest of the crew,
but didst come to this isle and art safe."
A sound sleep then fell on me, and when I woke it must have
been three o'clock the next day, by the rays of the sun; nay, it may
have been more than that; for I think that this must have been the
day that I did not mark on my post, as I have since found that there
was one notch too few.
I now took from my store the Book of God's Word, which I
had brought from the wreck, not one page of which I had as yet
read. My eyes fell on five words, that would seem to have been
put there for my good at this time; so well did they cheer my faint
hopes and touch the true source of my fears. They were these: "I
will not leave thee." And they have dwelt in my heart to this day.
I laid down the book, to pray. My cry was, "O Lord! help me to
love and learn Thy ways." This was the first time in all my life
that I had felt a sense that God was near and heard me. As for my
dull life here, it was not worth a thought; for now a new strength
had come to me; and there was a change in my griefs, as well as hi
my joys.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely
taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human shape had
ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured my habitation,
as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more
perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other productions I
might find, which I yet knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular
survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was
no more than a little brook of running water, and very fresh and
good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water in
some parts of it, at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it
could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savannas
or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the
rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as
might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk.
There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of, or under-
standing about, and might perhaps have virtues of their own, which
I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that
climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
plants of aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several
sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back,
musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and
goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover; but
could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little
observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the
plants in the field, at least very little that might serve me to any
purpose now in my distress.
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and
after going something farther than I had done the day before, I
found the brook and the savannas began to cease, and the country

became more woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground in great
abundance, and grapes upon the trees. The vines had spread indeed
over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I
was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my experience
to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore in
Barbary the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who
were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I
found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or
dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are
kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome
as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be to be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I
had lain from home. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and
got up into a tree, where I slept well; and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery, traveling near four miles, as I might
judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north, with a
ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh
water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other
way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of
spring, that it looked like a planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying
it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other
afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own; that I was
king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of
possession; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance
as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but
all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then. How-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat,
but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,
which made it very wholesome, and also very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home;
and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and
lemons to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was
approaching.
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place,
and a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and
lemons in another place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homeward; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but before I got
thither, the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits and the
weight of the juice, having broken them and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but
I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised,
when, coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine
when I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod to
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance
eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were, I
knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with
their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large
quantity of the grapes, and hung them up upon the out-branches
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the
limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of
the situation; the security from storms on that side the water and
the wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my
abode, which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the
67

whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to
look out for a place equally safe
as where I now was situate, if
possible, in that pleasant fruit-
ful part of the island.
This thought ran long in
my head, and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the
pleasantness of the place temp-
ting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to consider
that I was now by the seaside,
where it was at least possible
that something might happen to
my advantage, and, by the same
ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable that
any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among
the hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but
impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of July;
and, though, upon second thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it
at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge as high as I
could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood. And
here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together,
always going over it with a ladder, as before; so that I fancied now
I had my country house and my seacoast house; and this work took
me up to the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labor, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first
habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other, with a
piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of
a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into
when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the
grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down from
the trees. And it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which
followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of
my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most of
them home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from hence, which
was the 14th of August, it rained more or less, every day till the
middle of October, and sometimes so violently, that I could not
stir out of my cave for several days.
In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my
family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who
run away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no
more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she came home
about the end of August with three kittens.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I
could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In
this confinement, I began to be straightened for food; but ven-
turing out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat
to me, and my food was regulated thus: I eat a bunch of raisins
for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for
my dinner, broiled; for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to
boil or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle's eggs for my
supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the hill,
and made a door, or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall;
and so I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at
lying so open; for as I had managed myself before, I was in a
perfect enclosure; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed, and open
for anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I
had yet seen upon the island being a goat.
Sept. 30.—I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my
landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been
on the shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a
solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exercise, prostrating myself
on the ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins
to God, acknowledging His righteous judgments upon me, and
praying to Him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and
having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till
the going down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I had began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for as at first I
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were. But now, having cast up the days as above,
I found I had been there a year, so I divided it into weeks, and set
apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end
of my account, I had lost a day or two in my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memor-
andum of other things.
The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for
them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I had it,
and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging
experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had saved
the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so surprisingly found
spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were about
thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought
it a proper time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its southern
position, going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with
my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain;
but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I
would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the
proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving
about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not
one grain of that I sowed this time came to anything, for the dry
months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at
all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had
been but newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined
was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make
another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new
bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox. And this having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very
good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to
sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop
not amounting to above a half a peck of each kind. But by this
experiment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly
when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two
seed-times and two harvests every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and
the weather began to settle, which was about the month of
November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where,
though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just as
I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had made was not
only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some
trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out, and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after
lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to call it that these
stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased
to see the young trees grow, and I pruned them, and led them up
to grow as much alike as I could. And it is scarce credible how
beautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the
71
hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a
complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a
hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean that of my
first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and
afterward served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the
rainy seasons and the dry seasons; which were generally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds
happened to blow, but this was the general observation I made.
After I had found by experience the ill consequence of being
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within
doors as much as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, and very suitable also
to the time, for I found great occasion of many things which I had
no way to furnish myself with but by hard labor and constant
application; particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so
brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent
advantage to me now, that when I was a boy I used to take a great
delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my
father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as
boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the
manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a
hand, I had by this means full knowledge of the methods of it, that
I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind that
the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew might
possibly be as tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers in
England, and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country house, as I
called it; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to
ray purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next
time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon
found, for there was plenty of them. These I set up to dry within
my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use, I carried them
to my cave; and here during the next season I employed myself in
znaking, as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry
earth, or to lay up anything as I had occasion. And though I did
not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my purpose. And thus, afterwards, I took care
never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made
more, especially I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in,
instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time
about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two
wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except
two runlets, which were almost full, and some glass bottles, some
of the common size, and others which were case-bottles square,
for the holding of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot
to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the
ship, and which was too big for such use as I desired it, viz., to make
broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would
fain have had was a tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible for me to
make one. However, I found a contrivance for that, too, at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when
another business took me up more time than it could be imagined I
could spare.
I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole
island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I
built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the
seashore on that side; so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and
a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-
cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I
began my journey. When I had passed the vale where my bower
stood, as above, I came within view of the sea to the west; and it
being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or
a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the west to the W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my guess, it
could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise
than that I know it must be part of America, and, as I concluded,
by all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have
landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was now; and
therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which I
began now to own and to believe ordered everything for the best. I
quieted my mind and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered that if
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or
other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country and
Brazils, which are indeed the worst of savages; for they are
cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the
human bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward.
I found that side of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter
than mine, the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and full of very fine woods.
I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one,
if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me.
I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked
it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home;
but it was some years before I could make him speak. However,
at last I taught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very
diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the
low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes; but they
differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could
I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had
no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that
which was very good too; especially these three sorts, viz., goats,
pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise; which, added to my grapes, Lead-
enhall Market could not have furnished a table better than I, in
proportion to the company. And though my case was deplorable
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, and that I was not
driven to any extremities for food, but rather plenty, even to
dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a
day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns, to see
what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the
place where I resolved to sit down for all night; and then I either
75
reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes,
set upright in the ground, either from one tree to another, or so as
no wild creature could come at me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see that
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here indeed
the shore was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas, on the
other side, I had found but three in a year and a half. Here also was
an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen,
and some which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat, but such as I knew not the names of except those called
penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-
goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there were
many goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it was with
much more difficulty that I could come near them, the country
being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was
on the hill.
I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was
fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed all
the while I was here to be as it
were upon a journey, and from
home. However, I travelled
along the shore of the sea to-
wards the east, I suppose about
twelve miles, and then setting up
a great pole upon the shore for a
mark, I concluded I would go
home again; and that the next
journey I took should be on the
other side of the island, east from
my dwelling, and so round till I
came to my post again; of which
in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I
could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I could not
miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country. But I found
myself mistaken; for being come about two or three miles, I found
myself descended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with
hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I could not see which
was my way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the
day.
It happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days while I was in this valley; and not being
able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at
last was obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and come
back the same way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned
homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and niy gun, ammuni-
tion, hatchet, and other things very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it
alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could,
for I had often been musing whether it might not be possible to get
a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply
me when my powder and shot should be all spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string, which
I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I led
him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at
home, from whence I had been absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little
wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had been so
unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was
a perfect settlement to be compared to that; and it rendered every-
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a
great way from it again, while it should be my lot to stay on the
island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my long journey; during which most of the time was taken up in
the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to
be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then
I began to think of the poor kid which I had penned in within my
little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some
food. Accordingly, I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed
it could not get out, but almost starved for want of food. I went
and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead
it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need
to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog. And as I continually
fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it
became from that time one of my domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and
I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before,
being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having now
been there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered
than the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble
and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with, and without which
it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and
hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me even that
it was possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition,
than I should have been in a liberty of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that He could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by
His presence, and the communications of His grace to my soul,
supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon His
providence here and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
this life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the
wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days.
And now I changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires
altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were
perfectly new from what they were at my first coming.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out
upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I
was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the
midst of the great composures of my mind, this would break out
upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a
child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for
an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for if I
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go oif,
and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I daily
read the Word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my
present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, "I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
Immediately it occurred that these words were to me; why else
should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when
I was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God and
man? "Well then," said I, "if God does not forsake me, of what ill
consequence can it be, or what ma'tters it, though the world should
all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and
should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken solitary condition,
than it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular
state in the world, and with this thought I was going to give thanks
to God for bringing me to this place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at that
thought, and I durst not speak the words. "How canst thou be such
a hypocrite," said I, even audibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a
condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented
with, thou wouldest rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" So
I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked Gor for
being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my
eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition
of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed
God for directing my friend in England, without any order of mine,
to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me afterwards to
save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular
account of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be
observed, that I was veiy seldom idle, but having regularly divided
my time, according to the several daily employments that were
before me, such as, first, my duty to God, and the reading the
Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every
day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it did not
rain; thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I
had killed or catched for my supply; these took up great part of
the day; also, it is to be considered, that the middle of the day, when
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to
stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I
changed my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the
morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labor, I desire, may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for
want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took
up out of my time. For example, I was full two and forty days
making me a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave;
whereas two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have
cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this: It was to be a large tree which was to be cut
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was
three days a-cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs,
and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it
begun to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end; then turning
that side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the plank to
be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides.
I was now, in the months of November and December, expect-
ing my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or
dug up for them was not great; for as I observed, my seed of each
was not above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one whole
crop by sowing in the dry season. But my crop promised very
well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all
again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to
keep from it; as, first the goats and wild creatures which I called
hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and
day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no
time to shoot up into stalk.
This I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more,
because it required speed. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
weeks' time, and shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I
set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the
gate, where he would stand and bark all night long; so in a little
time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before while my corn was in the
blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now when it was in the
ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts,
who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone. I immediately
let fly among them, for I always had my gun with me. I had no
sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had
not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and
never able to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not tell.

However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among
it to see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green for them,
the loss was not so great but that the remainder was like to be a
good crop if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they
only waited till I was gone away. And the event proved it to be
so; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of
their sight but they dropped down, one by one, into the corn again.
I was so provoked, that I could not have the patience to stay till
more came on, knowing that every grain that they eat now was,
as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; but
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them
as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hanged them in
chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost
that this should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would
not only not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that
part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as
long as my scare-crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the year,
I reaped my crop.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down, and
all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the
broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of
the ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no
great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped in my way, for I
cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket
which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the
end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed
I had near two bushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of
barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that
time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I fore-
saw that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread.
And yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part
it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it, and if how to
make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things being added
to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to
preserve it all for seed against the next season, and in the mean-
time to employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish
this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. 'Tis
a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought
much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little things necessary
in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing
this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my
daily discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it
every hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no spade or shovel
to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I
observed before, but this did my work in but a wooden manner;
and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet, for want
of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made my work the
harder, and made it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with
patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When
the corn was sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it
myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch
it, as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have observed already
how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it,
cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it.
Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt

to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it, and yet all these
things I did without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an
estimable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I said,
made everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there was
no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I
had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to
these works, and as I resolved to use none of the corn for bread
till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to
apply myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had
a week's work at least to make me a spade which, when it was
done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labor to work with it. However, I went through that,
and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my
house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a
good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that wood which
I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that in one year's time
I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take me up less than
three months, because great part of that time was of the wet
season, when I could not go abroad.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out,
I found employment on the following occasions; always observing,
that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to
my parrot, and teaching him to speak, and I quickly learned him
to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud,
"Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but
an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great
employment upon my hands, as follows, viz., I had long studied,
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels,
which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at
them. However, considering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up some
such pot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and
strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry,
and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the
preparing corn, meal, etc., which was the thing I was upon, I
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like
jars, to hold what should be put into them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd,
misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them fell in, and
how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat of the sun,
being set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried; and, in a word,
how, after having labored hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make above
two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in about
two months' labor.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two great
wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break; and as between the pot and the basket there was
a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw,
and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet
I made several smaller things with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely
hard. But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none
of these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware
vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was
agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters
burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to
do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots
in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood all around it,
with a great heap of embers under them. I plied the fire with
fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots
in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed that they did not
crack at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that
heat about five or six hours, till I found one of them, though it did
not crack, did melt or run, for the sand which was mixed with the
clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots
began to abate of the red color; and watching them all night,
that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had
three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them
perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort
of earthenware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the shapes
of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when
I had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies, or
as a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine,
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire;
and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set
one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some
meat, which it did admirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made
some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal and several other
ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would have had it been.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or
beat some corn in; for, as to the mill, there was no thought at
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To
supply this want I was at a great loss; for, of all the trades in the
world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent
many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow,
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out;
nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which neither would bear the
weight of a heavy pestle, or would break the corn without filling it
with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a
stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block of
hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as
big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it in the
outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of fire and
infinite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil
make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or
beater, of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and
laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to
myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my
bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress my
meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I
did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most
difficult thing, so much as but to think on, for to be sure I had
nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin
canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. And here I was at a
full stop for many months, nor did I really know what to do;
linen I had none left, but what was mere rags; I had goats' hair,
but neither knew I how to weave it or spin it; and had I known
how, here were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I

found for this was, that at last I did remember I had, among the
seaman's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some neck-
cloths of calico or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made
three small sieves, but proper enough for the work; and thus I
made shift for some years. How I did afterwards, I shall show in
its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how
I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first, I had no
yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so I
did not concern myself much about it; but for an oven I was indeed
in great pain. At length I found out an experiment for that also,
which was this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but not
deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine
inches deep; these I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and
laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon
my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own
making and burning also; but I should not call them square.
When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or
live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it
all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and
whelming down the earthern pot upon them, drew the embers all
round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat. And
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley-
loaves, and became, in a little time, a mere pastry cook into the

bargain; for I made myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings;
indeed I made no pies, neither had I anything to put into them,
supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, that in the intervals of these things I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage; for I reaped my corn in its
season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the
ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no
floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted
to build my barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the
increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the
barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more,
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely; for my
bread had been quite gone a great while; also, I resolved to see
what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow
but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice was much more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved
to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread, etc.
All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts run many times upon the prospect of land which I had
seen from the other side of the island, and I was not without secret
wishes that I were on shore there, fancying the seeing the main-
land, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way or other
to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some means of
escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such
a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, I
should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of the
Carribean coasts were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the
latitude that I could not be far off from that shore. That suppose
they were not cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even
when they had been ten or twenty together, much more I, that
was but one, and could make little or no defence; all these things,
I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in
my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions
at first, but my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over
to the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought
I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we were
first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds,
almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy rough sand,
but no water about her, as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched
her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I
might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but
I might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her
upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island. How-
ever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolved to try what I could do; suggesting to
myself that if I could but turn her down, I might easily repair
the damage she had received, and she would be a very good boat,
and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. At last finding it
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging
away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. But when
I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get under it,
much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was forced
to give it over. !Aiid yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat,
my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than
decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not
possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives
of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say,
without hands, viz., of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only
thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more convenience
for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at all considering
the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the
Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was made, into
the water, a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them. For what was it
to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might
with much trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able with my
tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a
boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I found
it, and was not able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the least
reflection upon my mind of my circumstance while I was making
this boat, but I should have immediately thought how I should get
into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get it off of
the land; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to
guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms
of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with
the design, without determining whether I was ever able to under-
take it. Not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often
into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this
foolish answer which I gave myself, "Let's first make it; I'll war-
rant I'll find some way or other to get it along when 'tis done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my
91

fancy prevailed, and to work I
went. I felled a cedar tree: I
question much whether Solo-
mon ever had such a one for the
building of the Temple at Jeru-
salem. It was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part
next the stump, and four feet
eleven inches diameter at the end
of twenty-two feet, after which
it lessened for awhile, and then
parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labor that
I felled this tree. I was twenty
days hacking and hewing at it at
the bottom; I was fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it
cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet,
and inexpressible labor. After this, it cost me a month to shape
it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near
three months more to clear the inside, and work it so as to make an
exact boat of it. This I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and
chisel, and by the dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a
very handsome periagua and big enough to have carried six and
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have carried me and
all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted
with it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe
or periagua, that was made of one tree in my life. Many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there remained nothing but
to get it into the water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make
no question but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the
most unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost me infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it
was uphill towards the creek. Well, to take away this discourage-
ment, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a
declivity. This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains;
but who grudges pains, that have their deliverance in view? But
when this was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was
still much at one, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the
other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a
dock or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not
bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work; and
when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to be
dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out, I found that by the
number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been
ten or twelve years before I should have gone through with it; for
the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must have been at
least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctancy,
I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we
judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as
much comfort as ever before; for, by a constant study and serious
application of the Word of God, and by the assistance of His grace,
I gained a different knowledge from what I had before. I enter-
tained different notions of things. I looked now upon the world
as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and, indeed, no desires about. In a word, I had nothing
indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have; so I thought it looked,
as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz., as a place I had
lived in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as Father
Abraham to Dives, "Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed."
In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the
world here. I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or
the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was
now capable of enjoying. I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I
pleased, I might call myself king or emporer over the whole country
which I had possession of. There were no rivals: I had no
competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me. I
might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so
I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had
tortoise or turtles enough, but now and then one was as much as I
could put to any use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet of
ships. I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured into
raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable. I had
enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was all the rest
to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it,
or the vermin. If I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be
spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground;
I could make no more use of them than for fuel, and that I had no
occasion for but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me,
upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no
farther good to us than they are for our use; and that whatever we
may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just as much as we
can use, and no more. The most covetous, griping miser in the
world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had
been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what
to do with. I had no room for desire, except it was of things which
I had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed of great use to
me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as
silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business for it; and I
often thought with myself, that I would have given a handful of it
for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn;
nay, I would have given it all for six-pennyworth of turnip and
carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and
a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or
benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with
the damp of the cave in the wet season; and if I had had the drawer
full of diamonds, it had been the same case, and they had been of
no manner of value to me because of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my
body. I frequently sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and
admired the hand of God's providence, which had thus spread my
table in the wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright side
of my condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
such secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take
notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because they
see and covet something that He has not given them. All our
discontents about what we want, appeared to me to spring from
the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and
this was, to compare my present condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly have been,
if the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the
ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only could come
at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my
relief and comfort; without which I had wanted for tools to work,
weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to
myself, in the most lively colors, how I must have acted if I had
got nothing out of the ship. How I could not have so much as got
any food, except fish and turtles; and that as it was long before I
found any of them, I must have perished first; that I should have
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed
a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open
them, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a
beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with
95

all its hardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but
recommend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery,
to say, Is any affliction like mine? Let them consider how much
worse the cases of some people are, and their case might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.
I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my
mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition
with what I had deserved, and had therefore, reason to expect from
the hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had been well
instructed by father and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavors to infuse a religious awe of God into
my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the nature and end of my
being required of me. But, alas! falling early into the seafaring
life, which, of all the lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God,
though His terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into
the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little sense
of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my
messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death, which grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was
like myself, or to hear anything that was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least sense
of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I
enjoyed, such as my escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the
Portuguese master of the ship; my being planted so well in the
Brazils; my receiving the cargo from England, and the like; I
never had once the words, "Thank God," as much as on my mind, or
in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a thought
to pray to Him, or so much as to say, "Lord, have mercy upon me I"
no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by and
blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I
have already observed, on the account of my wicked and hardened
life past; and when I looked about me, and considered what
particular providences had attended me since my coming into this
place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me, had not only
punished me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plenti-
fully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me.
With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition;
and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing
I had not the due punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many
mercies, which I had no reason to have expected in that place; that
I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to
give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd
of wonders could have brought; that I ought to consider I had been
fed even by miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that I could hardly
have named a place in the unhabitable part of the world where I
could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I
had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no
venomous creatures or poisonous, which I might feed on to my
hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a
life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of
comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's goodness to me,
and care over me in this condition, be my daily consolation; and
after I did make a just improvement of these things, I went away,
and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought
I Read to Friday From the Bible.
on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted,
and near spent. My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a
little, till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon
the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to
me. And, first, by casting up times past, I remember that there
was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences which
befell me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe
days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked
upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and run away to Hull, in order to
go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-
of-war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of
that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I
made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 30th of
September, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island;
so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my bread;
I mean the biscuit, which I brought out of the ship. This I had
husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread
a day for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread for near
a year before I got any corn of my own; and great reason I had to
be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been
already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes began to decay, too, mightily. As to linen, I had
none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in
the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and
it was a very great help to me that I had, among all the men's clothes
of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There was also several
thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left indeed, but they
were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the weather was so
violent hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go
quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not,
nor could abide the thoughts of it, though I was all alone.
The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could not
bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling
under that shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more could
I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or
hat. The heat of the sun beating with such violence, as it does in
that place, would give me the headache presently, by darting so
directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not
bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon those views, I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out
all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me,
and with such other materials as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring,
or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I made most piteous work of it.
However, I made shift to make me two or three new waistcoats,
which I hoped would serve me a great while. As for breeches or
drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had hung them up
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them
were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others it seems
were very useful. The first thing I made of these was a great cap
for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain; and
this I performed so well, that after this I made me a suit of clothes
wholly of these skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open
at knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me
cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that
they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a
worse tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift
with; and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my
99
waist coat and cap being outermost, I had no trouble keeping dry.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me
an umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great
mind to make one. I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they
are very useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt the
heats every jot as great here, and greater, too, being nearer the
equinox. Besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a
most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a
world of pains at it, and was a great while before I could make
anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I
spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind; but at last I
made one that answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I
found was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread; but if
it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do. However, at last,
as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair
upwards, so that it cast off the rains like a pent-house and kept off
the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the wea-
ther with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty com-
fortably, my mind being en-
tirely composed by resigning to
the will of God, and throwing
myself wholly upon the disposal
of His providence. This made
my life better than sociable; for
when I began to regret the want
of conversation, I would ask
myself whether thus conversing
mutually with my own thoughts
and, as I hope I may say, with
even God Himself, by ejacula-
tions, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment of human
society in the world?

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same course, in the same
posture and place, just as before. The chief things I was employed
in, besides my yearly labor of planting my barley and rice, and
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to
have sufficient stock of one year's provisions beforehand—I say,
besides this yearly labor, and my daily labor of going out with
my gun, I had one labor, to make me a canoe, which at last I
finished; so that by digging a canal to it of six feet wide, and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the
first, which was so vastly big, as I made it without considering
beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so,
never being able to bring it to the water, or to bring the water to it,
I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not
get a tree proper for it, and in a place where I could not get the
water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near half a
mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my
labor, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.
However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size
of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view
when I made the first; I mean, of venturing over to the terra firma,
where it was about forty miles broad. Accordingly, the smallness
of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought
no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next design was to make a
tour round the island; for as I had been on the other side in one
place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the land, so the
discoveries I made in that little journey made me very eager to see
the other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of
nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made a
sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sail, which lay in
store, and of which I had a great stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she
would sail very well. Then I made little lockers, or boxes, at
either end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammuni-
tion, etc., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the
sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat,
where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off of me, like an
awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. But at
last, being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I
resolved upon my tour; and accordingly I victualled my ship for
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should
rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched
rice, a food I eat a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat,
and powder and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats,
of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the
seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover
me in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or
my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I
found it much longer than I expected; for though the island itself
was not very large, yet when I came to the east side of it I found
a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some
above water, some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying
dry half a league more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out
to sea to double the point.
When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how I should
get back again, so I came to an anchor; for I had made me a kind of
an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which I got out of the
ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up upon a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, wher?
I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, I perceived
a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which run to the east,
and even came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it,
because I saw there might be some danger that when I came into it
I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again. And, indeed, had I not gotten first up upon
this hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was the same
current on the other side of the island, only that it set off at a farther
distance; and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore; so I
had nothing to do but to get in out of the first current, and I should
presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, blowing
pretty fresh at E. S. E., and that being just contrary to the said
current, made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that it
was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach,
nor to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over-
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a warning-piece
again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to
the point, when even I was not my boat's length from the shore, but
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current like the
sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it with such violence,
that all I could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it,
but I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy,
which was on my left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all I could do with my paddlers signified nothing. And
now I began to give myself over for lost; for, as the current was on
both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they must
join again, and then I was irrevocably gone. Nor did I see any
possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me but
of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of
starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as
big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had
a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but
what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be
sure, there was no shore, for a thousand leagues at least.

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to
make the most miserable condition mankind could be in worse. Now
I looked back upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heart could wish for
was to be but there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with
eager wishes. "O happy desert!" said I, "I shall never see thee
more. O miserable creature," said I, "whither am I going?" Then
I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and how I had
repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be
on shore there again. Thus we never see the true state of our
condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know how
to value what we enjoy, but by want of it. It is scarce possible to
imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from my
beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recov-
ering it again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward,
that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as
possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian,
I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up
from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially
when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale.
By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the island;
and had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I had been
undone another way too; for I had no compass on board, and should
never have known how to have steered towards the island if I had
but once lost sight of it. But the weather continuing clear, I applied
myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away
to the north as much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some altera-
tion of the current was near; for where the current was too strong
the water was foul. But perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at about half a
mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks. These rocks I found
caused the current to part again; and as the main stress of it ran
away more southernly, leaving the rocks to the northeast, so the
other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy,
which ran back again to the northwest with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder
them, or who have been in such like extremities, may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the
stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I
spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a
strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the
northward than the current which carried rne away at first; so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open to the northern
shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to that
which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of way by the
help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no
farther. However, I found that being between the two great
currents, viz., that on the south side, which had hurried me away,
and that on the north, which lay about a league on the other side;
I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I found the
water at least still, and running no way; and having still a breeze
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
though not making such fresh way as I did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned
this disaster stretching out, as is described before, to the southward,
and casting off the current more southwardly, had, of course, made
another eddy to the north, and this I found very strong, but not
directly setting the way my course lay, which was due west, but
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across
this eddy, slanting northwest; and in about an hour came within
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got
to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks
for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my
deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such things as
I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I
had spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite
spent with the labor and fatigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat.
I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the case, to think of
attempting it by the way I went out; and what might be at the
other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind
to run any more ventures. So I only resolved in the morning to
make my way westward along the shore, and to see if there was no
creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her
again if I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where
I found a very convenient harbor for my boat, and where she lay
as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I
put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to
look about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had
been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing
out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly
hot, I began my march. The way was comfortable enough after
such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower in
the evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; for I
always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country
house.
And now happened something to change my whole life
on the island. One day at noon, while on a stroll down a part of
the shore new to me, what should I see on the sand but the print
of a man's foot I I felt as if I was bound by a spell, and could not
stir from the spot.
By-and-by, I stole a look round me, but no one was in sight.
What could this mean? I went three or four times to look at it.
There it was—the print of a man's foot; toes, heel, and all the
parts of a foot. How could it have come there?
My head swam with fear; and as I left the spot, I made two
or three steps, and then took a look around me; then two steps
more, and did the same thing. I took fright at the stump of an old
tree, and ran to my house, as if for my life. How could aught in
the shape of a man come to that shore, and I not to know it? Where
was the ship that brought him? Then a vague dread took hold of
my mind, that some man, or set of men, had found me out; and it
might be that they meant to kill me, or rob me of all I had.
How strange a thing is the life of man! One day we love that
which the next day we hate. One day we seek what the next day
we shun. One day we long for the thing which the next day we
fear; and so we go on. Now, from the time that I was cast on this
isle, my great source of grief was that I should be thus cut from
the rest of my race. Why, then, should the thought that a man
might be near give me all this pain? Nay, why should the mere
sight of the print of a man's foot make me quake with fear? It
seems most strange, yet not more strange, than true.
Fear kept me indoors for three days, till the want of food drove
me out. At last I was so bold as to go down to the coast to look
once more at the print of the foot, to see if it was the same shape
as my own. I found it was not so large by a great deal; so it was
clear there were men in the isle. Just at this time my good watch
dog fell down dead at my feet. He was old and worn out, and in
him I lost my best guard and friend.
One day as I went from the hill to the coast, a scene lay in
front of me which made me sick at heart. The spot was spread with
the bones of men. There was a round place dug in the earth, where
a fire had been made, and here some men had come to feast. Now
that I had seen this sight, I knew not how to act; I kept close to
my home, and would scarce stir from it save to milk my flock of
goats.
To feel safe was now more to me than to be well fed; and I
did not care to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood, lest the sound
of it should be heard, much less would I fire a gun. As to my bread
and meat, I had to bake it at night when the smoke could not be
seen. But I soon found the way to burn wood with turf at the
top of it, which made it like chark or dry coal; and this I could use
by day, as it had no smoke.
One day as I went home I was struck by the sight of some
smoke, which came from a fire no more than two miles off. From
this time I lost all my peace of mind. Day and night a dread would
haunt me that the men who had made this fire would find me out.
I went home and drew up my steps, but first I made all things
round me look wild and rude. To load my gun was the next thing
to do, and I thought it would be best to stay at home and hide.
But this was not to be borne long. I had no spy to send out,
and all I could do was to get to the top of the hill and keep a good
look-out. At last, through my glass, I could see a group of wild
men join in a dance around their fire. As soon as they had left I
took two guns, and slung a sword on my side; then with all speed
I set off to the top of the hill, once more to have a good view.
This time I made up my mind to go up to the men, but not
with a view to kill them, for I felt that it would be wrong to do so.
With such a load of arms it took me two hours to reach the spot
where the fire was; and by the time I got there the men had all
gone; but I saw them in four boats out at sea.
Down on the shore, there was a proof of what the work of
these men had been. The signs of their feast made me sick at heart,
and I shut my eyes. I durst not fire my gun when I went out for
food on that side of the isle, lest there should be some of the men
left, who might hear it, and so find me out. This state of things
went on for a year and three months, and for all that time I saw no
more men.
On the twelfth of May, a great storm of wind blew all day and
night. As it was dark, I sat in my house; and in the midst of the
gale, I heard a gun fire! My guess was that it must have been from
some ship cast on shore by the storm. So I set a light to some wood
on top of the hill that those in the ship, if ship it would be, might
know that some one was there to aid them. I then heard two more
guns fire. When it was light, I went to the south side of the isle
and there lay the wreck of a ship, cast on the rocks in the night by
the storm. She was too far off for me to see if there were men on
board.
Words cannot tell how much I did long to bring but one of
the ship's crew to the shore! So strong was my wish to save the life
of those on board that I could have laid down my own life to do so.
There are some springs in the heart which, when hope stirs them,
drive the soul on with such a force that to lose all chance of the thing
one hopes for would seem to make one mad; and thus was it with me.
Now, I thought, was time to use my boat; so I set to work
at once to fit it out. I took on board some dry grapes, a bag of
rice, some goat's milk, and cheese. At dawn I set out to sea, and
in less than two hours I came up to the wreck. What a scene was
there. The ship had struck on two rocks. The stern was torn
by the force of the waves, the masts were swept off, ropes and
chains lay strewn on the deck, and all was wrapt in gloom. As I
came up to the wreck, a dog swam to me with a yelp and a whine.
I took him on board my boat, and when I gave him some bread,
he ate it like a wolf, and as to drink, he would have burst if I had
let him take his fill of it.
I went to the cook's room, where I found two men, but they
were both dead. What a change had come on the scene, once so
wild with the lash of the waves and the roar of the wind! All was
calm now—death had done its work, and all had felt its stroke, save
the dog, and he was the one thing that still had life.
I thought the ship mus,t have come from Spain, and there
was much gold on board. I took some of the chests and put them
in my boat, but did not wait to see what they held, and with this
spoil, I came back. I then set to work to bring my freight from
the shore, where I -had left it. In the chests there were two great
bags of gold and some bars of the same, and near these lay three
109

small flasks and three bags of
shot, which were a great prize.
From this time all went well
with me for two years; but it
was not to last. One day, as I
stood on the hill, I saw six boats
on the shore. What could this
mean? Where were the men who
had brought them? And what
had they come for? I saw
through my glass that there
were a score and a half at least
on the east side of the isle. They
had meat on the fire, round
which I could see them dance.
They then took a man from one
of the boats, who was bound hand and foot; but when they came
to loose his bonds, he set off as fast as his feet would take him, and
in a straight line to my house.
To tell the truth, when I saw all the rest of the men run to
catch him my hair stood on end with fright. In the creek he swam
like a fish, and the plunge which he took brought him through it
in a few strokes. All the men now gave up the chase but two, and
they swam through the creek, but by no means so fast as the slave
had done. Now, I thought, was the time for me to help the poor
man, and my heart told me it would be right to do so. I ran down
my steps with my two guns, and went with all speed up the hill,
and then down by a short cut to meet them.
I gave a sign to the poor slave to come to me, and at the same
time went up to meet the two men who were in chase of him. I
made a rush at the first of these, to knock him down with the stock
of my gun, and he fell. I saw the one who was left aim at me with
his bow, so, to save my life, I shot him dead.
The smoke and noise from my gun gaye the poor slave who
had been bound such a shock that he stood still on the spot, as if
he had been in a trance. I gave a loud shout for him to come to
me, and I took care to show him that I was a friend, and made all
the signs I could think of to coax him up to me. At length he came,
knelt down to kiss the ground, and then took hold of my foot and
set it on his head. All this meant that he was my slave; and I bade
him rise and made much of him.
But there was more work to be done yet, for the man who
had had the blow from my gun was not dead. I made a sign for
my slave (as I shall now call him) to look at him. At this he spoke
to me, and though I could not make out what he said, yet it gave
me a shock of joy; for it was the first sound of a man's voice that
I had heard for all the years I had been on the isle.
The man whom I had struck with the stock of my gun sat up,
and my slave, who was in great fear of him, made signs for me to
lend him my sword, which hung in a belt at my side. With this
he ran up to the man, and with one stroke cut off his head. When
he had done this he brought me back my sword with a laugh and
put it down in front of me. I did not like to see the glee with which
he did it, and I did not feel that my own life was quite safe with
such a man.
He, in his turn, could but lift up his large brown hands with
awe to think that I had put his foe to death while I stood so far
from him. But as to the sword, he and the rest of his tribe made
use of swords of wood, and this was why he knew so well how to
wield mine. He made signs to me to let him go and see the man
who had been shot; and he gave him a turn round, first on this side,
then on that, and when he saw the wound made in the breast by
the shot, he stood quite still once more, as if he had lost his wits. I
made signs for him to come back, for my fears told me that the
rest of the men might come in search of their friends.
I did not like to take my slave to my house, nor to my cave;
so I threw down some straw from the rice plant for him to sleep
on, and gave him some bread and a bunch of dry grapes to eat.
He was a fine man, with straight, strong limbs, tall and young. His
hair was thick, like wool, and black. His head was large and high,
and he had bright black eyes. He was of a dark brown hue; hi»
face was round and his nose small, but not flat; he had a good mouth
with thin lips, with which he could give a soft smile; and his teeth
were as white as snow.
I had been to milk my goats in the field close by, and when he
saw me he ran to me and lay down on the ground to show me his
thanks. He then put his head on the ground and set my foot on
his head, as he had done at first. He took all the means he could
think of to let me know that he would serve me all his life; and I
gave a sign to show that I thought well of him.
Tht next thing was to think of some name to call him by. I
chose that of the sixth day of the week (Friday), as he came to me
on that day. I took care not to lose sight of him all that night, and
when the sun rose I made signs for him to come to me that I might
give him some clothes, for he wore none. We then went up to the
top of the hill to look out for the men, but as we could not see them
or their boats, it was clear that they had left the isle.
My slave has since told me that they had had a great fight
with the tribe that dwelt next to them, and that all those men whom
each side took in war were their own by right. My slave's foes had
four who fell to their share, of whom he was one.
I now set to work to make my man a cap of hare's skin, and
gave him a goat's skin to wear round his waist. It was a great
source of pride to him to find that his clothes were as good as my
own.
At night, I kept my guns, swords, and bow close to my side;
but there was no need for this, as my slave was, in sooth, most true,
to me. He did all that he was set to do, with all his whole heart
in the work; and I knew that he would lay down his life to save
mine. What could a man do more than that? And oh, the joy to
have him here to cheer me in this lone islel
I did' my best to teach him, so like a child as he was, to do
and feel all that was right. I found him apt, and full of fun; and
he took great pains to learn all that I could tell him. Our lives
ran on in a calm, smooth way; and, but for the vile feasts which
were held on the shores, I felt no wish to leave the isle.
As Friday had by no means lost his zest for these meals, it
struck me that the best way to cure him was to let him taste the
flesh of beasts; so I took him with me one day to the wood for some
sport. I saw a she goat, in the shade, with her two kids. I caught
Friday by the arm, and made signs to him not to stir, and then shot
one of the kids; but the noise of the gun gave the poor man a great
shock. He did not see the kid, nor did he know that it was dead-
He tore his dress off his breast to feel if there was a wound there;
then he knelt down to me, and took hold of my knees to pray of
me not to kill him.
To show poor Friday that his life was quite safe, I led him
by the hand, and told him to fetch the kid. By and by, I saw a hawk
in a tree, so I bade him look at the gun, the hawk, and the ground;
and then I shot the bird. But my poor slave gave still more signs
of fear this time than he did at first, for he shook from head to foot.
He must have thought that some fiend of death dwelt in the gun,
and I think that he would have knelt down to it, as well as to me;
but he would not so much as touch the gun for some time, though
he would speak to it when he thought I was not near. Once he
told me that what he said to it was to ask it not to kill him.
I brought home the bird, and made broth of it. Friday was
much struck to see me eat salt with it, and made a wry face; but I,
In my turn, took some that had no salt with it, and I made a wry
face at that. The next day I gave him a piece of kid's flesh, which
I had hung by a string in front of the fire to roast. My plan was
to put two poles, one on each side of the fire, and a stick on the top
of them to hold the string. When my slave came to taste the flesh,
he took the best means to let me know how good he thought it.
One day as we stood on the top of the hill at the east side of
the isle, I saw him fix his eyes on the main land, and stand for a
long time to gaze at it; then jump and sing, and call out to me.
"What do you see?" said I.
"O joy!" said he, with a fierce glee in his eyes, "O glad! There
see my land!"
Why did he strain his eyes to stare at this land as if he had a
wish to be there? It put fears in my mind which made me feel far
less at my ease with him. Thought I, if he should go back to his
home, he will think no more of what I have taught him and done for
b/o
in
V

him. He will be sure to tell the rest of his tribe all my ways, and
come back with it, it may be scores of them, and kill me, and then
dance round me, as they did round the men, the last time they came
on my isle.
But these were all false fears, though they found a place in
my mind a long while; and I was not so kind to him now as I had
been. From this time I made it a rule, day by day, to find out if
there were grounds for my fears or not. I said, "Do you wish
to be once more in your own land?"
"Yes! I be much O glad to be at my own land."
"What would you do there? Would you turn wild, and be as
you were?"
"No, no, I would tell them to be good, tell them eat bread,
corn, milk, no eat man more!"
"Why, they would kill you!"
"No, no, they no kill; they love learn."
He then told me that some white men who had come on their
shores in a boat had taught them a great deal.
"Then will you go back to your land with me?"
He said he could not swim so far, so I told him he should help
me to build a boat to go in. Then he said, "If you go, I go."
"I go? why, they would eat me!"
"No, me make them much love you."
Then he told me as well as he could, how kind they had been
to some white men. I brought out the large boat to hear what he
thought of it, but he said it was too small. We then went to look
at the old ship's boat, which, as it had been in the sun for years, was
not at all in a sound state. The poor man made sure that it would

do. But how were we to know this? I told him we should build a
boat as large as that, and that he should go home in it. He spoke
not a word, but was grave and sad.
"What ails you?" said I.
"Why you grieve mad with your man?"
"What do you mean? I am not cross with you."
"No cross? no cross with me? Why send you man home to his
own land, then?"
"Did you not tell me you would like to go back?"
"Yes, yes, we both there; no wish self there, if you not ther»!"
"And what should I do there?"
"You do great deal much good! you teach wild men be good
men; you tell them know God, pray God, and lead new life."
We soon set to work to make a boat that would take us both.
The first thing was to look out for some large trees that grew near
the shore, so that we could launch our boat when it was made. My
slave's plan was to burn the wood to make it the right shape; but
as mine was to hew it, I set him to work with my tools, and in two
months' time we had made a good strong boat; but it took a long
while to get her down to the shore.
Friday had the whole charge of her; and, large as she was, he
made her move with ease, and said, "he thought she go there well,
though great blow wind!" He did not know that I meant to make
a mast and sail. I cut down a young fir tree for the mast, and then
I set to work at the sail. It made me laugh to see my man stand
and stare, when he came to watch me sail the boat. But he soon
gave a jump, a laugh, and a clap of the hands when he saw the
sail jib and fall, first on this side, then on that.
The next thing to do was to stow our boat up in the creek,
where we dug a small dock; and when the tide was low, we made
a dam, to keep out the sea. The time of year had now come for
us to set sail, so we got out all our stores, to put them in the boat.
One day I sent Friday to the shore, to get a sort of herb that
grew there. I soon heard him cry out to me, "O grief! O bad! O
bad! O out there boats, one, two, three!" "Keep a stout heart,"
said I, to cheer him. The poor man shook with fear; for he thought
that the men who brought him here had now come back to kill him.
"Can you fight?" said I.
"Me shoot; but me saw three boats; one, two, three!"
"Have no fear; those that we do not kill will be sure to take
fright at the sound of our guns. Now will you stand by me and
do just as you are bid?"
"Me die when you bid die."
I gave him an axe and two guns, each of which had a charge
of swan shot. I took two guns as well, and put large shot in them,
and then hung my great sword by my side. From the top of the
hill, I saw with the help of my glass that the boats had each brought
eight men and one slave. They had come on shore near the creek,
where a grove of young trees grew close down to the sea. They
had with them three slaves, bound hand and foot, and you who read
this may guess what they were brought here for. I felt that I must
try and save them from so hard a fate, and that to do this, I should
have to put some of their foes to death. So we set forth on our way.
I gave Friday strict charge to keep close to me, and not to fire
till I told him to do so.
We went full a mile out of our way, that we might get round
to the wood to hide there. But we had not gone far, when my old
qualms came back to me, and I thought, "Is it for me to dip my
hands in man's blood? God did not call me to be a judge for Him.
He who said 'Thou shalt not kill,' said it for me, as well as the rest
of the world." So I resolved I would only go and place myself
near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I
would act then as God should direct; and that unless something
offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible
wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched
till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side which was next to
them, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them.
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which
was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing.
He did so, and came back to me, and told me they might be plainly
seen there—that they were all about the fire eating the flesh of one
of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little
from them, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation,
but one of the bearded men whom he had told me of, that came to
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the very nam-
ing of the white bearded man; and going to the tree, I saw plainly
by my glass a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with
his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that
he was a European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about
fifty yards nearer to the place where I was, which, by going a little
way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion,
though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back
about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the
way till I came to the other tree, and then came to a little rising
ground,which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about
eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat on the ground, all close huddled together, and had just
sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him,
perhaps, limb by limb, to their fire, and they were stooping down
to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday, "Now, Friday,"
said I, "do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground,
and Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I took my
aim at the savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him if he
was ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at them," said I; and at
the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my
side I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure,
in dreadful fear; and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon
their feet, but they did not know which way to run, or which way
117
to look, for they knew not from when their destruction came. Fri-
day kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might
observe what I did; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the
like; he saw me cock and present; he did the same again. "Are you
ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," said he. "Let fly, then," said I,
"in the name of God!" and with that I fired again among the amazed
wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded
with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only
two drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran about yelling
and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them
miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly after, though
not quite dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket that was yet loaded, "follow me," which
he did with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of
the wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and
bade Friday to do so, and running as fast as I could, being loaded
with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, lying
upon the beach. The two butch-
ers had left him at the surprise
of our first fire, and fled in a
terrible fright to the sea-side,
and had jumped into a canoe,
and three more of the rest made
the same way. I turned to Fri-
day, and bade him step forwards
and fire at them; he understood
me at once, and running about
forty yards nearer them, he shot
at them.
While my man Friday fired
at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the
poor victim; and loosing his

hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue what he was. He answered, in Latin, Christianus; but was
so weak and faint that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my
bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that he
should drink, which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which
he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was, and he said
Espagnole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by all the
signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for sav-
ing his life. "Seignoir," said I, with as much Spanish as I could
make up, "we will talk later, but we must fight now; if you have
any strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you."
He took them and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as
if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his would-be mur-
derers like a fury.
I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing
to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my
pistol and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the
tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there
that had been discharged, which he did with great swiftness; and
then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest
again, and bade them come to me when they wanted. And the
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-
pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded
them both; but, as he was not able to run, they both got from him
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them,
but the other was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded,
yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might
off to those who were left in the canoe. The account of the whole is
is follows: Three killed at our first shot from the tree; two killed
at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by
Friday, of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood;
three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found dropped here
and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them;
four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead—twen-
i: -one in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-
shot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me
take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed, I was very
anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their
people, they should come back perhaps with two or three hundred
of the canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented to
pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped
in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was
surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and
foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with
fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able
to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and
heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really little life in him.
I at once cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not
stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday
came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him he was safe,
and pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram
which, with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat
up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look
in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how
Friday kissed him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again,, wrung his hands, beat his
own face and head; and then sung and jumped about again like
a man who had lost his mind. It was a good while before I could
make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy
for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after,
and before they could be got a quarter of their way, that I could
not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their
own coast.
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his father, that
I could not find in my heart to take him off for some time; but
after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and
he came jumping and laughing, and greatly pleased; then I asked
him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and
said, "None; ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a cake of
bread, out of a little pouch I carried on purpose. I had in my
pocket also two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful
of them for his father. He had no sooner given his father these
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he
had been bewitched; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went. When he came up to
me, I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to
bring his father some fresh water, also two loaves of bread.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was any water left; he said, "Yes," and I bade him give to the
poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and
I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought to the Spaniard too,
who was very weak, and was lying upon a green place under the
shade of a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had tied it with. So I bade him
sit still, while Friday rubbed and bathed his ankles.
I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, and
lead him to the boat, but Friday, a lusty young fellow, took the
Spaniard quite on his back, and carried him away to the boat, and
set him down softly, close to his father; and presently stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he
brought them both safe into our creek, and, leaving them in the
boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. So he wafted me over,
and then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he
did; but they were neither of them able to walk; so that poor Fri-
day knew not what to do. To remedy this, I soon made a kind of
handbarrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them up
both together upon it between us.
But when we got them to the outside of our wall or fort, we
were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them
over, so I set to work again, and Friday and I, in about two hours'
121

time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, and between that and the grove of young wood which I had
planted; and here we made them two beds.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich
in subjects; and it was a merry idea, which I more than once made,
how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my
own property, so that I had the right of dominion. Secondly, my
people were perfectly subjected: I was the lord and lawgiver: they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives,
if there had been occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too,
I had but three subjects, and they were of three different religions:
my man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a
cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist.
As soon as I had secured my two weak prisoners, and given
them shelter and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of
making some provision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of
my own flock, to be killed; when I cut off the hinder quarter, and
chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh
and broth, having put some barley arid rice also in the broth; and
as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner
wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table
there for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged them.
Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and indeed
to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the
savages pretty well.
After we had supped, I ordered Friday to take one of the can-
oes and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for
want of time,we had left upon the place of battle; and, the next
day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages,,
which lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I
also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous
feast, which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could not
bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he did, and defaced
the very appearance of the savages being there; so that when I
went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little talk with my two new sub-
jects; and, first, I set Friday to ask his father what he thought of
the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might
expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist. He
first thought that the savages in the boat could never live out the
storm which blew that night they went off, but must be drowned,
or driven south to those other shores, and it was his idea that they
were so scared with the manner of their being attacked, the noise,
and the fire, that he believed they would tell the people they were
all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man. And
this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood since, by other
hands, the savages never tried to go over to the island afterward;
they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men
(for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever
went to that island would be killed with fire from the gods. This
I knew not; and therefore was under constant fear for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, I and all my army: for, as we
were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of
them, fairly in the open field, at any time.
In a little time, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their
coming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a
voyage to the main, being assured, by Friday's father, that I might
depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I
would go. But my thoughts were a little upset when I had a serious
talk with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were
sixteen more of his people, who having been cast away and made
their escape to that side, lived there at peace indeed with the sav-
ages, but were very sore put to it for the means to live. I asked
him all the story of their voyage, and how he thought they would
receive a proposal from me, which might tend toward an escape;
and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done.
He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and
they were under great distress, having neither weapons nor clothes,
nor any food, but at the mercy of the savages; out of all hopes of
ever getting back to their own country; and that he was sure, if
I would go to their relief, they would live and die by me.
By the advice of the Spaniard it was decided to put off doing
anything for his comrades for at least half a year. The case was
thus: he had been with us now about a month, during which time
I had let him see in what manner I provided for my support; and
he saw what stock of corn and rice I had laid up; which, though it
was more than enough for myself, yet it was not enough, without
good care, for my family, now it was raised to four; but much less
would it go around, if his people, who were, as he said, fourteen,
still alive, should come over.
And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to take Friday's father and go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those he had left
behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man
with him who would not first swear that he would no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who
was so kind as to send for them; but that they would stand by him
and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went,
would be entirely under and subject to his orders. I gave each of
them a musket, with a fire-lock on it, and about eight charges of
powder and ball, charging them to be careful of both, and not to
use either of them but upon urgent occasion.
This was a cheerful work being the first measures used by
me to help my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some
days. I gave them bread and dried grapes, enough for themselves
for many days, and enough for all the Spaniards for about eight
days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agree-
ing with them about a signal they should hang out at their return,
by which I should know them again, when they came back, at a
distance, before they came on shore.
It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange accident happened, of which the like has not been heard
of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when
my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, "Master,
master, they are come, they are come!" I jumped up, and went
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove,
which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood.
I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do: but I
was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I saw a boat at
about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with
a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing
pretty fair to bring them in: also I saw that they did not come from
that side which the shore lay on, but from the south end of the island.
Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies. In the next place, I went
in to fetch my glass, to see what I could make of them; and, having
climbed up to the top of the hill, when I saw a ship lying at an an-
chor. It seemed to be an English ship, and the boat looked like
an English long-boat.
They ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a
mile from me; which was very happy for me, else they would have
landed just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten
me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I saw they were Englishmen; there were
in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed,
and, as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five of them
were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the boat as
prisoners: one of the three I could see using the gestures of entreaty
and despair; the other two, I could see, lifted up their hands and
appeared concerned but not to such a degree as the first. I was
125
perfectly shocked at the sight, and knew not what the meaning
of it should be.
I expected to see the three prisoners killed every minute, so
I fitted myself up for a battle, though with more caution, knowing
that I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I
ordered Friday also to load himself with arms. I took myself two
fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure was very
fierce; I had my goat-skin coat on, with the great cap, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design not to have made any attempt till it was
dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found,
in short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I
thought, were all laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed
men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, how-
ever, sat down under the shelter of a great tree. I resolved to dis-
cover myself to them, and learn something of their condition; im-
mediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance
behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite
so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them un-
discovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I called
aloud to them in Spanish, "Who
are ye, sirs?"
They gave a start at my
voice and at my strange dress,
and made a move as if they
would fly from me. I said, "Do
not fear me, for it may be that
you have a friend at hand,
though you do not think it."
"He must be sent from the sky
then," said one of them with a
grave look; and he took off his
hat to me at the same time. "All
help is from thence, sir," I said.
"But what can I do to aid you?
You look as if you had some load

of grief on your breast. I saw one of the men lift his sword as if
to kill you."
The tears ran down the poor man's face, as he said, "Is this a
god, or is it but a man?" "Have no doubt on that score, sir," said
I, "for a god would not have come with a dress like this. No, do
not fear—nor raise your hopes too high; for you see but a man,
yet one who will do all he can to help you. Your speech shows
me that you come from the same land as I do. I will do all I can
to serve you. Tell me your case."
"Our case, sir, is too long to tell you while they who would
kill us were so near. My name is Paul. To be short, sir, my crew
have thrust me out of my ship, which you see out here, and have left
me here to die. It was as much as I could do to make them sheathe
their swords, which you saw were drawn to slay me. They have
set me down in this isle with these two men, my friend here, and the.
ship's mate."
"Where have they gone?" said I.
"There, in the wood close by. I fear they may have seen and
heard us. If they have, they will be sure to kill us all."
"Have they fire-arms?"
"They have four guns, one of which is in the boat."
"Well, then, leave all to me!"
"There are two of the men," said he, "who are worse than the
rest. All but these I feel sure would go back to work the ship."
I thought it was best to speak out to Paul at once, and I said,
"Now, if I save your life, there are two things which you must do."
But he read my thoughts, and said, "If you save my life, you
shall do as you like with me and my ship, and take her where you)
please."
I saw that the two men, in whose charge the boat had been left,
had come on shore; so the first thing I did was to send Friday to
fetch from it the oars, the sail, and the gun. And now the ship
might be said to be in our hands. When the time came for the men
to go back to the ship, they were in a great rage; for, as the boat
had now no sail nor oars, they knew not how to get out to their ship.
We heard them say that it was a strange sort of isle, for that
spirits had come to the boat, to take off the sails and oars. We
could see them run to and fro, with great rage; then go and sit in
the boat to rest, and then come on shore once more. When they
drew near to us, Paul and Friday would fain have had me fall
on them at once. But my wish was to spare them, and kill as few
as I could. I told two of my men to creep on their hands and feet
close to the ground, so that they might not be seen, and when they
got up to the men, not to fire till I gave the word.
They had not stood thus long when three of the crew came
up to us. Till now we had but heard their voices, but when they
came so near as to be seen, Paul and Friday stood up and shot at
them. Two of the men fell dead, and they were the worst of the
crew, and the third ran off. At the sound of the guns I came up,
but it was so dark that the men could not tell if there were three of
us or three score.
It fell out just as I could wish, for I heard the men ask, "To
whom must we yield, and where are they?" Friday told them that
Paul was there with the king of the isle, who had brought with
him a crowd of men! At this one of the crew said, "If Paul will
spare our lives we will yield." "Then," said Friday, "you shall
know the king's will." Then Paul said to them: "You know my
voice; if you lay down your arms the king will spare your lives."
They fell on their knees to beg the same of me. I took good
care that they did not see me, but I gave them my word that they
should all live, that I should take four of them to work the ship,
and that the rest would be bound hand and foot for the good faith
of the four. This was to show them what a stern king I was.
Of course I soon set them free, and I put them in a way to take
my place on the isle. I told them of all my ways, taught them how
to mind the goats, how to work the farm and make the bread. I
gave them a house to live in, firearms, tools, and my two tame cats;
in fact, all but Poll and my gold.
As I sat on the top of the hill Paul came up to me. He held
out his hand to point to the ship, and with much warmth took me
to his arms and said: "My dear friend, there is your ship! for she
is all yours, and so are we, and all that is in her!"
I made ready to go on board the ship, but told the captain I
would stay that night to get my things in shape, and asked him to
go on board in the meantime and keep things right on the ship,
and send the boat on shore next day for me. I told him to take
the worst of the two men who were killed, and hang him at the
yard-arm, that these men might see him.
I cast my eyes to the ship, which rode half a mile off the shore,
at the mouth of the creek, and near the place where I had brought
my raft to the land. Yes, there she stood, the ship that was to set
me free and to take me where I might choose to go. She set her
sails to the wind and her flags threw out their gay stripes in the
breeze. Such a sight was too much for me, and I fell down faint
with joy.
Friday and Paul then went on board the ship, and Paul took
charge of her once more. We did not start that night, but at noon
the next day I left the isle—that lone isle, where I had spent so
great a part of my life.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board the great
goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots;
also the money which had lain by me so long useless that it was
grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it
had been a little rubbed and handled, and also the money I found
in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I left the island, the
19th of December, as I found by the ship's account, in the year
1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity the
same day of the month that I first made my escape from among the
Moors. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England
the llth of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years
absent.
