Introduction
Rangelands embody biological diversity of pro-
found ecological and social significance, yet it is the
biological diversity of forests and wetlands that has
been the focus of research by scientists and concern
by the public. Recently, a broad array of people, from
ecologists and biologists to ranchers and recreationists,
have begun to realize the importance of rangeland
conservation and biological diversity. Although these
groups may not always share a common vision of
rangelands, they share a common interest in the land
that will foster a better understanding and apprecia-
tion of the value of diverse and healthy rangelands.
Ranchers have long practiced conservation of range-
land biological diversity. Most recognize the impor-
tance of both warm and cool season grasses to round
out their forage programs, and many have noticed
that in some years one grass will do poorly while
another will thrive, thus balancing the production.
Ranchers depend on native grasses coming back on
their own after drought or a bad grasshopper year;
some species will return quicker than others. Looking
toward the future, ranchers manage their grass for a
diverse rangeland community, not a monotypic one.
This is conservation of rangeland biological diversity
at the grass roots level.
Together, scientists and rangeland managers are
traveling to new levels of conservation of rangeland
biodiversity, but the journey has some formidable
challenges. Herbivory, fire, drought, and other natu-
ral events and processes historically shaped range-
land biodiversity and ecological processes long be-
fore human action. However, human influence on
the range has complicated and interrupted many
naturally occurring mechanisms. The use and control
of fire has altered its frequency and intensity. The
pattern, frequency, and intensity of herbivory by
large animals has been modified by the conversion
from free-ranging bison and other large ungulates to
confined domestic livestock and a proliferation of
livestock water developments. Cultivation has frag-
mented and isolated rangelands and often natural
processes no longer function. An insidious challenge
to rangeland biodiversity is the invasion of exotic
plants into native range often at the expense of native
biota.
The purpose of this symposium was to provide a
forum to discuss how elements of rangeland
biodiversity are being conserved today. We asked,
"How resilient and sustainable are rangeland sys-
tems to the increasing demands of a growing human
population and to extended periods of drought?"
One way to begin answering this question is to look
at our successes and failures in conserving all parts
of rangeland systems. Key programs and issues,
identified by a program committee, were addressed
by researchers and managers. Their papers, which
have received statistical and peer review, are pre-
sented here and provide research results, manage-
ment findings, and describe management programs
currently used to conserve rangeland biodiversity.
The paper "Gap Analysis in the Great Plains: A
Large-Scale Geographic Strategy for Conservation
of Biodiversity" by Dennis Jelinski, Michael Jennings,
and James Merchant was withdrawn by the authors
before publication of this workshop proceedings.
This symposium was held concurrently with the
Annual Meeting of the Central Mountains and Plains
Section of The Wildlife Society. We thank the organiz-
ers of that event for suggesting this symposium. Thanks
are also extended for the well-attended field trip to
review northern swift fox management in southwest-
ern South Dakota that concluded the workshop.
A Neotropical Migratory Bird Prioritization for
National Forests and Grasslands
Dick Roth1 and Richard Peterson2
Abstract.—The Rocky Mountain Region of the USDA Forest
Service provides nesting habitat for 146 species of neotropical
migratory birds. Interactive, prioritization databases were de-
veloped for each National Forest and National Grassland in the
Region to assist land managers in making informed decisions
about resource allocations. The data was processed using
Paradox software. This paper summarizes the uses and appli-
cation of the database for the Oglala and Ft. Pierre National
Grasslands.
METHODS
We used data provided by Colorado Bird Obser-
vatory and ranked according to the Partners-In-Flight
(PIF) ranking scheme for initial prioritization of
neotropical migratory birds (NTMBs). The approach
ranks species by their relative susceptibility to extinc-
tion (Carter and Barker 1993, Hunter et al. 1993).
There are many factors that contribute to extinction
probability. The PIF prioritization scheme uses seven
criteria as the most important in gauging a species
susceptibility to extirpation or extinction: 1) impor-
tance of area of consideration (IA), (percentage of a
species range that is within a state or geographic area
under consideration); 2) global abundance (GA); 3)
the degree of threat to the species' persistence on the
breeding ground (TB); 4) the degree of threat to
species' persistence on the wintering ground (TW); 5)
breeding distribution (BD); 6) extent of wintering
distribution (WD); 7) population trend in area of
consideration (PT); based upon U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. Each of
the seven criteria is weighted equally. An individual
species is assigned a score in each of the seven catego-
ries ranging from one (low concern) to five (high
concern). Each species is ranked according to the
average of the seven scores. The importance of area

score (IA) was modified for our use to include a rank
based upon the percentage of the area under consid-
eration which meets breeding habitat requirements
for a given species.
Uncertainty values are assigned to each species in
conjunction with valuesassignedforthreatstobreed-
ing (TBU) and wintering (TWU), and population
trend (PTU). These uncertainty values reflect the
extent of the available information for each of the
associated criteria. They indicate the extent and loca-
tion of gaps in our knowledge of neotropical migrant
biology. These values help us differentiate between
species with definite management concerns and those
requiring additional monitoring or research in order
to more clearly reflect their status.
Several criteria were modified for the Oglala and
Ft. Pierre National Grasslands. Population trend (PT)
and Population trend uncertainty scores were deter-
mined from USFWS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for
the 10-year and 26-year scores. Data from physi-
ographic region 39 (Missouri Plateau-Unglaciated)
were used for both grasslands. Other population
trend data more specific to the area under consider-
ationcanbe used for these criteria if available. Threats
to breeding habitat (TB) and Threats to breeding
habitat uncertainty (TBU) criteria provided by PIF
were used (Carter and Barker 1993). Additionally,
known local threats were also considered such as
reduction of prairie dog towns as a threat to burrow-
ing owl habitat. In this case, a TB score of 5 was used
because loss of prairie dog towns would result in
elimination of burrowing owl habitat (Peterson 1994).
Several methods have been developed to deter-
mine priorities for community based conservation
(Millsap et al. 1990, Master 1991, Reed 1992). The
technique developed by Partners in Flight is essen-
tially one that ranks individual species first, and
secondarily ranks habitats based on individual spe-
cies scores grouped by habitat preference. This rank-
ing can then be used to develop and justify commu-
nity based conservation programs. The determina-
tion of breeding occurrence and habitat preference of
neotropical migratory landbirds on the Oglala and
Ft. Pierre Grasslands was made using local expertise.
The habitat types and conditions developed for
the Grasslands and assigned to each species have
three levels:
1) Appropriate habitat contains six major
breeding bird habitat types. They include
trees/woodlands, shrubs/shrublands,
grass/grasslands, edge-tree/grass-shrub/
grass, wetlands and special topographic
structure.
2) Suitable habitat, in general, additional con-
ditions are needed for appropriate habi-
tat to be suitable breeding habitat for a
given species. For grasslands, additional
conditions could be related to a given
height and density of grasses or forbs. For
trees/woodland habitat, additional con-
ditions could include deciduous trees,
cavities or a multi-layered canopy.
3) Special conditions includes topographic
structures such as cliffs and cutbanks, but
also includes features such as riparian
areas and prairie dog towns.
These habitat categories enable development of
habitat ranking based on a species' use of a wide
variety of habitat types and variables.
Coding used for habitats and special features is as
follows:
Habitats T-(t)rees/woodlands, coni(f)erous,
(d)eciduous, (o)ld growth, m(u)ltilayer
canopy, and
(c)avities.
E-(e)dge, tree-grass/shrub-grass.
S-(s)hrubs, (b)ig sagebrush, (2) thorny
shrubs-esp. plum,
G-(g)rass/grasslands-open areas-esp.
s(h)ort and/or sparse, t(a)ll and/or
de(n)se, mi(x)ed/mid.
W-(w)etlands/(w)ater-(l)riparian,(m)arsh/
tall emergent, (3) wet meadow-tall
grass/short emergent.
Specials s(P)ecial-topo/structure-(4)cliffs/
caves/ledges and cutbanks, (5)buildings/
bridges/chimneys and bird houses, ^is-
lands/bare shores.
s(p)ecial-other-(7)prairie dog towns, (i.e.
burrows/bare ground/short grass and
associated prey), forest fire locations-
turned areas, esp. large with tall
snags, (9) cropland-esp alfalfa, (O)old
crow/magpie nests.
The mix of numbers and letters used in the coding
may appear to be confusing; however, familiariza-
tion with the application of those codes as displayed
in the habitat columns of the accompanying tables
reveals that they provide a logical fit.
RESULTS
The Oglala and Ft. Pierre National Grasslands
support 79 and 68 species of neotropical migratory
landbirds which regularly nest there, or a combined
total of 84 regular nesters. These are listed in Appen-
dix 1 and 2 along with all associated prioritization
scores for the seven criteria and some of the associ-
ated uncertainty scores. Species with R1O or R26
ranks of 3.00 or greater should be given high priority
for management considerations (Thompson et al.
1993). Analysis of the data reveals that 18 of the 84
species have a R1O or R26 rank of 3.00 or greater
(Appendix 1 and 2). The R1O and R26rank scores
along with importance of area, threats to breeding
and breeding distribution scores help to provide a
framework for setting management priorities. As an
illustration, the chestnut-collard longspur has high
R1O and R26 rank scores but has an importance of
area (IA) score of only 3.00.
Consequently, other species with higher IA scores
should be given higher management priority. The
two top ranked species on both grasslands (burrow-
ing owl and ferruginous hawk) have a preference for
short-grass prairie and prairie dog towns. Other spe-
cies on these two grassland have a preference for tall
and mixed-grass prairie. Consequently, management
of the National Grassland units for a diversity of
heights and would provide habitat for both species.
The database contains scores for each criterion,
for each species, for each unit where they are likely to
occur. It is important that the data for each unit be
analyzed separately for more specific insights into
the top priority species and habitat for each unit. For
example, what is the importance of the habitat on the
unit being analyzed for a given species. What are the
threats to that habitat? What is the status and trend of
that habitat?
This prioritization system reveals that the highest
ranked habitat on the Oglala National Grassland is
big sagebrush and that is based on one species (table
1). The next highest ranked habitat is short and
mixed-grass prairie and prairie dog towns respec-
tively. These habitats support six and four high prior-
ity (= > 3) species respectively. Edge habitat and
riparian habitat are both important because of the
diversity of species that they support. These values
are based upon the relative susceptibility to extinc-
tion of species found in each habitat. Information on
species as presented in table 2 should also be consid-
ered along with the habitat information when weigh-
ing the consequences of management actions.
A total of 12 species from the Oglala National
Grassland have a R26 Rank of 3.00 or greater. Brewer's
Sparrow is the species in big sagebrush habitat which
causes the high habitat rank in table 1. The rank of 1
for importance of area score (IA) indicates that only a
small portion of the Oglala National Grassland pro-
vides suitable breeding habitat for Brewer's Spar-
rows. The two top-ranked species use prairie dog
towns and the top five species also short to mixed
grass prairie habitats.Therefore, the highest priority
habitats for NTMBs on the Oglala National Grassland
should be those that support these species.

Similar analysis of the data for the Ft Pierre Na-
tional Grassland reveals somewhat different results
(table 3). Ft Pierre is in a higher precipitation area and
has taller grasses and more deciduous trees than the
Oglala National Grassland. Bird species diversity is
greater across habitat types than on the Oglala Na-
tional Grassland and mixed/tall grass habitat higher
priority. The burrowing owl is the highest ranked
species on both units (table 4). Dickcissel, bobolink,
grasshopper sparrow, northern harrier and upland
sandpiper had higher prioritization scores on the Ft.
Pierre National Grassland. Management of prairie
dog towns and short grass habitat should have some
priority on Ft. Pierre, but management for mixed to
tall grass habitat is of higher priority based on this
analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
LITERATURE CITED
The PIF species ranking system is a helpful tool in
establishing priorities for Neotropical Migratory Bird
species and habitat based management efforts for
those species. It should not replace human judgment
or additional information which might be important
in setting resource priorities. Refinement of the PIF
data as was done on the Oglala and Ft. Pierre Na-
tional Grasslands with local expertise increases the
utility value of the system. Only a few analysis ex-
amples were given here. However, an endless variety
of queries can be used to tease additional information
from the data.

Greater Prairie Chicken Nesting Habitat,
Sheyenne National Grassland, North Dakota
Clinton McCarthy1, Tim Pella2, Greg Link3, and Mark A. Rumble4
Abstract.—Greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido
pinnatus) populations and habitats have declined dramatically
in the Great Plains. The Sheyenne National Grassland (SNG)
has the largest population of greater prairie chickens in North
Dakota, but this population has declined over the past 15
years. Lack of nesting habitat has been identified as a signifi-
cant factor contributing to the decline in greater prairie chicken
populations throughout their range. We used the Habitat
Suitability Index (HSI) model for greater prairie chickens to
evaluate the nesting habitat conditions on the SNG. This
population of greater prairie chickens appears to sustain itself
on the brink of extirpation by nesting in the few areas that
provide nesting cover and in private alfalfa fields. Encroach-
ment of woody plants into the SNG, changes in private land-
use patterns, removal of forage by domestic livestock contrib-
ute to the low suitability of the SNG for nesting by greater
prairie chickens.
INTRODUCTION
The Sheyenne National Grassland (SNG) is ap-
proximately 28,745 ha of federally administered prai-
rie in southeastern North Dakota. Within its admin-
istrative boundary there are an additional 25,910 ha
of interspersed private cropland and prairie. The
SNG contains the largest population of greater prai-
rie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in the
state of North Dakota (Kobriger et al. 1987). Greater
prairie chickens are not native to the SNG, but are
considered a naturalized immigrant in North Da-
kota (Johnson and Knue 1989). Prairie chickens ap-
parently moved into North Dakota from the north-

central part of the United States during the Euro-
American settlement in the 1870's and 1880's (Johnson
and Knue 1989, Evans 1968). Greater prairie chicken
populations and their habitats (native tall grass prai-
rie) have declined to a small fraction of their historical
range (Hjertaas et al. 1993, Samson and Knopf 1994).
Thus, the population of greater prairie chickens on the
SNG has both regional and national importance.
Numbers of prairie chickens on the SNG increased
from the early 1960's through the early 1980's (Kobriger
et al. 1987). Since then, prairie chicken numbers on the
SNG have declined from a high of 410 males in 1983 to
a low of 84 males in 1994 (Kobriger et al. 1987, unpubl.
data, Sheyenne National Grassland, Lisbon, ND). State
and federal natural resource management agencies,
and conservation groups are concerned that manage-
ment of the SNG maybe contributing to the decline in
the greater prairie chicken population. Lack of suit-
able nesting habitat has been identified as the most
significant factor limiting populations of greater prai-
rie chickens across their range (Kirsch 1974, Westemeir
1973) and in North Dakota (Svedarsky 1979).
Habitat suitability index (HSI) models are an ac-
cepted method for quantifying species' habitats as
numerical index (Schamberger et al. 1982). Biological
and habitat information are synthesized to formulate
index values between zero (unsuitable) and one (op-
timum) for habitat requisites considered important to
a species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1980). We
conducted HSI analyses to assess habitat conditions
for greater prairie chickens on the SNG at three scales:
1) the western portion of the SNG and adjacent pri-
vate lands, 2) the Durler/Venlo Management unit, and
3) areas <^1.6 km of the 14 active booming grounds.
METHODS
The HSI model for greater prairie chickens (Prose
1985) identifies two habitat components, nesting cover
and winter food, as the most important habitat com-
13
ponents for prairie chickens. The HSI for nesting
cover is based on grassland vegetation height/den-
sity (expressed as visual obstruction measurements
on a pole, Robel et al. 1970) for nesting cover in the
spring (figure 1).
We mapped the lowland, midland, and upland
grassland vegetation types (Manske and Barker 1987)
on 1:24,000 aerial photos of the SNG. Most nesting by
greater prairie chickens on the SNG occurs within 1.6
km of leks (Newell et al. 1987). The Custer National
Forest Land Management Plan (U.S. Forest Service,
Custer National Forest, Billings, MT, 1986) requires
that nesting habitat for prairie grouse be assessed
within 1.6 km of leks. During October and Novem-
ber, 1994, we estimated height/density of vegetation
in these vegetation types from 81 transects within 1.6
km of greater prairie chicken leks in the northern and
western portion of the SNG. At each of 10 stations on
each transect, we recorded the height that vegetation
obstructed 100 percent of a pole (VOR) marked in 0.5
dm increments when viewed from four directions (at
90° azimuths) at a distance of 4 m and a height of 1 m
from the pole (Robel et al. 1970). VORs were averaged
for each station and the average among stations was
used to estimate transect VORs. We placed six
transects in upland vegetation, 51 transects in mid-
land vegetation and 26 transects in lowland vegeta-
tion. Data from these transects were used as VOR
estimates in the mapped vegetation polygons they
were collected in. For all other mapped vegetation

polygons, these VOR data served as calibrations for
ocular estimates of five VOR classes (0 - 0.50 dm, 0.51
-1.0 dm, 1.01 -1.5 dm, 1.51 - 2.0 dm, and >2.0 dm)
during field reconnaissance. Maps of vegetation and
VOR class assignments were transferred to 1:24,000
U.S. Geological Survey maps and the area of each
vegetation was planimetered for use in the HSI esti-
mates.
HSI for nesting cover is estimated in three steps
(Prose 1985). First, a suitability index is estimated
from the midpoint of the VOR classes of each vegeta-
tion type i (SIVORi). Second, the percent of area provid-
ing equivalent optimal nesting habitat (EONH) is
calculated using:
EONH = £ (SIvorMN,)
i i
where n = total number of vegetation types, and
N. = percent of the area in vegetation type i. Third,
HSI for nest cover is calculated from:
HSI =
(0.735 * EONH) - 21.4
37
Characteristics of vegetation and winter snow
accumulation influence the structure of vegetation in
the spring for nesting by greater prairie chickens.
VOR measurement collected in the fall decrease prior
to spring nesting. This decrease is proportional to the
height of vegetation and for the range of VOR 0.5-2.0
dm varies from 7-40 percent in mixed grass prairie (G.
Schenbeck pers. commun., Nebraska National For-
est, Chadron, NE). Over winter VOR losses on the
SNG are probably different, but data are lacking. We
selected 15 percent over-winter VOR losses to esti-
mate spring nesting cover based on fall VOR esti-
mates because the VORs for the SNG are near the
lower end of the range.
Western SNG Analysis
The western part of the SNG includes most of the
prairie chicken leks. This area included 3433 ha of
private land and 8984 ha of SNG administered lands.
We calculated the HSI for this analysis unit to show
estimated contributions to the HSI for prairie chick-
ens from adjacent private lands. VOR class informa-
14
tion was available for only 5738 ha (64 percent) of the
SNG lands in this analysis unit. We assumed the
mapped VOR classes were representative of the re-
maining of the western SNG and used these data for
HSI calculations in this analysis unit. For private
lands in the western SNG analysis unit we assumed:
1) CRP land had VOR class > 2.0 dm; 2) hay and alfalfa
had VOR cover classes <0.5 dm because of mowing
approximately the third week of June that destroys
existing nests and most young hatched birds; and
3) grazed pasture had VOR cover class 0.51-1.0 dm.
Area Surrounding 14 Active Leks
The area within 1.6 km of active leks includes
most of the nesting habitat of greater prairie chickens.
This scale of analysis allowed us to evaluate HSI for
areas of known greater prairie chicken occurrences.
This level of analysis included the area surrounding
active greater prairie chicken leks and we expected
HSI from this analysis should equal or exceed the
HSI's from the blocks of SNG that included areas
>1.6 km from leks and unused areas.
Durler/Venlo Management Unit
RESULTS
The Durler/Venlo management unit includes 3645
ha in nine range management allotments in the west-
ern SNG. The Durler/Venlo unit is a subset of the
prairie chicken range in the western portion of the
SNG. It includes the larger leks, highest prairie chicken
numbers, and the greatest number of prairie chicken
leks not shared by sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus
phasianellus jamesi). Most of the Durler/Venlo man-
agement unit is <L6 km from a prairie chicken lek.
This portion of SNG has complete vegetation classi-
fication and mapping.
We excluded vegetation communities that were
not available for nesting by greater prairie chickens
from the HSI for the Durler/Venlo management unit.
This HSI analysis presents a complete picture of the
nesting habitat for this area. We assigned vegetation
types to mapped polygons using the dominant veg-
etation community in the polygons. Within these
polygons, vegetation communities not capable of
producing 1.5 dm VOR measurements or that are
usually flooded (Manske and Barker 1987, Newell et
al. 1987) were considered unavailable for nesting by
greater prairie chickens. The area in each polygon
assigned to a VOR class did not include unsuitable
areas. For example, lowland vegetation communities
dominated by species such as Carex lanulosa were
considered unavailable because in most years the
ground is flooded. Upland vegetation communities
dominated by species such as Boutelou gracilis were
considered unavailable for prairie chicken nesting
because they are not capable of producing at least 1.5
dm VOR in most years.
Western Sheyenne National Grassland
The 12,445 ha in the western SNG had 24 percent
EONH (table 1), less than the minimum considered
necessary for the HSI to be greater than zero using fall
VOR estimates. When over-winter VOR losses were
included, the EONH in the spring declined to 21
percent, with an HSI remaining zero.
Durler/Venlo Management Unit
EONH in the Durler/Venlo unit was lower that
the western SNG. EONH was reduced by eliminat-
ing the lowlands that are usually flooded in the
spring from the HSI calculations. The net result was
12 percent fall EONH and 9 percent EONH in the
spring. The subsequent HSI for the Durler/Venlo unit
was also zero.

Area Surrounding 14 Active Leks
The area within 1.6 km of the 14 active leks had a
larger EONH (26 percent) in the fall than the other
analysis units. However, the nesting HSI was zero for
this area as well. Four of the lek areas provided
sufficient EONH for HSI's greater than zero. How-
ever HSI estimates for spring showed that only two of
these leks still provided sufficient EONH for HSI's
greater than zero.
DISCUSSION
Nesting HSI
Our data suggests that nesting cover limits greater
prairie chicken populations on the SNG. HSI's were
zero for all the analysis units we compared. Four leks
had sufficient nesting cover in the surrounding 1.6
km for HSI's greater than zero based on the fall
measurements. HSI for these lek areas were less than
0.2 Only two leks had HSI's greater than zero for the
area within 1.6 km from leks after over winter VOR
losses were considered. HSI's for these two leks were
<0.1.
VOR measurements in grassland vegetation that
are 2 to 3 dm are considered optimal nest cover for
greater prairie chickens (Prose 1985). VOR measure-
ments >1.5 dm provide SIVOR >0.7. Only 16 percent
of the western SNG was in the VOR class > 1.5 dm. In
the Durler/Venlo management unit, only 7 percent of
the suitable nesting area provided vegetation >1.5
dm. For areas <1.6 km of leks, only 14 percent of the
area had vegetation in the >1.5 dm VOR classes.
Suitable nesting cover for prairie chickens may in-
crease during drought years because lowlands that
are usually flooded are drier and usable for nesting
by hens.
Most of the nesting habitat for greater prairie
chickens in the SNG is the midland community type
in the humocky sandhills (Manske and Barker 1981,
Manske and Barker 1987). Switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum) communities found on the toe slopes sur-
rounding lowland meadows provide the primary
prairie chicken nesting cover on the SNG (Manske
and Barker 1987, Newell 1987). Although lowlands
are not considered suitable for nesting in most years,
the lowland/midland interface is used for nesting by
prairie chickens (Newell 1987). The lack of adequate
cover for nesting in upland communities was attrib-
uted to heavy livestock utilization (Newell 1987).
Historically, upland communities were likely tall grass
prairie (Burgess 1964), but currently have limited
capacity to provide nesting cover because they are
dominated by short cool season and warm season
grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass and blue grama.
The HSI model (Prose 1985) assumes that opti-
mum nesting habitat conditions exist when 80 per-
cent of the area supports herbaceous vegetation with
a VOR of 2 - 3 dm. However, lingering populations of
greater prairie chickens can exist in areas with 10-15
percent permanent grassland (Hamerstrom et al. 1957,
Prose 1985). Topfer et al. (1990) considers a spring
population of 200 birds (100 males) as a minimum
number to insure perpetuation of the population.
Greater prairie chickens probably persist on the SNG
because natural variation provides small limited ar-
eas with adequate nesting cover. These areas exist at
the lowland/midland community interface, in low-
lands during drought years, and in limited quantity
surrounding some leks. Limited nesting also occurs
in alfalfa on private lands (Newell 1987). Small popu-
lations, such as the greater prairie chicken on the
SNG, are highly susceptible to extinction due to
catastrophic natural events (Ruggiero et al. 1994).
Robustness of Analyses to Assumptions
Because the HSI in our evaluation were based on
ocular estimates of VOR classes, we conducted analy-
ses to estimate HSI for systematic errors in estimating
the VOR classes. If we over estimated the VOR classes
(e.g.,VOR was actually lower), then HSI would de-
cline further. Because, the lower limit on HSI is zero,
our conclusion of limited nesting habitat remained
unchanged.
If we systematically underestimated VOR classes
by one class (0.5 dm), HSI for the Western SNG
increased to 0.1 for fall VOR estimates and remained
zero for estimates of spring nesting cover. HSI in the
Durler/Venlo unit remained zero for both spring and
fall VOR estimates. HSI for the areas around active
leks increased to 0.3 for fall VOR estimates, but de-
clined to 0.1 for spring estimates of nesting cover.
Because the area surrounding leks included low-
lands that are flooded in most years, the HSI was
probably lower. None-the-less, analyses that assume
we underestimated nesting cover, still show that
nesting habitat is limited on the SNG.
16
The VOR estimates we used for the 3433 ha
private lands in western SNG analysis unit were
made subjectively post hoc. Because, these post hoc
estimates of private land VOR may have influenced
the HSI, we conducted an analysis that would present
the best possible HSI for this analysis unit. HSI for the
western SNG was recalculated assigning all private
lands with suitable vegetation types (hay and alfalfa,
pastures, and CRP) for nesting, a SIVOR of 1.0 (this
analysis does not change the HSI for nest cover on
lands managed by the SNG). The resulting HSI for
nest cover increased for the western SNG analysis
unit to 0.33. This HSI represents the upper limit for
the western SNG analysis unit, but it is not realistic.
Most of the area considered to have SIVOR of 1.0 are
grazed or mowed annually. Hay and alfalfa is usually
cut by the third week of June, destroying existing
nests and young broods unable to escape the mow-
ers. Only the 251 ha of CRP in the analysis unit
maintained its structural integrity throughout the
nesting and brood rearing periods. None-the-less,
this analysis still indicated that regional nesting habi-
tat for greater prairie chickens is limited in the vicin-
ity of the SNG.
Contributing Factors
The encroachment of woody and exotic plant
species, changes in adjacent agricultural/land use
changes, and livestock grazing practices are three
human induced factors that directly or and indirectly
influence nesting cover for prairie chickens on the
SNG. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), willow
(Salix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia)
have encroached into prairie reducing nesting cover
on the SNG (Kobriger et al. 1987, Jensen 1992). Leafy
spurge (Euphorbia esula) has expanded from 7 percent
to over 17 percent of the SNG since 1985 (unpubl.
data, SNG). Encroachment of woody plants reduces
and fragments suitable nesting, brood rearing and
roosting cover (Svedarsky 1979); provides travel cor-
ridors and perch sites for predators (Burhnerkempe
et al. (1984) and creates habitat more suitable for
closely related sharp-tailed grouse (Prose 1987).
Agricultural development on private lands adja-
cent to the SNG over the past 10-15 years shows that
remnant prairie habitats on private lands have been
largely converted to croplands (unpubl. data, Nat.
Res. Conserv. Serv., Lisbon, ND). Our analysis of the
western SNG unit, showed that most of the suitable
nesting habitat on private lands was Conservation
Reserve Program comprising 250 ha in the analysis
unit. No privately owed parcelsof native prairie were
identified in our analysis of the western SNG.
Grazing by livestock is the predominant use of
the SNG. Livestock stocking rates have fluctuated
between 50,000 and 60,000 AUMs over the past 10 -15
years on the SNG. However, the size of livestock has
increased approximately 40 percent during a compa-
rable period (L. Potts, pers. commun., SNG, Lisbon,
ND). These heavier animals require approximately
30 percent more forage (National Research Council
1984) than the standard AUM established for a 454 kg
animal.

Black-Tailed Prairie Dog Status and
Future Conservation Planning
Daniel W. Mulhern1 and Craig J. Knowles2
Abstract.—The black-tailed prairie dog is one of five prairie dog
species estimated to have once occupied up to 100 million ha
or more in North America. The area occupied by black-tailed
prairie dogs has declined to approximately 2% of its former
range. Conversion of habitat to other land uses and widespread
prairie dog eradication efforts combined with sylvatic plague,
Yersinia pestis, have caused significant reductions. Although,
the species itself is not in imminent jeopardy of extinction, its
unique ecosystem is jeopardized by continuing fragmentation
and isolation.
INTRODUCTION
The black-tailed prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus
Ord, is the most widespread and abundant of five
species of prairie dog in North America. Two species,
the Utah prairie dog, C parvidens J.A. Allen and the
Mexican prairie dog, C mexicanus, are currently listed
as threatened and endangered, respectively, under
the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The two other
widespread species are the white-tailed prairie dog,
C leucurus Merriam and the Gunnison's prairie dog,
C gunnisoni Baird.
The black-tailed prairie dog is native to the short
and midgrass prairies of North America. Its historic
range stretches from southern Canada to northern
Mexico and includes portions of Arizona, Colorado,
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyo-
ming (Hall and Kelson 1959). The eastern boundary
of prairie dog range is approximately the western
edge of the zone of tallgrass prairie, from which
prairie dogs are ecologically excluded. The western
boundary of this species is roughly the Rocky Moun-
tains. Its range is contiguous with, but generally does
not overlap, ranges of other prairie dog species.

With the exception of Arizona, from which it has
been extirpated, the species still occurs in all the states
(including Canada and Mexico) within its historic
range. Yet, widespread reductions have occurred in
population numbers and occupied areas throughout
this broad range. Historic evidence suggests that the
total area occupied by all species of prairie dogs may
have declined by as much as 98% during the first half
of this century (Miller et al. 1994).
METHODS
We sent letters of inquiry to state and federal
conservation and land management agencies and
consulted published reports. This information was
augmented by telephone interviews with individu-
als knowledgeable about prairie dog management.
The area surveyed included all states within the
original range of the black-tailed prairie dog. Al-
though responses were received from all states and
agencies queried, the quality of survey information
varied. Therefore, this report is a picture of prairie
dogs in the mid-1980s rather than an accurate assess-
ment of 1995 populations.
Prairie dog abundance and distribution is prob-
ably better documented at present than at any previ-
ous time due to improved mapping techniques and
greater interest in prairie dogs by land management
agencies. Yet, prairie dog occupied acreage can still
only be grossly estimated. A primary factor contribut-
ing to this uncertainty is that much of the mapping
effort is temporally distributed over a decade or more
and there is no method available to assess prairie dog
abundance over a broad area within a short span of
time. Typically, prairie dog populations change sub-
stantially within a few years due to the threats dis-
cussed below and to climatic factors and prairie dog
reproductive ecology. Another factor contributing to
errors in determining prairie dog abundance is a lack
of information from private and state lands.
19
THREATS TO THE PRAIRIE DOG
A number of causes have been identified or pro-
posed to account for the reductions in the acreage
occupied by black-tailed and other prairie dog spe-
cies. We believe that four areas of threat warrant
further discussion: 1) loss of habitat due to conver-
sion of prairie to other land uses; 2) intentional poi-
soning or other eradication or control efforts, prima-
rily prompted by the livestock industry; 3) shooting
for recreation or as a control effort; and 4) sylvatic
plague, Yersinia pestis.
LOSS OF PRAIRIE
Prairie dominated by blue grama, Bouteloua graci-
lis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths, and buffalograss, Buchloe
dactyloidcs (Nutt.) Engelm., possibly due to its rela-
tively flat topography, is among the first grassland
converted to agriculture (Dinsmore 1983). As a result,
Graul (1980) noted that as much as 45% of this prairie
type has been lost to other land uses. Reductions in all
shortgrass and midgrass prairies is expected to be
similar or possibly greater in some midgrass regions
where precipitation may be more suitable for agricul-
ture. Although National Grassland acreage in the
northcentral region of the Forest Service represents
only about 5% of that agency's land base, it also
represents the majority of the native prairie remain-
ing in this region of North and South Dakota (Knowles
and Knowles 1994).
Currently, with the exception of some areas of the
northwestern portion of the black-tailed prairie dog's
range, conversion of prairie to agricultural cropland
has lessened. This is because much of the arable land
is already in cultivation or has been converted to non-
native grasses for forage. Municipal and industrial
development probably account for most of the present
losses to native prairies in the United States. While
these losses are minor compared with those that
occurred during settlement of this country, they con-
tinue to reduce habitat availability for prairie dogs
and other species.
ERADICATION OR CONTROL EFFORTS
Eradication efforts have been carried out against
prairie dogs on a very large scale, affecting several
million ha of land (Anderson et al. 1986; Bell 1921).
Clark (1979) reported that in some years prairie dogs
were intentionally poisoned on more than 8 million
ha in the United States. During the early 1980s, 185,600
ha of prairie dogs were eradicated on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation in South Dakota (Hanson 1988;
Sharps 1988). In 1986 and 1987, a South Dakota black-
tailed prairie dog complex of 110,000 ha was de-
stroyed, eliminating the largest remaining complex
in the United States (Tschetter 1988).
Virtually every federal land management agency
has been involved in this effort. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service used compound 1080 until its ban in
1972. In 1976, this agency approved the use of zinc
phosphide as a prairie dog control agent, hoping to
avoid secondary poisoning of nontarget species while
maintaining its prairie dog poisoning program. It is
estimated that permitting activities by both the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency and the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service account for the an-
nual poisoning of 80,000 ha of prairie dogs in the
United States (Captive Breeding Specialist Group
1992). Much of this effort occurs on federally-owned
and managed land, despite the fact that less than 5%
of the United States beef weight is produced on these
lands (United States General Accounting Off ice 1988).
Most poisoning on federal land is due to private land
concerns, not necessarily federal forage concerns.
The legal designation indicating the regulatory
status of the black-tailed prairie dog varies among the
10 states in which it still occurs. In four states the
species is designated a legal agricultural pest, with
some level of either state or local mandatory controls
in effect. This includes statewide legislation mandat-
ing control of prairie dogs in Wyoming. In Colorado,
Kansas, and South Dakota, state legislation allows
counties or townships to mandate controls on land-
owners. In 1995, Nebraska repealed their long-stand-
ing legislation that mandated statewide control,
thereby joining the states of Montana, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas, where control
is not mandatory but assistance may be provided to
landowners who believe they have a prairie dog
population problem that requires control.
PRAIRIE DOG SHOOTING
Shooting of prairie dogs, either for recreation or
to reduce or control their numbers, is widespread
across the range of all species in the United States.
20
The impact this activity has on overall populations
remains unclear, but preliminary monitoring results
by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Mon-
tana indicate that some level of shooting might im-
pact the growth and expansion of prairie dog colo-
nies (Reading et al. 1989). Fox and Knowles (1995)
suggested that persistent unregulated shooting over
a broad area of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation
in Montana might have significantly influenced prai-
rie dog populations. However, they further con-
cluded that it would require approximately one rec-
reational day of shooting for every 6 ha of prairie dogs
to result in such an impact. This level of shooting
pressure is unlikely over the hundreds of thousands
of ha of currently occupied range.
SYLVATIC PLAGUE
Prairie dogs have coexisted with a variety of
predators for many centuries on the plains and have
adapted means of persisting in spite of this preda-
tion. However, a more recent threat has arrived to
which the prairie dog has no adaptive protection. A
flea-borne bacterium, the sylvatic plague, was intro-
duced into North America just before the turn of the
century. First discovered in black-tailed prairie dogs
in Texas in the 1940s (Cully 1989), small rodents such
as prairie dogs apparently have no natural immunity
to the plague, which now occurs virtually through-
out the range of the black-tailed prairie dog.
The impacts of plague are more adverse than just
the killing of many individuals. The plague persists in
a colony resulting in a longer population recovery
time than is common in colonies that have been
poisoned (figure 1). Four years following impact,
plague-killed colonies on the Rocky Mountain Arse-
nal National Wildlife Refuge had recovered to only
40%, while poisoned colonies had recovered to over
90% (Knowles 1986). Knowles and Knowles (1994)
suggested that prairie dogs have survived the intro-
duction of this disease simply due to their large,
highly dispersed populations. Further reductions in
these populations could make prairie dogs much
more susceptible to local or regional extirpations due
to the plague.

HISTORIC AND CURRENT STATUS
Rangewide
Seton (1929) estimated that in the early part of this
century, there may have been 5 billion prairie dogs in
North America. Around that time, prairie dog colo-
nies were estimated to occupy 40 million to 100
million ha of prairie in North America, but by 1960
this area was reduced to approximately 600,000 ha
(Anderson et al. 1986; Marsh 1984). These estimates
result in the often-cited figure of a 98% decline in
population among the five species of prairie dog. So,
while the black-tailed prairie dog still occurs in all but
one of the states in its historic range, significant
reductions in its total colony area have taken place
rangewide.

PRAIRIE DOG STATUS IN EACH STATE
Current status information was solicited from
state and federal agencies and from tribal authorities
in all eleven states in the historic range of the black-
tailed prairie dog (table 1). The following summary
provides updated status and population data for
those states.
Arizona
The Arizona Game and Fish Department (Duane
L. Shroufe, Director, in litt. 1995) confirms that the
black-tailed prairie dog, in the form of the Arizona
subspecies C ludovicianus arizonensis, is extirpated
from the state. However, it still occurs nearby in
Mexico and New Mexico. Arizona still supports
populations of Gunnison's prairie dogs.
Colorado
On the Comanche and Pawnee National Grass-
lands, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently estimates
a total of 2,455 ha of active prairie dogs, compared
with 910 ha from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck 1982). This
represents more than a doubling in area, but also
represents only 0.5% of the area available on these
public lands. Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site
contains 325 ha of black-tailed prairie dogs (NPS, in
litt.). Fort Carson and surrounding private lands
contain approximately 1,620 ha, Pinyon Canyon less
than 810 ha of prairie dogs (FWS, in litt.). The Rocky
Mountain Arsenal NWR (FWS, in litt.) prairie dog
population declined from 1,850 ha to 100 ha between
1988 and 1989, due to plague. Burnett (1918) esti-
mated that three combined species of prairie dog
occupied 5,665,720 ha in Colorado in the early 1900s.
Based on geographic distribution of black-tailed,
white-tailed, and Gunnison's prairie dogs in the state,
it may be assumed that black-tailed prairie dogs
accounted for approximately half this figure. There is
no reliable estimate of the total area occupied by
black-tailed prairie dogs statewide at this time.
Kansas
The National Park Service (in litt.) reports ap-
proximately 16 ha of prairie dogs at the Fort Larned
National Historic Site. On the Cimarron National
Grassland, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently esti-
mates 440 ha of active prairie dog colonies compared
with 20 ha estimated from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck
1982). This represents more than a twenty-fold in-
crease on this 44,000-ha area, yet still only 1% of the
total area of the Grassland. Both Lee and Henderson
(1988) and Powell and Robel (1994) reported that
selected counties had reductions of 84% since the
beginning of the century (Lantz 1903, cited in Lee and
Henderson 1988). A survey completed in 1992
22
(Vanderhoof et al. 1994) estimates 18,845 ha of prairie
dogs in Kansas, just over 2% of the 810,000 ha esti-
mated by Lantz (1903) some 90 years ago.
Montana
Flath and Clark (1986) estimated that black-tailed
prairie dogs occupied 595,000 ha of land in Montana
from 1908 to 1914. Estimated prairie dog occupied
area by the early 1980s had declined to 50,600 ha
(Flath and Clark 1986) and subsequent estimates
show further declines in prairie dogs (40,500 ha,
Campbell 1986; 35,545 ha, FaunaWest Wildlife Con-
sultants 1995). This most recent estimate indicates a
statewide reduction in occupied area of approxi-
mately 94% since the early 1900s.
Nebraska
On the Oglala National Grassland and Nebraska
National Forest, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently
estimates 105 ha of active prairie dog colonies, com-
pared with 145 ha estimated from 1978 to 1980
(Schenbeck 1982). Current estimates represent 1.4%
of land available. In 1973, prairie dog occupied area in
Nebraska was estimated at 6,075 ha (Lock 1973). By
1982, this figure had increased to an estimated 32,400
ha (Frank Andelt, Nebraska Game and Parks Com-
mission, cited in FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants
1995). By 1989, prairie dogs statewide occupied ap-
proximately 24,415 ha (Kevin Church, Nebraska Game
and Parks Commission, in litt.). Plague and increased
eradication efforts, resulting from state legislation
mandating prairie dog control, have reduced this
figure significantly since the 1980s, with less than
0.22% of the Nebraska landscape currently occupied
by the species (FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants 1995).
Historic estimates are unavailable.
New Mexico
The BLM (in litt.) reports that prairie dogs may be
extirpated from several sites, with only 140 ha re-
maining on BLM land in the state. The White Sands
Missile Range (Department of Army, in litt.) contains
just over 300 ha of prairie dogs. Around 1919 the area
in New Mexico occupied by prairie dogs, both
Gunnison's and black-tailed (including C. /.
arizonensis), was approximately 4,838,460 ha, but was
estimated to have been reduced to 201,220 ha by 1980
(Hubbards and Schmitt 1984). This is a 96% reduc-
tion. Hubbards and Schmitt (1984) further estimated
that the range of the black-tailed prairie dog in New
Mexico has been reduced by one-fourth, primarily
from the range of arizonensis.
North Dakota
Theodore Roosevelt National Park reportedly
contains less than 360 ha of prairie dogs (NPS, in litt.),
approximately 1% of the total Park land area. There
are believed to be currently 2,690 ha of prairie dogs on
the 660,435 ha of Custer National Forest in North and
South Dakota (Forest Service, in litt.). This represents
0.4% prairie dog occupancy of these lands. The Forest
management plan calls for an occupancy level at or
around 2,225 ha. The North Dakota Game and Fish
Department (in litt.) reports approximately 8,300 ha
of prairie dogs statewide, which may be a reduction
of 90% or more from historic levels. In 1992, only six
complexes of over 400 ha were identified.
Oklahoma
The Department of the Army (in litt.) has no
current estimate of prairie dog areas on Fort Sill, but
report that they have declined markedly in the past
10 years. Shackford et al. (1990) reported a statewide
estimate of 3,850 ha in 1967, increasing by 93% to
7,440 ha in 1989.
South Dakota
On the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre National
Grasslands, the Forest Service (in litt.) estimates 3,025
ha of active prairie dog colonies and an additional
2,600 ha of colonies are subject to periodic rodenti-
cide treatments. This compares to 17,600 ha esti-
mated from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck 1982). The 500,285
ha Black Hills National Forest and Custer and Elk
Mountain Ranger Districts currently support 53 ha of
prairie dogs. In the early 1920s there may have been
711,000 ha of prairie dogs statewide (FaunaWest
Wildlife Consultants 1995). The South Dakota Ani-
mal Damage Control office currently estimates 80,000
to 100,000 ha of active prairie dog colonies in the state;
the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates 65,000 ha of
these on tribal lands (Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, in
litt.). These estimates suggest at least an 86% decline
in prairie dog occupied area across the state. Bad-
23
lands and Wind Cave National Parks currently con-
tain 1,660 and 3,085 ha of prairie dogs, respectively
(NPS, in litt.). These numbers represent 2 and 4%,
respectively, of the area available on these public
lands.
Texas
There were an estimated 31,385 ha of prairie dogs
in northwest Texas in 1973 (Cheatham 1973). In 1991,
there were at least 12,145 ha of prairie dogs estimated
in Texas (Peggy Horner, Texas Parks and Wildlife, in
litt.). Comparing this with a statewide historic esti-
mate of 23,000,000 ha (Merriam 1902) results in a
decline of over 99% in this century.
Wyoming
On Thunder Basin National Grassland, the For-
est Service (in litt.) currently estimates 1,500 ha of
active prairie dog colonies, with an additional 4,900
ha subject to periodic rodenticide treatment. Colony
area for the period 1978 to 1980 was reported to be
2,550 ha (Schenbeck 1982). These numbers represent
0.6% of this 231,500 ha public grassland area. Devil's
Tower National Monument contains approximately
16 ha of black-tailed prairie dogs (NPS, in litt.); 3% of
the area available. Black-tailed prairie dogs in Wyo-
ming may have increased in abundance near the turn
of the century as a result of sheep and cattle grazing,
with an estimated 53,650 ha by 1971 (Clark 1973).
However, Campbell and Clark (1981) estimated a
75% reduction in prairie dog occupied areas since
1915. Current estimates indicate between 53,000 and
82,590 ha statewide (Wyoming Game and Fish De-
partment, cited in Fauna West Wildlife Consultants
1995).
SUMMARY OF PRAIRIE DOG
STATUS IN EACH STATE
FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants (1995) attempted
to estimate the amount of land area within the range
of the black-tailed prairie dog that is currently occu-
pied by the species. They included seven Great Plains
states in their analysis and concluded that the states
have less than a 1 % occupancy of land surface within
the species' range. The states included in this assess-
ment and the percent of prairie dog occupancy within
available area are Colorado (0.35%), Kansas (0.14%),
Montana (0.17%), Nebraska (0.22%), North Dakota
(0.17%),South Dakota (0.80%),andWyoming(0.60 to
0.88%).
While these individual state accounts do not rep-
resent an exhaustive rangewide status review, they
unfortunately provide the best information avail-
able. Significant reductions in occupied area have
and continue to occur throughout the species' range;
losses in some places exceeded 95%. Although the
species still occurs in all but one state in its historic
range, the eastern boundary of this distribution may
be receding to the west. Figures indicate that there
may be more than 550,000 ha of occupied black-tailed
prairie dog range remaining in the United States,
which is consistent with the estimate of 600,000 ha
(Marsh 1984) cited previously. Over half the known
prairie dog acreage in the central and northern Great
Plains occurs on private land, almost 30% is on Indian
reservations, and about 6% each occurs on Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management property
(figure 2, FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants 1995).
Neither Park Service nor Fish and Wildlife Service
lands support significant acreage of any prairie dog
species.
There is a need to develop a standardized survey
technique for assessing prairie dog status. Presently,
two methods are commonly employed and both
involve mapping of individual prairie dog colonies
either by ground reconnaissance or from aerial photo
interpretation. Both methods are time consuming
and expensive, making it unreasonable to expect a
survey of over 500,000 ha of prairie dog colonies on
the Great Plains within a short time period. Prairie
dog colonies represent clumped patches on a broad
landscape and there already exist nonmapping tech-
niques that might be capable of statistical sampling of
this distribution (Marcum and Loftsgaarden 1980). A
statistical approach to monitoring prairie dog colony
acreage may be a more appropriate technique than
trying to map all prairie dog colonies.
PRAIRIE DOGS AND LIVESTOCK
Efforts to eradicate the prairie dog by the live-
stock and agricultural industry have existed for most
of this century. Merriam (1902) estimated that prairie
dogs caused a 50 to 75% reduction in range produc-
tivity. Taylor and Loftfield (1924) concluded that the
prairie dogis "one of the most injurious rodents of the
24

and central Great Plains.
southwest and plains regions," and results in "the
removal of vegetation in its entirety from the vicin-
ity." Reports such as these were largely responsible
for the escalating effort by range managers on the
Great Plains to eradicate the prairie dog.
The conflict between the livestock industry and
the prairie dog will likely not end easily or quickly,
despite reports that prairie dog foraging does not
significantly affect weight gain of cattle (O'Meilia et
al. 1982; Hansen and Gold 1977). Others have re-
ported the beneficial effects of prairie dogs on long-
term range condition, including increased plant spe-
cies diversity, richness, and overall plant production
in prairie dog colonies (Archer et al. 1987; Uresk and
Bjugstad 1983; Bonham and Lerwick 1976; Gold 1976).
Uresk (1985) demonstrated that up to four years
following prairie dog control, plant production was
not increased whether the range was grazed or
ungrazed by cattle.
Conversely, Hanson and Gold (1977) reported
dietary overlap between cattle and prairie dogs, sug-
gesting there may be some competition for the same
species of forage plants. An estimation of true compe-
tition would be dependent on a variety of factors,
including density of prairie dogs, stocking rate of
cattle, ground cover, forage species present, and oth-
ers (Uresk and Paulson 1988). Collins et al. (1984)
reported that the annual cost of prairie dog poisoning
was higher than the annual value of the forage gained
by these measures. This issue requires more study,
with input from both sides of the debate.
PRAIRIE DOGS AND BIODIVERSITY
The prairie dog, an integral component of the
shortgrass prairie biotic community, is capable of
transforming its own landscape and creating habitat
alterations on a scale surpassed only by humans on
the Great Plains. The ecosystem that is maintained by
the prairie dog is valuable to many other species, with
over 100 species of vertebrate wildlife reportedly
using prairie dog colonies as habitat (Sharps and
Uresk 1990; Clark et al. 1989; Reading et al. 1989).
While few of these species are critically dependent on
prairie dogs for all their life requisites, the increased
biodiversity associated with prairie dog colonies in-
dicates the importance of this habitat. Agnew et al.
(1986) reported greater avian densities and species
richness on prairie dog colonies. Also, numerous
researchers have documented the preferential feed-
ing of wild and domestic ungulates on prairie dog
colonies (Coppock et al. 1983; Detling and Whicker
1987; Knowles 1986; Krueger 1986; Wydeven and
Dahlgren 1985).
25
A number of rare and declining species are asso-
ciated with prairie dogs and the habitat they provide.
The black-footed ferret, Mustek nigripes Audubon
and Bachman, 1851, is considered a true prairie dog
obligate because it requires the prairie dog ecosystem
for its survival. As one of the most endangered mam-
mals in North America, this species has come to
symbolize the decline in native grassland biodiversity.
At least two species that are candidates for listing
under the Endangered Species Act are also associated
to a lesser degree with prairie dogs. The mountain
plover, Charadrius montanus Townsend, 1837, and the
swift fox, Vulpes velox Say, 1823, are attracted to the
vegetative changes and possibly increased food avail-
ability in prairie dog colonies. The association of
other species that are either declining or vulnerable
indicate the problems facing this habitat.
CONSERVATION EFFORTS
Prairie dogs are managed either directly or indi-
rectly within the survey area by at least six federal
agencies, 11 state wildlife departments, state agricul-
ture departments, departments of state lands, and
numerous weed and pest districts, counties and pri-
vate landowners. Prairie dog management goals and
objectives vary significantly among these entities.
Even management within agencies but between ar-
eas varies significantly. This variation can range from
total protection of prairie dogs to a legal mandate to
exterminate. All states have simultaneously classified
the prairie dog as a pest and as wildlife, often with
opposing management goals. Federal policy regard-
ing prairie dogs has been inconsistent over time and
across geographic regions. The legal mechanisms
responsible for the decline of prairie dogs during this
century are still intact. Restoration of the prairie dog
ecosystem may not be possible without major changes
in management policy.
At least two federal agencies have taken the ini-
tiative to begin to address the problems associated
with declining prairie dog occupied areas and to
involve other interested parties. The Forest Service
initiated a working group comprised of various fed-
eral land and resource agencies throughout the north-
ern states in the Great Plains, involving the Bureau of
Land Management, Park Service, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, and Fish and Wildlife Service. The function of
this group is to encourage development of conserva-
tion assessments and strategies for the species across
broad landscapes.
In January 1995, the Fish and Wildlife Service
convened a meeting of federal, state, and nongovern-
mental entities to discuss problems facing the short-
grass prairie ecosystem, including the prairie dog as
a focal species. Consensus recommendations were: 1)
Fish and Wildlife Service will develop conservation
strategies to keep prairie species from becoming listed
under the Endangered Species Act and to recover
declining species before a listing occurs; and 2) work
with the Western Governor's Association to investi-
gate ways to coordinate and communicate with all
involved parties on prairie issues. The Fish and Wild-
life Service recognizes that prairie dog management
remains within the jurisdiction of the various state
and federal land management agencies. Therefore,
this agency is particularly interested in participating
in cooperative agreements with other agencies so
that the prairie dog may be managed as a wildlife
species rather than simply controlled as a pest.
CONCLUSION
The black-tailed prairie dog does not appear to be
in danger of becoming extinct in the foreseeable
future, given current management. However, the
additional negative impacts resulting from habitat
fragmentation (Wilcox and Murphy 1985) could seri-
ously impact the ability of some prairie dog popula-
tions to persist or become re-established. Habitat
fragmentation adversely quickly affects highly spe-
cialized species (Miller et al. 1994) and the myriad of
species associated with prairie dog colonies recover
from habitat or population losses at different rates.
This could result in a significant disruption of the
ecosystem overall functioning, further delaying its
recovery. Such effects are already evident for the
endangered black-footed ferret. The future recovery
or extinction of this species is inextricably entwined
with the decisions resource managers make today
regarding the conservation of the prairie dog ecosys-
tem.
Management of the black-tailed prairie dog must
give greater consideration to developing an abun-
dance and distribution of prairie dogs that will en-
sure long-term population persistence of associated
26
species. As a minimum, we believe that broad areas of
suitable grasslands should bave from 1 to 3% of the
area occupied by prairie dogs. Federally-owned lands
should assume a greater share of this responsibility,
with a goal of from 5 to 10% occupancy by prairie
dogs. Maintaining this level of occupancy may allow
resource managers to determine what actually con-
stitutes a functioning prairie dog ecosystem, so at-
tempts may be made to preserve this system into the
future.

The Role of Fire in Managing
for Biological Diversity on Native Rangelands
of the Northern Great Plains
Carolyn Hull Sieg1
Abstract.—A strategy for using fire to manage for biological
diversity on native rangelands in the Northern Great Plains
incorporates an understanding of its past frequency, timing and
intensity. Historically, lightning and humans were the major fire
setters, and the role of fire varied both in space and time. A
burning regime that includes fires at various intervals, seasons
and intensities, including midsummer burns, should be rein-
stated. However, burning to enhance rare systems and species
and to discourage exotic species is also needed. The goal is to
base plans on an understanding of historic processes and
ecosystem interactions, and resist techniques that rely on
unexamined conventions.
INTRODUCTION
"A common thread runs through the many defi-
nitions of biological diversity: variety of life and its
processes in a given area" (Salwasser 1990). A man-
agement strategy for conserving biological diversity
of any natural ecosystem must focus on saving all the
components, including the structure, composition
(including genetic diversity), and processes that char-
acterize these systems (Kaufmann et al. 1994). Bio-
logical diversity is more than just the identifiable
parts; it also includes the symbioses and synergisms
that make nature work (Salwasser 1990).
The importance of disturbances in shaping native
communities has recently received more attention.
Ecosystems are dynamic entities whose patterns and
processes are shaped and sustained on the landscape
by successional processes and by abiotic disturbances
such as fire, drought, and wind. To sustain these
ecosystems, processes that characterize the variabil-
ity found in native ecosystems should be present and

functioning, and management activities should con-
serve or restore historic disturbance patterns
(Kaufmann et al. 1994). This paper describes a strat-
egy for managing biological diversity of rangelands
on the Northern Great Plains. The approach is based
on restoring historical disturbance processes given
the significantly altered landscape patterns of today.
Plant nomenclature follows Great Plains Flora Asso-
ciation (1986) (table 1).
SETTING
The Northern Great Plains region includes North
Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska, plus the eastern
portions of Montana and Wyoming, and extends
northward into Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The climate of the region is characterized by an
increase in precipitation and humidity and a de-
crease in periodic droughts during the summer from
west to east (Risser 1990). This climate range influ-
ences not only the potential native vegetation but
also the fire regime and effects. The shortgrass prairie
on the Western and Southern portions of the region
is the most arid type; the mixed-grass prairie occurs in
the midsection of the region; and the tallgrass prairie
on the Eastern edge receives the most precipitation
(Risser etal. 1981).
The variation in precipitation across the region
greatly influences the growth and expansion of woody
plants. In the most Western portion of the region, big
sagebrush occupies uplands; in the absence of fire it
persists or expands (Wright and Bailey 1982). In the
remainder of the shortgrass and mixed-grass por-
tions of the region, woody plants are restricted to
areas of increased elevation, such as the Black Hills, or
to areas of increased moisture such as riparian zones,
draws, and north-facing slopes. Escarpments, ridges,
and outcrops in the Western portion support ponde-
rosa pine and Rocky Mountain juniper (Wells 1965).

Woody draws (narrow woodlands occurring in
ravines) are examples of communities in more arid
portions of the region that are restricted to sites with
grea ter soil moisture. The most common woody plants
in these draws are green ash and chokecherry. Ripar-
ian zones along streams and rivers support plains
cottonwood, willows, and dwarf sagebrush (Severson
and Boldt 1978). These woodlands may also expand
in the absence of fire, but the expansion is restricted
to sites with adequate moisture and the expansion
rate is slower than in the tallgrass region. Further,
many deciduous species, such as chokecherry and
willows, sprout vigorously following burning (Wright
and Bailey 1982). Only very frequent fires (i.e., every
1 to 5 years) would favor grasses over these species.
In contrast to more arid portions of the region,
mesic prairies in the Northern, Eastern and South-
eastern portions of the region are characterized by
precipitation amounts high enough to support the
expansion of woody plants onto uplands. It is in these
areas that frequent fires slow the expansionof woody
plants on uplands (Bragg and Hulbert 1976). In the
Northern portion of the region, aspen replaces pon-
derosa pine on outcrops and expands into the Cana-
dian prairies (Wright and Bailey 1982). Eastern red
cedar replaces Rocky Mountain juniper in the South-
eastern part of the region where it readily expands
onto uplands (Gehring and Bragg 1992). In the east-
ern tallgrass prairies, woody species, such as willows
and bur oak, invade grasslands, and only frequent
fires slow their expansion (Anderson 1990). Plains
cottonwood and willow dominate floodplains in the
more mesic portions of the Northern Great Plains;
green ash and bur oak are common on higher terraces
along major rivers (Johnson et al. 1976).
In addition to climatic factors, herbivores also
influence the region's vegetation and fire regimes.
However, it is difficult to distinguish the particular
influence each force has on vegetation (Henderson
and Statz 1995). Fire is often associated with periodic
drought, and fire and grazing are sometimes interre-
lated. For example, recently burned grasslands often
attract grazers; yet, heavily grazed areas usually re-
sist fire until dead litter reaccumulates (Steuter et al.
1990, Vinton et al. 1993). Therefore, the influences of
grazing and drought must be a part of a discussion of
historical fire effects (Henderson and Statz 1995).
FIRE HISTORY
An understanding of the frequency, timing, and
intensities of past fires is necessary before fire can be
incorporated into a strategy to conserve prairie sys-
tems. Based on data from adjoining ponderosa pine
forests, which indicated that fire frequency varied
from 2 to 25 years, Wright and Bailey (1982) estimate
that on level-to-rolling topography, a fire frequency
of 5 to 10 years in the Northern Great Plains is
reasonable. On topography more dissected with
breaks and rivers, they estimate a fire frequency of 20
to 30 years. Wendtland and Dodd (1992) agree with
this range, based on their examination of historical
documents and fire records from the Scotts Bluff
Na tional Monument area in northwestern Nebraska.
Dendrochronology data in the Devils Tower region
northwest of the Black Hills reveal that before 1770
the mean interval between fires was 27 years; from
1770 to 1900 the fire return interval was 14 years
(Fisher et al. 1987). Brown and Sieg (1996) report a
mean fire frequency in the south-central Black Hills
of 16 years for the period 1388 to 1918.
32
In the more mesic portions of the Northern Great
Plains, the average fire return interval was shorter.
Collins and Gibson (1990) estimate a frequency of
every 1 to 5 years in the tallgrass portions of this
region. In northcentral Nebraska, the fire return in-
terval averaged 3.5 years between 1851 and 1900
(Bragg 1985).
Historically, the major ignition sources for prairie
fires were lightning and American Indians. Light-
ning was, and is, an important ignition source in the
Northern Great Plains. In northwestern South Da-
kota, lightning-set fires occur an average of 6 to 25
times per year, and most commonly occur in July and
August (Higgins 1984); fewer occur in April, May,
June, and September. Wendtland and Dodd (1992)
note that of 10 fires described in historical documents
between 1824 and 1934, and of 26 fires officially
recorded between 1934 and 1969 in the Scotts Bluff
National Monument area, over 70 percent occurred
in July and August.
Higgins' (1986) review of 300 historical accounts
written between 1673 and 1920 reveals that fires
accidentally or intentionally set by American Indians
were common in the Northern Great Plains. He found
that although Indians set fires in nearly every month
of the year, April, September and October were their
peak fire-setting times. The majority of the 97 fires
described were scattered, single events of short dura-
tion and small extent; only 10 fires burned longer
than 1 day.
American Indians had many uses for fire. These
included attracting and herding wild animals, signal-
ing threats and warnings, improving pasturage, mask-
ing and eliminating personal signs at camps and
along trails, and for pleasure, warfare and ceremo-
nies (Higgins 1986). During their 10,000-year occupa-
tion of this region, the timing of fires set by American
Indians did not mirror lightning-set fires; therefore,
these Indian-set fires can be considered additive to
lightning fires (Higgins 1986).
A combination of periodic droughts, high tem-
peratures and strong winds in the region provide the
components necessary for fire spread (Collins 1990).
The end result of the erratic climate, flammable fuels,
topographic relief and other factors, such as grazing
animals, was that the role of fire was not constant in
time or space (Anderson 1990).
With the arrival of non-native settlers came fire
suppression policies and, in many areas, a shift in the
timing of fires. Near Devils Tower, Wyoming, after
1900, the fire return interval increased to every 42
years, versus less than every 27 years previously
(Fisher et al. 1987). In the south-central Black Hills,
Brown and Sieg (1996) record a 104-year fire-free
period in ponderosa pine stands between 1890 and
1994, and note that most of past fires occurred late in
the growing season or after growth had ceased for the
year. Higgins (1984) suggests that the recent extent
and spread of lightning fires has been modified by
cultural features such as roads; further, the fire re-
gime has also been altered by differing patterns of
grazing animals (first bison, then cattle). In contrast to
the late summer ignitions that commonly burned
before 1935 near Scotts Bluff, Nebraska, the 46 fires
recorded since 1935 dramatically shifted to spring
occurrences (Wendtland and Dodd 1992). Lengthen-
ing the interval between fires, shifting from summer
to early spring burning, and/or reducing fire inten-
sity by prescribing cooler fires may alter species com-
position to favor fire-intolerant species (Wendtland
and Dodd 1992) such as cactus and non-sprouting
woody species like sagebrush (Wright and Bailey
1982).
DEVELOPING A FIRE MANAGEMENT
STRATEGY TO CONSERVE DIVERSITY
The fire strategy most likely to manage diversity
on native rangelands of the Northern Great Plains is
based on two premises: 1) processes that mimic, as
much as possible, the variability found in native
ecosystems should be present and functioning; and
2) management activities should conserve or restore
historical disturbance patterns (Kauf mann et al. 1994).
This management strategy should reflect the differ-
ing roles that fire historically played in the various
portions of the region. However, this strategy must
also address the fundamental changes that have oc-
curred in the landscape such as drastically different
landscape patterns imposed by species changes and
management unit boundaries.
Wendtland and Dodd (1992) recommend a sce-
nario that mimics the presettlement fire history. For
the Scotts Bluff, Nebraska area, they infer this strat-
egy including high intensity summer fires on a return
interval of 5 to 30 years. Shifting burning programs
from all spring or fall burns to include some mid-
summer burns should favor some species not en-
hanced by spring or fall burns (Howe 1994). For
33
example, an April fire burns early foliage critical for
root production of cool-season plants, leaving late-
season plants unscathed; an August fire burns the
largely inactive foliage of cool-season species, while
consuming foliage and reproductive stems of warm-
season species (Howe 1994). However, historically,
fires occurring after fuels have cured in the fall or in
the early spring before green-up may have been
more significant than summer fires. High fuel mois-
ture in July and August and concurrent slow rates of
spread result in a smaller area being burned by an
individual fire, compared to those fires occurring
when fuels are cured in the fall (Steuter 1988). Given
the highly variable fire regime in the past, burns of
varying intensities at differing seasons are appropri-
ate. Further, the interval between fires should be
varied to best restore fire disturbance patterns of the
Northern Great Plains. The strategy should avoid a
uniformity in timing of burns or in intervals between
burns that artificially simplifies what was probably a
more complex system (Howe 1994).
SPECIAL HABITATS AND
SENSITIVE SPECIES
Reinstituting a fire regime based on historical
processes that includes burning at varying intervals
and in differing seasons is the first step in developing
a strategy for using fire to manage biological diversity
on native rangelands in this region. The second step
involves assessing the direct and indirect impacts of
fire on special habitats and sensitive species. Special
habitats are native biological communities or ecosys-
tems that are rare, unique, or highly productive ele-
ments of regional landscapes (Salwasser 1990). Sensi-
tive species include those native species currently in
danger of extinction or those whose population trends
are negatively affected by human actions (Salwasser
1990). The burning strategy should also consider the
potentially different historical fire disturbance re-
gimes in these sensitive ecosystems, minimize poten-
tial negative influences of fire, and maximize condi-
tions favorable to the expansion of these systems and
species.
The special habitats in the Northern Great Plains
(wetlands, lowlands, and riparian areas) contain high
numbers of listed vulnerable species (Finch 1992,
Finch and Ruggiero 1993). Although each of these
habitats constitutes a relatively small percentage of
the total land area, each contributes disproportion-
ately to the diversity of native rangelands in this
region (Finch and Ruggiero 1993). If sensitive com-
munities such as these occur within a management
unit, burning programs should be examined relative
to their impacts on these habitats. The range in fre-
quency, timing, and intensity of burns suitable to
upland habitats may not provide optimum condi-
tions for sustaining these distinctive systems.
Wetlands, lowlands, and riparian woodlands in
this region are examples of communities that, be-
cause of higher moisture, likely burned less frequently
than uplands. Riparian zones throughout the region,
and woody draws in the more arid portions, tend to
be green throughout most of the growing season,
have higher relative humidities than adjacent grass-
lands, and often have running water or moist soils
that slow the spread of fire into these communities. In
most years, prairie fires would skip over or only burn
lightly through these narrow woodlands (Severson
and Boldt 1978). However, the narrow configuration
and close contact of these woodlands with flammable
grassland fuels suggest that historically they were
exposed to a high number of grassland fires. Fire
inevitably entered these woodlands, especially in dry
years on hot and windy days.
Given that the species composition in woody
draws includes a number of deciduous species, such
as snowberry and chokecherry, that sprout following
burning (Wright and Bailey 1982), and that several
woody species establish best in mineral soils, fire
probably functioned as a regeneration mechanism in
these systems. Further, since these communities stay
green longer than uplands, fires probably burned
late in the growing season when there were adequate
levels of cured, fine fuel. Repeated, annual fires,
especially during droughts, tend to favor the growth
of grasses over woody plants (Wright and Bailey
1982). Fires occurring infrequently when plants are
dormant, followed by high precipitation, may en-
hance woody plant growth (Wright and Bailey 1982,
Sieg 1991). If the goal is to regenerate woody plants in
woody draws and/or to mimic historical fires, pre-
scriptions should be set to achieve high intensities
(Sieg 1996).
Rocky Mountain juniper woodlands are an ex-
ample of a relatively uncommon community in the
Western portion of the Northern Great Plains that
rarely burned. In this region, Rocky Mountain juni-
per grows best on steep barren slopes (Noble 1990)
where the sparse understory vegetation is rarely
34
adequate to sustain a fire. In areas where fine fuels are
sufficient to carry a fire, the high volatile oil content
of the foliage combined with Rocky Mountain
juniper's inability to sprout following topkilling, re-
sults in high mortality rates (Wright and Bailey 1982).
Threatened or endangered species are examples
of sensitive species whose needs cannot be ignored.
Because they are the first species to drop out of
ecosystems, they are considered the weakest link in
the conservation of native biological diversity (Finch
and Ruggiero 1993). Providing habitats in an appro-
priate spatial and temporal arrangement is necessary
to maintain viable populations of sensitive species.
Thus, vegetation management is a major tool for
maintaining and restoring biodiversity, and for
delisting or avoiding listing of threatened and en-
dangered species (Kaufmann etal. 1994).
Adjusting fire management programs to meet the
needs of threatened and endangered species requires
an understanding of the role of fire in the long-term
sustainability of the ecosystems supporting these
species, and in the life history and habitat needs of
individual species. For example, the western prairie
fringed orchid is a federally listed threatened plant
species associated with swales (low-lying often wet
land) of the tallgrass prairie (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1989). Although the tallgrass prairie is prone
to burn every 1 to 5 years (Collins and Gibson 1990),
it is unlikely that swales supporting orchids burned
as often, especially during years when they were
flooded. Vogl (1969) describes a "quasi-equilibrium"
of a Wisconsin lowland maintained by floods during
wet periods and fires during droughts. Lowlands
supporting orchid populations likely burned through-
out the growing season during prolonged droughts;
however, fires that occur when orchids are actively
growing are apt to injure or kill them. Since fall
burning allows orchids to complete their life cycle,
and dry conditions and lightning are inclined to
occur late in the growing season, fall fires are a better
choice than spring burning to sustain orchid popula-
tions and their associated habitat (Bjugstad-Porter
1993).
MANAGE INTRODUCED SPECIES
The introduction of exotic species to new envi-
ronments without their associated parasites and pests
may be humankind's greatest environmental ma-
nipulation (Young and Evans 1976). Many invasive
exotic species have characteristics that enable them to
vigorously compete with native plants and to exploit
disturbed areas (Parker et al. 1993). In addition to
reviewing impacts of existing non-native species and
preventing the introduction of new ones (Kaufmann
et al. 1994), management plans should address how
to manage these species; fire is a useful tool in this
arena. Problem species include those purposely
planted, such as smooth brome, and a variety of
species accidentally introduced, such as cheatgrass,
Japanese brome, and leafy spurge (Lym 1991).
Although burning is not a panacea for discourag-
ing introduced species, with careful planning it can
be a useful tool, especially if native species are not
adversely affected. Burning at a time when plants are
most vulnerable is useful for suppressing undesir-
able species. For example, burning in mid-or late
May, when smooth brome tillers are either elongat-
ing or heading, reduces tiller density of smooth brome
by 50 percent when compared to unburned plots in
Nebraska (Willson 1992). Burning in May also en-
hances production of flowering culms of some native
warm-season grasses such as big bluestem (Willson
1992). However, burning is not a cure-all for reduc-
ing persistent species such as smooth brome, and the
outcome is strongly dependent on other factors such
as climate and precipitation patterns. Subsequent
burning in Pipestone, Minnesota failed to signifi-
cantly reduce smooth tiller density (Willson and
Stubbendieck 1996).
In addition to killing or injuring individual exotic
plants, burning can be used to make the habitat less
conducive to a species expansion. Spring burning in
western South Dakota killed Japanese brome seed-
lings for one growing season, and by reducing litter
accumulations, decreased future germination rates
(Whisendnt and Uresk 1990). In this case, spring
burning was detrimental to the production of one
native species, green needlegrass; enhanced produc-
tion of two others, buffalo grass and sand dropseed;
and did not change the production of a fourth,
threadleaf sedge (Whisenant and Uresk 1990).
A combination of burning and other manage-
ment tools may be valuable in managing invasive
species. For example, picloram plus 2,4-D applied in
the fall followed by spring burning reduced the stem
density and germination rates of leafy spurge in
North Dakota more than any other treatment tested
(Wolters et al. 1994). The key to success in managing
invasive species is to begin treatment before expan-
35
sive spread occurs and to focus as much as possible on
the invaded ecosystem rather than on the invader
(Hobbs and Humphries 1995).

SUMMARY
A strategy for using fire to manage native biologi-
cal diversity on rangelands in the Northern Great
Plains should consider natural disturbance patterns.
Fires historically occurred as often as every 1 to 5
years in the more mesic portions of the region, but
less frequently in areas of rough topography and in
lowlands. Lightning, a major ignition source in this
region, caused fires most often in July and August.
American Indians accidentally or intentionally set
fires in nearly every month of the year; however, the
greatest number were set in April, September, and
October. The end result of the erratic climate, fuels,
topographic relief and factors such as grazing ani-
mals, was that the role of fire was not constant in time
or space.
Reinstituting a fire regime based on historical
processes, including burning at varying intervals (to
reflect climatic patterns) and in differing seasons, is
the first step in developing a strategy for using fire to
manage for biological diversity on native rangelands
in this region. Including mid-summer burns, rather
than concentrating all prescribed burning in the spring
and fall, would better mimic natural disturbance
patterns. The second step involves adjusting fire
regimes to best sustain special habitats, such as wet-
lands and riparian zones, and sensitive species, espe-
cially threatened and endangered ones. Third, fire
prescriptions should be planned so that burning does
not enhance the spread of invasive species. The over-
all goal is to base the fire management strategy on an
understanding of historic processes and ecosystem
interactions, and resist techniques that rely on
unexamined conventions (Howe 1994).

The Role of Fire in Managing for Biological Diversity on Native
Rangelands of the Northern Great Plains 31
Carolyn Hull Sieg
Rangelands embody biological diversity of pro-
found ecological and social significance, yet it is the
biological diversity of forests and wetlands that has
been the focus of research by scientists and concern
by the public. Recently, a broad array of people, from
ecologists and biologists to ranchers and recreationists,
have begun to realize the importance of rangeland
conservation and biological diversity. Although these
groups may not always share a common vision of
rangelands, they share a common interest in the land
that will foster a better understanding and apprecia-
tion of the value of diverse and healthy rangelands.
Ranchers have long practiced conservation of range-
land biological diversity. Most recognize the impor-
tance of both warm and cool season grasses to round
out their forage programs, and many have noticed
that in some years one grass will do poorly while
another will thrive, thus balancing the production.
Ranchers depend on native grasses coming back on
their own after drought or a bad grasshopper year;
some species will return quicker than others. Looking
toward the future, ranchers manage their grass for a
diverse rangeland community, not a monotypic one.
This is conservation of rangeland biological diversity
at the grass roots level.
Together, scientists and rangeland managers are
traveling to new levels of conservation of rangeland
biodiversity, but the journey has some formidable
challenges. Herbivory, fire, drought, and other natu-
ral events and processes historically shaped range-
land biodiversity and ecological processes long be-
fore human action. However, human influence on
the range has complicated and interrupted many
naturally occurring mechanisms. The use and control
of fire has altered its frequency and intensity. The
pattern, frequency, and intensity of herbivory by
large animals has been modified by the conversion
from free-ranging bison and other large ungulates to
confined domestic livestock and a proliferation of
livestock water developments. Cultivation has frag-
mented and isolated rangelands and often natural
processes no longer function. An insidious challenge
to rangeland biodiversity is the invasion of exotic
plants into native range often at the expense of native
biota.
The purpose of this symposium was to provide a
forum to discuss how elements of rangeland
biodiversity are being conserved today. We asked,
"How resilient and sustainable are rangeland sys-
tems to the increasing demands of a growing human
population and to extended periods of drought?"
One way to begin answering this question is to look
at our successes and failures in conserving all parts
of rangeland systems. Key programs and issues,
identified by a program committee, were addressed
by researchers and managers. Their papers, which
have received statistical and peer review, are pre-
sented here and provide research results, manage-
ment findings, and describe management programs
currently used to conserve rangeland biodiversity.
The paper "Gap Analysis in the Great Plains: A
Large-Scale Geographic Strategy for Conservation
of Biodiversity" by Dennis Jelinski, Michael Jennings,
and James Merchant was withdrawn by the authors
before publication of this workshop proceedings.
This symposium was held concurrently with the
Annual Meeting of the Central Mountains and Plains
Section of The Wildlife Society. We thank the organiz-
ers of that event for suggesting this symposium. Thanks
are also extended for the well-attended field trip to
review northern swift fox management in southwest-
ern South Dakota that concluded the workshop.
National Forests and Grasslands
Dick Roth1 and Richard Peterson2
Abstract.—The Rocky Mountain Region of the USDA Forest
Service provides nesting habitat for 146 species of neotropical
migratory birds. Interactive, prioritization databases were de-
veloped for each National Forest and National Grassland in the
Region to assist land managers in making informed decisions
about resource allocations. The data was processed using
Paradox software. This paper summarizes the uses and appli-
cation of the database for the Oglala and Ft. Pierre National
Grasslands.
METHODS
We used data provided by Colorado Bird Obser-
vatory and ranked according to the Partners-In-Flight
(PIF) ranking scheme for initial prioritization of
neotropical migratory birds (NTMBs). The approach
ranks species by their relative susceptibility to extinc-
tion (Carter and Barker 1993, Hunter et al. 1993).
There are many factors that contribute to extinction
probability. The PIF prioritization scheme uses seven
criteria as the most important in gauging a species
susceptibility to extirpation or extinction: 1) impor-
tance of area of consideration (IA), (percentage of a
species range that is within a state or geographic area
under consideration); 2) global abundance (GA); 3)
the degree of threat to the species' persistence on the
breeding ground (TB); 4) the degree of threat to
species' persistence on the wintering ground (TW); 5)
breeding distribution (BD); 6) extent of wintering
distribution (WD); 7) population trend in area of
consideration (PT); based upon U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. Each of
the seven criteria is weighted equally. An individual
species is assigned a score in each of the seven catego-
ries ranging from one (low concern) to five (high
concern). Each species is ranked according to the
average of the seven scores. The importance of area

score (IA) was modified for our use to include a rank
based upon the percentage of the area under consid-
eration which meets breeding habitat requirements
for a given species.
Uncertainty values are assigned to each species in
conjunction with valuesassignedforthreatstobreed-
ing (TBU) and wintering (TWU), and population
trend (PTU). These uncertainty values reflect the
extent of the available information for each of the
associated criteria. They indicate the extent and loca-
tion of gaps in our knowledge of neotropical migrant
biology. These values help us differentiate between
species with definite management concerns and those
requiring additional monitoring or research in order
to more clearly reflect their status.
Several criteria were modified for the Oglala and
Ft. Pierre National Grasslands. Population trend (PT)
and Population trend uncertainty scores were deter-
mined from USFWS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for
the 10-year and 26-year scores. Data from physi-
ographic region 39 (Missouri Plateau-Unglaciated)
were used for both grasslands. Other population
trend data more specific to the area under consider-
ationcanbe used for these criteria if available. Threats
to breeding habitat (TB) and Threats to breeding
habitat uncertainty (TBU) criteria provided by PIF
were used (Carter and Barker 1993). Additionally,
known local threats were also considered such as
reduction of prairie dog towns as a threat to burrow-
ing owl habitat. In this case, a TB score of 5 was used
because loss of prairie dog towns would result in
elimination of burrowing owl habitat (Peterson 1994).
Several methods have been developed to deter-
mine priorities for community based conservation
(Millsap et al. 1990, Master 1991, Reed 1992). The
technique developed by Partners in Flight is essen-
tially one that ranks individual species first, and
secondarily ranks habitats based on individual spe-
cies scores grouped by habitat preference. This rank-
ing can then be used to develop and justify commu-
nity based conservation programs. The determina-
neotropical migratory landbirds on the Oglala and
Ft. Pierre Grasslands was made using local expertise.
The habitat types and conditions developed for
the Grasslands and assigned to each species have
three levels:
1) Appropriate habitat contains six major
breeding bird habitat types. They include
trees/woodlands, shrubs/shrublands,
grass/grasslands, edge-tree/grass-shrub/
grass, wetlands and special topographic
structure.
2) Suitable habitat, in general, additional con-
ditions are needed for appropriate habi-
tat to be suitable breeding habitat for a
given species. For grasslands, additional
conditions could be related to a given
height and density of grasses or forbs. For
trees/woodland habitat, additional con-
ditions could include deciduous trees,
cavities or a multi-layered canopy.
3) Special conditions includes topographic
structures such as cliffs and cutbanks, but
also includes features such as riparian
areas and prairie dog towns.
These habitat categories enable development of
habitat ranking based on a species' use of a wide
variety of habitat types and variables.
Coding used for habitats and special features is as
follows:
Habitats T-(t)rees/woodlands, coni(f)erous,
(d)eciduous, (o)ld growth, m(u)ltilayer
canopy, and
(c)avities.
E-(e)dge, tree-grass/shrub-grass.
S-(s)hrubs, (b)ig sagebrush, (2) thorny
shrubs-esp. plum,
G-(g)rass/grasslands-open areas-esp.
s(h)ort and/or sparse, t(a)ll and/or
de(n)se, mi(x)ed/mid.
W-(w)etlands/(w)ater-(l)riparian,(m)arsh/
tall emergent, (3) wet meadow-tall
grass/short emergent.
Specials s(P)ecial-topo/structure-(4)cliffs/
caves/ledges and cutbanks, (5)buildings/
bridges/chimneys and bird houses, ^is-
lands/bare shores.
s(p)ecial-other-(7)prairie dog towns, (i.e.
burrows/bare ground/short grass and
associated prey), forest fire locations-
turned areas, esp. large with tall
snags, (9) cropland-esp alfalfa, (O)old
crow/magpie nests.
The mix of numbers and letters used in the coding
may appear to be confusing; however, familiariza-
tion with the application of those codes as displayed
in the habitat columns of the accompanying tables
reveals that they provide a logical fit.
RESULTS
The Oglala and Ft. Pierre National Grasslands
support 79 and 68 species of neotropical migratory
landbirds which regularly nest there, or a combined
total of 84 regular nesters. These are listed in Appen-
dix 1 and 2 along with all associated prioritization
scores for the seven criteria and some of the associ-
ated uncertainty scores. Species with R1O or R26
ranks of 3.00 or greater should be given high priority
for management considerations (Thompson et al.
1993). Analysis of the data reveals that 18 of the 84
species have a R1O or R26 rank of 3.00 or greater
(Appendix 1 and 2). The R1O and R26rank scores
along with importance of area, threats to breeding
and breeding distribution scores help to provide a
framework for setting management priorities. As an
illustration, the chestnut-collard longspur has high
R1O and R26 rank scores but has an importance of
area (IA) score of only 3.00.
Consequently, other species with higher IA scores
should be given higher management priority. The
two top ranked species on both grasslands (burrow-
ing owl and ferruginous hawk) have a preference for
short-grass prairie and prairie dog towns. Other spe-
cies on these two grassland have a preference for tall
and mixed-grass prairie. Consequently, management
of the National Grassland units for a diversity of
heights and would provide habitat for both species.
The database contains scores for each criterion,
for each species, for each unit where they are likely to
occur. It is important that the data for each unit be
analyzed separately for more specific insights into
the top priority species and habitat for each unit. For
unit being analyzed for a given species. What are the
threats to that habitat? What is the status and trend of
that habitat?
This prioritization system reveals that the highest
ranked habitat on the Oglala National Grassland is
big sagebrush and that is based on one species (table
1). The next highest ranked habitat is short and
mixed-grass prairie and prairie dog towns respec-
tively. These habitats support six and four high prior-
ity (= > 3) species respectively. Edge habitat and
riparian habitat are both important because of the
diversity of species that they support. These values
are based upon the relative susceptibility to extinc-
tion of species found in each habitat. Information on
species as presented in table 2 should also be consid-
ered along with the habitat information when weigh-
ing the consequences of management actions.
A total of 12 species from the Oglala National
Grassland have a R26 Rank of 3.00 or greater. Brewer's
Sparrow is the species in big sagebrush habitat which
causes the high habitat rank in table 1. The rank of 1
for importance of area score (IA) indicates that only a
small portion of the Oglala National Grassland pro-
vides suitable breeding habitat for Brewer's Spar-
rows. The two top-ranked species use prairie dog
towns and the top five species also short to mixed
grass prairie habitats.Therefore, the highest priority
habitats for NTMBs on the Oglala National Grassland
should be those that support these species.

tional Grassland reveals somewhat different results
(table 3). Ft Pierre is in a higher precipitation area and
has taller grasses and more deciduous trees than the
Oglala National Grassland. Bird species diversity is
greater across habitat types than on the Oglala Na-
tional Grassland and mixed/tall grass habitat higher
priority. The burrowing owl is the highest ranked
species on both units (table 4). Dickcissel, bobolink,
grasshopper sparrow, northern harrier and upland
sandpiper had higher prioritization scores on the Ft.
Pierre National Grassland. Management of prairie
dog towns and short grass habitat should have some
priority on Ft. Pierre, but management for mixed to
tall grass habitat is of higher priority based on this
analysis.

LITERATURE CITED
The PIF species ranking system is a helpful tool in
establishing priorities for Neotropical Migratory Bird
species and habitat based management efforts for
those species. It should not replace human judgment
or additional information which might be important
in setting resource priorities. Refinement of the PIF
data as was done on the Oglala and Ft. Pierre Na-
tional Grasslands with local expertise increases the
utility value of the system. Only a few analysis ex-
amples were given here. However, an endless variety
of queries can be used to tease additional information
from the data.

Sheyenne National Grassland, North Dakota
Clinton McCarthy1, Tim Pella2, Greg Link3, and Mark A. Rumble4
Abstract.—Greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido
pinnatus) populations and habitats have declined dramatically
in the Great Plains. The Sheyenne National Grassland (SNG)
has the largest population of greater prairie chickens in North
Dakota, but this population has declined over the past 15
years. Lack of nesting habitat has been identified as a signifi-
cant factor contributing to the decline in greater prairie chicken
populations throughout their range. We used the Habitat
Suitability Index (HSI) model for greater prairie chickens to
evaluate the nesting habitat conditions on the SNG. This
population of greater prairie chickens appears to sustain itself
on the brink of extirpation by nesting in the few areas that
provide nesting cover and in private alfalfa fields. Encroach-
ment of woody plants into the SNG, changes in private land-
use patterns, removal of forage by domestic livestock contrib-
ute to the low suitability of the SNG for nesting by greater
prairie chickens.
INTRODUCTION
The Sheyenne National Grassland (SNG) is ap-
proximately 28,745 ha of federally administered prai-
rie in southeastern North Dakota. Within its admin-
istrative boundary there are an additional 25,910 ha
of interspersed private cropland and prairie. The
SNG contains the largest population of greater prai-
rie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in the
state of North Dakota (Kobriger et al. 1987). Greater
prairie chickens are not native to the SNG, but are
considered a naturalized immigrant in North Da-
kota (Johnson and Knue 1989). Prairie chickens ap-
parently moved into North Dakota from the north-

central part of the United States during the Euro-
American settlement in the 1870's and 1880's (Johnson
and Knue 1989, Evans 1968). Greater prairie chicken
populations and their habitats (native tall grass prai-
rie) have declined to a small fraction of their historical
range (Hjertaas et al. 1993, Samson and Knopf 1994).
Thus, the population of greater prairie chickens on the
SNG has both regional and national importance.
Numbers of prairie chickens on the SNG increased
from the early 1960's through the early 1980's (Kobriger
et al. 1987). Since then, prairie chicken numbers on the
SNG have declined from a high of 410 males in 1983 to
a low of 84 males in 1994 (Kobriger et al. 1987, unpubl.
data, Sheyenne National Grassland, Lisbon, ND). State
and federal natural resource management agencies,
and conservation groups are concerned that manage-
ment of the SNG maybe contributing to the decline in
the greater prairie chicken population. Lack of suit-
able nesting habitat has been identified as the most
significant factor limiting populations of greater prai-
rie chickens across their range (Kirsch 1974, Westemeir
1973) and in North Dakota (Svedarsky 1979).
Habitat suitability index (HSI) models are an ac-
cepted method for quantifying species' habitats as
numerical index (Schamberger et al. 1982). Biological
and habitat information are synthesized to formulate
index values between zero (unsuitable) and one (op-
timum) for habitat requisites considered important to
a species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1980). We
conducted HSI analyses to assess habitat conditions
for greater prairie chickens on the SNG at three scales:
1) the western portion of the SNG and adjacent pri-
vate lands, 2) the Durler/Venlo Management unit, and
3) areas <^1.6 km of the 14 active booming grounds.
METHODS
The HSI model for greater prairie chickens (Prose
1985) identifies two habitat components, nesting cover
and winter food, as the most important habitat com-
13
cover is based on grassland vegetation height/den-
sity (expressed as visual obstruction measurements
on a pole, Robel et al. 1970) for nesting cover in the
spring (figure 1).
We mapped the lowland, midland, and upland
grassland vegetation types (Manske and Barker 1987)
on 1:24,000 aerial photos of the SNG. Most nesting by
greater prairie chickens on the SNG occurs within 1.6
km of leks (Newell et al. 1987). The Custer National
Forest Land Management Plan (U.S. Forest Service,
Custer National Forest, Billings, MT, 1986) requires
that nesting habitat for prairie grouse be assessed
within 1.6 km of leks. During October and Novem-
ber, 1994, we estimated height/density of vegetation
in these vegetation types from 81 transects within 1.6
km of greater prairie chicken leks in the northern and
western portion of the SNG. At each of 10 stations on
each transect, we recorded the height that vegetation
obstructed 100 percent of a pole (VOR) marked in 0.5
dm increments when viewed from four directions (at
90° azimuths) at a distance of 4 m and a height of 1 m
from the pole (Robel et al. 1970). VORs were averaged
for each station and the average among stations was
used to estimate transect VORs. We placed six
transects in upland vegetation, 51 transects in mid-
land vegetation and 26 transects in lowland vegeta-
tion. Data from these transects were used as VOR
estimates in the mapped vegetation polygons they
were collected in. For all other mapped vegetation

polygons, these VOR data served as calibrations for
ocular estimates of five VOR classes (0 - 0.50 dm, 0.51
-1.0 dm, 1.01 -1.5 dm, 1.51 - 2.0 dm, and >2.0 dm)
during field reconnaissance. Maps of vegetation and
VOR class assignments were transferred to 1:24,000
U.S. Geological Survey maps and the area of each
vegetation was planimetered for use in the HSI esti-
mates.
HSI for nesting cover is estimated in three steps
(Prose 1985). First, a suitability index is estimated
from the midpoint of the VOR classes of each vegeta-
tion type i (SIVORi). Second, the percent of area provid-
ing equivalent optimal nesting habitat (EONH) is
calculated using:
EONH = £ (SIvorMN,)
i i
where n = total number of vegetation types, and
N. = percent of the area in vegetation type i. Third,
HSI for nest cover is calculated from:
HSI =
(0.735 * EONH) - 21.4
37
Characteristics of vegetation and winter snow
accumulation influence the structure of vegetation in
the spring for nesting by greater prairie chickens.
VOR measurement collected in the fall decrease prior
to spring nesting. This decrease is proportional to the
height of vegetation and for the range of VOR 0.5-2.0
dm varies from 7-40 percent in mixed grass prairie (G.
Schenbeck pers. commun., Nebraska National For-
est, Chadron, NE). Over winter VOR losses on the
SNG are probably different, but data are lacking. We
selected 15 percent over-winter VOR losses to esti-
mate spring nesting cover based on fall VOR esti-
mates because the VORs for the SNG are near the
lower end of the range.
Western SNG Analysis
The western part of the SNG includes most of the
prairie chicken leks. This area included 3433 ha of
private land and 8984 ha of SNG administered lands.
We calculated the HSI for this analysis unit to show
estimated contributions to the HSI for prairie chick-
ens from adjacent private lands. VOR class informa-

SNG lands in this analysis unit. We assumed the
mapped VOR classes were representative of the re-
maining of the western SNG and used these data for
HSI calculations in this analysis unit. For private
lands in the western SNG analysis unit we assumed:
1) CRP land had VOR class > 2.0 dm; 2) hay and alfalfa
had VOR cover classes <0.5 dm because of mowing
approximately the third week of June that destroys
existing nests and most young hatched birds; and
3) grazed pasture had VOR cover class 0.51-1.0 dm.
Area Surrounding 14 Active Leks
The area within 1.6 km of active leks includes
most of the nesting habitat of greater prairie chickens.
This scale of analysis allowed us to evaluate HSI for
areas of known greater prairie chicken occurrences.
This level of analysis included the area surrounding
active greater prairie chicken leks and we expected
HSI from this analysis should equal or exceed the
HSI's from the blocks of SNG that included areas
>1.6 km from leks and unused areas.
Durler/Venlo Management Unit
RESULTS
The Durler/Venlo management unit includes 3645
ha in nine range management allotments in the west-
ern SNG. The Durler/Venlo unit is a subset of the
prairie chicken range in the western portion of the
SNG. It includes the larger leks, highest prairie chicken
numbers, and the greatest number of prairie chicken
leks not shared by sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus
phasianellus jamesi). Most of the Durler/Venlo man-
agement unit is <L6 km from a prairie chicken lek.
This portion of SNG has complete vegetation classi-
fication and mapping.
We excluded vegetation communities that were
not available for nesting by greater prairie chickens
from the HSI for the Durler/Venlo management unit.
This HSI analysis presents a complete picture of the
nesting habitat for this area. We assigned vegetation
types to mapped polygons using the dominant veg-
etation community in the polygons. Within these
polygons, vegetation communities not capable of
producing 1.5 dm VOR measurements or that are
usually flooded (Manske and Barker 1987, Newell et
al. 1987) were considered unavailable for nesting by
greater prairie chickens. The area in each polygon
assigned to a VOR class did not include unsuitable
areas. For example, lowland vegetation communities
dominated by species such as Carex lanulosa were
considered unavailable because in most years the
ground is flooded. Upland vegetation communities
dominated by species such as Boutelou gracilis were
considered unavailable for prairie chicken nesting
because they are not capable of producing at least 1.5
dm VOR in most years.
Western Sheyenne National Grassland
The 12,445 ha in the western SNG had 24 percent
EONH (table 1), less than the minimum considered
necessary for the HSI to be greater than zero using fall
VOR estimates. When over-winter VOR losses were
included, the EONH in the spring declined to 21
percent, with an HSI remaining zero.
Durler/Venlo Management Unit
EONH in the Durler/Venlo unit was lower that
the western SNG. EONH was reduced by eliminat-
ing the lowlands that are usually flooded in the
spring from the HSI calculations. The net result was
12 percent fall EONH and 9 percent EONH in the
spring. The subsequent HSI for the Durler/Venlo unit
was also zero.

The area within 1.6 km of the 14 active leks had a
larger EONH (26 percent) in the fall than the other
analysis units. However, the nesting HSI was zero for
this area as well. Four of the lek areas provided
sufficient EONH for HSI's greater than zero. How-
ever HSI estimates for spring showed that only two of
these leks still provided sufficient EONH for HSI's
greater than zero.
DISCUSSION
Nesting HSI
Our data suggests that nesting cover limits greater
prairie chicken populations on the SNG. HSI's were
zero for all the analysis units we compared. Four leks
had sufficient nesting cover in the surrounding 1.6
km for HSI's greater than zero based on the fall
measurements. HSI for these lek areas were less than
0.2 Only two leks had HSI's greater than zero for the
area within 1.6 km from leks after over winter VOR
losses were considered. HSI's for these two leks were
<0.1.
VOR measurements in grassland vegetation that
are 2 to 3 dm are considered optimal nest cover for
greater prairie chickens (Prose 1985). VOR measure-
ments >1.5 dm provide SIVOR >0.7. Only 16 percent
of the western SNG was in the VOR class > 1.5 dm. In
the Durler/Venlo management unit, only 7 percent of
the suitable nesting area provided vegetation >1.5
dm. For areas <1.6 km of leks, only 14 percent of the
area had vegetation in the >1.5 dm VOR classes.
Suitable nesting cover for prairie chickens may in-
crease during drought years because lowlands that
are usually flooded are drier and usable for nesting
by hens.
Most of the nesting habitat for greater prairie
chickens in the SNG is the midland community type
in the humocky sandhills (Manske and Barker 1981,
Manske and Barker 1987). Switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum) communities found on the toe slopes sur-
rounding lowland meadows provide the primary
prairie chicken nesting cover on the SNG (Manske
and Barker 1987, Newell 1987). Although lowlands
are not considered suitable for nesting in most years,
the lowland/midland interface is used for nesting by
prairie chickens (Newell 1987). The lack of adequate
cover for nesting in upland communities was attrib-
uted to heavy livestock utilization (Newell 1987).
Historically, upland communities were likely tall grass
prairie (Burgess 1964), but currently have limited
capacity to provide nesting cover because they are
dominated by short cool season and warm season
grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass and blue grama.
The HSI model (Prose 1985) assumes that opti-
mum nesting habitat conditions exist when 80 per-
cent of the area supports herbaceous vegetation with
a VOR of 2 - 3 dm. However, lingering populations of
greater prairie chickens can exist in areas with 10-15
percent permanent grassland (Hamerstrom et al. 1957,
Prose 1985). Topfer et al. (1990) considers a spring
population of 200 birds (100 males) as a minimum
number to insure perpetuation of the population.
Greater prairie chickens probably persist on the SNG
because natural variation provides small limited ar-
eas with adequate nesting cover. These areas exist at
the lowland/midland community interface, in low-
lands during drought years, and in limited quantity
surrounding some leks. Limited nesting also occurs
in alfalfa on private lands (Newell 1987). Small popu-
lations, such as the greater prairie chicken on the
SNG, are highly susceptible to extinction due to
catastrophic natural events (Ruggiero et al. 1994).
Robustness of Analyses to Assumptions
Because the HSI in our evaluation were based on
ocular estimates of VOR classes, we conducted analy-
ses to estimate HSI for systematic errors in estimating
the VOR classes. If we over estimated the VOR classes
(e.g.,VOR was actually lower), then HSI would de-
cline further. Because, the lower limit on HSI is zero,
our conclusion of limited nesting habitat remained
unchanged.
If we systematically underestimated VOR classes
by one class (0.5 dm), HSI for the Western SNG
increased to 0.1 for fall VOR estimates and remained
zero for estimates of spring nesting cover. HSI in the
Durler/Venlo unit remained zero for both spring and
fall VOR estimates. HSI for the areas around active
leks increased to 0.3 for fall VOR estimates, but de-
clined to 0.1 for spring estimates of nesting cover.
Because the area surrounding leks included low-
lands that are flooded in most years, the HSI was
probably lower. None-the-less, analyses that assume
we underestimated nesting cover, still show that
nesting habitat is limited on the SNG.
16
private lands in western SNG analysis unit were
made subjectively post hoc. Because, these post hoc
estimates of private land VOR may have influenced
the HSI, we conducted an analysis that would present
the best possible HSI for this analysis unit. HSI for the
western SNG was recalculated assigning all private
lands with suitable vegetation types (hay and alfalfa,
pastures, and CRP) for nesting, a SIVOR of 1.0 (this
analysis does not change the HSI for nest cover on
lands managed by the SNG). The resulting HSI for
nest cover increased for the western SNG analysis
unit to 0.33. This HSI represents the upper limit for
the western SNG analysis unit, but it is not realistic.
Most of the area considered to have SIVOR of 1.0 are
grazed or mowed annually. Hay and alfalfa is usually
cut by the third week of June, destroying existing
nests and young broods unable to escape the mow-
ers. Only the 251 ha of CRP in the analysis unit
maintained its structural integrity throughout the
nesting and brood rearing periods. None-the-less,
this analysis still indicated that regional nesting habi-
tat for greater prairie chickens is limited in the vicin-
ity of the SNG.
Contributing Factors
The encroachment of woody and exotic plant
species, changes in adjacent agricultural/land use
changes, and livestock grazing practices are three
human induced factors that directly or and indirectly
influence nesting cover for prairie chickens on the
SNG. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), willow
(Salix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia)
have encroached into prairie reducing nesting cover
on the SNG (Kobriger et al. 1987, Jensen 1992). Leafy
spurge (Euphorbia esula) has expanded from 7 percent
to over 17 percent of the SNG since 1985 (unpubl.
data, SNG). Encroachment of woody plants reduces
and fragments suitable nesting, brood rearing and
roosting cover (Svedarsky 1979); provides travel cor-
ridors and perch sites for predators (Burhnerkempe
et al. (1984) and creates habitat more suitable for
closely related sharp-tailed grouse (Prose 1987).
Agricultural development on private lands adja-
cent to the SNG over the past 10-15 years shows that
remnant prairie habitats on private lands have been
largely converted to croplands (unpubl. data, Nat.
Res. Conserv. Serv., Lisbon, ND). Our analysis of the
western SNG unit, showed that most of the suitable
nesting habitat on private lands was Conservation
Reserve Program comprising 250 ha in the analysis
unit. No privately owed parcelsof native prairie were
identified in our analysis of the western SNG.
Grazing by livestock is the predominant use of
the SNG. Livestock stocking rates have fluctuated
between 50,000 and 60,000 AUMs over the past 10 -15
years on the SNG. However, the size of livestock has
increased approximately 40 percent during a compa-
rable period (L. Potts, pers. commun., SNG, Lisbon,
ND). These heavier animals require approximately
30 percent more forage (National Research Council
1984) than the standard AUM established for a 454 kg
animal.

Abstract.—The black-tailed prairie dog is one of five prairie dog
species estimated to have once occupied up to 100 million ha
or more in North America. The area occupied by black-tailed
prairie dogs has declined to approximately 2% of its former
range. Conversion of habitat to other land uses and widespread
prairie dog eradication efforts combined with sylvatic plague,
Yersinia pestis, have caused significant reductions. Although,
the species itself is not in imminent jeopardy of extinction, its
unique ecosystem is jeopardized by continuing fragmentation
and isolation.
INTRODUCTION
The black-tailed prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus
Ord, is the most widespread and abundant of five
species of prairie dog in North America. Two species,
the Utah prairie dog, C parvidens J.A. Allen and the
Mexican prairie dog, C mexicanus, are currently listed
as threatened and endangered, respectively, under
the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The two other
widespread species are the white-tailed prairie dog,
C leucurus Merriam and the Gunnison's prairie dog,
C gunnisoni Baird.
The black-tailed prairie dog is native to the short
and midgrass prairies of North America. Its historic
range stretches from southern Canada to northern
Mexico and includes portions of Arizona, Colorado,
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyo-
ming (Hall and Kelson 1959). The eastern boundary
of prairie dog range is approximately the western
edge of the zone of tallgrass prairie, from which
prairie dogs are ecologically excluded. The western
boundary of this species is roughly the Rocky Moun-
tains. Its range is contiguous with, but generally does
not overlap, ranges of other prairie dog species.

With the exception of Arizona, from which it has
been extirpated, the species still occurs in all the states
(including Canada and Mexico) within its historic
range. Yet, widespread reductions have occurred in
population numbers and occupied areas throughout
this broad range. Historic evidence suggests that the
total area occupied by all species of prairie dogs may
have declined by as much as 98% during the first half
of this century (Miller et al. 1994).
METHODS
We sent letters of inquiry to state and federal
conservation and land management agencies and
consulted published reports. This information was
augmented by telephone interviews with individu-
als knowledgeable about prairie dog management.
The area surveyed included all states within the
original range of the black-tailed prairie dog. Al-
though responses were received from all states and
agencies queried, the quality of survey information
varied. Therefore, this report is a picture of prairie
dogs in the mid-1980s rather than an accurate assess-
ment of 1995 populations.
Prairie dog abundance and distribution is prob-
ably better documented at present than at any previ-
ous time due to improved mapping techniques and
greater interest in prairie dogs by land management
agencies. Yet, prairie dog occupied acreage can still
only be grossly estimated. A primary factor contribut-
ing to this uncertainty is that much of the mapping
effort is temporally distributed over a decade or more
and there is no method available to assess prairie dog
abundance over a broad area within a short span of
time. Typically, prairie dog populations change sub-
stantially within a few years due to the threats dis-
cussed below and to climatic factors and prairie dog
reproductive ecology. Another factor contributing to
errors in determining prairie dog abundance is a lack
of information from private and state lands.
19
A number of causes have been identified or pro-
posed to account for the reductions in the acreage
occupied by black-tailed and other prairie dog spe-
cies. We believe that four areas of threat warrant
further discussion: 1) loss of habitat due to conver-
sion of prairie to other land uses; 2) intentional poi-
soning or other eradication or control efforts, prima-
rily prompted by the livestock industry; 3) shooting
for recreation or as a control effort; and 4) sylvatic
plague, Yersinia pestis.
LOSS OF PRAIRIE
Prairie dominated by blue grama, Bouteloua graci-
lis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths, and buffalograss, Buchloe
dactyloidcs (Nutt.) Engelm., possibly due to its rela-
tively flat topography, is among the first grassland
converted to agriculture (Dinsmore 1983). As a result,
Graul (1980) noted that as much as 45% of this prairie
type has been lost to other land uses. Reductions in all
shortgrass and midgrass prairies is expected to be
similar or possibly greater in some midgrass regions
where precipitation may be more suitable for agricul-
ture. Although National Grassland acreage in the
northcentral region of the Forest Service represents
only about 5% of that agency's land base, it also
represents the majority of the native prairie remain-
ing in this region of North and South Dakota (Knowles
and Knowles 1994).
Currently, with the exception of some areas of the
northwestern portion of the black-tailed prairie dog's
range, conversion of prairie to agricultural cropland
has lessened. This is because much of the arable land
is already in cultivation or has been converted to non-
native grasses for forage. Municipal and industrial
development probably account for most of the present
losses to native prairies in the United States. While
these losses are minor compared with those that
occurred during settlement of this country, they con-
tinue to reduce habitat availability for prairie dogs
and other species.
ERADICATION OR CONTROL EFFORTS
Eradication efforts have been carried out against
prairie dogs on a very large scale, affecting several
million ha of land (Anderson et al. 1986; Bell 1921).
Clark (1979) reported that in some years prairie dogs
were intentionally poisoned on more than 8 million
ha in the United States. During the early 1980s, 185,600
ha of prairie dogs were eradicated on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation in South Dakota (Hanson 1988;
Sharps 1988). In 1986 and 1987, a South Dakota black-
tailed prairie dog complex of 110,000 ha was de-
stroyed, eliminating the largest remaining complex
in the United States (Tschetter 1988).
Virtually every federal land management agency
has been involved in this effort. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service used compound 1080 until its ban in
1972. In 1976, this agency approved the use of zinc
phosphide as a prairie dog control agent, hoping to
avoid secondary poisoning of nontarget species while
maintaining its prairie dog poisoning program. It is
estimated that permitting activities by both the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency and the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service account for the an-
nual poisoning of 80,000 ha of prairie dogs in the
United States (Captive Breeding Specialist Group
1992). Much of this effort occurs on federally-owned
and managed land, despite the fact that less than 5%
of the United States beef weight is produced on these
lands (United States General Accounting Off ice 1988).
Most poisoning on federal land is due to private land
concerns, not necessarily federal forage concerns.
The legal designation indicating the regulatory
status of the black-tailed prairie dog varies among the
10 states in which it still occurs. In four states the
species is designated a legal agricultural pest, with
some level of either state or local mandatory controls
in effect. This includes statewide legislation mandat-
ing control of prairie dogs in Wyoming. In Colorado,
Kansas, and South Dakota, state legislation allows
counties or townships to mandate controls on land-
owners. In 1995, Nebraska repealed their long-stand-
ing legislation that mandated statewide control,
thereby joining the states of Montana, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas, where control
is not mandatory but assistance may be provided to
landowners who believe they have a prairie dog
population problem that requires control.
PRAIRIE DOG SHOOTING
Shooting of prairie dogs, either for recreation or
to reduce or control their numbers, is widespread
across the range of all species in the United States.
20
remains unclear, but preliminary monitoring results
by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Mon-
tana indicate that some level of shooting might im-
pact the growth and expansion of prairie dog colo-
nies (Reading et al. 1989). Fox and Knowles (1995)
suggested that persistent unregulated shooting over
a broad area of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation
in Montana might have significantly influenced prai-
rie dog populations. However, they further con-
cluded that it would require approximately one rec-
reational day of shooting for every 6 ha of prairie dogs
to result in such an impact. This level of shooting
pressure is unlikely over the hundreds of thousands
of ha of currently occupied range.
SYLVATIC PLAGUE
Prairie dogs have coexisted with a variety of
predators for many centuries on the plains and have
adapted means of persisting in spite of this preda-
tion. However, a more recent threat has arrived to
which the prairie dog has no adaptive protection. A
flea-borne bacterium, the sylvatic plague, was intro-
duced into North America just before the turn of the
century. First discovered in black-tailed prairie dogs
in Texas in the 1940s (Cully 1989), small rodents such
as prairie dogs apparently have no natural immunity
to the plague, which now occurs virtually through-
out the range of the black-tailed prairie dog.
The impacts of plague are more adverse than just
the killing of many individuals. The plague persists in
a colony resulting in a longer population recovery
time than is common in colonies that have been
poisoned (figure 1). Four years following impact,
plague-killed colonies on the Rocky Mountain Arse-
nal National Wildlife Refuge had recovered to only
40%, while poisoned colonies had recovered to over
90% (Knowles 1986). Knowles and Knowles (1994)
suggested that prairie dogs have survived the intro-
duction of this disease simply due to their large,
highly dispersed populations. Further reductions in
these populations could make prairie dogs much
more susceptible to local or regional extirpations due
to the plague.

Rangewide
Seton (1929) estimated that in the early part of this
century, there may have been 5 billion prairie dogs in
North America. Around that time, prairie dog colo-
nies were estimated to occupy 40 million to 100
million ha of prairie in North America, but by 1960
this area was reduced to approximately 600,000 ha
(Anderson et al. 1986; Marsh 1984). These estimates
result in the often-cited figure of a 98% decline in
population among the five species of prairie dog. So,
while the black-tailed prairie dog still occurs in all but
one of the states in its historic range, significant
reductions in its total colony area have taken place
rangewide.

PRAIRIE DOG STATUS IN EACH STATE
Current status information was solicited from
state and federal agencies and from tribal authorities
in all eleven states in the historic range of the black-
tailed prairie dog (table 1). The following summary
provides updated status and population data for
those states.
Arizona
The Arizona Game and Fish Department (Duane
L. Shroufe, Director, in litt. 1995) confirms that the
black-tailed prairie dog, in the form of the Arizona
subspecies C ludovicianus arizonensis, is extirpated
from the state. However, it still occurs nearby in
Mexico and New Mexico. Arizona still supports
populations of Gunnison's prairie dogs.
Colorado
On the Comanche and Pawnee National Grass-
lands, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently estimates
a total of 2,455 ha of active prairie dogs, compared
with 910 ha from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck 1982). This
represents more than a doubling in area, but also
represents only 0.5% of the area available on these
public lands. Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site
contains 325 ha of black-tailed prairie dogs (NPS, in
litt.). Fort Carson and surrounding private lands
contain approximately 1,620 ha, Pinyon Canyon less
than 810 ha of prairie dogs (FWS, in litt.). The Rocky
Mountain Arsenal NWR (FWS, in litt.) prairie dog
population declined from 1,850 ha to 100 ha between
1988 and 1989, due to plague. Burnett (1918) esti-
mated that three combined species of prairie dog
occupied 5,665,720 ha in Colorado in the early 1900s.
Based on geographic distribution of black-tailed,
white-tailed, and Gunnison's prairie dogs in the state,
it may be assumed that black-tailed prairie dogs
accounted for approximately half this figure. There is
no reliable estimate of the total area occupied by
black-tailed prairie dogs statewide at this time.
Kansas
The National Park Service (in litt.) reports ap-
proximately 16 ha of prairie dogs at the Fort Larned
National Historic Site. On the Cimarron National
Grassland, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently esti-
mates 440 ha of active prairie dog colonies compared
with 20 ha estimated from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck
1982). This represents more than a twenty-fold in-
crease on this 44,000-ha area, yet still only 1% of the
total area of the Grassland. Both Lee and Henderson
(1988) and Powell and Robel (1994) reported that
selected counties had reductions of 84% since the
beginning of the century (Lantz 1903, cited in Lee and
Henderson 1988). A survey completed in 1992
22
dogs in Kansas, just over 2% of the 810,000 ha esti-
mated by Lantz (1903) some 90 years ago.
Montana
Flath and Clark (1986) estimated that black-tailed
prairie dogs occupied 595,000 ha of land in Montana
from 1908 to 1914. Estimated prairie dog occupied
area by the early 1980s had declined to 50,600 ha
(Flath and Clark 1986) and subsequent estimates
show further declines in prairie dogs (40,500 ha,
Campbell 1986; 35,545 ha, FaunaWest Wildlife Con-
sultants 1995). This most recent estimate indicates a
statewide reduction in occupied area of approxi-
mately 94% since the early 1900s.
Nebraska
On the Oglala National Grassland and Nebraska
National Forest, the Forest Service (in litt.) currently
estimates 105 ha of active prairie dog colonies, com-
pared with 145 ha estimated from 1978 to 1980
(Schenbeck 1982). Current estimates represent 1.4%
of land available. In 1973, prairie dog occupied area in
Nebraska was estimated at 6,075 ha (Lock 1973). By
1982, this figure had increased to an estimated 32,400
ha (Frank Andelt, Nebraska Game and Parks Com-
mission, cited in FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants
1995). By 1989, prairie dogs statewide occupied ap-
proximately 24,415 ha (Kevin Church, Nebraska Game
and Parks Commission, in litt.). Plague and increased
eradication efforts, resulting from state legislation
mandating prairie dog control, have reduced this
figure significantly since the 1980s, with less than
0.22% of the Nebraska landscape currently occupied
by the species (FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants 1995).
Historic estimates are unavailable.
New Mexico
The BLM (in litt.) reports that prairie dogs may be
extirpated from several sites, with only 140 ha re-
maining on BLM land in the state. The White Sands
Missile Range (Department of Army, in litt.) contains
just over 300 ha of prairie dogs. Around 1919 the area
in New Mexico occupied by prairie dogs, both
Gunnison's and black-tailed (including C. /.
arizonensis), was approximately 4,838,460 ha, but was
estimated to have been reduced to 201,220 ha by 1980
(Hubbards and Schmitt 1984). This is a 96% reduc-
tion. Hubbards and Schmitt (1984) further estimated
that the range of the black-tailed prairie dog in New
Mexico has been reduced by one-fourth, primarily
from the range of arizonensis.
North Dakota
Theodore Roosevelt National Park reportedly
contains less than 360 ha of prairie dogs (NPS, in litt.),
approximately 1% of the total Park land area. There
are believed to be currently 2,690 ha of prairie dogs on
the 660,435 ha of Custer National Forest in North and
South Dakota (Forest Service, in litt.). This represents
0.4% prairie dog occupancy of these lands. The Forest
management plan calls for an occupancy level at or
around 2,225 ha. The North Dakota Game and Fish
Department (in litt.) reports approximately 8,300 ha
of prairie dogs statewide, which may be a reduction
of 90% or more from historic levels. In 1992, only six
complexes of over 400 ha were identified.
Oklahoma
The Department of the Army (in litt.) has no
current estimate of prairie dog areas on Fort Sill, but
report that they have declined markedly in the past
10 years. Shackford et al. (1990) reported a statewide
estimate of 3,850 ha in 1967, increasing by 93% to
7,440 ha in 1989.
South Dakota
On the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre National
Grasslands, the Forest Service (in litt.) estimates 3,025
ha of active prairie dog colonies and an additional
2,600 ha of colonies are subject to periodic rodenti-
cide treatments. This compares to 17,600 ha esti-
mated from 1978 to 1980 (Schenbeck 1982). The 500,285
ha Black Hills National Forest and Custer and Elk
Mountain Ranger Districts currently support 53 ha of
prairie dogs. In the early 1920s there may have been
711,000 ha of prairie dogs statewide (FaunaWest
Wildlife Consultants 1995). The South Dakota Ani-
mal Damage Control office currently estimates 80,000
to 100,000 ha of active prairie dog colonies in the state;
the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates 65,000 ha of
these on tribal lands (Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, in
litt.). These estimates suggest at least an 86% decline
in prairie dog occupied area across the state. Bad-
23
tain 1,660 and 3,085 ha of prairie dogs, respectively
(NPS, in litt.). These numbers represent 2 and 4%,
respectively, of the area available on these public
lands.
Texas
There were an estimated 31,385 ha of prairie dogs
in northwest Texas in 1973 (Cheatham 1973). In 1991,
there were at least 12,145 ha of prairie dogs estimated
in Texas (Peggy Horner, Texas Parks and Wildlife, in
litt.). Comparing this with a statewide historic esti-
mate of 23,000,000 ha (Merriam 1902) results in a
decline of over 99% in this century.
Wyoming
On Thunder Basin National Grassland, the For-
est Service (in litt.) currently estimates 1,500 ha of
active prairie dog colonies, with an additional 4,900
ha subject to periodic rodenticide treatment. Colony
area for the period 1978 to 1980 was reported to be
2,550 ha (Schenbeck 1982). These numbers represent
0.6% of this 231,500 ha public grassland area. Devil's
Tower National Monument contains approximately
16 ha of black-tailed prairie dogs (NPS, in litt.); 3% of
the area available. Black-tailed prairie dogs in Wyo-
ming may have increased in abundance near the turn
of the century as a result of sheep and cattle grazing,
with an estimated 53,650 ha by 1971 (Clark 1973).
However, Campbell and Clark (1981) estimated a
75% reduction in prairie dog occupied areas since
1915. Current estimates indicate between 53,000 and
82,590 ha statewide (Wyoming Game and Fish De-
partment, cited in Fauna West Wildlife Consultants
1995).
SUMMARY OF PRAIRIE DOG
STATUS IN EACH STATE
FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants (1995) attempted
to estimate the amount of land area within the range
of the black-tailed prairie dog that is currently occu-
pied by the species. They included seven Great Plains
states in their analysis and concluded that the states
have less than a 1 % occupancy of land surface within
the species' range. The states included in this assess-
ment and the percent of prairie dog occupancy within
available area are Colorado (0.35%), Kansas (0.14%),
Montana (0.17%), Nebraska (0.22%), North Dakota
(0.17%),South Dakota (0.80%),andWyoming(0.60 to
0.88%).
While these individual state accounts do not rep-
resent an exhaustive rangewide status review, they
unfortunately provide the best information avail-
able. Significant reductions in occupied area have
and continue to occur throughout the species' range;
losses in some places exceeded 95%. Although the
species still occurs in all but one state in its historic
range, the eastern boundary of this distribution may
be receding to the west. Figures indicate that there
may be more than 550,000 ha of occupied black-tailed
prairie dog range remaining in the United States,
which is consistent with the estimate of 600,000 ha
(Marsh 1984) cited previously. Over half the known
prairie dog acreage in the central and northern Great
Plains occurs on private land, almost 30% is on Indian
reservations, and about 6% each occurs on Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management property
(figure 2, FaunaWest Wildlife Consultants 1995).
Neither Park Service nor Fish and Wildlife Service
lands support significant acreage of any prairie dog
species.
There is a need to develop a standardized survey
technique for assessing prairie dog status. Presently,
two methods are commonly employed and both
involve mapping of individual prairie dog colonies
either by ground reconnaissance or from aerial photo
interpretation. Both methods are time consuming
and expensive, making it unreasonable to expect a
survey of over 500,000 ha of prairie dog colonies on
the Great Plains within a short time period. Prairie
dog colonies represent clumped patches on a broad
landscape and there already exist nonmapping tech-
niques that might be capable of statistical sampling of
this distribution (Marcum and Loftsgaarden 1980). A
statistical approach to monitoring prairie dog colony
acreage may be a more appropriate technique than
trying to map all prairie dog colonies.
PRAIRIE DOGS AND LIVESTOCK
Efforts to eradicate the prairie dog by the live-
stock and agricultural industry have existed for most
of this century. Merriam (1902) estimated that prairie
dogs caused a 50 to 75% reduction in range produc-
tivity. Taylor and Loftfield (1924) concluded that the
prairie dogis "one of the most injurious rodents of the
24
Reservations (30.0%)
BLM (6.0%) ^
FS (6.0%


W'^y^W&^i Private/State (55.0%)

and central Great Plains.
southwest and plains regions," and results in "the
removal of vegetation in its entirety from the vicin-
ity." Reports such as these were largely responsible
for the escalating effort by range managers on the
Great Plains to eradicate the prairie dog.
The conflict between the livestock industry and
the prairie dog will likely not end easily or quickly,
despite reports that prairie dog foraging does not
significantly affect weight gain of cattle (O'Meilia et
al. 1982; Hansen and Gold 1977). Others have re-
ported the beneficial effects of prairie dogs on long-
term range condition, including increased plant spe-
cies diversity, richness, and overall plant production
in prairie dog colonies (Archer et al. 1987; Uresk and
Bjugstad 1983; Bonham and Lerwick 1976; Gold 1976).
Uresk (1985) demonstrated that up to four years
following prairie dog control, plant production was
not increased whether the range was grazed or
ungrazed by cattle.
Conversely, Hanson and Gold (1977) reported
dietary overlap between cattle and prairie dogs, sug-
gesting there may be some competition for the same
species of forage plants. An estimation of true compe-
tition would be dependent on a variety of factors,
including density of prairie dogs, stocking rate of
cattle, ground cover, forage species present, and oth-
ers (Uresk and Paulson 1988). Collins et al. (1984)
reported that the annual cost of prairie dog poisoning
was higher than the annual value of the forage gained
by these measures. This issue requires more study,
with input from both sides of the debate.
PRAIRIE DOGS AND BIODIVERSITY
The prairie dog, an integral component of the
shortgrass prairie biotic community, is capable of
transforming its own landscape and creating habitat
alterations on a scale surpassed only by humans on
the Great Plains. The ecosystem that is maintained by
the prairie dog is valuable to many other species, with
over 100 species of vertebrate wildlife reportedly
using prairie dog colonies as habitat (Sharps and
Uresk 1990; Clark et al. 1989; Reading et al. 1989).
While few of these species are critically dependent on
prairie dogs for all their life requisites, the increased
biodiversity associated with prairie dog colonies in-
dicates the importance of this habitat. Agnew et al.
(1986) reported greater avian densities and species
richness on prairie dog colonies. Also, numerous
researchers have documented the preferential feed-
ing of wild and domestic ungulates on prairie dog
colonies (Coppock et al. 1983; Detling and Whicker
1987; Knowles 1986; Krueger 1986; Wydeven and
Dahlgren 1985).

ciated with prairie dogs and the habitat they provide.
The black-footed ferret, Mustek nigripes Audubon
and Bachman, 1851, is considered a true prairie dog
obligate because it requires the prairie dog ecosystem
for its survival. As one of the most endangered mam-
mals in North America, this species has come to
symbolize the decline in native grassland biodiversity.
At least two species that are candidates for listing
under the Endangered Species Act are also associated
to a lesser degree with prairie dogs. The mountain
plover, Charadrius montanus Townsend, 1837, and the
swift fox, Vulpes velox Say, 1823, are attracted to the
vegetative changes and possibly increased food avail-
ability in prairie dog colonies. The association of
other species that are either declining or vulnerable
indicate the problems facing this habitat.
CONSERVATION EFFORTS
Prairie dogs are managed either directly or indi-
rectly within the survey area by at least six federal
agencies, 11 state wildlife departments, state agricul-
ture departments, departments of state lands, and
numerous weed and pest districts, counties and pri-
vate landowners. Prairie dog management goals and
objectives vary significantly among these entities.
Even management within agencies but between ar-
eas varies significantly. This variation can range from
total protection of prairie dogs to a legal mandate to
exterminate. All states have simultaneously classified
the prairie dog as a pest and as wildlife, often with
opposing management goals. Federal policy regard-
ing prairie dogs has been inconsistent over time and
across geographic regions. The legal mechanisms
responsible for the decline of prairie dogs during this
century are still intact. Restoration of the prairie dog
ecosystem may not be possible without major changes
in management policy.
At least two federal agencies have taken the ini-
tiative to begin to address the problems associated
with declining prairie dog occupied areas and to
involve other interested parties. The Forest Service
initiated a working group comprised of various fed-
eral land and resource agencies throughout the north-
ern states in the Great Plains, involving the Bureau of
Land Management, Park Service, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, and Fish and Wildlife Service. The function of
this group is to encourage development of conserva-
tion assessments and strategies for the species across
broad landscapes.
In January 1995, the Fish and Wildlife Service
convened a meeting of federal, state, and nongovern-
mental entities to discuss problems facing the short-
grass prairie ecosystem, including the prairie dog as
a focal species. Consensus recommendations were: 1)
Fish and Wildlife Service will develop conservation
strategies to keep prairie species from becoming listed
under the Endangered Species Act and to recover
declining species before a listing occurs; and 2) work
with the Western Governor's Association to investi-
gate ways to coordinate and communicate with all
involved parties on prairie issues. The Fish and Wild-
life Service recognizes that prairie dog management
remains within the jurisdiction of the various state
and federal land management agencies. Therefore,
this agency is particularly interested in participating
in cooperative agreements with other agencies so
that the prairie dog may be managed as a wildlife
species rather than simply controlled as a pest.
CONCLUSION
The black-tailed prairie dog does not appear to be
in danger of becoming extinct in the foreseeable
future, given current management. However, the
additional negative impacts resulting from habitat
fragmentation (Wilcox and Murphy 1985) could seri-
ously impact the ability of some prairie dog popula-
tions to persist or become re-established. Habitat
fragmentation adversely quickly affects highly spe-
cialized species (Miller et al. 1994) and the myriad of
species associated with prairie dog colonies recover
from habitat or population losses at different rates.
This could result in a significant disruption of the
ecosystem overall functioning, further delaying its
recovery. Such effects are already evident for the
endangered black-footed ferret. The future recovery
or extinction of this species is inextricably entwined
with the decisions resource managers make today
regarding the conservation of the prairie dog ecosys-
tem.
Management of the black-tailed prairie dog must
give greater consideration to developing an abun-
dance and distribution of prairie dogs that will en-
sure long-term population persistence of associated
26
suitable grasslands should bave from 1 to 3% of the
area occupied by prairie dogs. Federally-owned lands
should assume a greater share of this responsibility,
with a goal of from 5 to 10% occupancy by prairie
dogs. Maintaining this level of occupancy may allow
resource managers to determine what actually con-
stitutes a functioning prairie dog ecosystem, so at-
tempts may be made to preserve this system into the
future.

for Biological Diversity on Native Rangelands
of the Northern Great Plains
Carolyn Hull Sieg1
Abstract.—A strategy for using fire to manage for biological
diversity on native rangelands in the Northern Great Plains
incorporates an understanding of its past frequency, timing and
intensity. Historically, lightning and humans were the major fire
setters, and the role of fire varied both in space and time. A
burning regime that includes fires at various intervals, seasons
and intensities, including midsummer burns, should be rein-
stated. However, burning to enhance rare systems and species
and to discourage exotic species is also needed. The goal is to
base plans on an understanding of historic processes and
ecosystem interactions, and resist techniques that rely on
unexamined conventions.
INTRODUCTION
"A common thread runs through the many defi-
nitions of biological diversity: variety of life and its
processes in a given area" (Salwasser 1990). A man-
agement strategy for conserving biological diversity
of any natural ecosystem must focus on saving all the
components, including the structure, composition
(including genetic diversity), and processes that char-
acterize these systems (Kaufmann et al. 1994). Bio-
logical diversity is more than just the identifiable
parts; it also includes the symbioses and synergisms
that make nature work (Salwasser 1990).
The importance of disturbances in shaping native
communities has recently received more attention.
Ecosystems are dynamic entities whose patterns and
processes are shaped and sustained on the landscape
by successional processes and by abiotic disturbances
such as fire, drought, and wind. To sustain these
ecosystems, processes that characterize the variabil-
ity found in native ecosystems should be present and

functioning, and management activities should con-

egy for managing biological diversity of rangelands
on the Northern Great Plains. The approach is based
on restoring historical disturbance processes given
the significantly altered landscape patterns of today.

SETTING
The Northern Great Plains region includes North
Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska, plus the eastern
portions of Montana and Wyoming, and extends
northward into Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The climate of the region is characterized by an
increase in precipitation and humidity and a de-
crease in periodic droughts during the summer from
west to east (Risser 1990). This climate range influ-
ences not only the potential native vegetation but
also the fire regime and effects. The shortgrass prairie
on the Western and Southern portions of the region
is the most arid type; the mixed-grass prairie occurs in
the midsection of the region; and the tallgrass prairie
on the Eastern edge receives the most precipitation
(Risser etal. 1981).
The variation in precipitation across the region
greatly influences the growth and expansion of woody
plants. In the most Western portion of the region, big
sagebrush occupies uplands; in the absence of fire it
persists or expands (Wright and Bailey 1982). In the
remainder of the shortgrass and mixed-grass por-
tions of the region, woody plants are restricted to
areas of increased elevation, such as the Black Hills, or
to areas of increased moisture such as riparian zones,
draws, and north-facing slopes. Escarpments, ridges,
and outcrops in the Western portion support ponde-
rosa pine and Rocky Mountain juniper (Wells 1965).

Woody draws (narrow woodlands occurring in
ravines) are examples of communities in more arid
portions of the region that are restricted to sites with
grea ter soil moisture. The most common woody plants
in these draws are green ash and chokecherry. Ripar-
ian zones along streams and rivers support plains
cottonwood, willows, and dwarf sagebrush (Severson
and Boldt 1978). These woodlands may also expand
in the absence of fire, but the expansion is restricted
to sites with adequate moisture and the expansion
rate is slower than in the tallgrass region. Further,
many deciduous species, such as chokecherry and
willows, sprout vigorously following burning (Wright
and Bailey 1982). Only very frequent fires (i.e., every
1 to 5 years) would favor grasses over these species.
In contrast to more arid portions of the region,
mesic prairies in the Northern, Eastern and South-
eastern portions of the region are characterized by
precipitation amounts high enough to support the
expansion of woody plants onto uplands. It is in these
areas that frequent fires slow the expansionof woody
plants on uplands (Bragg and Hulbert 1976). In the
Northern portion of the region, aspen replaces pon-
derosa pine on outcrops and expands into the Cana-
dian prairies (Wright and Bailey 1982). Eastern red
cedar replaces Rocky Mountain juniper in the South-
eastern part of the region where it readily expands
onto uplands (Gehring and Bragg 1992). In the east-
ern tallgrass prairies, woody species, such as willows
and bur oak, invade grasslands, and only frequent
fires slow their expansion (Anderson 1990). Plains
cottonwood and willow dominate floodplains in the
more mesic portions of the Northern Great Plains;
green ash and bur oak are common on higher terraces
along major rivers (Johnson et al. 1976).
In addition to climatic factors, herbivores also
influence the region's vegetation and fire regimes.
However, it is difficult to distinguish the particular
influence each force has on vegetation (Henderson
and Statz 1995). Fire is often associated with periodic
drought, and fire and grazing are sometimes interre-
lated. For example, recently burned grasslands often
attract grazers; yet, heavily grazed areas usually re-
sist fire until dead litter reaccumulates (Steuter et al.
1990, Vinton et al. 1993). Therefore, the influences of
grazing and drought must be a part of a discussion of
historical fire effects (Henderson and Statz 1995).
FIRE HISTORY
An understanding of the frequency, timing, and
intensities of past fires is necessary before fire can be
incorporated into a strategy to conserve prairie sys-
tems. Based on data from adjoining ponderosa pine
forests, which indicated that fire frequency varied
from 2 to 25 years, Wright and Bailey (1982) estimate
that on level-to-rolling topography, a fire frequency
of 5 to 10 years in the Northern Great Plains is
reasonable. On topography more dissected with
breaks and rivers, they estimate a fire frequency of 20
to 30 years. Wendtland and Dodd (1992) agree with
this range, based on their examination of historical
documents and fire records from the Scotts Bluff
Na tional Monument area in northwestern Nebraska.
Dendrochronology data in the Devils Tower region
northwest of the Black Hills reveal that before 1770
the mean interval between fires was 27 years; from
1770 to 1900 the fire return interval was 14 years
(Fisher et al. 1987). Brown and Sieg (1996) report a
mean fire frequency in the south-central Black Hills
of 16 years for the period 1388 to 1918.
32
Plains, the average fire return interval was shorter.
Collins and Gibson (1990) estimate a frequency of
every 1 to 5 years in the tallgrass portions of this
region. In northcentral Nebraska, the fire return in-
terval averaged 3.5 years between 1851 and 1900
(Bragg 1985).
Historically, the major ignition sources for prairie
fires were lightning and American Indians. Light-
ning was, and is, an important ignition source in the
Northern Great Plains. In northwestern South Da-
kota, lightning-set fires occur an average of 6 to 25
times per year, and most commonly occur in July and
August (Higgins 1984); fewer occur in April, May,
June, and September. Wendtland and Dodd (1992)
note that of 10 fires described in historical documents
between 1824 and 1934, and of 26 fires officially
recorded between 1934 and 1969 in the Scotts Bluff
National Monument area, over 70 percent occurred
in July and August.
Higgins' (1986) review of 300 historical accounts
written between 1673 and 1920 reveals that fires
accidentally or intentionally set by American Indians
were common in the Northern Great Plains. He found
that although Indians set fires in nearly every month
of the year, April, September and October were their
peak fire-setting times. The majority of the 97 fires
described were scattered, single events of short dura-
tion and small extent; only 10 fires burned longer
than 1 day.
American Indians had many uses for fire. These
included attracting and herding wild animals, signal-
ing threats and warnings, improving pasturage, mask-
ing and eliminating personal signs at camps and
along trails, and for pleasure, warfare and ceremo-
nies (Higgins 1986). During their 10,000-year occupa-
tion of this region, the timing of fires set by American
Indians did not mirror lightning-set fires; therefore,
these Indian-set fires can be considered additive to
lightning fires (Higgins 1986).
A combination of periodic droughts, high tem-
peratures and strong winds in the region provide the
components necessary for fire spread (Collins 1990).
The end result of the erratic climate, flammable fuels,
topographic relief and other factors, such as grazing
animals, was that the role of fire was not constant in
time or space (Anderson 1990).
With the arrival of non-native settlers came fire
suppression policies and, in many areas, a shift in the
timing of fires. Near Devils Tower, Wyoming, after
1900, the fire return interval increased to every 42
years, versus less than every 27 years previously
(Fisher et al. 1987). In the south-central Black Hills,
Brown and Sieg (1996) record a 104-year fire-free
period in ponderosa pine stands between 1890 and
1994, and note that most of past fires occurred late in
the growing season or after growth had ceased for the
year. Higgins (1984) suggests that the recent extent
and spread of lightning fires has been modified by
cultural features such as roads; further, the fire re-
gime has also been altered by differing patterns of
grazing animals (first bison, then cattle). In contrast to
the late summer ignitions that commonly burned
before 1935 near Scotts Bluff, Nebraska, the 46 fires
recorded since 1935 dramatically shifted to spring
occurrences (Wendtland and Dodd 1992). Lengthen-
ing the interval between fires, shifting from summer
to early spring burning, and/or reducing fire inten-
sity by prescribing cooler fires may alter species com-
position to favor fire-intolerant species (Wendtland
and Dodd 1992) such as cactus and non-sprouting
woody species like sagebrush (Wright and Bailey
1982).
DEVELOPING A FIRE MANAGEMENT
STRATEGY TO CONSERVE DIVERSITY
The fire strategy most likely to manage diversity
on native rangelands of the Northern Great Plains is
based on two premises: 1) processes that mimic, as
much as possible, the variability found in native
ecosystems should be present and functioning; and
2) management activities should conserve or restore
historical disturbance patterns (Kauf mann et al. 1994).
This management strategy should reflect the differ-
ing roles that fire historically played in the various
portions of the region. However, this strategy must
also address the fundamental changes that have oc-
curred in the landscape such as drastically different
landscape patterns imposed by species changes and
management unit boundaries.
Wendtland and Dodd (1992) recommend a sce-
nario that mimics the presettlement fire history. For
the Scotts Bluff, Nebraska area, they infer this strat-
egy including high intensity summer fires on a return
interval of 5 to 30 years. Shifting burning programs
from all spring or fall burns to include some mid-
summer burns should favor some species not en-
hanced by spring or fall burns (Howe 1994). For
33
root production of cool-season plants, leaving late-
season plants unscathed; an August fire burns the
largely inactive foliage of cool-season species, while
consuming foliage and reproductive stems of warm-
season species (Howe 1994). However, historically,
fires occurring after fuels have cured in the fall or in
the early spring before green-up may have been
more significant than summer fires. High fuel mois-
ture in July and August and concurrent slow rates of
spread result in a smaller area being burned by an
individual fire, compared to those fires occurring
when fuels are cured in the fall (Steuter 1988). Given
the highly variable fire regime in the past, burns of
varying intensities at differing seasons are appropri-
ate. Further, the interval between fires should be
varied to best restore fire disturbance patterns of the
Northern Great Plains. The strategy should avoid a
uniformity in timing of burns or in intervals between
burns that artificially simplifies what was probably a
more complex system (Howe 1994).
SPECIAL HABITATS AND
SENSITIVE SPECIES
Reinstituting a fire regime based on historical
processes that includes burning at varying intervals
and in differing seasons is the first step in developing
a strategy for using fire to manage biological diversity
on native rangelands in this region. The second step
involves assessing the direct and indirect impacts of
fire on special habitats and sensitive species. Special
habitats are native biological communities or ecosys-
tems that are rare, unique, or highly productive ele-
ments of regional landscapes (Salwasser 1990). Sensi-
tive species include those native species currently in
danger of extinction or those whose population trends
are negatively affected by human actions (Salwasser
1990). The burning strategy should also consider the
potentially different historical fire disturbance re-
gimes in these sensitive ecosystems, minimize poten-
tial negative influences of fire, and maximize condi-
tions favorable to the expansion of these systems and
species.
The special habitats in the Northern Great Plains
(wetlands, lowlands, and riparian areas) contain high
numbers of listed vulnerable species (Finch 1992,
Finch and Ruggiero 1993). Although each of these
habitats constitutes a relatively small percentage of
the total land area, each contributes disproportion-
ately to the diversity of native rangelands in this
region (Finch and Ruggiero 1993). If sensitive com-
munities such as these occur within a management
unit, burning programs should be examined relative
to their impacts on these habitats. The range in fre-
quency, timing, and intensity of burns suitable to
upland habitats may not provide optimum condi-
tions for sustaining these distinctive systems.
Wetlands, lowlands, and riparian woodlands in
this region are examples of communities that, be-
cause of higher moisture, likely burned less frequently
than uplands. Riparian zones throughout the region,
and woody draws in the more arid portions, tend to
be green throughout most of the growing season,
have higher relative humidities than adjacent grass-
lands, and often have running water or moist soils
that slow the spread of fire into these communities. In
most years, prairie fires would skip over or only burn
lightly through these narrow woodlands (Severson
and Boldt 1978). However, the narrow configuration
and close contact of these woodlands with flammable
grassland fuels suggest that historically they were
exposed to a high number of grassland fires. Fire
inevitably entered these woodlands, especially in dry
years on hot and windy days.
Given that the species composition in woody
draws includes a number of deciduous species, such
as snowberry and chokecherry, that sprout following
burning (Wright and Bailey 1982), and that several
woody species establish best in mineral soils, fire
probably functioned as a regeneration mechanism in
these systems. Further, since these communities stay
green longer than uplands, fires probably burned
late in the growing season when there were adequate
levels of cured, fine fuel. Repeated, annual fires,
especially during droughts, tend to favor the growth
of grasses over woody plants (Wright and Bailey
1982). Fires occurring infrequently when plants are
dormant, followed by high precipitation, may en-
hance woody plant growth (Wright and Bailey 1982,
Sieg 1991). If the goal is to regenerate woody plants in
woody draws and/or to mimic historical fires, pre-
scriptions should be set to achieve high intensities
(Sieg 1996).
Rocky Mountain juniper woodlands are an ex-
ample of a relatively uncommon community in the
Western portion of the Northern Great Plains that
rarely burned. In this region, Rocky Mountain juni-
per grows best on steep barren slopes (Noble 1990)
where the sparse understory vegetation is rarely
34
sufficient to carry a fire, the high volatile oil content
of the foliage combined with Rocky Mountain
juniper's inability to sprout following topkilling, re-
sults in high mortality rates (Wright and Bailey 1982).
Threatened or endangered species are examples
of sensitive species whose needs cannot be ignored.
Because they are the first species to drop out of
ecosystems, they are considered the weakest link in
the conservation of native biological diversity (Finch
and Ruggiero 1993). Providing habitats in an appro-
priate spatial and temporal arrangement is necessary
to maintain viable populations of sensitive species.
Thus, vegetation management is a major tool for
maintaining and restoring biodiversity, and for
delisting or avoiding listing of threatened and en-
dangered species (Kaufmann etal. 1994).
Adjusting fire management programs to meet the
needs of threatened and endangered species requires
an understanding of the role of fire in the long-term
sustainability of the ecosystems supporting these
species, and in the life history and habitat needs of
individual species. For example, the western prairie
fringed orchid is a federally listed threatened plant
species associated with swales (low-lying often wet
land) of the tallgrass prairie (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1989). Although the tallgrass prairie is prone
to burn every 1 to 5 years (Collins and Gibson 1990),
it is unlikely that swales supporting orchids burned
as often, especially during years when they were
flooded. Vogl (1969) describes a "quasi-equilibrium"
of a Wisconsin lowland maintained by floods during
wet periods and fires during droughts. Lowlands
supporting orchid populations likely burned through-
out the growing season during prolonged droughts;
however, fires that occur when orchids are actively
growing are apt to injure or kill them. Since fall
burning allows orchids to complete their life cycle,
and dry conditions and lightning are inclined to
occur late in the growing season, fall fires are a better
choice than spring burning to sustain orchid popula-
tions and their associated habitat (Bjugstad-Porter
1993).
MANAGE INTRODUCED SPECIES
The introduction of exotic species to new envi-
ronments without their associated parasites and pests
may be humankind's greatest environmental ma-
nipulation (Young and Evans 1976). Many invasive
exotic species have characteristics that enable them to
vigorously compete with native plants and to exploit
disturbed areas (Parker et al. 1993). In addition to
reviewing impacts of existing non-native species and
preventing the introduction of new ones (Kaufmann
et al. 1994), management plans should address how
to manage these species; fire is a useful tool in this
arena. Problem species include those purposely
planted, such as smooth brome, and a variety of
species accidentally introduced, such as cheatgrass,
Japanese brome, and leafy spurge (Lym 1991).
Although burning is not a panacea for discourag-
ing introduced species, with careful planning it can
be a useful tool, especially if native species are not
adversely affected. Burning at a time when plants are
most vulnerable is useful for suppressing undesir-
able species. For example, burning in mid-or late
May, when smooth brome tillers are either elongat-
ing or heading, reduces tiller density of smooth brome
by 50 percent when compared to unburned plots in
Nebraska (Willson 1992). Burning in May also en-
hances production of flowering culms of some native
warm-season grasses such as big bluestem (Willson
1992). However, burning is not a cure-all for reduc-
ing persistent species such as smooth brome, and the
outcome is strongly dependent on other factors such
as climate and precipitation patterns. Subsequent
burning in Pipestone, Minnesota failed to signifi-
cantly reduce smooth tiller density (Willson and
Stubbendieck 1996).
In addition to killing or injuring individual exotic
plants, burning can be used to make the habitat less
conducive to a species expansion. Spring burning in
western South Dakota killed Japanese brome seed-
lings for one growing season, and by reducing litter
accumulations, decreased future germination rates
(Whisendnt and Uresk 1990). In this case, spring
burning was detrimental to the production of one
native species, green needlegrass; enhanced produc-
tion of two others, buffalo grass and sand dropseed;
and did not change the production of a fourth,
threadleaf sedge (Whisenant and Uresk 1990).
A combination of burning and other manage-
ment tools may be valuable in managing invasive
species. For example, picloram plus 2,4-D applied in
the fall followed by spring burning reduced the stem
density and germination rates of leafy spurge in
North Dakota more than any other treatment tested
(Wolters et al. 1994). The key to success in managing
invasive species is to begin treatment before expan-
35
the invaded ecosystem rather than on the invader
(Hobbs and Humphries 1995).

SUMMARY
A strategy for using fire to manage native biologi-
cal diversity on rangelands in the Northern Great
Plains should consider natural disturbance patterns.
Fires historically occurred as often as every 1 to 5
years in the more mesic portions of the region, but
less frequently in areas of rough topography and in
lowlands. Lightning, a major ignition source in this
region, caused fires most often in July and August.
American Indians accidentally or intentionally set
fires in nearly every month of the year; however, the
greatest number were set in April, September, and
October. The end result of the erratic climate, fuels,
topographic relief and factors such as grazing ani-
mals, was that the role of fire was not constant in time
or space.
Reinstituting a fire regime based on historical
processes, including burning at varying intervals (to
reflect climatic patterns) and in differing seasons, is
the first step in developing a strategy for using fire to
manage for biological diversity on native rangelands
in this region. Including mid-summer burns, rather
than concentrating all prescribed burning in the spring
and fall, would better mimic natural disturbance
patterns. The second step involves adjusting fire
regimes to best sustain special habitats, such as wet-
lands and riparian zones, and sensitive species, espe-
cially threatened and endangered ones. Third, fire
prescriptions should be planned so that burning does
not enhance the spread of invasive species. The over-
all goal is to base the fire management strategy on an
understanding of historic processes and ecosystem
interactions, and resist techniques that rely on
unexamined conventions (Howe 1994).
