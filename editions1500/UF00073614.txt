Tun story of Romn-
. _ son Cursor: was writ-
ten by Daniel De Foe,
and first published in
1719, nearly one hundred and seventy yexus

ago. The author called it "The Life and

Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson

Crusoe, of York, Mariner: who lived eight

and-twenty years all alone in an uninhabited

island on the coast of America, near the

mouth of the great river Omonoque; hav-

ing been cast on shore by shipwreck, where
in all the men perished but himself. With
an account how he was at last strangely
delivered by Pirates. 'Written by himself."

They gave their books very long titles

in those days. But the people soon found
that this was a very interesting book, de-

spite its long title. No publisher wanted
to print it at first, but as soon as it was

published, a large number of copies were
sold, and publishers have been printing it

and selling it ever since.
'It was at first thought by some to be an

 
 

entirely true story, but it is not. It is, no
doubt, however, founded inpart onthe real
adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the son
of a shoemaker in Scotland. The following
brief account of him is given by Wilson,
the biographer of De Foe:

-"His real name was Selcraig, which he
changed to that of Selkirk, when he went
to see. He was born at Largo, in the
county of Fife, in 1676, and, after a com-
mon school education, was put to his

'father's business, which was that of a shoe-

maker. Being a spoiled child, he soon dis-
covered a. waywuldness of temper that gave
much uneasiness to his parents; whilst an
early propensity to the sea rendered his
employment irksome. At length an inci-
dent oecured that put him upon indulging
his humor; for, being brought under church-
censure for irregular conduct when he was
eighteen years of age, rather than submit,
he suddenly left home, and was never heard
of for six years. It is supposed that he was
with the buceaneers in the South Seas. In
1701 we find him again at Largo, but the
same intractable person as ever, being en-
gaged in constant broils with his family.
As the sea was his favorite element, he did
not icontinuo long in Scotland, but, going
to London, engaged with CuptninDampiel
 

upon a cruising expedition to the South
Seas. This was the voyage that lender-ed
his subsequent history so interesting to the
lovers of romance.

" Being appointed sailing-master of the
Cinque Ports galley, a companion to the
St. George, commanded by Dampicr, he left
England in the spring of 1703, and, after
various adventures, both vessels reached
the is1and of Juan Fernandez in the follow-
ing Fcbmnry. After staying some time to
refit, they sailed again in quest of booty;
but a violent quarrel arising between Sel-
kirk and his commander, Stradling, which
settled into a rooted animosity, the former
resolved to take the first opportunity of
leaving the vessel. This occurred at the
beginning of September, 1704, when her
crazy state obliged Strsdling to return to
Juan Fernandez for fresh repairs; which

being completed, Selkirk bade a. final adieu
to his comrades at the end of the same
month. Upon this island he lived by him.
self four years and four months, until he
was released by Captain Woodes Rogers,
in the month of February, 1709."

It has been said that this "did fellow
Wrote a story of his adventures and gave it
to Do Foo, and that De Foe made the story
of Ronmsorr Censor: from it, but this is not
believed to be true.

Whether the story is founded upon that
of Selkirk or not, it is one that every body
finds full of interest. The picture of Crusoe,
with his coilt and umbrella of goat skins,
watching day after day for a ship, until the
days pass into months and the months into
years, is one which readers will never tire
of, and is especially attractive to boys and

killed in the war with the Spaniards, and
the other had gone away from home and
had not been heard from; but I would be

against all the entreaties of my mother

fortunes and new" life of happiness.8 .

ROBINSON CR USOE.

 

He said that it was only the very wealthy
on the one hand, or the very desperate on
the other, who went abroad in search of
adventure. Mine was the middle state,
which he had found by experience was the
best state in the world. This was the
state of life that was envied both by kings
and beggars. This condition of life was

that he

Much more he told me to dissuade me
from going to sea, and he ended by saying
that though he should not cease to pray
for me. if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me.

I was deeply afi'ected by what my father
said, and I resolved not to think any more
of going abroad. But in a few days my
good resolutions were all given up and I
began to'think of running away from
home in spite of the entreaties of my

might have neither poverty nor

 

ever, as no opportunity presented its'elf, I
still remained at home, though I refused
to engage in any busiuem or to learn any
trade.

One day, being at Hall, I met one of my
companions who was going by sea to Lon-
don, and he invited me so strongly to go
with him that I consulted neither father
nor mother any more, nor so much as sent
them Word of it; but leaving them to hear
of it as they might, without asking God's
blessing, or my father's, without any con-
sideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the let
of September, 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London.

Never any young ndventurer's misfor
tunes, I believe, began sooner or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner
got out of the IIumber than the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightful manner ; and, as I had never
been at sea before, I was most inexpreesibly
sick in body, and terrified in mind. I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken
by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning
my duty. All the good counsels of my
parents came new fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to
the pitch of hardness to which it has come
since, rcproached me with the contempt of
advice, and the breach of my duty to God
and my father.

I thought that every wave would swallow
us up, and that every time the ship fell
into the hollow or trough of the sea, it
would never rise again. In this agony of

iather and the team of my mother. How- mind I made many vows and resolutions,118

Friday, and seeing a great oak-tree fit for
his purpose, he beckoned us tofollow ; and
doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the
tree, laying his gun down upon the ground,
at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree. The beareoon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance. The first
thing he did, he stopped at the gun,

Finally, Friday crept to the end of the
limb and dropped to the ground, and the
bear began to come down backward. Fri- .
duy picked up his gun, and when the hear
was nearly on the ground he shot him
through the head.

Friday went out on u long brunch, and
the bear followed him, " Now," said Fri-

began to shake the limb up and down, so
that the hear had all it could do to hold
on. "11811 the bear would move back,
Friday would sit still and tell him tocome

him, and get another shaking us before.

in the country, we should find. them there;
and this was a. small plain surrounded
with woods on every side, and a long nur-
ruw defile, or lane, which we were to pass
to get through the wood, and then we

.should come to the village where we were

to lodge. It was Within half, an hour of

the only way; so we formed in a moment,

The night was coming on, and the light
began to be dusky, which made it the
worse on our side; and, on 21. sudden, we
perceived two or three troops of wolves, one
on our left, one behind us, and one in our
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded
with them. lilowever, us they did not fall
upon us, we kept our way forward. Ai

 

another opening of the wood, we heard
the noise of a gun, and looking that way,

a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and

was a. necessity to keep a continual firing,

a train of powder to be poured along the
log, and I set fire to it. This frightened
them so that when we had fired another
volley and gave a great shout, they all
tinned tail and left us, and we resumed
our journey.

propensity to rambling should be worn
out, and I might, at sixty-one years of age,
have been a little inclined to stay at. home.

Yet all these things had no efiect upon
line, or at least not enough to resist the
strong inclination I had to go abroad again.
In particular, the desire of seeing my new
: plantation on the island, and Lhe colony I
left. there, ran in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagina-
tion ran upon it. all (lay; and my fancy
worked so steadily and strongly upon it
i that'- I talked of it in my sleep.

In this kind of temper I lived some. years.
My Wife, finally, told me very seriously,
one night, that she believed there was some
powerful impulse of Providence upon 1116
to visit my island again, and that I ought120

 

 

tog-o. This affectionate behavior in my wife
brought me a little out of the vapors, and
I began to think seriously of my folly,
and to give up my thoughts of going
away. I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some busi-
ness that might effectually tie me up from

 

any more excursions of this kind; for I
found that. thing return upon me chiefly
when I was idle, and had nothing to do.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in
the county of Bedford. I had a little
house upon it, and the land about it, I
found, was capable of great improvement.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled

my family, bought ploughs, harrows, a_

cart, wagon, horses, cows and sheep, and,
setting seriously to work, became in one
half-year a more country gentleman. My
thoughts were entirely taken up in manag-
ing my servants, cultivating the ground,
enclosing, planting, etc; and I lived, asI
thought, the most- agreeable life that na-
ture was capable of directing.

But in the middle of all this felicity, '

one blow from unseen Providence un-
hinged me at once, and drove me into a

deep relapse of the wandering disposition,
which, as I majyr say, being born in my
very blood, soon recovered its hold of me.
This blow was the loss of my wife. My
thoughts ran all away again into the old
aflair; my head was quite turned with the
whiinseys of foreign adventlu'es; and all
the pleasant, innocent amusements of my
farm, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and -
Were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste; in a word, I
resolved to let my farm, and return to Lon-
don. When I came to London, I was still
as uneasy as I was before; I had no relish
for the place, no employment in it, nothing
to do but to saunter about.

It was now the beginning of the year
1693, when my nephew, whom I had
brought up to the sea, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa. 110 came
to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to
him to . go a voyage for them to the East
Indies, and to China, as private traders.
"And now, uncle," says he, "if you will
go to sea with me, I will engage to land
you upon yom' old habitation in the island;
for we are to touch at the Brazils."

This so exactly hit with my temper that
I consented, but told him I would go no
further than my own island. He argued
against this, but to little purpose. How-
ever, I aud my man Friday went on board
in the Downs, on the 8th of January, 1693.
I took with me the frame of a sloop that
could be easily put together. I also took
with me some servants Whom I purposed
lo leave on the island, among them two
carpenters, a. smith, 8. very handy, in-
121

 

 

. genions fellow, who could do runny things,
and a tailor. In my cargo was an abun-
dance of cloths and wearing apparel, beds,
bedding, and household stuff, particularly
kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter,
brass, eta, and near a hundred pounds more
in iron-work, nails, tools of every kind,
staples; hooks, hinges, and ever r necessary
thing I could think of. '

I carried also a hundred spare arms,
muskets, and fusees; besides some pistols,
a 'aonsidcrable quantity of shot of all
sizes, three or four tons of lead, and {we
pieces of brass cannon; and, because I
knew not What time and what extremities
I was providing for, I carried a hundred

 

 

barrels of powder, besides swords, cub
188568, and the iron part of some pikes and
hulberts. So that, in short, we had a large
magazine of all sorts of stores; and I
made my nephew ourry two sxnnll quarter-
deck guns more than he wanted for his
ship, to leave behind if there was occasion;
that when we came there, we might build
a. fort, and man it against all sorts of
enemies. \

. Contrary winds first put us to the north.
ward, and we were obliged to put in at
Galway, in Ireland. Here I took in sev-
eral live hogs, and two cows with their
calves, which I reeolved, if I had a. good
passage, to put on shore in my island; but -

I shall trouble nobody with the little in-
cidents of wind, weather, currents, etc, on
the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten my
1 story, shall observe that I came to my old
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1695. It was with no small difficulty that
I found the place ; for, as I came to it, and
went from it, before, on the south and east:
side of the island, coming from the Brazils,
so now, coming in between the main and
the island, I did not know it when Isaw it.

'We went 011 shore on several islands,
I but none for my ptu'pnse; only this I
learned. by my coasting the shore, that I
was under one great mistake before, viz,
that the continent which I thought I saw
from the island I lived in, was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a
ridge of islands.

Thus, cosstimr fwm one island to an-
other, at length I came fairon the south
l side of my island, and presently knew the
125

 

 

very countenance of the place ; so I brought
the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with
the little creek where my old habitation
was. ,

As soon as I saw the place, I called for
Friday, and asked him if. he knew where
he was? He looked about a little, and,
presently clapping his hands, cried, "Oh,

 

yes; oh, there--oh, yes; oh, there!" point '

ing to our old habitntion, and fell dancing
and capering like a. nnul fellow; and I had
much ado to keep him from jumping into
the sea, to swim ashore to the place.

"Well, Friday," says I, "do you think'

we shall find anybody here? and do you
think we shall find your father?" "No,
no," wys he, shaking his head, " no see
him more; no, new! more see him again.
He long ago die; he much old man."

"Well, well," says I, "Friday, you don't

As soon as Friday told me he saw
people, I caused the English ancient to be

notice we were. friends; and immediately
ordered 11. boat out, taking Friday with me;

As we went on shore, the first man I
fixed my eye upon was the. Spaniard
whose life I had saved. I ordered nobody
to go on shore at first "ut- myself; but
there was no keefiing Friday in the boat,
for the affectionate creature had spied his
father at a distance, and if they had not
let him go ashore, he would have jumped
into the sea. He was no sooner on shore,
but he flew away to his father, like an
arrow out of a bow. It would have made

any man shed team, in spite of the Iii-Incest
resolution, to have seen the first transports
of this poor fellow's joy when he came to
his .father: how he. embraced him, kissed
him, stroked his face, took him up in his

 

 

arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay
down by him; then stood and looked at
him for a quarter of an hour together;

then lay down on the ground, and, stroked
his legs, and kissed them, and then got up
again, and stared at him; one Would have

would have made a dog laugh the next

way. In the morning, he walked along the
shore again with his old father, several
hours, always leading him by the hand, as
if he had been a. lady; and every now and
then he would come. to the boat to fetch
something or other For him, either a lump
of sugar, a. drum, n biscuit cake, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the
afternoon, his [relics run another way; for
then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and
make a thousand antic postures and ges-
tures; and all the while he did this he
would be talking to him, and telling him
one story or another of his travels, and of
what happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, it the same filial affection
was to be found in Christians to their
parents, in our part. of the world, one
would be tempted. to say there would

lmrdly have been any need of the fifth
munmandment.

The first Spaniard, whom I amid, I knew
very well, was he whose life I luKl saved.
He. came towards the boat, and he not only
did not know me at first, but he hurl no

then, beckoning to the person that attended
him, bade him go and call out his eom~
rndes.

110 then asked me if I would walk to
my old habitzi'tioli, where he would give me
possession of my own house again. So I
walked along with him; but, alas! I could
no more find the place again than if I had

was come, till I sl'mke to him. " Seignior,"
said I, in Portuguese, " do you not know
me?" At. which he spoke not aword, but
threw his arms abroad, and saying some
thing in Spanish thatI did not perfectly

hear, came formird and embraced me, tell- '

ing me he was inexcusable not to know that
face again that he had once seen as if an
angel from Heaven, sent to save his life;

never been there; for they had phniied so
many trees, und in ten years' time they
were grown so big, that, in short, the place
was inaccessible, except by such windings

, and blind ways as they themselves only,

who made them, could find.

I asked him what put them upon all
these fortifientiona He told me 1 would say
there was need enough of it, when they
had given me an account how they had
 

passed their time. Nothing that ever bei'ell
him in his life, he said, was so ulllicting to
him at first, as thedisappointment when he '
came back to the island and found I was
not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called
them) that were left behind, and of Whom,
he said, he had a long story to tell me, the
Spaniards all thought themselves much
better among the savages, only that their
number was so small; "and," says he, " had
they been strong enough, we had been all
long ago in purgatory;" and with that he
crossed himself on the breast. "But, sir,"
says he, "I hope you will not he displeased ,
when 1 shall tell you how, forced by neces. l

sit-y, we were obliged to disarm them, and I, I

masiem, but would be our murderers." I
answered, l was afraid of it when l left
them there, and nothing troubled me at
my parting from the island, but that they
were not come bxwk, that I might have put
them in possession of everything first, and
left the others in a state of subjection, as
they deserved.

'While I was saying this, the man
came Whom he had sent back, and with
him eleven more. In the dress they were
in, it was 'inxpowible to guess what nation
they were of ; but he made all clear both
to them and to me. Fimt he turned to
me, and pointing to them, said, "These,
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe
their lives to yell;" and then taming to
them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was; upon which they all
came up, one by one, not as it' they had
been sailors, and ordinary fellows, but
really as if they had been noblemen, and I
a monarch.

As soon as lhml retired with the SPHXJ- way 1 baked my bread, bred up Lame

inrd, I had him relate to me all that had
napmned, and first I asked him about his
. 1oynge to the main, as I then thought it,
with Friday's father. He told me they had
a. safe voyage and his friends were over-
joyed to see him, and they had thought
him surely dead. They borrowed some
large canoes from the savages under the

goats, and planted my corn; and, in a
Word, everything I did. They began to
live very eociably; and the head Spaniard,
who had seen, pretty much of my methods,
nnd Friday's father together, managed all
their affairs; but as for the Englishmen,
they did nothing but rumble about the
island, shoot parrots, and c'ntch tortoises;

 

 

 

pretense ol' going a-fiehing, and reached the
islnud in safety.

The only just thing the rogues did was
that, when the Spaniards came ashore, they
gave my letter to them, and gave them
m'ovisions, as I ordered them; also they
gave them the long,r Paper of directions
which I had left with them, containing
the particular methods which I took for
managing ever ' part of my life there; the

and when they exnne home at night, the
Spaniards had their suppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied
with this, had the others but let them
alone, which, hon-ever, they could not find
in their hearts to (lo long; but, like the dog
in the nunger, they would not eat thenr
selves, neither would they let the others
eat. The difference, nevertheless, was at
that but trivial, and such as is not'worth
 

 

relating, but at last it broke out int-o open

war; and though, it is true, the. first rela-
tion of it came from the Spaniards them-
selves, whom I 111113r call the. necuSerS, yet
when I came to o\nmine the. fellows, they
could not den)- n word of it.

But befow I come to the 1>111t1culms of
this 11111131 must supply 11 defect 111 m)-
formor relation; and this was, I forgot to
set down, muong the rest, that just as we
wele weighing the anchor to set sail, there
happened a. little quarrel on board of our
ship, and the captain, in separating them,
threatened "guin to'hung them when he
came to England. This so flighwned two
of them that they stole the ship's pinnace,
and taking two muskcts and some other
wenpons, they ran away to their oom-
pnnions on shore. But the. other rogues
would not have them to live with them,
but made them go and build huts for
themselves. This they had done when the
Spaniards came. The latter gave them
some corn to plant, and they began to live
prettywcll. But the three rogues would
not let them alone, but tore up their crops
and set their hut on fire.

But not to crowd this part with an ac-
count of the lesser part of their rorruei 16s,
such as treading (low 11 their corn, shooting

 

three young kids and a she-goat, which the
Poor men had got to breed up tame for
their store; and,.in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner, it forced the
two men to snch'a desperation, that they
resolved to fight them all three, the first
time they had a fair opportunity.

It happened that the day before, two of
the Spanim'ds, having been in the woods,
had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom,
for distinction, I called the honest men,
and he hurl made a sad complaint to the
Spaniards ot' the barbarous usage they had

,met with from their three countrymen.

When the Spaniards came home at night,
and thev u-'eie all at supper, one of them
took the heedom to r'ep1ove the thee
Emrlislunen, though in very gentle and
1nnnne1ly terms, and asked. them how they
could be so cruel. -

One of the Englishmen returned very
briskly, " What had they to do there? that
they came on shore without leave; and
that they should not 1)]:111t or build upon
the island; it was none of their ground."
"W'hy," said the Spaniard, very calmly,
"Seignior Inglese, they must- not starve."
The Englishman replied, "They might
starve; they should not plant nor-build in
that place. They should. be servants,
____-_--__.._______----------------_

and Work PS01 them." "But, " my; the
Spaniard, "they sue not bought with your
money; you have no right to make them
servants.' The Englislnnz'm answered,
" The island was theiis; the governor had
given it to them, and no 1mm had anything

13!.

 

the Spaniards had given notice of their
coming, and Atkins:3 p10posed that they
should til-k6 revenge on the Spaniards.

As soon us they had made this bloody;
bargain, they fell to work with the poorj
men's habitation.

They (lid not set fire,

 

to do there but then'ieelves;u and with
that, swore that they would go and burn
all their new huts. " W hy," said the
Spaniard, " by the same rule we would be
your slaves too." "And so you shall,"
says the bold (log, " before we are done
with you." With that, they strode off with
their guns.

They intended to wait till midnight, and
then go murder the two men and burn
their huts; but they fell asleep and did not
awake until their victims were gone abroad
in the morning. Then they concluded that

indeed, to anything. but they yulled down
both their houses, and pulled them so limb
from liml) that they left not the least stick
standing, or source any Sign on the ground
Where they stood. They tore all their little
collected household stufi in pieces, and
tlnew everything about; in such 3, mannei,
that the 11001 men afte1wn1'ds found some.
of thei1 things a mile off their habitation
When they 111d done this, they pulled up.
all the young trees which the poor men
had planted; pulled up an inclosure they
had made to secure their cattle and their
com; and, in a word, sacked and plundered
everything as completely as a. horde of
Tartan would have done.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

The two men were, at this juncture, gone
to find them out, and had resolved to fight
them wherever they had been, though they
were but two to three; so that, had they
met, there certainly would have been
bloodshed among them, for they were all
very stout, resolute fellows, to give them
their due. '

But Providence took more care to keep
them asunder than they themselves could

(10 to meet; for, as if they had dogged one
another, when the three were gone thither,
the two were here; and afterwards, when
the two Went hack to find them, the three
were come to the old habitation again. \Ve
shall see their different conduct presently.

\Vheu the three came back like furious
creatures, flushed with the rage, which the
work they had been about had put them
into, the)r came up to the Spaniards, and
told them what they had done, by way
of scoff and bravado; and one of them

 

stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if
they had been a couple of boys at play,
taken hold of his hat as it was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering
in his face, says to him, " And you, Sei-
gnior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same
sauce, if you do not mend your manners."
The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil
man, was as brave a man as could be,
having no weapon in his hand, stepped
gravely up to him, and, with one blow of
,his' fist, knocked him down; at which one
 

of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired
his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. He
missed his body, indeed, for the bullets
went through his hair, 'but one of them
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard
believe he was more hurt than he really
was, and that put him into some heat, for
before he acted all in a perfect calm. But
now, resolving to go through with his work,
he stooped, and took the fellows musket
whom he had knocked down, and was just
going to shoot the man Who had fired at
him, when the rest; of the Spanianls, being
in the cave, omne out. and calling [.0 him
not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the
other two, and took their arms from them.

The rogues went away swearing ven-
geance, but when they had wandered about
for three days, they came back nearly

133

l
starred, and begged to be taken in. So

the Spanim'ds took them in again, and gave
them their arms, first making them go and

    

9

build up the hats and fences they had
destroyed. They had just. begun to be in-
solenb main when an macidenl; happened
which made them lay by all private resent;-
meut's, and look to the preservation of their
lives.

The Spaniard Whom I had saved and
who was then the leader or the governor, I
feeling restless one night, got up and
\s'andered abroad to see if anything was
the matter. He had not gone far when he
was surprised to see several fires and a
great number of savages walking about
them. He went back and told the rest,
and they all kept very close till morning. ,
It seems that the savages had had a. great~
battle in their own country, and both sides

had come here to eat. their prisoners. But '

neither Party knew that the other was on
the island. In the morning, when they
found it out, they fell to fighting again,

and a great number were killed. Three of 1

them ran away, right into our habitation
and were captured by the Spaniards.
When the battle was over, the victors

raised a: great shout, and took to their=
canoes, and shortly after the others fol
lowed, none of them who went away
having found out that them were inhabi-
tants on the island. The great danger they
had been in tamed even the three English
brutesl have been speaking of; and for a

grub while after, they were tractable, and-
went about the common business of the
whole society well enough. But some time
after this they fell into such simple meas-
ures again, as brought them into a great
deal of trouble. .

They had taken three prisoners, as I
observed ; and these three being lusty, stout
young fellows, they made them servants,
and taught them to work for them; and
as slaves this)' did well enough. But they
did not take their measures with them as I
did by my man Friday, and so they never
had them to assist them and figlltlor them'
as I had Friday, who was as true to me as
the very flesh upon my bones.

And now the}r had another broil with
the three Englishmen; one of whom,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves,
 

because the fellow had not done some-
thing right which be bid him do, drew a
hatchet Out of a frog~belt, in which he
wore it, and fell upon the poor savage to
kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was
by, seeing him give the fellow a bar-barons
cut in his shoulder, placed himself between
him and the savage. The fellow, being
enraged the more at this, struck at the
Spaniard with his hatchet, when the
Spaniard knocked him down with a Ehovel.

The two other Englishmen rushed on the I of being shot He gave them grain and

Spaniard, and the other Spaniards coming
to the rescue, a sharp fight: ensued, and
then the three Englishmen fi'erc taken
prisoners.

Some of the Spaniards were then for
putting them to death; but the merciful
governor decided that they should be
tumed awny to live by themselves, and
forbidden to come near them under pain

provisions and all else that they needed,
except arms and ammunition, and they
went; and huilded huts on a remote part of
the island. Here they lived for nearly a.
year, when they came in one day and.
asked for a canoe and arms, and said they
would go over to the mainland and seek
their fortunes. The Spaniards gave them
arms and ammunition and some tools, andon.

 

"A storm, you fool !" replies he ; "do you
call that a storm? Why, it was nothing at
all; give us but a good ship and sea-room,
and we think nothing of such a squall of
wind as that; but you're but a. fresh-water
sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of
punch, and we'll forget all that."

To make short this sad part of my story,
we went the way of all sailors; the punch
was made, and I was made halfdrnuk with
it; and in that one night's wickednew I
drowned all my lepentance, all my reflec-
tions upon my past conduct, all my resolu-
tions for the future. In a word, as the sea.
was returned to its smoothness, so the
hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
of being swallowed up by the sen. being
forgotten, and the current of my former
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows

ROBINSON CR USOE.

 

I found, indeed, some intervals of refleo
tion; and the serious thoughts did, as it
wow, endeavor to return again sometimes;
but I shook them OR, and roused myself
from them, and applying myself to drink-
ing and company, soon mastered the return
of those fits. But; I was to have another
lrial for it still ; and Providence, as in such
cases generally it does, resolved to leave me

- rntimly without excuse; for if I would

not take this for a deliverance, the next
was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we

' came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind

having been contrary, and the weather
calm, we had made. but little way since the
storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, for seven or eight days,
during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same Roads.

We had not, however, rid here so long
but we should have tided it up the river,
but that the wind blew too fresh, and,
after we had lain four or five days, blew
very hard. However, the Roads being
reckoned as good as an harbor, the anchor-
age good, and our ground-tackle very
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not
in the least appiehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the
manner of the sea. But the eighth day, in
the morning, the Wind increased, and we
had all hands at work to strike our top-
masts, and make everything snug and close,
that the ship might ride as easyas possible.

having baked bread enough to serve them i battle were eaten. There had been a great

amonth, and given them as much goats'
flesh as they could eat while it was sweet,
and a great basket of dried grapes, n. 'pot
of iresh water, and a young kid alive, they
boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage
over the sen, where it wus at least forty
miles brand. The Spaniards called after
them, "Ban veg/(90!" and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.

But after two-und-twentzy days' absence
they all came back, and upon being ques-
tioned told of their adventures. The}; hull
reached what they thought. the main land
and found it only an island. The savages
rushed clown to the shore to fight them, so
they did not land. They landed, however,
at another islnnrl where they were well
treated. On that island, they were told
that only the men and women taken in

 

fight, and the king then had a large number
Waiting to be killed and eaten. "Till
Atkins in fun asked if they might have
some, and the savages brought down to the
boat fivewomen and eleven men.

As brutish as these fellows were at home.
their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do. To refuse
the prisoners would have been the highest

"Tr

affront to the savage gentry that could he
offered them. After some debate they
resolved to accept of them; and, in return,
they gave the savages one of their hatchels,
an old key, a. knife, and six or seven of
their bullets; which, though they did nut
understand their use, they seemed particu-
larly pleased with; and then tying the poor
(arentnl'es' hands behind them, they dragged
the prisoners into the boat for our men.
 

0n the way back, the)r stopped at the
first island and set eight of them at lih-
city, and the others they had brought to
our island and then had them bound in
their huts, so they could not run away.
Upon hearing such a remarkable'story, all
went over to the huts to look at them.
Here they eat, all of them stark naked,
First, there were three men, lusty, comely
fellows, well~slmped,straight and fair limbs,
about thirty and thirty-five years of age;
and five women, whereof two might be
from thirty to forty; two more not above
four or live-and-tu-'enty; and the fifth, a
tall, comely maiden, about. sixteen or seven'
teen. The women were \vell-Im'ox'ed,sg1'ee-
able persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, hall they
been perfectly white, would have passed
for very handsome women, even in London
itself. '

Only one of them, a woman, could
understand Friday's father, but through
her we soon made them understand that
they were not; to be eaten, nor even killed.
At this, when we untied them, they all
fell to dancing, and then they all began to
take up things to signify that they would
work. As there were five women and
five Englislnnen, the Spaniards let these
last each choose one for a wife, which they
did. And now each one built a hut- for
himself, the two honest ones in one place,
and the three rogues in another.

Some time after this five or six canoes
of savges came on shore. Our men kept
within doors lcill the Canoes Were gone,
and then it was discovered that they had
left three of their number behind, and.
they lay under a tree fast; asleep. After

 

 

consultation it was resolved to take them
prisoners; and they did so, The poor'
fellows were strangely frightened when
they were seized upon and bound; and
afraid, like the women, that they should be
murdered and eaten for it seems those
people think all the world do as they do;
but they were soon made easy as to that.
One' of them run away to the woods
and was never seen again. He probably

escaped with some ennoes that (mine ashore
soon after.

The first testimony they had that this
fellow had given intelligence of them was,
that, about two months after, six canoes of
savages came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to

W' hen our men cmue out from the tree,
the savage who was not killed begun to
make piteons means for his life, so they
tied him to a. tree and ran on to their
wives. Soon after, the other savages went
away as they (mine. It, was five or six

months before they saw any more of the

 

come before, and landed about a mile. from
the habitation of the two Englishmen,
where this escaped man had been kept.
As they were coming directly towards
their huts, the two men sent their wives
and some of their goods into the Woods,
and went a little way themselves and hid A
in 5-. hollow tree. The savages burned.
their huts and then suittererl about the:
island. A number of them (awning up to-
the hollow tree, the two Englishmen fired
and killed all but one. Among the killed

to make preparation. In the morning

with the Spaniards. To arm these, they

their situation; only that Will Atkins,

 

fending-pieces, five muskets or fowling-
pieces, two swords and three old hulberts.

To their slaves they did not give
either musket or fusee; but they had each
a long stuff, with a great spike of iron fas
toned into eneh end of it, and by his side
a hatchet ; also every one of our men had
a hatchet. Two of the women could not
he previliled upon, but the)r would come
into the fight, and they had bows and

 

arrows, which the Spaniards hurl taken
from the savages when the first action hap-
pened, and the women had hatehets too.
The Spaniard governor commanded the
whole; and W' ill Atkins, who, though a
dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a.
' most (luring, bold fellow, commanded

under him. The savages came forward

likr lions; and our men, which was the

139

who now proved a most useful fellow, with
six men, Wns planted just behind a small
thicket of bushes, as an ad vaneed guard,
with ordens to let the first of them pass by,
and then fire into the middle of them, and
us soon as he had fired, to make his retreat
as nimbly us he could round a pnrt of the
wood, and so come behind the Spaniards.
When the savages came on, they ran

 

straggling about every way in heaps, out
of all nmnner of order, and Will Atkins
let about fifty of them pass by him ; then
seeing the rest come in u, very thick throng,
he orders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their muskets with six 01' seven hnl-
lets apiece. How mnn)r they killed or
wounded they knew not, but the conster-
nation and surprise was inexpreseible

worst oi their fate, had no advantage in among the savages. They were frightenedto the lust degree to hear such a dreadful
noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in
the middle of their flight, W'ill Atkins and
his other three let fly again among the
thickest of them; and in less than a min-
ute, the first three being loaded again, gave
them a third volley.

Had W'ill Atkins and his men mtired
immediately, as they were ordered to (h),
or had the rest of the body been at hand,
to pour in their shot continually, the sav-
ages had been effectually routed; for they
thought they were killed by the gods with
thunder and lightning; but some of the
savages who were at a distance spying
them, came upon them behind, and wounded
Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the
Indian slaves.

ROBINSON CH USOE.

 

 

Onr men being thus hard laid at,
ietreated to n rising ground in the wood;
and the Spaniards, afterfiring three volleys
upon them, retreated also; for their num-
ber was so great, and they were so deeper.
lttfi, that though above fifty of them were
killed, and. more than as many Wounded,
yet they came on in the teeth of our men,
fearless of danger, and shot their arrows
like a cloud.

The Spaniard governor having drawn
his little body up together upon a rising
ground, Atkins, though he was wounded,
would have them march and charge again
altogether at once; but the Spaniard re-
plied: "Seignior Atkins, you see how their
wounded men fight; let them alone till
morning; all the wounded men will be
stiff and sore with their wounds, and faint.
'wilh the loss of blood; and so we shall
have the fewer to engage." This advice
 

 

was good; but 'Will Atkins replied mer-
rily, "T hut is true, seignior, and so shall I
too ; and that is the reason I would go on

while I am warm." f'Well, Seignior
Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you luwe he-
haved gallnntly, and done your part; we
will fight for you if you cannot come on;
but I think it best to stny till morning."
So they Waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night,
and they found the savages in great dis-
order about. their dend and wounded men,
and a. grant noise and hurry among them
where the}r lay, they afterwards resolved
to fell upon them in the night ' They
come so near where the thickest of them
lay, that, before they were Seen or heard,
eight of them fired in upon them, and did
dreadful execution upon them; in half a
minute more, eight others fired after then],
pouring in their small shot in such a
quantity, that abundance were killed and
wounded; and all this while they were not

able to see who hurt them, or which ivay
to fly.

They fought desperately, but so many
Were killed and wounded, the!) the rest
soon fled to their boats and put to see.
But a dreadful storm coming on that even-

others driven back to the island, seeing
which our men went over and filed guns
to "frighten them, and they all ran into the
Woods. Our men then destroyed all their

home, so that they could not get back to

their nation to bring another army. The
savages kept hid in the woods most of the
time, but they managed to destroy the
crops and do much dunnge. Having no
weapons, they were reduced to u deplor-
able condition, some of them even starv-

ing it up like basket-work all the way
round. Our men were so token with it,
that they got the wild savages to come and
do the like for them; so that when I came
to see the two Englishmen's colonies, they
looked, at a distance, as if they all lived
like bees in a hive. As for Will Atkins,
who was now become a very industrious,
useful, and sober fellow, he had made him~
self such a. tent of basket-work as, I be-
lieve, was never seen. It was one hundred
and twenty paces round on the outside, as

and only a few iron spikes, which he made
himself too, out of the old iron thut I had
left there; and, indeed, this follow showed
abundance of ingenuity in several fixings
which he had no knowledge of. He mudo
him a. forge, with a. pair of wooden bel
lows to blow the fire. He made himsel'x
charcoal for his work; and he formed out
of the iron crows a middling good anvil to
hummer upon. In this manner he made
many things, but; especially hooks, staples,
and spikes, bolts and hinges.
[ lmd many talks with the Spaniards
about their adventures among the savages.
They told me they had given up all hope of
getting away. They were compelled to
go with them to their wars, and in one of
them the Spaniard, whom I had rescued,
was taken prisoner. They were very

grateful to me for sending for them, and v

were very polite and kind in every way.
So I called thcm all together one day, nnd
showed them the stores I had brought,
and was going to leave them, for I had
not come to take them away. First, I
asked them, one by one, if they were
willing to stay, and would give up all
unimositics, one to another. And each
told me he would.

' Will Atkins, with abundance of frank
nets, Suit] they had met with affliction
enough to make them all sober, and 'ene-
mics enough to make them all friends;
that, for his part, he would live and die
With'them ; that they had done nothing to
him, but what his own mad humor made
necessary; and that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and
brutish things he had done to the-m; and
as for going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years.

I cannot exprona what pleasure sat upon
the wuntenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of
them. They told me Iwas a. father to
them; and that having such 3. correspond-
cut as Iwns in so remote apart of the
World, it would make them forget that
they were left in a desolate place; and
they all engaged to me not to leave the
galace without my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I

1413

 

 

had brought with me. particularly the
tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters,
all of them most necessary people; but,
above all, my general nrtiflcer, than whom
they could not name anything that was '
more useful to them. And the tailor, to
show his cone/urn for them, went to work
immediately, and, With my lcuve, made
them every one a. shirt, the first thing he
did; and what was still more, he taught
the women not only how to stitch, but he
made them assistto make the shirts for
their husbands, and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scan-cc need men-
tion how useful they were ; for they took
to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things,
and made clever, convenient; tables, tools,
hedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and
everything they wanted of that. kind. But '
to let them see how nature made artificers
at first, I carried the carpenters to see "I ill
Atlcine' basket-house, as I called it: and
 

they both owned they never saw an instance
of such natural ingenuity before, nor any
thing so regular and handilyr bunt, at least
of its kind. And one of them, when he saw

it, after musing a good while, turning about
m me, "I am sure," says he, "that man
has no need of us; you need do nothing

but give him tools."

him that he realized what a grant sinner he
had been, u.n(l he had resolved to be a
Christian." Both. he and his wife were
ready to be baptized, and the priest pen
formed that office, and then married them.

The last thing I did before I went away
was to take a Bible to Will Atkins. The
mm was so confounded, that he was not
able to speak for some time; but recover-
ing himself, he takes it with both his
hands, and turning to his wife, "Here,

hear what we. have said? Here's. the
hook I prayed for when you and I
hncelcd down under the bush; now God
has heard us and sent it." When he had
said so, the man fell into transports of
passionate joy.

Having now done with the island, I left
them all in good circumstances, and in a
flourishing condition, and went on board
my ship again on the 6le of May. I prom-
ised to send them further relief from the
Brazils, and particularly I promised to
send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs
and cows. As to the two cows and calves
which I brought from England, we had
been obliged to kill them at sea, for want
of hay to feed them.

About three days after we had sailed,
while we were becalmed, a great. fleet. of

15!

canoes were seen approaching us. I had the
ship brought to an anchor; the boats were
put overboard and manned, forl was afraid
only that they would set the ship on fire.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed
to be struck with wonder and astonishment,
us at a sight which doubtless they had
never seen before. They came up, how-
ever, vex-y near to us, and seemed to go
about to row round us; but we called to
our men in the boats not to let them come
too near them. Our men beckoned with
1 their hands to keep them book, which they
. understood very well, and went back; but
at their retreat about. fifty arrows came on
board us from those boats, and one of our
men in the long-boat was wounded. How-
ever, I called to them not to fire by any
means ; but we handed. down some deal
boards into the bonfiwith which they made
: a kind of fence to cover them. They
 

 

rowed a little farther out to sea, till they
came dimctly broadside with us, and then
rowed. down straight upon us. Upon this
I ordered all my men to keep close, lest
they should shoot any more arrows, and
made all our guns ready. I made Friday
go out upon the deek,-and call out aloud
to them in his language, to know what
they meant; which accordingly he did.
Whether they understood him or not, that
I knew not; but immediately Friday cried
out they were going to shoot, and, unhap-
pily for him, poor fellow, they let fly
about three hundred of their arrows, and,
to my iuoxpressible grief, killed. poor
Friday, no other man being in their sight. I
was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty
servant and companion, that I immediately
ordered five guns to be loaded with small
shot, and four Wit-h great, and gave them
such a broadside as they had never heard
in their lives before. They were not above
half a cable's length ofi when we fired;
and our gunnem took the aim so well that
thirteen or fourteen of their canoes were
split and overeat, and the men all set

'a-swimming; the rest, frightened out of
their wits, scoured away as fast as they
could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our
shot; so I suppose that many of them
were lost

not be; so we went on. Poor honest
Friday! We buried him with all the de-

him into atcoliiu, and throwing him into

guns for him; and so ended the life of llle

we arrived at the Brazils in about twelve
days' time. My old partner was glad to
see me, and sent me some very hu'ndseme
prevents; and when I told him of the frame
of the sloop I had brought, and that it was
my design to send some supplies to the
people on my island, he offered to attend
to it [or me.

Accordingly, he got. hands, and finished
the sloop in a very few days; and I gave
the master of her such instructions that he
could not; miss the place ; nor did he, as I
had an account from my partner after-

heurd one of our men make a terrible noise
on the shore, calling out for God's sake to
bring the boat in, and come and help
them. At the some time I henrd the fire of
five mmkets, which was the number of
guns they had, and then three times over;
for, it seems, the natives here were not so
easily frightened with guns as the savages
were in America, where I had to do with
them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately
from sleep with the noise, I caused the

We took up seven of our men, and with
difficulty enough too, three of them being
very ill wounded; and that which was
still worse wnsthat while we stood in the
boat to take our men in, we were in as

as the captain carried to trade with the
natives, we set sail, and made a most suc-
cessful voyage.

 

My suwem I owed entirely to my
friend'the captain, who first showed me
what things to buy in London, and then
how to trade them with the natives of
Guinea for gold-dust. On the voyage, he
taught me the use of the ship's instruments,
by which an account of our course was

' taken every day, and I became a navigator
as well as 8. Guinea. trader.

. My friend died soon after his arrival at
home, hutI resolved to go the game my
age again on the same ship. This was a
most unhappy voyage, for though I left a
good. portion of my money with myfriend's
widow, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes.

Our ship making her course towards the
Canary Islands, was surprised, in the gray
of the morning, by a Moorish rover of Sal-
lee, who gave. chase to us. we crowded as
much canvas us our yards would spread, or
our masts carry, to get clear; but finding
the pimto gained upon us, we prepared to
fight, our ship having twelve guns and the
i rogue eighteen. About three in the. after

brought eight of our guns to hear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him,
which made him sheer ofi again, after
retlu-ning our fire, and pouring in also his

close.

to defend ourselves; but laying us on hoard

in the boat, and they were as sure to hit

to the ship, and the captain, hearing our
firing, pretty well understood us; and
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as
near the shore as he durst with the ship,
and then sent out another bout, with ten
hands in her, to assist us, and they towed
us buck to the ship,

"'e soon learned the cause of the fray.
It seems that a. young woman had been
taken by one of our sailors and carried into
the woods. An old woman, who was with
the young one, made a great outcry, and
that brought on the attack. We had one
mun killed, and the rest came 011' free, ex'

trouble, for he had not come back from the

took twenty stout follows and wont quietly

solved on going on bomd; but the boat-
swuin and his party were resolved to make
a visit 'to the Indian town, where these
dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked
me to go along with them; and if they
could find them, as they still fancied they
should, they did not doubt of getting a
good booty; and it might be they might

was sitting on the ground, in order to go
to the boat. One or two of the men began
to opportune me to go ; and, when I re-
fused, began to grumble, and soy they were
not under m y command, and they would go.

you go with me? I'll go for one." Jack

When they came to the Indian town,
three of them, who were is little before the
rest, called out and told them that they had
found Tom J eflfry; they all ran up to the
place, where they found the poor fellow
hanging up naked by one arm, and his
throat cut. There was an Indian house

just by the tree, where they found sixteen
or seventeen of the principal Indians, and
two or three of them wounded by our shot;
and our men found they Were awake, and

so enraged them, as before, that they swore
to one another to be revengedmnd that not
an Indian that came into their hands should
have any quarter ; and to work they went
immediately, and in a quarter of an hour
they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and murdered so many of the peo-
ple that the rest rest run off to the woods.
'Vhen our men cmue back, we set sail to
Bengal. 0n the way I blamed the men
very much for what they had done, and
this led to further trouble. I had gone on
shore at Bengal, and the men came and
told me they were resolved to leave me
there, for if I went hack to the ship they
would all leave her. I sent- for the captain,
and told him it would be so hard for him
to get sailors, that I had better stay, so he
left me, with all my goods and with plenty
of money. _

Here I met an English merchant, and to-
gether we bought a ship and made trading
voyages to the Spice Islands and to China,

' with great profit. We then sold our ship,resolved to voyage no more. But one day
a Dutch ship came into port, and the man
who claimed to be the xuiptsin offered to
sell her to us cheap, and we boght. All
the cxew left her, which we thought very
strange, but we afterwards learned that
they had mutinicd and murdered the cop

had sold the ship to us. We picked up
some English and some Dutch sailors, and
resolved to go to China again. '

in, and, for ought I see, you huve no know-
ledge of it." "I know no danger Inmin,"
says I, "but that my ship is leaky, nudI
cannot find it out; but I intend to lay her
aground tomorrow, to see if I can find it."
" Do you know, sir," said he, " the town of ,

Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this
river; and there are two large English ships
about five leagues on this side, and three
'Duteh?" I turned short upon him, and
said: "Sir, I wish you would. explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I
have to be afraid of any of the Company's
ships, or Dutch ships. What can they
have to say to me ?" " W'ell, sir," says he,
"if you think yourself secure, you must
take your chance; I am sorry your fate
should blind you against good advice; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea
immediately, you will the very next tide
be attacked by five long-boats full of men,
and perhaps, if you are taken, you will be
hanged f or a pirate."
This led me to question him further, and
I found that he himself took us for pirates,
knowing the story- of the killing of the
- captain and the seizing of the ship by the
rascal who sold her to us. As soon as I
reached the side of the ship, my partner
told me he had stopped the leak, and we
weighed anchor and set sail at once. It
was not long before we found ourselves
chased by five boats. As they came up
and were making to board us, we poured
in a broadside upon them which sank ono
boat, and running out our two long guns,
we kept fixing till the rest gave up the
chase. We picked up three of their men
and went on our way, and reached the
coast of Cochin China. As we did not find
the ship so perfectly tight and soundas we
desired, we resolved while we were at this
place to lay her on shore, and take out
what heavy things we hurl on board, and
clean her bottom, it 'poSsible, to find out
where the leaks were. '

 

The inhabitants, who had never "been
amluainted with such a sight, came wow.
dering down the shore to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie down on one side in
such a manner, and heeling in towards the
shore, and not seeing our men, who._were
at work on her bottom with stages, and
with their boats on the ofl-side, they pre-
sently concluded that the ship was cast
away, and lay fast on the ground. On this
supposition, they all came about us in two
or three houis' time, with ten or" twelve
large boats, intending, no doubt, to have
come on board and plundered the ship, and
if they found us there, to have enrried us
away for slaves to their king, or whatever
they call him.

"When they came up to the ship, and
began to row round her, they discovered
us all hard at work on the outside of the
ship's bottom and side, washing, and grav-

'ing and stopping, as every seafaring man

he could do so very well, and that there
" was a great 'Dutch ship gone up that way
just before. This gave me a little shock,
for a Dutch ship was now our terror. The
old man found me a little confused and
under some concern when he named a.
Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir, you need
be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ;
I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation? You are no pirates ;, what
need'you fear?" "'Vhy, seignior," said I,
" I_hope there are no pirates in these seas.
Wlfarc hut in an ill condition to meet
with them, for you see we have but a small
force, and are but veryr weakly manned."
" Oh, sir," says he, " don't be concerned; I
do not know that there have been any
pirates in these sons for fifteen years, except
one, which was seen, as I hear, in the Bay
of Shun, about a month since ;' but you nmy
be assured she is gone to the southward;
nor was she a ship of any great force, or

fit for the work. She was not built for a
privateer, but was 11m away with by n. rep-
robate crew that was on board, after thecap-
Itain and some of his men had been mur-
dered." " Why, then," said I, " they deserve
death." "Nay," said the old man, "they
do deserve it, and they will certainly have

' it, if they light upon any English or Dutch

ship; for they have all agreed together,
that if they meet that rogue, they'll give
him no quarter."

After more conversation, I told him the
whole story of how We got the very ship
that he was talking of. He was greatly
surprised, but he said We did Well to go to
Nauquin, for if we fell into the hands of
the English or Dutch at that time they
would listen to no explanation. Ile ml-
vised that we sell the ship at N anquin and
buy a Chinese junk, nnd promised to assist
us at both sale and purchnse. He promised,
too, to see the Dutch and English masters
and explain all. so that the new owners of
the ship should not have the same trouble
that we had. ' -

.VVhile these things were passing between
us, by way of discourse, we Wont forward

west point of the grout Gulf, where, by the '
way, I came by accident 1.0 undurstnnd that

their hands. I consulted my partner again
in this exigency, and he was us much at a
loss as I was, and Would vex)! glwdly have
been safe on shore almost nnywherc; how-
ever, I was not in such pcrplexity neither,
but I asked the old pilot if there was no
creek or harbor which I might put into
  

and pursue my business with the Chinese
privately, and be in no danger of the
enemy. He told me if I would sail to the
southward about forty-tyre leagues, there
was alittle port called Quincheng, where
the fathers of the mission usually landed
from Macao, on their progress to teach
the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European shi'ls ever put. in. We
resolved to go to this place, and "weighed
at once.

We did not come to the other part (the

was joyful when I set my foot on shore,
resolving, and my partner too,'that if it;

of all the circumstances of life that ever I

had any experience of, nothing makes man-
kind so completely miserable as that of be-
ing in constant fear. \Vell does the Scripture
say, " The fear of man briugcth a snare ;"
it is a. life of death, .and the mind is so en-
tirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of
no relief. Providence began here to- clear
up our wny a little; and the first thing that
offered was, that our old Portuguese Pilot

first place he bought all our opium, and
gave us a very good price for it, paying us
in gold by weight, some small pieces of
their own coin, and some in small wedges,
of ten or twelve ounces each. '
The Japan merchant would not buy the
ship, but he made on offer to hire her 10

where he treated with the Spaniards and
brought back cloves and other spices.
Having got a good acquaintance at
Manilhi, he got his ship made free ship,
and the governor of Manilla hired him to
go to Acapulco, on the coast of Mexico.

 

He made the voyage to Acapulco' very
happily, and there he sold his ship; and
having there also obtained allowance to
travel hyland to Porto Bella, he found
means, somehow or other, to get to Jamaica
with all his measure; and about cightyears
after came to England, exceeding rich.

We were now on shore in China: if I
thought myself banished, and remote from
my own country at Bengal, where I had
many ways to get home for my money,
what could I think of myself now, when
I was got about a. thousand leagues farther
off. We went ten days' journey to the
city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing,
indeed. They say it has a million of people
in it; it is regularly built, the streets all
exactly straight, and cross one another in

:great advantage. But when I come to
'compnre the miserable people of these
countries with ours, their fabrics, their
manner of living, their govermnent, their
religion, their wealth, and their glory, as
some call it, I must confess that I scarcely
think it worth my While to mention them
here.

We had made the acquaintance of a
Spanish priest, called Father Simon, who
was going to l'ekin, and upon his invita-
tion, we accompanied him. "'0 were
fifteen days reaching the great city,

Pride of these people For example,

' coming by the house of a country gentle-

man, as Father Simon called him, about
ten leagues off the city of Nunquin, we
had first of all the honor to ride with the
master of the house about two miles. The
state he rode in was a perfect Don' Quixot-
ism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
His habit was very proper for a merry-
andrcw, being a dirty calico, with hanging
sleeves; tassels, and cuts,aud slashes almost
on every side. It covered a taflety vest, as
greasy as a. butchcrls, and which testified
that his honor must hem. most exquisite
slovcn. His horse was but a poor, starved,
hobbling creature, and he had two slaves
following him, on foot to drive the poor
creature along. He had a whip in his hand,
and he belabored the beast as fast about
the head as his slaves did about the tail:
and thus he rode by us, with about. ten or

sat under a tree, something like the pal-
metto, which effectually shaded him over
the head; but under the tree was placed
a large umbrella, which made that part
look well enough. He sat lolling back in
a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, corpu-
lent man, and had his meat brought him
by two women-slaves. He had two more,

twice. However, to cut short this melan-
choly part of our story, our ship being disx
abled, and three of our'men killed, and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield,
and were all carried prisonels into Sallee,
a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so
dreadful as I at first feared; nor was I car-
ried up the country to the Emperor's court,
as the rest of our men were, but was kept
by the captain as his proper prize, and
made his slave, being young and nimble,
and fit for his business. At this surpris-
ing change of my circumstances, from a
merchant to a slave, I was perfectly over-
whelmed; and now I looked back upon
my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable; which I thought
was now so efl'ecinully brought to pass,
that I could not be worse; for now the
hand of heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone. But alasl this was but a
taste of the misery I was tie-go through

As my new patron, or master, had taken
me home to his house, so I was in hopes
that he would take me with him when he
went to sea again, believing that it would
some time or other be his fate to be taken
by a. mn-of--wal', and that then I should
be set at liberty. But this hopegofimine
was soon taken away; for when he went
to son, he left me on shore to look after his
little gm'den, and do the.common drudgery
of slaves about his house.

I had no. one to talk to, for, though
there were other slaves, not one of them
could understand my language, nor could
I understand theirs. But while at work
digging in the garden or grinding grain, I

 

13

 

thought of nothing but my escape. But
for along time no means of escaping pre.
30an itself.

After about two years, my master stayed
at home longer than usual, and two or
three times a week he used to go out
a-fishing in his boat. Ila always took me

and a young Moresco, besides a Moor, with

 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  

him, for we made him very merry, and I
was very dexterous in catching fish.

It happened one time, that, going Mish-
ing with him in a calm morning, a fog rose
so thick, that though ,we Were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it;
and revving we knew not whither, we
labored all day and all the next night; and
when the morning come, we found we had
pulled out to sea instead of pulling in for
 

more attended at a distance, who we sup-
posed were to eat of the same after their
master.

At length we arrived at Pekin. Iliad

nephew the captain had given me to attend

 

me as a. servant, and who proved very'
trusty and diligent; and my partner had
nobody with him but one servant, who
was a. kinsman. As for the Portuguese
pilot, he heing desirous to see the court,

And indeed this old man was a most useful
:mplement to us everywhere; for we had
not been above a week at Pekin, when he
came laughing: "Ah, Scignior Inglese,"
says he, "I have something to tell which
will make your heart glad." In short, he
told us there was a great caravan of Mus

and he was sure we would take the oppor-
tnnit)r to go with them.

I confess I was greatly' surprised with
this good news, and had scarce power to
speak to him for some time; but at last I
turned to him, "How do you know this 2"
said I ; " are you sure it is true?" " Yes,"
says he; "'1 met this morning on the street
an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian,
who is among them." we then went to
consult together what>> was to he done; and
I asked my partner what- he thought of the
pilot's news, and Whether it would suit
with his affairs? Jig: told me he would do
just as I would; for he had settled all his
afi'airs so well at Bengal, and left his effects
in such good hands, that as we had made a
good voyage here, if he could invest it in
China silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be
content to go to England, and then make
his voyage back to Bengal by the Com-
pany's ships.

The old pilot was of so much service to
us that we agreed to pay him a good price
to accompany us, to which he consented,
and we soon made our arrangements to
start with the caravan.

It was the beginning of February, our
style,,when we set out from Pekin. My
partner and the old pilot had gone express
back to the port- where. we had first put
in, to dispose of some goods which we had
left there; and I, with aChinese merchant
went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety
pieces of fine damaska, with about two hun-
dred. pieces of other very fine silks ol' sev-

When we had travelled one day's jour-

called all the gentlemen and merchants---
that is to say, all the passengers except the
servants--to a great council, as they called
it. At this; council, every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to n common

to give an account of the reception they

'IR-vo days after, we came to the city of
Naun, or Nauru; we thanked the governor
for his care of us, and collected to the
value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts,
which we gave to the soldiers sent to gnaw}
us; and here we rested one day. '
 

As we were riding through the Musco
Vite dominions, being a little way off fi-om
the caravan, I came upon some people wor-
shiping an idol. It had a, head not resem-
bling any creature that the world ever
saw; ears as big as goats' horns, and as
high; eyes us big as a crown pioce'; a. none
like a crooked rnnl's horn, and a mouth ex-
tended fem-cornered, like that of a lion,
with horrible teeth, hooked like a purrot's
under bilL It was dressed up in the filth-
iest manner that you could suppose; its
'uyper garment was of sheep-skins, with the
Wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet on
the head, with two horns growing through
it. It was about eight feet high, yet had no
feet or legs, nor any other proportion of
parts. I rode up to the image or monster

sword made a stroke at the bonnet that
was on its head, and cut it in two; and
one of our men that was with we took hold
of the sheepskin that covered it, and pulled
at it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry
and howling ran through the village, and
two or three hundred people came about

 

 

 

. my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it,
for we saw some had some bows and ar-
rows. We went back in the night and
destroyed the idol with fire.

We had been almost seven months on
our journey when we arrived at T obolski,
and here I resolved to stop for the winter,
nud let the caravan go on. Here I made
the sequnintnnce of an exiled prince, and
the winter, though very cold, passed very

 

' pleasantly. 1n the mouth of May,I began

to pack up to continue my journey with a
caravan that was soon to start, and I won-
dered why the prince could not go with
me. But my wonder was over when I
entered upon that subject with the person
I have mentioned. "Consider, first, sir,"

' said he, "the place where we are; and,

secondly, the condition we are in. We are
surrounded with stronger things than bars
or bolts; on the north side, on unnuvigable
ocean, where ship never sailed, and boa1|

neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor
subsist by any other way; so that it is

upon him to make the attempt to escape
with me. "'e did not start till June, and,
after much hardship and fatigue, we finally

Kama, which in these parts is the boundary
between Europe and Asia. The first city
on the European side was called Soloy

great city on the river Kama ; and here we
thought to see some evident alteration in
the people. But we were mistaken; for as

I turned her head to the south-east.

day, I had no doubt that we were one

this time we were within sight of the>>
coast, and I knew that we were were out
of the kingdom of the Moors.

But so afraid was I of being followed
by my late master, that we sailed on
toward the south for five days, without
stopping. At the close of the fifth day,
we anchored at the month of a little river;

" but I was afraid to go on shore for fear of

the wild beasts, which inhabit that coast
in great numbers. They made hideous
noises in the night, and sometimes we could

[see great creatures bat-hing on the beach.

One of them swam off toward the boat,
but a shot from a fowling-piece sent him
quickly back to the shore.

However, we had to go on shore for
water, for we had not a pint left, so, the
next day, we'drew the boat in as close as
we could, and waded ashore, taking our
fowling-pieces and two jars. I staid by
the boat, while Xury soon found some
water and filled the jars. He also shot a

had quite a feast.

found that the land was inhabited by

dried roots and corn for which I was
thankful.

I sailed on for eleven days more without
going near the shore till I saw the land run
out a great way into the sea. This I took
to be Cape de Verde. On soiling out to
the point of the Cupe, I saw land fur out

Portuguese ship. and I crowded all sail to
come up to her, and was soon on board.

Upon hearing my story, the captain
offered to take me to the Brnzils, whither

' he was going, without unypay whatever, and
to take all my goods also. He offered to
give me a good sum for my boat, which I
accepted.- He wanted also to buy Xury,
but I was loth to sell the boy's liberty as
soon as he had gained it. But as he ofl'ered
to set him free in ten yems and to treat
him well, and, moreover, Xury being will-
ing, I let the Captain have him.

We made :1 good voyage to the Brazils,
landing in All Saints' Bay in twenty-two
days. The generous treatment the captain
gave me, I can never enough remember. He
would take nothing of me for my passage,
gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I
had in my boat, and caused everything I
had in the ship to be punctually delivered
to me; such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of becs'-
wux, for I had made candles of the rest; in
a word, I made about two hundred and
twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and
with this stock I wont on shore.

I soon learned that the planters of that

country lived well and become rich, so I[

bought land and became a planter, raising
sugar and tol'nmco. When the Portuguese
captain sailed, I sent by him an order for
the money which I had left with the
English captain's widow, and gave him in-
structions to invest it in Lisbon in such

I was now very prosperous and happy,
but. I was not to remain so. I often talked
to the planters about me of my voyage to
the coast of Guinea, and how easy it was to
trade with the natives for gold-dust, or
even for slaves, which were very dear in -
the" Brazils.

One day some of the planters came to
me and proposed, that, as there was noth-
ing we needed so much as slaves to work
our plantations, they would fit out a ship
to go to the coast of Guinea for slaves, and
that I would take charge of the affair. Al-
though I was very well situated where I
was, I accepted their proposal, providing

 

they would take care of my property while
I was gone. In short, I obeyedhlindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason; v
and, mzcordingly, the ship being fitted out,
and tho cargo finished, and all things doneDO

 

as by agreement, by my partners in the
voyage, I. went on board in an evil hour
again, the lst of September-,1659, being the
tame day eight years that I Went from my

 

father and mother at Hull, acting the rebel
to their authority, and the fool to my own
interest.

' Our ship was about one hundred and '

twenty tons burden, curried six guns, and
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy,
and myself. We had on board no large
cargo of goods, except of such toys as were
fit for our trade with the negrocs, such as
bonds, hits 0!? glass, shells, and odd trifles,
especially little lookingvglasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like.

fime, and were, by our last observation, in

quite out of our knowledge. It blew in
such a. terrible manner, that for twelve
days together we could do nothing but
drive, and, scudding away before it, let it
carry us wherever fate and the fury of the
waves directed; and during these twelve
days, I need not say that I expected every
day to be swallowed up; nor did any in
the ship expect to save their lives.

 

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

At last we perceived land ahead, but be
fore we could make out whether it was ah
island or the mainland, the ship struck on
the send a long distance from the shore.
Now, we were in a dreadful condition in-
deed, and had nothing to do but to think
of saving our lives as best we could. We
had a boat at our stern just before the
storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next
place she broke away, and either sunk or
was driven of? to sea; so there was no hope
from her. We had another boat; on hoard,
but how to get her 011' into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no
room to debate, for we fancied the ship
would break in pieces every minute, and

some told us she was actually broken

already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel
lay hold of the boat, and with the help of
the rest of the men, they got her flung over
the ship's side; and getting all into her, let
go, and committed om'selv'es, being eleven

 

in number, to God's mercy and the wild

my whole being, I may say, wrnpt up in
a contemplation of my deliverance; mak-

I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my
comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but

I cast my eyes to the stranded Vemel,

it possible I could get on shore?

done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful de-
liveranee; for I was wet, had no clothes to
shift me, nor anything either to eat or
drink, to comfort me. Neither did I see
any prospect before me, but that of per-
ishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts; and that which was particu-
hu-ly affecting to me was, that I had no
weapon, either to hunt and kill any crou-
tnre for my sustenance, or to defend my-
self against any other creature that might
desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about. me but a knife, :1 to-
bacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box.
This was all my provision; and this threw
me into terrible ugonies of mind, that for a
while I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy
heart, to consider what would be my lot if
there were any ravenous beasts in that
country, seeing at night they always come
abroad for prey.

All the remedy that offered to my
thoughts, at that time, was to get up into
a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved
to sit all night, and consider the next
day what death I should die, for as yet I
saw no prospect of life. I walked about
a [nrlong from the shore, to see if I could
find any fresh water to drink, which I did
to my great joy; and having drunk, and
put a little tobacco in my mouth to pre-
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and get
ting up into it, endeavoured to place my-
self so that if I should sleep I might not
fall. And having cut me a. short stick,
like. a tmncheon, for my defence,I took up
my lodging; and being excessively fatigued,
23

 

I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably

as, I believe, few could have done in my
condition, and found myself more refreshed
\n'th it than I think I ever was on such an
occasion. '

that at least I might save some necessary
things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment
in the tree, I looked about me again, and
the first thing I found was the boat, which

came bzmk for the present, being more
intent upon getting at the ship, where I
hoped to find something for my present
subsistence. .

and company as I now was.

This forced the tears to my eyes again.
As there was little relief in that, I resolved
if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled
off my clothes, for the weather was hot, and

 

too]: to the water. But when I came to the
ship my difficulty was still greater to know
how to get on board, for as she lay high out
of the water, there was nothing within my

twice, and the second time I espied a small
piece of rope hanging down the forechains
so low, that with great difficulty I got hold
of it, and by the help of that ropo got up
into the forecastle of the ship.

I found that the ship was bulged, and
had a great deal of water in her hold; but
that she lay so on the side of a bank of
hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,
almost to the water. By this means all her
quarter was free, and all that was in that
part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to search, and to see what was
spoiled and what was free. And, first, I
found that all the ship's provisions were
dry and untouched by the water, and being
very well disposed to eat,I went to .the
braid-mom and filled my pockets with his-
cuit, and ate itas I wentahout other things,
for I had no time to lose. I also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which I
took a. large dram, and which I had, indeed, .
need enough of, to spirit me for what was
before me. _

Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to
furnish myself with numythiugs which I
foresaw would he very necessary to me. It
was in vain to sit still and wish for what
was not to be had; and this extremity
roused my application. ""e had several
spare yards, and two or three large span: of
wood, and a. spare top-mast or two in the
ship. I resolved to {all to work with these,
and I flung as many of them overhomd asI
could manage for their weight, tying every
one with a rope, that they might not drive
away. "'hen this was done I went down
the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I
tied four of them together at both ends, as of an'aok. These I stowed by themselvm,
well as I could, in the form of a raft, and there being no need to put them into the

being too light.

So I went to work, and with the carpen-- -

great deal of labor and pains. But the -.
hope of furnishing myself with necessaries
encouraged me to3 go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another
occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear
any reasonable weight. My next care was
what; to loud it with, and how to preserve
what I had laid upon it from the surf of
the sea: but I was not long considering
this.

I fiist laid all the planks or bourds upon
it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got thIee
of the seamen's chests, which I had broken _
open and emptied, and lowered them down
upon my raft; the first of these I filled
with provisions--vim, bread, rice, three the mortificution to see my coat, shirt and

to me, and much more valuable tlnm a ship.
' hiding of gold would have been at that
time. I got it" down to my raft, whole as
it was, without losing time to look into it,
for I knew in general what it contained.

 

 

My next care was for some ammunition
and arms. There were two fowling-picces
in the cabin, and two pistols These I
secured first, with some powder-horns, and
two old, rusty swords. _I knew there were
three barrels of powder in the ship and,
with much search, I found them; two of
them were dry and good, and these I got
to my raft, with the arms.

And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and I began to think how I
should get to shore with all my things,
having neither mil, our, nor rudder,nud
- the least pufi of wind would have overset
my raft. But the sea was calm, the tide
was setting toward the shore, and what
little wind there was, blew in that direc-
tion. I found, however, two or three
broken oars, and with these I put to sea.

The raft went very well; but I found
that the tide took me some distance from

R O BINSON CR USOE.

the point where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there was an in.
draft of the water. This led me to think
that there might be u creek or river there;
and so I found there was.

I steered my raft toward it as well as I
could. At the mouth of the little creek I
value very nenr sull'eriug a second ship-
wreck, which, I verily believe, would have
broken my heart. The raft ran on a shoal,
aud nearly upset. I held all the things in
their places, and when the tiderose a little
higher, it floated safelyoff. I_ landed at
i high tide, when the water covered the
:bnnk, and when it receded, the raft was
high and dry.

My next work was to view the country,
and seek a. proper place for my habitation,
and where to stow my goods, to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where
I was, I yet knew not; whether on the
continent or an island; whether inhabited
or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not.

There was a hill not above a mile from
me, which rose up very steep and high,
and which seemed to overtop some other
hills, which lay as in a. ridge from it, north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn
of powder; and thus armed, I traveled for
discovery up to the top of that hill, where,
after I had with great labor and difficulty
got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great
affliction--vim, that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea no
land to be seen except some rocks, which
lay a great way off, and two small island;
less than this, which lay about three
leagues to the. west.W
I found also that the island I was inwm At my coming back, I shot at a great

ban-en, and, us I saw good reason to - bird, which I saw sitting upon a. tree, on
believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, ' the side of a great- wood. I believe it was

abundance of 'fuwls, but knew not their since the creation of the world. I had no
kinds; neither, when I killed them, could . sooner fired, but fi-(nn all parts of the wood
ltell what was fit for fnml and what not. ' there arose. an innumerable number of2s

ROBINSON OR 17801).

 

fowls of many sorts, making a confused
screaming and crying, every one according
to his usual note, but not one of them of
any kind that I knew. As for the creature
I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its
color and beak resembling it, but it had no
tulons or'clnws more than common. Its
flesh was car-rion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came
back to my raft, and fell to work to bring
my cargo on shore, which took me all the
rest of the day. What to (lo with myself
at night I knew not, nor indeed where to
rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast
might devour me, though, as I afterwards

 

found, there was really no need for those
fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded
myself rormd with the chests and boards
that I had brought on shore, and made a
kind of hut for that night's lodging. As
for food, I yet saw not which way to sup-
ply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, nur out of the
wood where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that Imight
yet get a great many things out of the
ship, which would be useful to' me, and
particularly some of the rigging and soils,
and such other things as might come to
loud; and I resolved to make another voy-
age on board the vessel. if possible. And
as I knew that the first storm that blew
must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart, till I
got everything out of the ship that I could
get Then I called a council--that is to
say, in my thoughts--whether I should
take back the raft; but this appemed im-
practicable; so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down; and I did so,
only that I stripped before I went from my
hut, having nothing on but a. chequered
shirt, :1 pair of linen drawers, and a. pair of
pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship us before, and
prepared a second raft; and, having had
experience of the first, I neither made this
so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet
I brought away several things very useful
to me; as, first, in the carpenter-'5 stores I
found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two
of hate-hots, and, above all, that most useful
thing called a. grindstone.
 

All these I secured, together with seve-
ral things belonging to the gunner, particu-
larly two or three iron crows, and two
barrels of musket bullets, seven musliets,
and another fowling piece, with some small '

 

 

quantity of powder more; a large bag-full
of small shot,und it great. roll of sheet-lend;
but this last was so heavy I could not
hoist it up to get. it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-
top sail, a). hzumuock, and some bedding;
and with this I loaded my second raft, and
brought them all safe on shore, to my very ,
great comfort.

I was under some apprehension during
my absence, from the luud, that at least my l
provisions might be devoured on shore;
but when I (came back, I found no sign of
any visitor ; only' there sat a creature like a
wild cat, upon one of the chests, which,

 

29

 

when I came towards it, ran away a little
distance, and then stood still. She set very '
composed and unconcerned,and looked full
in my face, us if she had a mind to be
acquainted with me. I plesented my gun
to her, but, as she did not understand it,
she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor
did she offer to stir away; upon which I
tossed her u. bit of biscuit, though, by the
way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not grent ; however, I spared her a bit,
I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and
ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more;
but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore----
though I was obliged to open the bun-rels of
powder, and bring them by parcels, for they f
were too heavy, being large casks--I went
to work to make me a little tent, with the
sail, and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought
everything that: I knew would spoil either
with rain or sun; and l piled all the empt)r
chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt,
either from man or beast. _

When I had done this, I blocked up the'
door of the tent with some boards within, _
and an empty chest set up on end without;do

 

and spreading one of the beds upon the
ground, laying my two pistols just at my
head, and my gun at length by me, I went
to bed for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night. I was very Weary and
heavy; for the night befow I had slept
little, and had labored hard all day, as
well to fetch those things from the ship, as
to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds
now that ever was laid up, I believe, forone
man ; but still I was not satisfied, for while

 

the ship stood upright in that posture, I
thought I ought to get everything out of
her I could. So every day, at low water, I
went on board, and brought away some.
thing or other; but particularly the third
time I went,I brought away as much of
the riggirgr as I could, as also all the small
rope and rope twine I could get, with a
piece of spare canvas, which was to mend
the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of
wet gunpowder. In a. word, I brought
away all the sails, first and last; only that

as much at a time as I could, for they were
no more useful to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only. '

But that which comforted me more still,
was, that at last of all, after I had made
fire or six such voyages as these, and .
thought I had nothing more to expect from
the ship that was worth ray-meddling with
--I say, after all this, I found a great hogs
head of bread, three large runlets of rum
or spirits, a box of fine sdgar, and a band
of fine flour; this was surprising to me, be-
cause I had given over expecting any more
provisions except. what was spoiled by the
water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel,
in pieces of the sails, which I cut out ; and,
in a word, I got all this on shore also,
though at several times.

The next day I made another voyage, and
now, having plundered the ship of what
was portable, I cut up the cable in pieces
that I could lift, and gathered all the iron
Work that I could more. I cut up the
yards and made a raft to take it all ashore,
but when I got into the little core, the raft
upset and my load all went to the bottom.
However, when it was low water, I got the
most of it out.

If it had remained calm, I verily believe
that I would have out up the whole ship
and got it ashore. The twelfth time that
I went on boaul, I found some money and
some knives. The former was of no worth
to me, but I took it, and as the wind began
to rise I hurried on shore. It blew very
hard that night, and in the morning there
was no more ship to be seen.

I now begun to-think of securing myself

I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring against wild beasts and savages, by build-

ing a dwelling, and I resolved to make me
both a tent and a cave, and I set about
finding a more healthy and suitable spot
than where I then was.

I consulted several things in my situa-
tion, which I found would he proper for
me: first, health and fresh water; secondly,

shelter from the heat of- the sun ; thirdly, '

security from ravenous creatures, whether
man or beast; fourthly, (7. view to the sea.
that if God sent any ship in sight, I might
not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
of which I was not willing to banish my
expectation yet. -

In Search of a place proper for this, I
found a little plain on the side of a rising
hill, whose front towards this little plain

was steep as a house side, so that. nothing '

could come down upon me from the top.
On the side of the rock there was a hollow
phwc, worn a little way in, like the en-
trance or door of a cave; but there was
not- really any cave, or way into the rock,
at all. _

On the flat. of the green, just below this
hollow place, I resolved to pitch my tent.
This plain was not above a hundred yards
broad, and about twice as long, and 1mr
like a green before my door; and, at the

 

end of it. descended in'egulm'ly every way,
down into the low ground by the sea-side.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-
circle befme the hollow place, and in this
half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till
they stood very firm, the biggest end being
out of the ground nhove lire feet and a
half, and sharpened on the top. The two
rows did notstand above six inches from
one another. '

Then I took the pier-es of cable which I
had cut in the ship, and laid them in rows,
upon one another, within the circle, be-
tween these two rows of stakes, ,up to the

top, placing other stakes in the" inside,
leaning against them, about two feet and a
half high, like a spur to a post; and this
33

 

fence was so strong, that neither man nor
beast could get into it or ove1 it.

The entrance into this place I made to
be, not by a door, but by a. short ladder to
go over the top; which ladder, when I was
in, I lifted over after me; and so I was
completely fenced in 'and fortified, as I
thought, from all the worldfand conse-
quently slept secure in the nigh; which

- ' otherwise I could not have (lune; though,
as it appeared afterwards, there was no
need of all this caution from the enemies
that I apprehended danger from.
' Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite
labor, I carried all my riches, all my pro~
' ions, ammunition, and stores; and I
made me a large tent also, to [reserve me
from the rains, that in one part of the

year are very violent there. I made it '
double--viz, one smaller tent within, and _
one larger tent above it , and covered the
uppermost part of it with a large tar-
paulin, which I had saved among the sails
When I had done all this, I dug a cave
in the hill-side, pilingr the earth and stones
within my fence so as to raise the ground
nearly to the top. Before I had done all

 

this, :1. thunder-storm, accompanied by sharp
flashes of lightning, frightened me very
much for four that niy powder would take
fire. As soon as the storm was over, I
went to Work and separated the powder
into small parcels and hid it away in
different places in the rocks.

In the interval of time while this was
doing, I went out at least once every day
 

with my gun, as well to divert myself, as' and I was upon the I'm-ks, they took no

upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my
pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame;
but it would not eat, so I was forced to
kill it and eat it myself. _
After I had been there about ten or
twelve duys, it came into my thoughts that
I should lose my reckoning of time, and
should even forget the Sabbath-day from
the working-days; but to prevent this, I

 

cut it with my knife upon a. large post, in
capital letters, and making it into a great
cross, I set it up on the shore Where I first
landed, viz., "I came on shore here on the
30th of September, 1659."

Upon the sides of this square post I cut-
evcry day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as
the rust, and every fiist day of the month
as long again as that long one; and thus I
kept my calendar.

I had brought from the ship some pens,

kept a. strict account of everything, but
they were soon gone. "*8 had on the
ship two cats and a dog, and I had brought
both of the cats on shore. As for the dog
he swam ashore, and become my trusty
servant for many years.

The want of tools made every work I
did go on heavily; and it was near awhole
year beiorc I had entirely finished my
littie pale, or surrounded habitation. The
piles or stakes, which Were as heavy as I
could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more, by
far, in bringing home; so that I spent
sometimes two days in cutting and bring--
ing home one of those posts; and a third
day in driving it into the ground. But
what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of anything I had to do,sceing
I had time enough to do it in? nor had I
any other employment, if that had been
over, at least that I could foresee, except
the ranging the island to seek for food,
and climbing the high rocks to see if any
vessel was within sight.

Having now brought; my mind aliti'ic
to rciish my condition, uud given over
looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a
ship; I say, giving over these things, I
began to apply myself to :wcommodatc my
way of living, and to make things as easy
to me us I could.

I have already described my habitation,
which was a tent under the side of a rock,
surrounded with a strong paic of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it.
a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up
against it of turfs, about two feet thick on
the outside; and after some time (I thinl:

ink and paper, and while they lasted I I it was a your and a half) I raised rafters
 

from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched.
or covered it with boughs of trees, and
such things as I could get to keep out the
rain, which I found at some times of the
year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought
all my goods into this pale, and into this
care which I had made behind me. But I
must observe, too, that at first this was a
confused heap of goods, which, as they lay
in no order, so they took up all my place.
I had no room to turn myself; so I set my
self to enlarge my care, and worked fur-
ther into the earth, for it was a loose,
sandy rock, which yielded easily to the
labor I bestowed on it; and so when I
found I was pretty safe as to beasts of
prey, I worked sideways, to the right
hand, into the rock; and then turning to
the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out on the out-
side of my pale or fortification.

And now I began to apply myself to
make such necessary things as I found I
most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to
enjoy the few comforts I had in the world.
I could not write, or eat, or do several
things with so much pleasure without a
table.

Ihad never handled a tool in my life;
and yet, in time, by labor, applienlimi, and
contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted
nothing but I could. have mado it, espe-
cially if I had had the tools. However, I
made abundance of things, even without.
tools; and some with no more tools than
an lulze and a hatchet, which, perhaps,
were never made that way before, and that
with infinite labor. For example, if I

8?

 

 

wanted a board, I had no other way but to
cut down a tree, set it on an edge before
me, and hew it flat on either side with my
axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smooth with my
adm. It is true, by this method I could
make but one board out of a. whole tree;
but this I had no remedy for but patience.

IIowover,I made me a table and a chair,
in the first place; and this I did out of the
short pieces of boards that I brought on
my Tait from the ship. But when I had.
wrought out some boards as above, I made
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and
an hall', one over another, all along one
side of my care, to lay all my tools, nails
and iron-work on ; and, in a word, to sepa-
rate everything at large into their places,
that I might come easily at them; also I
knocked pieces into the wall of: the rock,
to hang my guns and all things that would.
hang:r up; so that had my cave been to be_as

 

 

seen, it looked like 21 general 111ngaziue of
all nt'ccwxu y things; and I had everything
so ready at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order.

  

As long as my ink
last/ed I kept a jour-
nal of all that happened to me, of which I
will now give a part, for much that I wrote-
at that time I have already told, and need
not repeat.

September 30, 1659.----I, poor, 111iserable
Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, dur-
ing a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on
shore on this dismal, unfortunate island,
which I called "The Island of Despair ;"
all the refit of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost dead;

All the. rest of the day I spent in million
ing myself at the dismal circumstances I
was brought to; Viz, I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to;
and, in despair of any relief, suw nothing
but. death bcforc am: either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, or perish by
starvation. \

and was no more to be seen, except the

wreck of her, and that only at low water.

I spent this day in eove1i11w and seeming

the goods which I savcd,tl1at the min

Oct. 26.----I walked about the shore
almost all day, to find out a place to fix
my habitation, greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either
from wild beasts 01- men. 'I'owalds night

and marked out a semicircle for my e11-
cunxpment, which I resolved to strengthen
with a Work, wall, or fortification, unale of
double piles, lined within with cables, and
without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked
very hard in carrying all my goods to my
new habitation, though some part of the
time it raincd exceeding hard.

my tent into the rock, to make room for
my further conveniency.

Nola--Three things I wanted exceed-
ingly for this work, via, a pickaxe, a
shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I
desistcd from my work, and began to con-
sider how to supply that, want, and make
me some tools. As for the piekaxe, I
made use of the iron crowns, which were
proper enough, though heavy; and the
next thing was a shovel, or spade. This was
so absolutely necessm'y, that, indeed, I
could do nothing effectually without it; but
what kind of one to make I knew not.

.Nov. 18.--The next day, in seamhing
the woods, I found a tree of that wood,
or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness ; of
this, with great labor, and almost. spoiling
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home,
with difficulty enough, for it was exceed:
ingly heavy. The excessive hardness of
the wood, and having no other way, made
me a long while upon this machine, for I

worked it by little and little into the form
of a shovel o' spade; the handle exactly
shaped like ours in England, only that the
hoard part having no imn shod upon it at

 

 

bottom, it would not last me so long ; how
ever, it served well enough for the uses
which I had occasion to put it to; but
nevcrwas a shovel, I believe, made after
that fashion or so long making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a
basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket I
could not make. by any means, having no
such things as twigs that would bend to
make wicker-ware--at least, none yet found
out; and as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied
I could make all but the. wheel; but that
I had no notion ol';'ne.ithel' did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no
possible way to make iron gudgcons for the
spindle. or axis of the wheel to run in; so
I gave it over, and so, for carrying away'40

Nata--During all this time I worked to

This was not. so difficult to me as the
making the shovel ; and yet this and the
shovel, and the attempt which I mndc in
vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me no

And now, in the managing my household '-
afi'ailis, I found myself wanting in many i
things, which I thought at first it was inn
possible for me to make; as, indeed, as to
some of them it was: for instance, 1 could
never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small ruulet or two, as I observed before; .
but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it; I could never put in the '

 

heads, nor join the stares so true to one nu-
ot-her as to make them hold water; so Igzwc-
that also over.

In the next place, I was at a. goat loss
for candles; so that as soon as it was dark, |

which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered
the lump of beef-wax with which I made
candles in my African mlventure; butl had
none of that now. The only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved
the fallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I
added a. wick of some oakum,I made me
a lamp; and this gave me light, though not
a clear, steady light like a candle.

In the middle of all my labors, it hap-
pened that, rummaging my things, I found
a little bag, which had been filled with corn
for the feeding of poultry. W'hat little re-
mainder of corn had been in the bag was
all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing
in the bag but husks and dust ; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use,
I shook the husk-s of corn out of it; on one

' side of my fortification, under the rack.

It was a little before the great rains just
now mentioned, that. I threw this stuff away,
taking no notice of anything, and not so
much as remembering that I had thrown any-
thing there, when, about a month after, I
and some few stalks of something green
shooting upon the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen. But I
was surprised when, after a little longer
time, I saw about ten or twelve can come
out, which were perfect green barley, of
the same kind as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonish-
ment and confusion of my thoughts on this
occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no rc-
ligious foundation at all ; indeed, I had
veryfew notions of religion in my head,
nor had entertained any sense of anything
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a
chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God, without so much as inquiring into the
end of Providence in these things. But
after I saw barley grow there in a climate
which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it come

there, it stamled me strangely, and I began :

to suggest that God had minwulously caused
this grain to grow withoutl any help of seed
SOIVD.

This touched my heart a little, and
brought tears out of my eyes, and I began
to bless myself that such a prodigy of.
Nature should happen upon my account;

and this was the more strange tome, be- '

cause I saw near it still, all along by the
side_of the rock, straggling stalks of rice,
and which I know, because I had seen it
grmv in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I carefully saved the ears'ot this corn,
you may be sure, in their season, which
was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all
again, hoping in time to have sufficient to
supply me with bread. But. it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat,
and even then but sparingly; for I lost all
that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it
just before the dryr season, so that it never
came up at all.

Besides this barley, there were twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved
with the same care, and whose use was of
the same kind, or to the same purpose,
viz., to make me bread, or rather food;
for I found ways to cook it up without
baking, though I did that. also after some
time. .

But to return to my Journals----
A1)2-2'116.---I finished the ladder; so I
went up the ladder to the top, and then
pulled it up after me, and let it down on
L the inside. This was a complete enclosure
i to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without,

unless it c'ould first mount my wall.

 

The very next day after this wall was
finished, I had almost had all my labor
overthrown at once, and myself killed.
The case was thusz--As I was busy in the
inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadful surpris-
ing thing indeed; for, all on a. sudden, I
found the earth came tumbling down from
the roof of my care, and from the edge of
the hill over my head, and two of the posts
I had set up in the care cracked in u fright-
, ful manner. I was heartily scared; and {or
fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward
to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe
there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected
might roll down- upon me. I was no sooner
stepped down upon the firm ground, than
I plainly saw it was a terrible earthqualw:44

 

R O BINSON OR USOE.

 

for the ground I stood on shook three hm'ricane of wind. The sea was lashed to

times, with such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest. building that
could be supposed to have stood upon the
earth; and a great piece of the top of the
rock, which stood about. half a mile from
me, next the sea, "fell down with such a.
terrible noise as I never heard in all my
life. I perceived also the very sea. was put
into a violent motion by it.

I was so amazed with the thing itself,
having never felt the like, or' discoursed
with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupefied; and the motion of the

 

eanJl made my stomach sick like one that
was' tossed at sea. But the noise of the
falling of the rock awaked me as it. were,
and rousing me from the stupcficd condi-
tion I was in, filled me with horror, and I
thought of nothing then, but the hill fall-
ing upon my tent and all my household
goods, and burying all at once.

\thn I found there were no more shocks,
I began to take courage, but I was for a
long time afraid to get over the wall for
four the hill would fall on me. To make
my situation worse, the rain began to fall
down in torrents, and there came a terrible

foam; and trees were torn up by the roots,
and, in short, it was a. dreadful storm.

In about three hauls the wind abated,
but the rain continued all night and all the
next (lay. As there were no more shocks,
I climbed over the wall and went into my
care to escape the min, but still in great
fear that it would fall upon me.

This led me to a resolve that I would
find a new place for my home, where an
earthquake could not harm mo, and I find
this in my journal:

April 22.---I began to cbnsider of means
to put this resolve in execution; but I
was at a great loss about my tools I
had three large axes, and abundance of
hatchets (for we carried the hatchcts for
traffic with the Indians) ; but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood,
they were all full of notches and dull;
and though I had a griudstone, I could
not turn it and grind my tools too. At
length, I contrived a wheel with a string,
to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty.

Nata--I had not seen any such thing in
England, or at least not to take notice how
it was done, though since I have observed
it was very common there; besides that,
my grindstone was very large and heavy,
This machine cost me a full Week's work
to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29.--These two whole days I
took up in grinding my tools, my machine
for turning my grindstone performing Very
well.

April 30.----Having perceived my bread
had been low a great while, I now took a
survey of it, and reduced myself to one
45

 

biscuitcnke a. day, which made my heart
very heavy.

May L--In the morning, looking toward
the sea-side, the tide being low, I saw
something lie on the shore liken cask;
when I came to it, I found a small barrel,
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
ship, which were driven on shore by the
late hurricane: and looking towards the
wreck, I thought it seemed to lie higher
out of the water than it used to do. I
examined the barrel which was driven
on shore, and soon found that it was it har-
ml of gunpowder; but it had taken water,
and the powder was cuked as hard as a
stone; however, I rolled it further on
shore for the present, and went on to look
for more.

When I came to the ship, I found that
the earthquake or the hurricane had cost it
so close to the shore that I could walk
quite to it at low water. The wreck was
also much broken up, and many things
were "'flslled ashore.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from
moving my habitatiou,nnd I lnisied myself
mightily to make my way into the ship,
which I found was filled with sand. This
I could not do, but I resolved to pull her
in pieces and to that end I worked every
day.

11%;] 4.--I went a-fishing, but caught
not one fish that I durst eat of, till I was
weary of my sport; when, just going to
leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had
made me n louglinc of some rope-yarn, but
I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught

'fish enough, as much as I cared to out; all
of which I dried in the sun, and ate them

dry.

May 5.--Worked on the wreck; cut
another beam asunder. and brought three
great fir planks from of the docks, whichI
tied together, and made swim on shore
when the tide of flood came in.

 

fling] 6.--Worked on the wreck; got
several iron bolts, and other pieces of iron-
work; worked very hard, nnd came home
very much tiled.

May 7.---Went to the wreck again, with
nu intent not to work, but found the weight
of the wreck had broken itself down ; that
several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose, and the inside of the hold lay so
open that I could see into it.46

--__--_____----_-----------_------------

May 8.--W'ent to the wreck, and car-
ried an iron crow to wrench up the deck
which lay now quite clear of the water or
sand. I wrenched open two planks, and
brought them on shore also with the tide.

May 9.---Went to the wreck, and with
the crow made way into the body of the
wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break
them up. I felt also a roll of English
lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy
to move.

May 10, 11, 12, 18, 14.--cht every
day to the Wreck; and got a good deal of
pieces of timber, and boards, or planks, and
two or three hundrcdweight' of iron.

May 15.--I curried two hatchets, to try
if I could not cut a piece 095 the roll of
lead, but as it lay about a foot and a. half
in the water, I could not make any blow to
drive the hatchet.

May 16.--It had blown hard in the
night, and the wreck appeared more broken
by the force of the water; but I stayed so
long in the woods, to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me_ going to the
wreck. ,

I continued this work every day to the
15th of J une, except the time: necessary to
get food, which I always appointed, during
this port of my employment, to' be when
the tide was up, that I might be ready
when it was ebbed out; and by this time
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron.
work enough to have built a good boat, if
I had known how; and also I got, at seve-
ral times, and in several pieces, near one
hundredweight of the sheet-lead.

June 16.---Goiug.down to the sea-side, I
found a large tortoise, or turtle. This was

the first I had seen, which, it seems, was
only my misfortune; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every
day.

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. _I
found in her threescore eggs ; and her flesh
was to me, at that time, the most savory
and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life,
having had no flesh, but of goats and
tow]; since I landed in this horrible place.

June 1 8.--Raiued all the (lay, and I stayed
within. I thought, at this time, the rain
felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

June 19.----Very ill, and shivering, as if
the weather had been cold.

June 20.--No rest all night: violent
pains in my head, and feverish.

June 2-1.--Vcry ill ; frightened almost to
death with the apprehension of my sad con-
dition--to be sick, and no help; prayed
to God, for the first time since the storm
ofi of Hull, but'scarce knew what I said
or why; my thoughts being all confused.

June 22.--A little better; but under
dreadful apprehensions of sickness.

me' 23.--Very bad again ; cold and
shivering, and then a violent headache.

June 2-4.-Much better.

June 25.--An ague very violent: the fit
held me seven hours; cold fit, and hot with
faint sweats after it.

June 26. -- Better; and having no
victuals to eat, took my gun, but found my-
self very weak; however, I killed a she
goat, and with much difficulty got it home,
and broiled some of it, and ate. 'I would
faiu have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.. h, .

June 27.-The ague again so violent that
I lay a-bed all day, and neither ate nor
drank. I was ready to perish with thirst;
but so weak I had no strength to stand up,
or to get myself any water to drink.
Frayed to God again, but was lightheaded;
and when I was not, I was so ignorant I
knew not what to say , onl)r I lay and
clied, "Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity
me! Lo1d,hiive 111e1cy upon me. "' Isup-

stepped upon the ground, I thought the
earth trembled, just as it had done in the
earthquake. Then I heard 11 voice so
terrible that it is inqmwihle to express
the terror of it. All that I understood
was this :----" Seeing all these things have
not b1ought thee to 1epenmnce, 11on thou
shalt die;" --at 11 inch wo1ds, I thought he
lifted up the spear that was in his hand to
kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account
will expect that I should be able to tie
scribe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision. Nor is it my more possible to de-
scrihe the impression that remained upon
my mind when I awaked, and found it
was but a dream.

I had received from my Int-her had been
worn out by eight years of seafaring
wickedness. During 1111 that time I had
never thought seriously of God, nor had ]
been thankful to Him for His great iner-
ciee. But now I began to pray for the
first time in many yams, after which I fell

. into a refreshing sleep.

sze 28.----Feeling much better, I arose
and cooked three of the turtle's eggs in
the ashes, 11nd ate them. I tned to walk
about with my gun, but was too weak to
I knew
that the agile would return the next day,
and then I remembered that the Brazilians
took tobacco for such distempers. I had

V some tobacco in one of the chests thatI

had saved, and I went to get it. I was
directed by heaven, no doubt, for I found
in the chest a cure both for soul and body.
Packed in with the tobacco was a Bible,
which I had forgotten all about, but which
 

I was now overjoyed to find. I took it to
my table and read from it a long time, and
having taken a dose of tobacco steeped in
rum, I went to bed. '-

The next day I had the fever, but not so
bad, and J uly 3d I missed it for good and
all. I was, however, so weak for 'many
days that 1 could do but little more than
sit at the month of my cave and try to
make baskets.

It was the 15th of J uly that I began to
take a. more particular survey of the island
itself. I went. up the ewe]; first, where, as
I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I
found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not float any higher; and
that it was no more than a little brook.
On its hanks were man)r meadows covered
with guise, and on the higher pmtslfonnd
tobacco growing. There were many other
plants that I had never seen before.

01) the next <<lay I Went farther the same
way, and, much to my joy, found melons
upon the gmuud in great abundance, and
grapes hanging in great clusters from the
branches of: the twee. I staid there all
that night, sleeping in a tree as when I
filst landed. In the morning, I traveled on
some four miles farther. Here I found a
delicious valley, where everything appeared
so fresh and green that it looked like a
planted garden. Here were orange, lemon,
lime and cocoa trees, but. few of them bore
fruit. I gathered some green limes, and,
mixed with water, I found their juice very
refreshing. I resolved to lay up a store of
all for the wet season.

In order to do this,I gathered a great
heap of grapes in one place, alesser heap
in another phice, and a. great panel of

limes and lemons in another place; and
taking a few of each with 1110. I traveled
home, but. before I got thither, the grapes
were spoiled ; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken
them and bruised them, they were good for
little or nothing. As to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring but a few.

 

The next clay I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my har-
vest; but I was surprised, when, coming to
my heap of grapes, I found them all sprwd

. abroad, troddeu to pieces, and dragged
about, some here, some there, and abund-
ance eaten and devoured. By this I con- '
eluded there. were some wild ereatures

quantity of the gmpes, and hung them equally safe as where. now I was situate, if

upon the out branches of the trees, that
they might cure and dry in the sun ; and
as for the limes nnd lemons, I carried as
many back as I could well stand under.
"'hen I came home from this journey, I
contemplated with great pleasure the fruit-
fullness of that valley, and the pleasantuom
of the situation; the security from storm
on that side of the water, and the wood;
and concluded that I hud pitched upon a l
pluce to fix my abode, which was by far
the worst part of the country. Upon the
whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to look out for it place

 

possible, in that pleatsunt, fruitful pmt of
the island.

This thought. run long in my head, and
I was exceedingly fond of itfor some time,
the pleasantness of the place texnpting me;
but. when 1 came to a nearer view of it, I
considered that I was now by the sen-side,
where it. was at lcust possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage;
and that the some ill fate that brought
me hither, might bring some other un-
happy \rretches to the same place ; and to
enclose myself among the hills and woods
in the centre of the island, was to antici-
pate my bondage, and to render such on
nifuir not. only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove.

However, I was so enamored with
this place, that I spent much of my time
there for the. whole remaining part of the
month of July; and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved as above not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of n. bower, and
surrounded it at a distance with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I'
could reach, well staked, and filled between
with hrushwood; and here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three nights to.
gather, always going over it with a. ladder
as before; so that 1 fancied now I had my
country house and my soo-oonst house.

The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I
had hung up were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent. good raisins of the
sun ; so I began totnkc them down from the
trees, and it was very happy that I did so.
for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I haul lost the better part52

 

of my winter's food; for I had above two
hundred large bunches of them. No sooner
had I taken them all down, and carried
most of them home to mycure, bntit began
to rain; and it rained, more or less, every
day, till the middle of October, and some
times so violently, that I could not stir out
. of my care for several days

In this season I was much surprised with
the increase of my family. I had been con-
cerned {or the loss of one of my cats, who
ran away from me, and I heard no more
tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she
came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. I afterward came to he so
pestered with cats, that I was forced to
kill them like rennin, or wild beasts, and
to drive them {mm my house as much as
possible.

From the 14th of August. to the 26th,
incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and
was now very careful not to he nmeh wet.
In this confinement, I began to he strait-
ened for food; but venturing out twice, I
one day killed a goat; and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my

i food was regulated thus :--I ate a bunch of
raisins for myhreakfast; a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner,
' broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had
no vessel to boil or stew anything): and
two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.
Sept. 30.----I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing. I cast
up the notches on my post, and found
I had been on shore three hundred and
sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn
fast, setting it apart for religious exercises,
prostrating myself on the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing my
sins to God, acknowledging his righteous
judgment- npon me, and praying to him to
have mercy upon me through Jesus Christ;
} and having not tasted the least refreshment

 

for twelve hours, even till the going down
of the sun, I then ate-n. biscuit-cake and a.
bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing
the day as I began it. I now set- of)? every
seventh day as the Sabbath day.

My ink gave out about this time, nml I
gave up my journal. After a. time I learned
how to divide the rainy season from the
dry season, but at first the lack of this
knowledge came near costing me dear, for
I sowed 1in grain before the dry season.
and not a stalk came up. Fortunately]
had not sown it all, and I sowed the few
grains left before the rainy season and it
grew very well, though it was several years
before I had enough to make a crop.

AfterI had found, by experience, the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain,
I took care to furnish myself with provi-
sions before hand, that I might not be
obliged to go out, and I sat within doors
as much as possible during the wet mouths
In this time I found nun-h employment,
and very suitable also to the time, for I
found great occasion of mun)r things which

I had no way to furnish myself with buti

.hy haul lnlmr and constant. application;
particularly, I had tried many ways to
make myself 11 basket, but. all the twigs I
could get for the purpose proved so brittle
that they would do nothing.

'It came into my mind that. the twigs of
tlnd- tree from "hence I ant. my stnkes that
grew might possibly be as tough us the
snllows, willows, and osiers in Englund,
and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the
next, day I went to my (rolun'.r_\"-house, as I
called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much
as 1 could desire. During the next season,
I employed myself in making," well as

I could, a great. nulny baskets, both to.

 

 

carry earth or lay up anything, as I had
occasion ; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufli-
cicntly scrvicnhle for my purpose; and
thus, afterwards, I tool: care never to be
without them; and as my n'ickerm'are
decayed, I made more, especially strong,
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to hare any
quantity of it.

I now resolved to travel quite across to
the other side of the island, so, taking a
hatchet with my gun and (iog,nn(l a. large:-
quantity of powder and shot than usual,
and putting a great, bunch of raisins and
two biscuit cakes in my pouch, I began

' my journey.

ing, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it i
down with a stick, and having recovered .
it, I brought it home; but it was some
' years before I could make him speak;
however, at last, I taught him to call me
by my name very familiarly.

 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was
surprised to see that I haul taken up my
lot on the worst side of the island, for
here, indeed, the shore was covered with
innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other _
side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number
of fowls of many kinds, some of which I
had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat, but such as I knew not
the names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased,
but- was very sparing of my powder and
shot, and therefore had more mind to kill
a she-goat, if I could, which I could better
feed on; and though there were many
goats here, more than 'on the other side of
the island, yet it was with much more
difficulty that I could come near them.

I confess this side of the country was

much pleasanter than mine; but yet I had
not the least inclination to remove, for, as
I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed all the while
I was here to be as it were upon a jour-
ney, and from home. However, I trav-
eled along,~ the shore of the sea towards
the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore
fora mark, I concluded I would go home
again. '

I took another way going home, and
became bewildered and lost, so that I had
to go hack to my post and start again. In
this journey, my dog surprised a kid, which
I caught and led by a string till I came to
my bower, where I left him, securely tied.
I cannot express my satisfaction when I
came to what. I called my home and throw
myself in my hammock. I had been gone'
a month, and it all appeared so comfortable
that I resolved never to leave it for so long,r
a time again, while I remained on the
island.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel
how much more happy the life I now led
was, with all its miserable circumstances,
than the wicked, abominable life I led all
the past part of my days; and now having,'

my very desires altered, and my delights

and at the end of all my harvesting, I
found that out of my half-peek of seed I
had near two bushels of rice, and above I
two bushels and a-hall' of barley; that is,
to say, by my guests for I had no measure
at that time.

I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels,
which, indeed, I wanted sorely. I (lid not
doubt but if I could find out any clay, I
might boteh up some such pot as might,
being dried by the sun, be hard enough
and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and to

in preparing corn, meal, PS50., which was

' 'the thing that I was upon, I resolved to

make some as large as I could, and fit only
to stand like jars, to hold what should he
put into them.

'It would make the reader pity me, or
rather laugh at me, to tell how many awk>>
ward ways I took to raise this paste ; what
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how
many of them fell in, and how many fell
out--the clay not being stiff enough to
hear its own weight; how many cracked
by the over-violent heat of the sun, being i

pieces with only removing, as well before. 1
as afterthey were dried; and, in a word,
how, after having labored hard to find the.
clay--to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it~I could not make
above. two large earthen ugly things (I can
not call them jars) in about two months'
labor.

However, as the sun baked these two
very dry and hard, I lifted them very
gently up, and set them down again in two

59

 

great wicker baskets, which I had made on
purpose for them, that they might not
break.

'l'hough miscarried so much in my design
for large pots, yet I made several smaller
things with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers and pipkins,
and anything my hand turned to; and the
heat of the sup baked them strangely hard.

   

{3;

But all this would not answer my end,
which was to get an earthen pot to hold
what was liquid, and bear the fire; which
none of these. could do. It happened after
some time, making a pretty large fire for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it.
out after I had done with it,I found a
broken piece of one of my earthenware ves-
sels in the fire, burnt: as hard as a stone,
 

and red as a tile. I was agreeably surpiised not let the fire abate too fast, in the morn-
t'o see it, and said to myself that certainly iug I had three Yer)r good (I will not say

I now thought to dig out a stone, and
make myself a mortar; but,aftel' searching
a long while I could find no stone hard
euough,as all the rocks on the island were
soft. and crumbling. I got instead a great.
block of hard wood, and with much labor
I rounded the outside, and then, with the
help of fire, made a hollow place in it, as

not crack at all; when I saw them clear

live or six hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the
clay melted with the violence of the heat,
and would have run into glass if I had
gone on. So 1 slashed my fire grmlually till
the pots began to abate of the red color,
and watching them all night, that I might

made some very good sieves.

The baking part was the next. thing to
he considered, but I managed this also.
I nmde some hollow earthen vessels, which
served as hearths. In there I built hot
fires. Then, raking the ashes and embers
ofi' clean, I put in my loaves and covered
them with earthen jam.

All the while these things were doing,
you may he sure my. thoughts ran many
times upon the land which I had seen
from the other side of the island; and I
was not without secret wishes that I was
onshore there, l'nneying that I might find
some way or other to convey myself fur-
ther, and perhaps nt lust find some means
of esehpe.

But all this while I made no allowance
for the dungeis of: such a condition, and
how I might fall into the hands of sav-
ages, and perhaps such as I might have
reason to think far Woxso than the lions
and tigem of Africa; tlmt if I once came
into their power I should run a hazard of
being killed. and perhaps of being eaten;
for I haul henrd that the people of the
Caribbean coasts were ennnihuls, or men-
c-atele, and I knew by the latitude, that I
could not. he far off from that shore. All
these things, I say, which I ought to have
considered Well of, and I did cast. up in

 

my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none '

of my apprehensions at first, and my head
ran mightilyr upon the thought of getting
over to that shore.

Now, I wished fur my boy Xury and
the long-boat, with the shoulde1'~of-muttou
sail, with which I sniled above a. thousand
miles on the comet of Africa; but this was
in min. Then I thought I would go and
look at our ship's bout, which was blown
up upon the shore a great way, in the
storm, when we were. fiisit enst away. She
lay almost where she did at first, but. not
quite, and was turned, by the force of the
waves and the winds, ahnost bottom up-
ward, aguhist. the high ridge of rough
sand, but no water about her as before.

If I had had hands to have refitted her,
and to have launched her into the water,
the heat would have done well enough,

 

 

 

might have easily foreseen that I could no
more turn her and set her upright, upon
her bottom, than I could remove the
island; however, I went to the wood, and
cut levers and rollers, _and brought them to
the boat, resolved to try What I could dc.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece
of fruit-less toil, and spent, 1 think, three
orvfour weeks about it; at last, finding it

But I was unable to stir it, or to get6':

under it, much less to move it. forward to-
wards the water; so I was forced to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the
hopes of the bout, my desire to venture
over for the mainland increased.

  

'- upon thinking whether
it was not Possible to make myself a
canoe, or periagna, such as the natives of
those climates make, even without tools,
or, as I might say, without hazids~viz..
"of the trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy, and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of
making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes
or Indians; but not at all considering the
particular inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz",
want of hands to move it into the water
when it was made.

I went to work upon this boat the most
like a fool that ever man did, who had any
of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it;
not but that the (lillieult-y of launching my
boat came often into my head; but I put
a stop to my inquiries into it, by this
foolish answer which I gave myself: "Let
me first make it; I warrant I shall find
some way to get it' along when it is done."

This was a most preposterous method;
but the eagerness of myfaney prevailed,
and. to work I went, and felled a cedar-
tree. I question much whether Siilomon
ever had such a. one for the building the
Temple of Jerusalem. III-was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end'of
twenty-two feet; after which it lessened
for a while, and then parted into branches.
It was not without infinite labor that I

- felled this tree. I was twenty days hack-

ing and hewing at it at the bottom; I was

,fuurteen more getting the branches and

limbs and the vast spreading head of it. cut
off, which 1 hacked and hewed through
with my axe and hatchet. Afterthis, it
cost me a month to shape it to something
like the bottom of a boat. It cost me
near thnee months more to clear the inside,
and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it. This I did, indeed, without fire,
by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint
of hand labor, till I had brought it to he a
very handsome l'ifil'lflglla, and big enough
to have carried six-and-twenty men.

When I had gone through this work, I
was extremely delighted with it. The
boat was really much bigger than ever I
saw a canoe or periagna, that was "made of
one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke
it had cost, you may be sure--for there
remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water,
I make no question, but I should have
begun the maddest voyage, and the most
unlikely to be performed that ever was
undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the
water failed me. It lay about one him>>

dred yards from the water, and not more;
but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek.
away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into the surface of the earth, and so
make a deelivity. This I began, and it
cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but
who grudge pains that have their deliver-
ance in view '3); but when this was worked
through,nnd this difficulty managed, it was

still much at one, for I could no more stir ,

the canoe than I could the other bout.
Then I measured the distance of ground,
and resnlred to cut a dock or canal, to
bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I
could not bring the canoe down to the
water. I began this work, but upon cal-
culating the amount of digging and what
I could do in 9, day, I found it would take
twelve years to finish it, so I was obliged
to abandon it.

In the middle of this work I finished my

bread for a year befom I got any corn of

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily;

while, except some shirts which I had found
in tho chests of the other seamen, and
which I care-fully preserved ; because many
times I could bear no other clothes on but

'a shirt; and it was a very great help

to me that I had, among all the men's
clothes of the ship, almost three dozen
of shirts. There were also several thick
watch-coats of the senlnen's, which were
left behind, but they were too hot to wear;
so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed,
botchiug, for I made most piteous work of
it. However, I made shift to make two or
three waiscoats, which I hoped would serve
me u great while; as for brooches or
drawers, I made but a very sorry shift till
afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins

versary with the same devotion, and with
as much comfort as ever before; for, by
a constant study and serious application of
the word of God, and by the assistance of
His grace, I gained adiifcrcnt knowledge
from what I had before. I looked now

upon the world as a thing remote, which I ,

had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and, indeed, no desire about; in a
word, I had nothing indeed to do with it,
nor was ever likely to have.

The next thing to my ink being wasted,
was that of my bread, I mean the biscuit
which I brought out of the ship. This I
had husbanded to the last degree, allowing
myself but one cake of bread a day for
above a year; and yet I was quite without

four-footed ones, and I had hung them up
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by
which means some of them were so dry and
hard that they Were fit fol-little, but others,
it seems, were very useful. The first thing
made of these was a great cap for my head,
with the hair on the outside, to shoot off
the rain; and this performed so well, that
after, I made me a suit of clothes wholly of
those skins. I must not omit to acknow-
ledge they were wretchedly made; for if I
was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
However, they were such as I made a very
good shift with, and when I was abroad, if
it happened to rain, the hair of the waist-
coat and cap being outermost, I was kept

After this, I spent a great deal of time

conversing mutually with my own thoughts,
and (as I hope I may say) with even my
Maker, by ejaculations and petitions was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of
human society in the world?

_.I cannot say that, after this for five

years, any extraordinary thing happened to i

me, but I lived on in the same course, in
the same postlu'e and place, just as before.
The chief thing I was employed in, besides
my yearly labor of planting my barley and
rice, and tuning my raisins--of both which
I always kept up just enough to have
sufficient stock of the year's provision
beforehand--J had one labor, to make me
a canoe, which at last I finished; so that,
by digging a canal to it of six feet wide
and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile.

In building this boat I was wiser than
in building my. larger one, and I built it
small enough to get to the sea. I was near
. two years in building it, but I never
grudged my labor, in hopes of having a.
boat to go off to sea at last. '

However, though my little periagua. was
finished, yet the size of it was not at all
answerable to the design which I had in
view when I made the first; I mean of
venturing over to the mainland, so that
design was given over for the present. As
I had a. bout, my next design was to make
a tour round the island.

For this purpose, I fitted up a little mast
in my boat, and made a sail to it out of

some of the little pieces of the ship's sails .

which lay in store. I tried the boat, and
found she would sail very well. Then I
made little lockers or boxes at each end to

place where I could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella at the stern, to stand
over my head like an awning. All now
being ready, I loaded my ship for the voy-
age, putting in two dozen loaves of barley
bread, an earthen pot full of . parched
rice, a little bottle of rum, and half a goat,
powder and shot for my gun, and two
large coats, one to lie upon and one to
cover me in the night, and thus I set sail.

When I came to the east side of the
island, I found a great ledge-of reeks lie
out about two leagues into the sea, and be-
yond that a shoal of sand lying half a
league more. I was afraid to go so far out
to sea, for fear I could not get back again,
so I anchored my boat, and, taking my
gun, went on shore and climbed a big hill,
to get a view of the other side of the
ledge.

From the hill I perceived a strong and
intricate current, which would be very
likely to prevent me from being able to
make the island again. And, indeed, had
I not got first. upon this hill, I believe it
would have been so; for there was the
some current on the other side of the
island, only that it set ofi at a farther dis-
tance, and I saw there was a. strong eddy

under the shore; so I had nothing to do

but to get .ont of the first current, and I
should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because,
the wind blowing pretty fresh at E.S.E.,
and that being just contrary to the current,
made a great breach of the sea upon the
point; so that it was not safe for me to
 

 

keep too close to the shore for the breach, l, with such ' violence that all I could do

I had no prospect be-
fore me but of perishing, not by the sea,
for that was calm enough, but of starving
from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tor-
toise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I
had a great jar of fresh water, that is to
say, one of my earthen pots; but what

was all this to being driven into the vast,

ocean, where, to be sure, there was no
shore, no mainland or island, for a thous-
_ and miles at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the
providence of God to make the most mis-
erable conditibn that mankind could be in
worse. Now I looked back upon my deso-
late, solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world, and ad the happiness
my heart could wish for was to be there
again. I stretched out. my hands to it,
with eager wishes. "0 happy desert!"
said I, "I shall never see thee more. 0
miserable creature! whither aan going?"

way, too; for, I had no compass on board.
and should never have known how to have
steered towards the island, if I had but
once lost sight of it. But the weather
continuing clear, I applied myself to get
up my mast again, and spread my sail,
standing away to the north as much as
possible, to get out of the current.

I made such good headway that I soon
found an eddy which- carried me about a
league on my way back. T he wind con-
tinuing fair, I continued to near the island
and soon got to land. When I was on
shore, I fell on my knees and gave God
thanks for my deliverance. After which, I
drew my boat into a little c0ve under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being
quite spent with the fatigue of the voyge,
which I resolved not to repeat.

I was now at a great loss which way to
get home with my boat. I had run so much
hazard, and knew too much of the case, to
think of attempting it by the way I went
out; and what might be at the other side I
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any
more ventures. So I resolved, on the next
morning, to make my way westward along
the shore, and to see it there was no creek
where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again, if I wanted her.

talking to me, '_-' Poor Robin Crusoe! and:

how did I come here! and where had I

' see me again; and so I carried him home

along with me.

I had now enough of rambling to sea. for
some time, and enough to do for many days
to sit still and icflcct upon the danger I

 

had been in. I would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on my side of
the island; but I knew not how it was

had been my favoulite, was the only per-

was now grown very old and crazy, sat
always at my right hand; and two cats,
one on one side the table, and one on the
other, expecting now and then a bit from
my hand, as a mark of special furor.

I wanted the use of my boat very much.
but I was very loth to run any more risk
at sen. One (lay I resolved to go by land
to the little hill on the other side where I
had observed how the shore lay and the
current set, and so I started, following the
edge of the shore. lIaAl any of the people
of England met me at that time, I should

5 either have {lightened them or raised a

great deal of laughter.

I had a great, high shapelese cap, made
of goat's skin, with a flap hanging down
behind, as well to keep the sun from me as
to shoot the rain oil from running into my
neck; nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh under
the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the
skirts coming down to about the middle
of the thighs and a pair of opendtneed

 

all gone. To make provision for this, I set
traps, and caught some young kids, which
I tamed, keeping them in a large enclosure,
securely fenced about. It would have
made a stoic smile to see me and my little
family sit down to dinner. There was my

breeches of the same. The branches were
made of the skin of an old he-goarv, whose
hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, like pautaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I
had none, but had made me a pair of some-

little holes, alvout as big as I might put
my arm out at. In tho inside of this, I

 

I thickened my wall to about ten feet. thick,

continually bringing,r earth out of my care,
and laying it. at the foul: of the Wall, and
walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets like
manon,so I could fire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time. This wall I was many
a weary mouth in finishing, and yet never"
thought- inyself safe till it was done.

Then I planted the ground without as

so that, in two years' lime, Iliad a grove so
think that no one would ever imagine there
was any human habitation beyond it.
\V hile I was doing this I thought- much of
the safety of my goats ; so I made a strong

 

n...
enclosure in a retired part of the island,
and removed to it ten she-goats and two
he-gonts and left them there.

One day as I wandered more to the. west:
part of the island, beingou a hill, I thought.
I saw a boat far out at son, but- I was not
sure. On cmning down from the hill, I
was confounded and znnazed to see the
shore spread with skulls and other bones of
human bodies. There was a place where
a fire. had been made, and a circle dug in
the earth, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuuuul
feast. "Then I recovered from my horror
at such a sight, I began to thank God that
I was cast ashore upon a part of the island
that was not visited by the cannibals.

In this frame of thankfnlness, I went
home to my castle, and began to he much
easier now, as to thevsai'ety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before: for I
observed that these wretches never came to
this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not. wanting, or
not- expecting, anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woody part of it, without finding anything
to their purpose. I knew I had been here
now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of human creature there
before; and I might be eighteen yeah!
more. as entirely concealed as I was now, it'
I did not. discover myself to them, which I
had no manner of occasion to do; it being
my only business to keep myself: entirely
concealed where I was, unless I found a
better sort of creatures than cannibale to
make myself known to. Yet I entertained
such an abhorreuee of the savage wretches
that I have. been speaking of, and of the

 

 

 

 

wretched inhuman custom of their devour-
ingund eating one, another up, that I con?
tinued pensive and sad, and kept, close
within my own circle for almost. two years
after this. \\-'hen I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz., my
easlle, my country-seat. (which I called my
bower), and my enclosure in the Woods;
1101' did I look after thie for any other use
than as an enclosure for my goats; for the
aversion which nature gave me to these
wretehes was such, that I did not so much
as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but- began rather to think of making me

at sea; in which case, if I had happened to
have fallen into their hands, I knew what-
would have been my int.

Night and day, I could think of nothing
new but how I might destroy some of
these monsters, and, if pomihle, save the
victim they should bring hither to destroy.
It would take "P." larger volume than this;
whole work is intended to be, to set down
all the contrivances I hatched, or rather

brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the,

destroying of these

to prevent. their coming
hither any more. But
all was abortive; noth.

could one man do

could 1 be sure of its going off at any cer-
tain time, when it might. surprise them;

'nnd, at best, that. it would do little. more

than just blow the fire about their ears and
fright them, bu'v not sufficient to make
them forsake the place; 5" I laid it aside.

I continually made my tour every morn-
ing to the top 0!" the hill, which was frommy castle, as l culled it,
about three miles or
more, to see if 'I could
observe any boats upon the sen, coming near
the island, or standing over towards it; but

I began to think, too, that it mas not
for me to judge these wretchcs, and for u,
year, I gave up watching for them. This
I did, however: I removed my bout and
hid it securely on the east end of the
island, and I kept myself more retired
than ever. .

I believe the render of this will not
think it strange if I confess these anxie-
ties, these constant fears I lived in, and
the concern that was now upon me, put
an end-to all invention, and to all the
contrivzmces that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon
hands than that of my food. I cared not.
to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood
now, for fear the noise I should make
should be heard; much less would 1 fire
a gun for the some reason; and, above all,
I was intolembly uneasy at making any
fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at
9. great distance in the day, should betray
me. For this reason, I removed that part

as burning of pots and pipes, etc, into
my new apartment in the woods; where,
after I luul been some time, I found, to
my unspeakable consolation, a mere nab

prised; and yet I had no more peace
Within, from the apprehensions I had
that if these savages, in rambling over
the island, should find my corn standing
or cut, or any of my works, they would

 

immediately conclude that there were peo-
ple in the place, and would then never rest

till they had found me out. In this ex-
tremity I went back directly to my castle,
and pulled up the ladder after me, having
made all things without look as wild and
' natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting
myself'in a posture of defence; I loaded
all my cannon, as I called them--that is to

'say, my muskets, which were mounted
upon my new fortifications, and all my
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp--not forgetting seriously to
commend myself to the Divine protection,
and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
his out of the hands of the barbarians.

' ' And in this posture I continued about

two hours, and began to be impatient for
, intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to
send out. I was not able to bear sitting
in ignomnco any longer; so setting up my
ladder to the side of the hill, and then
-pulling the ladder after me, I set it up
again, and mounted to the top of the hill,
and pulling out my perspective-glass, I laid
me down flat on the ground, and began to
look for the place. I presently found
there were no less than nine naked saw--
ages sitting round a small fire they had
made, not to warm them, for they had no
need of that, the weather being extremely
hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of
their barbarous dietiof human flesh which
they had brought with them, whether alive

- 4 or dead I could not know.

They had two canoes with them; which
they had hauled up upon the shore; and
as it was then bid) of tide, they seemed to
me to wait the return of the flood to go
away again. As I expected, so it proved;
for, as soon as the tide made to the west-
ward, I saw them all take boat and row
(or paddle, as we call it) away. I should
have observed, that for an hour or more
before they went off they were dancing
and I could easily discern their postures
and gestures by my glass.

As soon as I saw them gone, I took my
guns and" pistols and went away to the
$1

 

hill on the other side. Isaw there had
been three canoes o!' savages there, and
they were out. at sea, making over for the
'main. Going down to the shore I saw
with horror. the marks of their dreadful
feast, in the blood and bones of human
bodies.

I was so filled with indignation at this
sight, that I began to ponder how I could
destroy them when they should come
again. I went often to the hill to loolc for
them, and if they had come, I should ccr~
tainly have attacked them. But more than
a your elapsed and I saw no signs of them,
811d I lived on very comfortably. In the

 

meantime, an event happened which
intensely excited me.

There had been a. storm of wind all day,
with n. great deal of lightning and thunder,
and a very foul night it was after it As
I was rending in the Bible, and taken up
with very serious thoughts about my pres-
ent condition, I was surprised with the
noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to he sure, a surprise of a differ-
ent nature from any I haul met before ; for
the notions this put into my thoughts were
of another kind. I started up in the
greatest haste, and, in a trice, clapped my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and
pulled it after me; and, mounting it the

 

second time, got to the top of the hill the
very moment that a flash of fire bid me
listen for a second gun, which, accordingly,

 

in about half a minute, I heard; and by
the sound, knew that it was from that pant
of the sea where I was <<lr'ren out with the
current, in my bout. I immediately con-

. sidered that this must be' some ship in dis~

tress. I had the presence of mind, at that
minute, to think, that though 1 could not
help them, it might be they might help
me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and, making a
good, handsome pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill. The wood was dry,and blazed
freely; and though the wind blew very
haul, yet it burned fuil'ly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as
a ship, they must need see it, and no doubt
they did; for as soon as my fire blazed up,
I heard another gun and then several
nmre.

  

In the morning I saw to my great sor-
row the wreck of a ship upon the concealed
rocks, far out from shore. I cannot ex-82

plain, by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing I felt in my soul
upon this sight, breaking out sometimes
thus :---" Oh, that there had been but one
or 't-wo, nay, or but one soul, saved out of
this ship, to have escaped to me that I
might but have had one companion, one
fellowcrentuxe, to have spoken to me and
to have conversed with!" In all the time
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest,

 

so strong 1). desire after the society of my
fellowm'cutures, or so deep 21. regret ut the
want of it.

1 But there was no sign of any living
thing on the "Tech, and I had only the

And now the thought so pressed upon
me night and day that I must go off to this
wreck, that, at last, I loaded my boat with
everything necessary and ventured to son,
after making a careful study of the (lan-
gerous currents.

When I came close to the ship, a (log
apptmred upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and, as soon as I culled
him, jumped into the sea to come to me. I

'took him into the boat, but found him
almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave
him a cake of my bread, and he devoured
it like u ravenous wolf thnt had been starv-
ing a fox-might in the snow; I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with
which, if 1 would have let him; he would.
have burst himself. After this I went on
board ; but the first sight I met with was
with two men drowned in the forecasge.

share; {or I am satisfied I might. have
louded my canoe several times over
with nn'mey; which, if I had over escaped
to England, would have lain here safe

 

 

enough till I might have come again and
fetched it.

After this vent, I lived easy enough for
near two yems, but I thoughtconstantly
of how I should get away from the island.

'One night I drowned that one of the'ric-

time of the cannilmls ran away from them
and came to me. "New," thought I, in
my dremn, "I may venture to the main.
land, for this savage will be my pilot."
After this dream, I watched every day for
the cannibals, determined to capture one of
their victims.

I had watched thus for aboutu your and
a half, when I saw one morning no less

; than live canoes on shore, and there were
' about thirty ol' the savages dancing around

a fire. "lliile I looked, I saw two miscr-
ulde wretches dragged from the boats.
One was knocked down innnedinlely and
cut up for their cookery, while. the other
"113 left standing by himself till they
would be ready for him.

This Poor wretch, seeing himself a little
at liberty, und unbound, started away from
them, and run with incredible. swul'tness
 

 

along the sands, directly towards me. I
was dreadfully frightened, when I perceived
him runany way; and especially when, as
I thoughtJ saw him pursued by the whole
body. However, my spirits began to re
cover when I found that there was not
above tlyee men that followed him: and
still more was I eueoumged, when I found
that hermit-stripped them exceedingly in
running.

V There was between them and my castle,
the creek ; but he. made nothing of it, but,
plunging in, swam through in about thirty
strokes, landed, and ran with exceeding
strength and swiftness. When the three
persons came to the creek,I found that two
of them could swim, but the third went no
fartlienand soon after went softly bxwk

.again. It came very warmly upon my,

' thoughts that now was the time to get me 1

a servant, and perhaps a companion. I

immediately ran down the ladder, fetched -

my two guns, and getting up again with

the same haste to the top of the hill, I

crossed towards the sea; and having a

very short cut, and all down hill, clap'd

 

myself in' the way between'the pursue}!
and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him that fled, who, looking back, was at
first perhaps as much fr'ghtencd at me as
at them. But I beckoned with my hand to
him to come back; and, in the mean time,
rushing at once upon the foremost, I I
knocked him down with the stock of my
piece. I was loth to fire, because I would.
not have the rest hear. Having knocked
this fellow down, the other stopped, as if
he had been frightened, and I advanced
towards him. But as I came nearer, I per-
ceived he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it to shoot at me: so I was then
obliged to shoot at him first, which I did,
and killed him at the first shot. The poor
savage Who ilerl, but had stopped, was so
frightened with the fire and noise of my
piece that. he stood stock still. I hallooed
again 1.0 him, and made signs to'come fan
ward, which he easily understood, and

came a little way, and stood, trembling. I
smiled at him pleasantly, and beckoned,
and at length he came close to me, laid his
head upon the ground, and Put my foot
upon it. This, it seems, meant; that he
would be my slave forever.

But there was more work to do. The
savage that I had knocked down began to
come to himself, and set up on the ground.
My savage motioned for me to give him my
sword, and when I gave it to him he run
quickly and out off his head at a single
stroke. \V hen he had done this, he comes
laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword inguin. But- that
'which astonished him meet, was to know
how I killed the other Indian so far 'ofi'.
When he came to him, he stood like one
amazed, looking at him, turning him first

. on one side, then on the other. He took
up his bow and arrows and came back; so
I turned to go away, and beckoned him to
follow me.

Upon this he I'llafle. signs to me that he
should bury them with sand, that they
might-not be seen by the rest, if they fol-
lowed; .nnd'so I made signs to him ugnin

 

 

 

to do so. He fell to work; and in an in.
stunt he had Scraped a hole in the sand
with his hands, big enough to bury the
first in, and then dragged him into it, and
covered him; and did so by the other also.
Then calling him away, I carried him, not
to my castle, but quite away to my cave,
on the farther part; of the island. ' Here I
gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
out, and u (l runght of water, which I found
he was indeed in great distress for, and
having refreshed him, I made signs for
him to go and lie doom to sleep, so the
poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, With
straight, strong limbs toll and well shnped;
and, as I reckon, about twentysix years of
 

a He hand a very good countenance, not
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to
have something very unruly in his face.
His hair was long and black, not curled
like wool; his.forehead very high and
huge; and a great; vivacity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The color of his
skin was not- quite black, but very tawny.
His face was round and plump; his nose
small, not flat like the Negroes; u. very
good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth
well set, and as white as ivory. After he
had slept about, half an hour, he awoke and
came out of the cure to me: for I had been
milking my goats. W'hen he espied me he
came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the pos-
sible signs of an humble, thankful disposi-
tion, making a great many antic gestures
to show it. At last he lays his head lint
upon the ground, close to my foot, und
sets my other foot upon his head, us he had
done before. _

I let him know that I understood him
and was very well pleased. In :1. little
time I began to speak to him, and teach
him to speak to me; and, fii-styl let. him
know his mum should be FRIDAY, which
was the clay I saved his life. I called him
so for the memory of the time. I likewise

taught him to say Yes and No, and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him

see me drink it before him, and sop my
bread in it; and gave him a. cake of bread ;
to do the'like, which he quickly complied I
with, and made signs that it was very good

night; but, as soon as it was (lll)",I bec-

where he hmrl buried the two men, he

I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and

Friday let me know that there had been
a great battle, and that, four prisoners, of

all into my habitation every night. But I
needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a. more faithful, loving,
sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness, or designs,
perfect-1y obliged and. engaged. His very

have sacrificed his life to sure mine,
upon any occasion whatsoever. The many
testimonies he gave me of this put it out
of doubt, and soon convinced me that I
needed no precautions for my safety on his
account.

I was greatly delighted with him, and
made it my business to tench him every-
thing that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; but especially tomake him speak, and understand me when
I spoke. And he was the uptcst scholar
that ever was; and particularly was so
men'y, so constantly diligent, and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make
me undeistnnd him, that. it was very pleas.
ant to me to fall: to him.

After I had been two or three days
returned to my castle, I thought that, in
order to bring Friday off from his horrid 1
way of feeding, and from the relish of oi
cannilml's stomach, I ought to let him taste =
other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed,

intending to kill a kid out of my own
flock, and bring it home and dress it; but
as I was going,I saws she-goat-Iying down
in the shade, and two young kids sit-ting
by her. I <<attached hold of Friday and
made signs to him not to stir; inuucdiatcly
I presented my piece, shot, and killed one
of the kids. The poor oreatme, who had,
at a distance, indeed, seen me kill his
enemy, but did not know nor could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly
surprised; trembled, and shook, and looked
so amazed that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot
at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped.
up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was
not wounded ; nod,as I found presently,
thought I was resolved to kill him; for he
came and kneelecl down to me, and embrac-
ing my knees, said a great many things I
did not understand; but I could easily see
the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him
that I would do him no harm ; and taking
him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was u-'ondei'iug, and.
looking to see how the creature was killed,
I loaded my gun again. Brand-by I sawl
a great fowl sitting upon a. tree within
shot; so, to let Friday understand a little:
what I would do, I called him tome again,|
pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a
parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground
under the parrot, to let. him see I would
make it fall: I fired, and bade him look,
and immediately he saw the parrot fall.
He stood like one frightened again, not-
withstanding nll I had said to him; and I
 

believe, if I would have let him, he would
have worshipped me and the gun. As for
the gun itself, he would not so much as
touch it for several days.

When IMday tasted the stewed kid he
let me know that he liked it very much.
The next day I roasted a piece, and when
E'ida-y came to eat it he expressed great
satisfaction, and made me understand that
he would never eat human flesh any more.
I taught him to beat and sift the com and

 

to make bread, and in a short time he was
able to do all my work as well as I could
do it myself, and we lived very happily.

I haul. a mind once to try if he had any
hankering inclination to his own country
again; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer me almost. any
question, I asked him' whether the nation
he belonged to never 'conquercd in battle.
At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes
we always fight the better."

the farther part of the island, on the said
man-eating occasions that he was now
brought for: and, some time after, when
.I took the courage to carry him to that
i side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me
he was. there 0mm, when they eat up
twenty men, two women and one child.
He could not tell twenty in English, but
=he numbered them, by laying so many
stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over.

I asked Friday a thousand questions
about his country, and he told me all he
knew. He said his; sort of people were
called Cnribs; but .l'm'ther meet there were
white-bearded men like me, and that they
had killed " much mans ;" by all of which,
I knew he meant the Spanimde whose
cruelties in America. had spread over the
whole country, and were remembered from
father to son. As the time passed away,
I talked much to Friday about God and
the Saviour, and I verily believe that he
became a better Christian than I was.
'When he could understand me well I told
him of the countries of Europe, and how
I came to be on the island. W'hen I
showed him the ship's boat which was
now falling to pieces on the shore, he told
me that such a boat had come ashore in
his country with seventeen white men in it,
and that these white men were then living
'with his people.

It was after this some time, that being
upon the top of the hill, at the east side of
the island, Friday, the weather being very
serene, looked very earnestly towards the
main land, then fell to dancing and cried,

 

savages who used to come on shore on "Oh, joy! oh, glad! there see my country."
 

 

 

That set me to thinking whether I could
not make the voyage with Friday, or send
Fridaylllom, to see if the white men were
still there.

W' hen I proposed to Friday that he
should go over alone to see his people, he
felt very badly, and said he would like to

go, but would not leave me ; so I resolvefl
to make a large (amine and make the ven-
ture. "'0 felled a. large tree near the

I loaded the two landing-pieces with

Then I took four niuskets, and loaded

them with two sligs, and five small bullets -

hum of bullets each. I hung my great

sword by my side, and gave Friday his

lhatchet. When I had thus prepared my-

self, I took my perspective-glass, and Went

soul 'within me. He told me it was not

men whom he had told me of, that came to

horror at the very naming of the white
bearded man; and going to the tree, I saw

killed them all except four who escaped in

dead.

Those that were in the canoe worked
hard to get out of gunshot, and though
Friday made two or three shots at them, I
did not find that he hit any of themri\
Friday Would fain have had me to take one
of their canoes, and pursue them; and,
indeed, I was very anxious about their
escape, lest, carrying the news home to
their people, they should come back per-
haps with two or three hundred of the
canoes, and devour us; so I oonswted to
pursue them by sea, and running to one of
their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday
follow me. But when I was in the canoe
I was surprised to find another poor crca
ture lie there, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, and almost dead with fear;
for he had not been able to look over the
side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that
he had really little life in him.

 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or
rushes, and would have helped him up;
but he could not stand or sp'eulr, but
groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
 

still, that he was only unbound in order
to be killed. W'heu Friday came to him,
I bade him speak to him, and tell him of
his deliverance ; and pulling out my bottle,
made him give the poor wreteh a drum;
which, with the news of his being do-
livered, revived him, and he sat up in the
bout. But when Friday came to hear him
speak, and look in his face, it would have
moved anyone to tears to have seen how

  

 

w-

Friday kissed him, embmeed him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hulloocd, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head: and then sung and jumped about
again like a distracted creature. It was a
good while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter;
'but when he came a little to himself, he
told me that it was his father. He went.

into the boat, and out of the boat, a. great
many fimes; when he went in to him, he
would sit down, open his breast, and hold
his father's head close to his bosom half an
hour together; then he took his arms and
ankles, which were numbed and stiff with
binding, and chufed and rubbed them with
his hands; and I gave him some rum out
of my bottle to rub them with, which did
them a. great deal of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of
the canoe with the other mvuges, who
were now gotten almost out of sight ; and
it; wus happy for us, for it blew so hard
within two hours after, and before they
could be got uquarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all night, and.
that, from the north-west, which was against
them, that I could not suppose their boat
could live.The Spaniard's limbs were as had as
those of the savage, bub Friday picked
him up and carried him to the boat, and
'paddled it along to the creek, and so we
got home. NeiLher the savage nor the
Spaniard could climb over the wall, so we
made them a good bent outside. But they
soon got well and as strong as Friday and
myself. .

I had Friday ask his father what he
fihought of the escape. of the savages in

that they could never live out the storm,
but, if they did, that they were so dread-

being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that
he believed they would tell the people
they were all killed by thunder nnd'lighb--

Friday and I were two heavenly spirits,

them allay out so, in their language, one

to cc'mceive that a man could dart fire, and

master, they are come, they are come I"
I jumped up, and went Out as soon as I
could get my clothes on, through my little
grove, which, by the way, was by this time
grown to he a very thick wood. But I was
surprised, when, presently, I saw a boat
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder
of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in; also
I observed, presently, that they did not
come from that side which the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and
bade him lie close, for these were not the
people we looked for, and that we might
not know yet whether they were friends or
enemies. In the next place, I went in to
fetch my perspective glass, to see what I
could make out of them. I had seal-cc set
foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly
discovered a ship lying at anchor, not above
a league and a. half from the. shore. By my
observation, it appeared plainly to be an
English ship, and. the boat appeared to he
an English long-boat.

'I cannot express the confusion I was in,
though the joy of seeing a ship, and one
that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently
friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hanging

 

about me--I cannot tell from whence they
crane--bidding me keep upon my guard,

I was fully satisfied they were English-
men, at least most of them; one or two I

 

thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and,
as I thought, bound; and when the first
four or five of them were jumped. on shore,
they took those three out of the boat, as
prisoners. One of the three I could per-
ccire using the most passionate gestures of
entreaty, affliction, and despair; the other
two, I could perceive, lifted up their
hands sometimes, and appeared concerned,
indeed, but not to such a degree as the
{inst I was perfectly confounded at the -
sight, and know not what the meaning of
it should be. Friday called out to me in
English, as well as he could, "0 master!
you see English mans eat prisoner as well
as savage mans." "Why, Friday," says I,
"do you think they are going to eat them,
then Z"----"Yes," says Friday, "they will
eat them."---"No, 110," says I, "Friday; I
am afraid they will murder them, indeed;
but you may he sure they will not eat
them,"

All this while I had no thought of What
the matter really was, but stood trembling
with the horror of the sight, expecting
every moment when the three prisoners
should be killed: nay, once I saw one of
the villains lift up his arm with a. great
Cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike oneof the poor men; and I expected
to sec him {all every moment; at which
all the blood in my body seemed to run
chill in my veins. I Wished heartily now

upon the ground, very pensive, and looked
like men in despair.

It was just at the top of high water
when these people. came on shore; and
while they rambled about to see what kind
of a place they-were in, they had carelesaly
stayed till the tide was spent, leaving their
bout aground. They had lel' t two men in

testimony of his gratitude that he was mercy. The captain told them he would

me. I told him the best method I could
think of was to fire on them at once as
they lay. He said, very modestly, that he
was loth to kill them, if he could help it ;
but that those two Were incorrigible vil-
lains, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped,
we should be undone still, for they would
go on board and bring the whole ship's
company, and destroy us all.

In the middle of this discourse we heard
some of them awake, and soon after we
saw two of them on their feet. I asked
him if either of them were the men who
he had said were the heads of the mutiny?
He said, "No." "Well, then," Said I,
"you may let them escape; if the rest
escape you,it is your fault." Animated were upon the island.

and those in our keeping, though they

answer to them. Then three men got into
the boat and put her off a little way from
the shore, while the other seven started to
find their companions. '
It seems they Were too much frightened
to go far from the shore, but they went to
the top of a hill and halloocd several

\

the shore, I inntgined it to he as it really
was; but I prescntlythought of a strata:-
gem to fetch them back again, and which
answered my end to a tittle. I ordered
Friday and the captain's mute to go over
the little creek to n rising ground, at about
half a mile distance, and halloo out as loud
as they could; and that as soon as ever
they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again; and then keeping
out of sight, take a. round, always answor-
ing when the others hallooed, to draw them
as far into the island as possible.
 

They were just going into the boat,
when Friday and the mate hallooed; and
they answering, ran along the shore west-
ward, towards the voice they heard, when
they were presently stopped by the crock,
Where, the water being up, they could not
get over, and culled for the boat to come
up and setthcm over, us I expected. When
they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up in good way
into the creek, they took one of the three
men out of her, to go along with them, and
left only two in the boat, having fastened
her to the stump of a. little tree on the
shore. This was what I wished for; and
immediately leaving Friday and the cap
tu-in's mate to their business, I took the
rest with me, and crossing the creek out. of

109

their sight, we surprised. the two men before
they were aware ; one of them lying,r on
the shore, and the other being in the boat.
The fellow on shore was between sleeping
and waking, and going to start up. The cup-
tain, who was foremost, ran in upon him,
and knocked him down; and then called
out to him in the host to yield, or he was
an. dead man. There needed very few argu-
ments to persuade a single man to yield,
when he saw five men upon him, and
his comrade knocked down. In the

meantime, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the
rest, that they drew them, by hullooing and
answering, from one hill to another, till
they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they could not reach back to
 

 

the boat before it was dark; and, indeed,
they were heartily tired themselves also,
by the time they came back to us.

When they came back to the boot in
the dark, and found it high on the shore of
the creek, n-nd their two men gone, they
began to complain that they were on an
enchanted island.

I made the man they hnd left in the
boat, who was now one of us, call them
by name, to try if I could bring them to
a pnrley. So he calls out as loud as he
could to one of them, "Tom Smith! Tom
Smith ! For God's sake, throw down your
arms' and yield, or you are all dead men

says Smith quickly.
"Here they are,"

hunting you these
two hours; the boat-I -

at once, you are all

Then the captain
called out that if they
would lay down their
arms, the governor,
by whom he meant
me, would spare all
their lives, except
that; of Will Atkins,
who, it seems, was the
first man to mutiny.
and lay hold of the captain. They all lay

down their arms at once, and we bound

them and took some to the cave, and the
others to my bower. I mended the hole
that We had made in the first boat, and
after talking with the prisoners, the cap-
tain picked out those that he could trust
and started to retake the ship, reaching her
about midnight.

Those that were on the deck were not
elm-med at seeing their own bouts coming
back, and so the captain, after a short
fight, captured them all and put down the
hatches to keep the otheis below. They
then broke open the door of the round-

as he fired upon them and would not sub- '
mit, the mate shot him dead. The next

day his,body was hung up at the yard-

urm as a warning to the rest.

When the captain came book, he told
me he had brought me some little refresh-
ments, such as the ship afforded. ' Upon
this, he called aloud to the boat, and bade
his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and, indeed, it was a
present as if I had been one that was not
to be carried away along with them, but
as if I had been to dwell upon the island
still, and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles
full of excellent cordial waters, six large
bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of
excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces
of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of pens, and about a hunched-
Weight of biscuit. He also brought me a
box of sugar, a box of flour, a. bag full of
lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things. But besides
these, he brought me six new .'clean
' shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a. hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn
but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot. It was a very kind and
agreeable present, as any one may imagine,
to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkwm'd, and uneasy as it was
to met-o wear such clothes at their first
putting on.

After dressing in my new clothes, so as
to look more like a real governor than in
my goat shine, I had all the rebels brought

before me, and I told them I had got a full
account how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit further
robberies. I let them know that by my

 

direction the ship had been seized; that
she lay now in the road ,' and they might
see that their new captain had received the
reward of his villany; that, as to them, I
wanted to know what they had to say why
I should not execute them as pirates, as
they could not doubt but I had authority
to do.

One of them answered that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they
were taken, the captain promised them
their lives, and they humbly implored my
mercy. But I told them I knew not what
mercy to Show them; for as for myself I
had resolved to quit the island with all my

Upon this they begged that I would let

history, and how I had managed every-
thing. I left them all my firearms and
about a barrel and a half of gunpowder,

very nice gentleman; he will not go a step
out of his way for a, prince; nay, if you
are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way and keep going on; for if you
stop, and stand still, and look at him, he
takes it for an affront ;

to piusue his revenge--that is his first

afironted, he will never leave you, night or
day, but follow at a good round rate till
he overtakes you.

When, on a sudden, we .espled the bean;
We were a little surprised. "Oh-012,011!"
says Friday; "oh, master! you give me te
leave, me shakee te hand 'with him; me
makee you good laugh."

"You fool," said I, " he will eat you

down he sits, and gets his boots off in a
moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as
we cull the flat shoes they wear, and which
he had in his pocket), gives my other ser-
vant his horse, and with his gun away he
flew, swift like the wind.

The beer was walking softly on, and
oflered to meddle with nobody, till Friday
coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him: "Hark ye, hark
ye," says Friday, "me speakee with you."
W/o followed at a distance. Friday, who

but if you throw- ,

had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came
up with him quickly, and took up a. great
stone, and threw it at him, and hit him
just on the head, but did him no more

 

harm than if he had thrown it agztinsta. '
wall. But it answered Friday's end, for the
rogue was so void of fear that he (lid it I
purely to inn-kc the boar follow him, and
show us some laugh, as he called it. As
soon us the bear felt the stone, and saw
him, he turns about, and comes after him,
taking very long strides, and shuffling on
at a strange rate, so as would have put a.
horse to n middling gallop. Away runs
