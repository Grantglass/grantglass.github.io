\\-'RL'.CKED.

OR many days we had been tempest-tossed. Six times had the darkness
closed over a wild and terrific scene, and returning light as often
brought but renewed distress, for the raging storm increased in fury until
an the seventh day all hope was lost. "We were driven completely out of
our course; no conjecture could be formed as to our whereabouts. The
crew had lost heart, and were utterly exhausted by incessant labour.

The riven masts had gone by the board, leaks had been sprung in every
direction, and the water, which rushed in, gained upon us rapidly.

Instead of reckless oaths, the seamen now uttered frantic cries to God
for mercy, mingled with strange and often ludicrous vows; to be performed
should deliverance be granted.

Every man on board alternately commended his soul to his Creator
and strove to bethink himself of some means of saving his life.

My heart sank as I looked round upon my family in the midst of
these horrors. Our four young sons were overpowered by terror. "Dear
children," said I, " if the Lord will, He can save us even from this fearful
peril ; if not, let us calmly yield our lives into His hand, and think of the
joy and blessedness of finding ourselves for ever and ever united in that
happy home above." At these words my weeping wife looked bravely up,

_ and, as the boys clustered round her, she began to cheer and encourage
them with calm and loving words. I rejoiced to see her fortitude, though
my heart was ready to break as I gazed on my dear ones.

We knelt down together, one after another praying with deep earnest-
ness and emotion. Fritz, in particular, besought help and deliverance for
his dear parents and brothers, as though quite forgetting himself.

Our hearts were soothed by the never-failing comfort of child-like con-
fiding prayer, and the horrors of our situation seemed less overwhelming.
"Ah," thought I, "the Lord will hear our prayerl He will help us."

Amid the roar of the thundering waves 1 suddenly heard the cry of
"Land! land!" while at the same instant the ship struck with a frightful
shock, which threw everyone to the deck, and seemed to threaten her
immediate destruction.IO Tl!!! .5" 755' l". I all/fl 1' A'Ul}/.VSO.\".

Dreadful sounds betokened the breaking up of the ship, and the roaring
waters poured in on all sides.

Then the voice of the captain was heard above the tumult, shouting,
"Lowe: away the boats! We are lost!"

"Lost!" I exclaimed, and the word went like a. dagger to my heart;
but seeing my children's terror renewed, l composed myself, calling out
cheerfully, "Take courage, my boys! we are all above water yet. There is
the land not far off; let us do our best to reach it. You know God helps
those that help themselves!" V\-'itl1 that, I left tllCll'l and went on deck.
What was my horror when through the foam and spray l beheld the only
remaining boat leave the ship, the last of the seamen spring into her and
push ofi', "Wordless of my cries and entroaties that we might be allowed to
share thei ender chance of preserving their lives. My voice was drowned
:' the howling ol' the blast, and even had the crew wished it, the return
of the boat was impossible.

Casting my eyes despairingly around, I became gradually aware that
our position was by no means hopeless, inasmuch as the stern of the ship
containing our Cabin was jammed between two high rocks and was partly
*iised from among the breakers which dashed the ibrepart to pieces. As
the clouds m" mist and rain drove past, I could make out, through rents in
the vaporons curtain, a line of rocky coast, and, rugged as it was, my heart
bounded towards it as a sign of help in the hour of need. Yet the sense
of our lonely and forsaken condition weighed heavily upon me as I returned
to my family, constraining myself to say with a smile, "Courage, dear ones!
Although our good ship will never sail more. she is so placed that our
cabin will remain above water, and tomorrow, if the wind and waves abate,
l see no reason why we should not be able to get ashore."

These few words had an immediate effect on the spirits of my children,
who had once regarded our problematical chance of escaping as a happy
certainty, and began to enjoy the relief from the violent pitching and rolling
of the \'LSSOl. My wife, however, perceived my distress and anxiety in
spite of my forced composure, and I made her comprehend our real situa-
tion, ~greatly tearing the eiiect oi" the intelligence on her nerves. Not for
a moment did he- rourago and trust in Providence forsake her, and on
seeing this, my tortitude revived.

"We must find some food, and take a good supper," said she; "it will
never do to grow faint by fasting,r too long. We shall require our utmost
strength to-inni'l'0\\:,"

Night drew on apuee, the storm was as fierce as ever, and at intervals
we were startled by crashes announcing further damage to our unfortu--
nate ship. "God will help us soon now, won't He, father?" said my
youngest child.

"You silly little thing," said Fritz, my eldest son, sharply, "don't you
Lnow that we must not. settle what God is to do for us? We must have
patience and wait His time."H'A'li'CK/fl), 1 1

"Very well said, had it been said kindly, Fritz, my boy. You too
often speak harshly to your brothers, although you may not mean to do so."

A good meal being nowrcady, my youngsters ate heartily, and, retiring
to rest, were speedily fast asleep. Fritz, who was of an age to be aware
of the real danger we were in, kept watch with us. After a long silence,
"Father," said he, "don't you think we might contrive swimming--belts for
mother and the boys? with those we might all escape to land, for you and
I can swim."

"Your idea is so good," answered I, "that lshall arrange something at
once, in case- of an accident durinn' the night. "

\-\'0 immediately searched about lor what would ansue1 the pu1pose,
and io1t11natelysgot hold oi a number 01 empty flasks and [in ca Lsters,
which we connected two and two togetlm so as to 101111 floats sulliciently
buoyant to support a person in the water, and my will: and young sons
each willingly put one on. I then provided mySulf with 111.1tchos, knives,
cord, and other portable articles, trusting that, should the vessel go to pieces
before daylight, we might gain the shore, not wholly destitute.

liz'ltZ, as well as his brothers, 110w slept soundly. Throughout the night
my wife and I maintained our prayerful watch, dreading at every fresh sound
some fatal change in the position of the wrcrlc.

At length the faint dawn of day appeared, the long weary night was
over, and with thankful hearts we perceived that the gale had begun to
moderate; blue Sky was Seen above us, and the lovely hues of sunrise
adorned the eastern horizon.

l aroused the boys, and we assembled on the remaining portion of the
deck, when they, to their surprise, discovered that no one else was on board.

"Hallo, papa! what has become of everybody? Are the sailors gone?
Have they taken away the boats? Oh, papa! why did they leave us
behind ? What can we do by ourselves?"

"My good children," I rephed, "we must not despair, although we
seem deserted. See how those on whose skill and good faith we depended
have lclt us cruelly to our fate in the hour of danger. God will never do
so. He has not forsaken us, and we will trust Him still. Only let us bestir
ourselves, and each cheerily do his best. Who has anything to propose '3"

"T he sea will soon be calm enough for swimming," said Fritz.

"And that would be all very fine for you," exclaimed Ernest, "but
think of mother and the rest of us! Why not build a raft and all get on
shore together?"

"We should find it dillieult, I think, to make a raft that would carry
us safe to shore. However, we must contrive something, and first let each
my to procure what will be of most use to us." i

Away we all went to see what was to be found, I myself proceeding,r
to examine, as of greatest consequence, the supplies of provisions and fresh
water within our reach. -

My wife took her youngest son, Franz, to help her to feed the unfor-

innate animals on board, who were in a pitiful plight, having been 11e--
glectcd for several days.

Fritz hastened to the arm-chest, Ernest to look for tools; and Jack
went tow-aids the captain's cabin, the door of which he no sooner opened
than out sprang tuo splendid large dogs, who testified Lhei1 exticnic delight
and giatitude by such tremendous bounds that they knocked theii little (le-
liverer completely head over heels, frightening him .nearly out of his wits.
Jack did not long yield either to fear or anger, he presently recovered him--
self, the dogs seemed to ask pardon by vehemently licking his face and
hands, and so, seizing the larger by the ears, he jumped on his back, and,
to my great amusement, coolly rode to meet me as I came up the hatchway.

When we re-assenihled in the cabin, we all displayed our treasures.
I'ritz brought a couple of guns, shot-belt, powderflasks, and plenty of bullets.

Ernest produced a cap full of nails, an axe, and a hammer, while pin--
cers, Chisels, and angers stuck out of all his pockets.

Little Franz carried a box, and eagerly began to show us the " nice
sharp little hooks " it contained. "Well, done, Franz !" cried I, "these fish-
liooks, which you the youngest have found, may contribute more than
anything else in the ship to save our lives by procuring food for us. Fritz
and Ernest, you have chosen well."

" Will you praise me too?" said my dear wife. "I have nothing to
show, but l can give you good news. Some useful animals are still alive;
a cow, a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, and a fine sow. I was but
just in time to save their lives by taking food to them."

"All these things are excellent indeed," said I; "but my friend Jack
here has presented are with a couple of huge hungry useless dogs, who will
eat more than any of us."

"011, papa! they will be of use! Why, they will help us to hunt when
we got on shore l"

" No doubt they will, if ever we do get on shore, Jack; but I must
say I don't know how it is to be done."

"Can't we each get into a big tub, and float there ?"' returned he. "I
have often sailed splendidly like that, round the pond at home."

"My child, you have hit on a capital idea," cried I. "Now, Ernest,
let me have your tools, hammers, nails, saw, angers, and all; and then
make haste to collect any tubs you can find !"

We very soon found four large tasks, made of sound wood, and strongly
bound with iron hoops; they were floating with many other thinas in the
water in the hold, but we managed to fish them out, and drag them to a
suitable place for launching them. They were exactly what I wanted, and
I succeeded in sawing them across the middle. Hard work it was, and we
were glad enough to stop and refresh ourselves with wine and biscuits.

MV- eig ht tubs 110w stood ranged in a row near the water' s edge, and
I looked at them with great satisfaction; to my suiprise, my wife did not
seem to share my pleasure!ll'li'la'i"A'.".'/). Li

"'I shall never," said
she, " muster courage to
get into one of these l"

" Do not he too sure
of that, dear wife; when
you see lll)' corrti-i\-'zui('.c
cmnplctcd, you will perhaps
prefer it to this immove-
able wreck."

I next procured a long
thin plank on which my
tubs could be fixed, and

upwards so as to form a
keel. Other two planks
were nailed along the sides
ofthe tubs ,' they also being
flexible, were brought to a. point at each end, and all firmly secured and
nailed together. I felt satisfied that in smooth water this craft would be
perfectly trustworthy. But when we thought all was ready for the launch.
we found, to our dismay, that the grand (:outrirance was so heavy and
clumsy, that even our united efforts could no: more it an inch.

"1 must have a lever," cried I. "Run and fetch the capstan-bar l"

Fritz quickly brought one, and having forrued'rollers by cutting up u
long spar, I raised the fore~part of my boat with the bar, and my sons
placed a roller under it.

"How is it, father," inquired Ernest, " that with that thing you alone
can do more than all or" us together?"

'I explained, as well as I could in a hurry, the principle of the lever ;
and promised to have it long till: on the subject of mechanics, should we
have a future opportunity.

I now made first a long rope to the stern or" our boat, attaching the
other end to a beam; then placing a second and third roller under it, we
once more began to push, this time with success, and soon our gallant Craft
was safely launched: so swiftly indeed (lid she glide into the water that, but
for the rope, she would have passed beyond our reach. The boys wished
to jump in directly ; but, alas, she leaned so much on one side that they
could not venture to do so.

Sonic heavy things being thrown in, however, the bout rightcd itself by
degrees, and the boys were so delighted that they struggled which should
first leap in to have the fun of sitting down in the tubs. But it was plain
to me at once that something more was required to make her perfectly
safe, so I contrived outriggers to preserve the balance, by nailing long poles
across at the stem and stern, and fixing at the ends of each empty brandy-
czrslis. Then, the boat appearing steady, I got in ; and turning it towards

the most open side of the wreck, I cut and cleared away obstructions, so
as to leave a free passage for our departure, and the boys brought cars to
be ready for the voyage. This important undertaking we were forced to
postpone until the next (lay, as it was by this time far too late to attempt
it. It was not pleasant to have to spend another night in so precarious a.
situation; but, yielding to necessity, we sat down to enjoy a comfortable
supper, for during our exciting and incessant work all day we had taken
nothing but an occ 'ioual biscuit and a little wine.

We prepared for rest in a much happicr frame of mind than on the
preceding day, but 1 did not forget the possibility of a renewed storm, and
therefore made everyone put on the belts as before.

1 persuaded my wife (not without considerable difficulty) to put on a
sailor's dress, assuring her she would find it much more comfortable and
convenient for all she would have to go through. She at last consented to
do this, and left us for a short time, reappearing. with much cmlmrrassmeut
and many blushes, in a most becoming suit, which she had found in a mid-
shipnian's chest. We all admired her costume, and any awkwardness she
felt soon began to pass off; then retiring to our berths, peaceful sleep pre-
pared us all for the exertions of the coming day.

"'6 rose up betimcs, for sleep weighs lightly on the hopeful, as well as
on the anxious. Alter kneeling together in prayer, "Now, my beloved
ones," said I, " with God's help we are about to effect our escape. Let the
poor animals we must leave behind be well fed, and put plenty of fodder
within their reach: in a few days we may be able to return, and save them
likewise. After that, collect everything you can think of which may be of
use to us."

The boys .joyfully obeyed me, and I selected from the large quantity
of stores they got together, canvas to make a tent, a chest of carpenters
tools, guns, pistols, powder, shot, and bullets, rods and fishing--tackle, an
iron pot, a case of portable soup, and another of biscuit. These useful
articlesof course took the place of the ballast I had hastily thrown in the
day before.

With a hearty prayer for God's blessing, we now began to take our
seats, each in his tub. Just then we heard the cocks begin to crow, as
though to reproach us for deserting them. "Why should not the fowls go
with us l" exclaimed I. "If we find no food for "Him, they can be food
for us." " Ten hens and a couple of cocks were accordingly placed in one
of the tubs, and secured with some wire-netting over them.

The ducks and geese were set at liberty, and tool: to the water at
once, while the pigeons, rejoicing to find themselv's on the. wing, swiftly
made for the shore. My wife, who managed all this for me, kept us waiting
for her some little time, and came at last with a bag as big as a pillow in
her arms. "This is my contribution," said she, throwing the bag,toilittlc
Franz, to be, as i thought, a cushion for him to sit upon.

All being,r ready, we cast oil, and moved away from the wreck. MyU'JPIECICED. 15

good, brave wife sat in the first compartment of the boat; next her was
Franz, a pretty little boy, nearly eight years old. Then came .Fritz, a
handsome, spirited young fellow of fifteen ; the two centre tubs contained
the valuable cargo; then came our bold thoughtless luck; next him lirnest,
my second son, intelligent, well-informed, and rather indolent. l myself. the
anxious. loving father, stood in the stern, endeavouring to guide the roll.
with its precious burden to a safe landing-place.

The older boys tool; the oars, everyone wore a float belt, and had
something useful close to him in case of being thrown into the water.

The tide was flowing, which was a great help to the young oarsmcn.
We emerged from the wreck and glided into the open sea. All e_\ -s were
strained to get a full view of the land, and the boys pulled with a will;
but for some time we made no progress. as the boat kept turningr round
and round, until I hit upon the right way to steer it, alter which we
merrily made for the shore.

We had left the two dogs, Turk and Juno, on the wreck, as, being both
large mastiffs, we did not care to have their additional weight on board our
craft; but when they saw us apparently deserting them, they set up a pite--
ous howl, and sprang into the sea. I was sorry to see this, for the dis-
tance to the land was so great that I scarcely expected them to be able to
accomplish it. They followed us, however, and, occasionally resting: their
forepaws on the Outriggers, kept up with us well. Jack was inclined to
deny them this, their only chance of safety. "Stop," said I, "that would
he unkind as well as foolish; remember, the merciful man i'etzardeth the life
of his beast."

Our passage, though tedious, was safe; but the nearer wt: approached the.
shore the less inviting it appeared; the barren rocks seemed to threaten us
with misery and want.

Many casks, boxes, and bales of goods floated on the water around us.
Fritz and I managed to secure a couple of hogsheads, so as to tow them
alongside. With the prospect of famine before us, it was desirable to lay
hold of anything likely to contain provisions.

B_'--and-by we began to perceive that, between and beyond the cliffs.
green grass and trees were discernible. Fritz (-onld distinguish many tall
palms, and Ernest hoped they would prove "to he cocoanut trees, and
enjoyed the thoughts of drinking the refreshing milk.

"I am very sorry I never thought of bringing away the captain's tolu-
scopc," said I.

"Oh, look here, father!" cried Jack, drawing,r a little spy-glass joyfully
out of his pocket.

By means of this glass, l made out that at some distance to the left
the coast was much more inviting; a strong current, however, carried us
directly towards the frowning rocks, but I presently observed an opening,
where a stream flowed into the sea, and saw that our geese and ducks were
swimming towards this place. I steered after them into the creek, and wt.-16 7'11]! SAW-755 FAN/ll. l" NOB/"BUN.

{mind Ourselves in a small bay or inlet where the water was perfectly smooth
and of moderate depth. The ground sloped gently upwards from the low
banks to the clill's, which here retired inland, leaving a small plain, on which
it was easy for us to land. Everyone sprang gladly out of the boat but
little Franz, who, lying packed in his tub like a potted shrimp, had to he
lifted out by his mother.

The dogs had scrambled 011 shore before us; they r ceived us with loud
barking and the wildest demonstrations of delight. The geese and ducks
kept up an incessant din, added to which was the screaming and croaking
0i fiamingoes and penguins, whose dominion we were i11'ading. The noise
was deafening, but far from unwelcome to me, as I thought of the good
dinners the birds might furnish.

As soon as we could gather our children around us on dry land, we
knelt to offei than? s and praise 101 our merciful escape, and with full hea1ts
we commended ourselves to Gods good keeping lor the time to come.

All hands then briskly feil to the work of unloading, and oh, how rich
we felt ourselves as we did so! The poultry we left at liberty to to"
for themselves, and set about finding a suitable place to erect a tent in w 1
to pass the night. This we speedily (lid; thrusting a long spar into a hole
in the rock, and supporting the other end by a pole firmly planted in the
ground, we formed a framework over which we stretched the sailcloth we
had brought; besides fastening this down with pegs, we placed our he aw
Chests and boxes on the borde1 ol' the canvas, 21nd a11anged hooks so as to
be able to close up the enhance duiing the night.

When this was accomplished, the boys ran to collect moss and grass.
to spread in the tent for our beds, while I arranged a fire- -place with some
l'mfi'e llat stones, near the bunk which flowed close by. Dry twigs and sea-

and giving my wife several cakes of the p01 table soup, she established her-
self as our cook, with little Franz to help her.

He, thinking his mother was melting some glue for cai'penteri1ig,.\1,'as
eager to know "what papa was going to make next?"

"This is to be soup for your dinner, my child. Do you think these
cakes look like glue?"

"Yes, indeed, I do!" replied Franz, "and 1 should not much like to
taste glue soup! Don't you want some beef or mutton, main-.1121?"

"Where can I get it, clear?" said she; "we are along way from a
butcher's shop! but these cakes are made of the juice of good meat, boiled
till it becomes a strong stiff jelly-- people take them when they go to sea,
because on a long voyage thev can 0111) have salt meat which will not

and went along the 10113411 coast to we hawhit lay beyond the stleam; this

I was anxious to land the two casks which were floating alongside our
boat, but on attemptingr to do so, 1 found that I could not get them up the
bank on which we had landed, and was therefore obliged to look for a
more convenient spot. As I did so, I was startled by hearing Jack shouting
for help, as though in great danger. He was at some distance, and I hur-
ried towards him with a hatchet in my hand. The little fellow stood scream-
ing in a deep pool, and as I approached, I saw that a huge lobster had
taught his leg in its powerful claw. Poor Jack was in a terrible fright; kick
as he would, his enemy still clung on. I waded into the water, and seizing

the lobster firmly by the hack, managed to make it loosen its hold, and
we brought it safe to land. Jack, having speedily recovered his spirits, and
anxious to take such a prize to his mother, caught the lobster in both hands,
but instantly received such a severe blow from its tail, that he Hung,r it
down, and passionately hit the creature with a large stone. This display of
temper vexed me. "You are acting in a very childish way, my son," said
I; "never strike an chem}.r in a revongeful spirit." Once more lifting the
lobster, Jack ran triumphantly towards the tent.

" Mother, mother! a lobster! A lobster, Ernest! look here, Franz!
mind, he'll bite you! Where's Fritz?" All came crowding round Jack and1N Til/2' .WVJS'S' iiiL-'li/L' V 11' ()/)i'.-'\'.S'0.-V.

his prize, wondering at. its unusual size, and Ernest wanted his mother to
make lobster soup directly, by adding it to what she was now boiling.

She, however, begged to decline making any such experiment, and said
she preferred cooking one dish at a. time. Having remarked that the scene
of Jack's adventure afforded a convenient place for getting my tasks on shore,
I returned thither and succeeded in drawingr them up on the beach, where
I set them on end, and for the present left them.

On my return I resumed the subject of Jack's lobster, and told him he
should have the olfending claw all to himselt \i hen it \'as ready 1.0 be eaten,
congmtulating him on being the first to discover anvthing useful.

"As to that," said Lrnest, "I found something 1e1y cood to eat, as
well as Jack, only I Could not get at them without wetting my feet."

"Pooh!" cried Jack. "I know what he saw--nothing but some nasty
mussels--I saw them too. Who wants to eat trash like that! Lobster
for me l " .

"I believe them to be oysters, not mussels," returned Ernest calmly.

"Be good enough, my philosophical young friend, to fetch a few specimens
of these oysters in time for our next meal," said I; "we must all exert
ourselves, Ernest, for the common good, and pray never let me hear-you
object to wetting your 'feet. See how quickly the sun has dried Jack
and me."

"I can bring some salt at the same time, " said Ernest; " l remarked a
good deal lying in the crevices of the rocks; it tasted very pure and good,
and I_ concluded it \1 as produced by the ex aporation of sea water in
the sun.'

" Extremely probable, learned sir," cried I ,' "but if you had brought a
bag full of this good salt instead of merely speculating so profoundly on
the subject, it would have been more to the purpose. Run and fetch some
directly." It proved to be salt str'e enough, although so impure that it seemed
useless, till my wife dissolved and strained it, when it became fit to put
in the soup.

"Why not use the sea--water itself?" asked Jack.

" Because," said Ernest, " it is not only salt, but bitter too. Just try it."

"Now," said my wife, lasting the soup with the stick with which she
had been stirring it, "dinner is ready, but where can Fritz be?" she con-
tinued, a little anxiously.

"How are we to eat our soup when he does come?" I asked: "We
have neither plates nor spoons, and we can scarcely lift the boiling pot to
our months. We are in as uncomlbrtable a position as was the. for to whom
the stork served up a dinner in a jug with a long neck."

"Oh, for a few cocoanut--shellsl" sighed Ernest.

" Oh, for half a dozen plates and as many Silver spoons!" rejoined l,
smiling.

" Really though, oyster-shells would do," said be, after a moment:
thought.

"True, that is an
idea worth having] Off
with you, my boys, get
the oysters, and clean
out a few shells. What
though our spoons have
no handles, and we do

in hating the soup out!"

Jack was away and
up to his knees in the
water in a moment, de-
taching the oysters.
Ernest followed more
leisurely, and, still un~
willing to wet his feet,
stood by the margin of
the pool and gathered in
his handkerchief the oys-

he picked up and pocketed
a large mussel-shell for his own use. As they returned with a good supply
we heard a shout from Fritz in the distance; we returned it joyfully, and
he presently appeared before us, his hands behind his hack, and a look of
disappointment upon his countenance.

" Unsuccessful I" said he.

"Really I" I replied; " never mind, my boy--better luck next time."

"Oh, l'ritz!" exclaimed his brothers, who had looked behind him, "a
sucking-pig, a little sucking-pig! "'here did you get it? How did you
shoot it! Do let us see itl"

Fritz then, with sparkling eyes, exhibited his prize.

"l am glad to see the result of your prowess, my boy," said l; "but 1.
cannot approve of deceit, even as a joke; stick to the truth in just and
earnest."

liritz then told us how he had been to the other side of the stream.
"So dill'erent from this," he said; "it is really a. beautilul country, and the
shore. which runs down to the sea in a gentle slope, is covered with all
sorts of useful things from the wreck. Do let us go and collect them. And,
father, why should we not return to the wreck and bring off some of the
an'lmals'." Just think of what value the cow would he to us, and what a
pity it would be to lose her. Let us got her on shore, and we will more
over the stream, where she will have good pasturage, and we shall be in
the shade instead of on this desert, and, father, I do wish-----"

"Skip, stop, my boy!" cried I. "All will be done in good time.an .7711? .S'N'ISX f-L'iflh'lil' ROB/AES'OIV.

To-morrow and the day after will bring work of their own. And tell me,
did you see no traces of our shipmates?"

" Not a sign of them, either on land or sea, living or dead," he replied.

"But the sucking--pig," said Jack, "where did you get it?"

" It was one of several," said Fritz, " which I found on the shore; most
curious animals they are; they hopped rather than walked, and every now
and then would squat down on their hind legs and rub their snouts with
their fore-paws. Had not I been afraid of losing them all, I would have
tried to catch one alive, they seemed so tame."

Meanwhile, Ernest had been carefully examining the animal in question.

"This is no pig," he said; " and except for its bristly skin, does not
look like one. See, its teeth are not like those of a pig, but rather those of
a squirrel. In fact," he continued, looking at Fritz, " your sucking--pig is
an agonti."

" Dear me," said Fritz, "iisten to the great professor lecturing! He is
going to prove that a pig is not a pig!"

"You need not be so quick to laugh at your brother," said I, in my
turn: "he is quite right. l, too, know the agouti by descriptions and pic-
tures, and there is little doubt that this is a specimen. The little animal is
a native of North America, where it makes its nest under the roots of trees,
and lives upon fruit. But, Ernest, the agouti not only looks something like
a pig, but most decidedly grunts like a porkcr."

While we were thus talking, Jack had been vainly endeavouring to open
an oyster with his large knife. "Here is a simpler way," said I, placing
an oyster on the fire; it immediately opened. "Now," I continued, "who
will try this delicacy?" All at first hesitated to partake of them, so un~
attractive did they appear. Jack, however, tightly closing his eyes and
making a face as though about to take medicine, gulped one down. We
followed his example, one after the other, each doing so rather to provide
himself with a spoon than with any hope of cultivating a taste for oysters.

Our spoons were now ready, and, gathering round the pot, we dipped
them in, not, however, without sundry sealdcd fingers. Ernest then drew
from his pocket the large shell he had procured for his own use, and scoop-
ing up a good quantity of soup he put it down to cool, smiling at his own
foresight.

" Prudence should be exercised for others," I remarked; " your cool soup
will do capitally for the dogs, my boy; take it to them, and then come and
eat like the rest of us."

Ernest winced at this, but, silently taking up his shell, he placed it on
the ground before the hungry dogs, who lapped up its contents in a mo-
ment; he then returned, and we all went merrily on with our dinner.
While we were thus busily employed, we suddenly discovered that our dogs,
not satisfied with their mouthful of soup, had cspicd the agouti, and were
rapidly devouring,r it. 1" ritz, seizing his gun, flew to rescue it from their hungry
jaws, and, before I could prevent him, struck one of them with such force. Tl 't'x'l." {Ii/1'1). 2|
that his gun was bent. The poor beasts ran off howling, followed by a
shower of stones from Fritz, who shouted and yelled at them so fiercelv
that his mother was actually terrified. I followed him, and as soon as he
would listen to me, represented to him how deepicable as well as wicked
was such an outbreak of temper: "for," "aid l, " you have hurt, if not actu-
ally wounded, the dogs; you have distressed and terrified your mother, and
spoiled your gun."

Though l"ritz's passion was easily aroused it never lasted long, and,
speedily recovering himself, immediately he entreated his mother's pardon,
and expressed his sorrow for his fault.

By this time the sun was sinking beneath the horizon, and the poultry,
which had been straying,y to some little distance, gathered round us, and
began to pick up the crumbs of biscuit which had fallen during our repast.
My wife hereupon drew from her mysterious hag some handfuls of oats,
peas, and other grain, and with thein'began to feed the poultry. She at
the same time showed me several other seeds of various vegetables. "That
was indeed thoughtful," said I; "but pray be careful of what will be 01'
such value to us; we can bring plenty of damaged biscuits from the wreck,
which, though of no use as food for us, will suit the fowls very well indeed."

The pigeons now flew up to crevices in the rocks, the {owls perched
theinSeIi-'es on our tent-pole, and the ducks and geese waddled off cackling
and quacking to the marshy margin of the river. We, too, were ready for
repose, and, having loaded our guns, and offered up our prayers to God,
thanking Him for His many mercies to us, we commended ourselves to His
protecting care, and as the last ray of light departed, closed our tent and
lay down to rest.

The children remarked the suddenness of nightlidl, for indeed there had
been little or no twilight. This convinced me that we must be not far
from the equator, for twilight results from the refraction of the sun's rays;
the more obliquely these rays fall, the farther does the partial light extend,
while the more perpendicularly they strike the earth the longer do they
continue their undiminished force, until, when the sun sinks, they totally
disappear, thus producing sudden darkness.THE NEW COUNTRY.

XX; 15 should have been badly off without the shelter of our tent, {or the
' night proved as cold as the day had been hot, but we managed to sleep
comlbrtahly, everyone being thoroughly fatigued by the labours oi the day.
The voice- of our vigilant cock, which as he loudly saluted the rising moon
was the last sound I heard at night, roused me at daybreak, and i then
awoke my wife, that in the quiet interval while yet our children slept, wc:
might take counsel together on our situation and prospects. It was plain
to both or' us that, in the first plthe, we should ascertain if possible the fate
of our late conumnions, and then exz'uninc into the nature and resources of
the country on which we were stranded.

We therefore came to the resolution that, as soon as we had break--
fasted, Fritz and l should strut on an expedition with these objects in view,
while my wife remained near our landing-place with the three younger boys.

" Rouse up, rouse up, my boys," cried I, awakening the children cheer-
fully. "Come and help your mother to get breakfast ready."

"As to that," said she, smiling, "we can but set on the pot, and boil
some more soup!"

"WhvI you forget Jack's fine lobster!" replied I. "What has become
of it, Jack?"

"It has been safe in this hole in the rock all night, father. You see,
I thought, as the (logs seem to like good things, they might take a fancy
to that as well as to the agonti."

"A very sensible precaution," remarked l ; "I believe even my headless
Jack will learn wisdom in time. It is well the lobster is so large, for we
shall want to take part with us on our excursion today."

At the mention of an excursion, the four children were wild with delight,
and, capering around me, clapped their hands for joy.

"Steady there, steady!" said l, "you cannot expect all to go. Such
an expedition as this would be too dangerous and fatiguing for you younger
ones. Fritz and I will go alone this time, with one of the dogs, leaving
the other to defend you."

We then armed ourselves, each taking a gun and a game-bag; Fritz in
addition sticking a pair of pistols in his belt, and I a small hatchet in minc.I'll/If BEE" ' C OLIVER I". 2';

Breakfast being over, we stowed away the remainder of the lobster and some
biscuits, with a flash of water, and were ready for a start.

"Stop!" I exclaimed, "we have still left something very important
undone."

"Surely not," said Fritz.

"Yes," said I, " we have not yet joined in morning prayer. We :er
only too ready, amid the cares and pleasures of this life, to forget the God
to Whom we owe all things." Then having commended ourselves to His
protecting care, I took leave of my wife and children, and, bidding them
not wander far from the boat and tent, we parted, not without some at 'iely
on either side, for we knew not what might assail us in this unknown region.

We now found that the banks of the stream were on both sides so
rocky that we could get down to the water by only one narrow passage,
and there was no Corresponding path on the other side. I was glad to see
this, however, for I now knew that my wife and children were on a com-
paratively inaccessible spot, the other side of the tent being protected by
steep and precipitous cliffs. Fritz and I pursued our way up the stream
until we reached a point where the waters fell frenr a considerable height
in a cascade, and where several large rocks lay halt covered by the water;
by means of these we succeeded in crossing the stream in safety. We thus
had the sea on our lcit, and a long line of Iroelty heights, here and there
adorned with clumps of trees, stretching away inland to the right. W e had
forced our way scarcely fifty yards through the long,r rank grass which was
here partly withered by the sun and much tangled, when we heard behind
us a rustling, and, on looking round, saw the grass waving to and no, as it
some animal were passing through it. Fritz instantly turned and brought
his gun to his shoulder, ready to fire the moment the beast should appear.
I was much pleased with my son's coolness and presence of mind, for it
showed me that I might thoroughly rely upon him on any future occasion
when real danger might occur; this time, however, no savage beast rushed
out, but our trusty dog Turk, whom, in our anxiety at parting, wt: had for--
gotten, and who had been sent after us, doubtless by my thoughtful wife.

From this little incident, however, we saw how dangerous was our
position, and how difficult escape would be should any fierce beast steal
upon us unawares: we therefore hastened to make our way to the open
seashore. Here the scene which presented itself was indeed delightful. A
background of hills, the green waving grass, the pleasant groups of trees
stretching here and there to the very water's edge, Formed a lovely pro-
spect. On the smooth sand we searched carefully for any trace of our han-
less companions, but not the mark of a footstep could we lind. '

" Shall I fire a shot or two?" said Fritz; " that would bring our com-
panions, if they are within hearing."

" It would indeed," I replied, "or any savages that may be here. No,
110; let "S search diligently, but as quietly as possible."

" But why, father, should we trouble ourselves about them at all? They24 T 1Y1; .5' I! 755 FA .1111: Y R 0513.150."

left us to shift for ourselves, and I for one don't care to set eyes on them
again."

"You are wrong, my boy," said J. " In the first place, we should not
return evil for evil; then, again, they might be of great assistance to us in
building a house or" some sort; and lastly, you must remember that they
took nothing with them from the vessel, and may be perishing of hunger."

Thus talking, we pushed on until we came to a pleasant grove which
stretched down to the water's edge ; here we halted to rest, seating ourselves
under a large tree, by a rivulet which murmured and splashed along its pebhl}r
bed into the great ocean before us. A thousand gail}-'-plumaged birds flew
twittering above us, and Fritz and I gazed up at them.

My son suddenly started up.

".~\ monkey," he exclaimed; "1 am nearly sure l saw a monkey."

As he spoke he sprang round to the other side of" the tree, and in
doing so stumbled over a round substance, which he handed to me, remark-
ing, as he did so, that it was a round bird's nest, of which he had often
heard.

"You may have done 50," said I, laughing, "but you need not neces>>
sarily conclude that every round hairy thing is a bird's nest; this, for in~
stance, is not one, but a cocoauut."

We split open the nut, but, to our disgust, found the kernel dry and
uneatable.

"Hullo," ericd Fritz, "I always thought a eocoanut was full of deli-
cious sweet liquid, like almond milk."

"50 it is," I replied, "when young and fresh, but as it ripens the mill:
becomes congealed, and in course of time is solidified into a kernel. This
kernel then dries, as you see here, but when the nut falls on favourable soil,
the germ within the kernel swells until it bursts through the shell, and,
taking root, springs up a new tree."

"I do not understand," said Fritz, " how the little germ manages to get
through this great thick shell, which is not like an almond or hazel-nut
shell, that is clivlt'lchdown the middle already."

"Nature provides for all things," I answered, taking up the pieces.
"Look here: do you see these three round holes near the stalk; it is through
them that the germ obtainsZegress. Now let us find a good nut if we can."

As cocoannts must -be overuripe before they fall naturally from the
tree, it was not without dillicult)' that we obtained one in which the kernel
was not dried up. When we [succeeded, however, we were so refreshed by
the fruit that we could deferftheg'repast we called our dinner until later in
the day, and so spare our Stock of provisions.

Continuing our way through a thicket, and which was so densely over-
grown with iianas that we had to clear a passage with our hatclicts, we again
emerged on the seashore beyond, and found an open View, the forest sweep-
ing inland, while on the space before us stood at intervals single trees of
remarkable appearance.'17:? young monkey, (.'::/z.'/1iug Jig/z! 9/ /"r1'(:, (If (mu Ila/(ml zum' w; /2/'.>>' .ylzrltt/I/rrx (p. 2g}

These at once attracted Fritz's observant eye, and he pointed to tllClll,
exclaiming, "Oh, what absurd-looking trees, l'atherl See what strange humps
there are on the trunks."

We approached to examine them, and I recognized them as ealabash-

he made. " the savages," I rcmarkcd,' are said to term these things must
ingeniously, using them to contain liquids: indeed, they actually cook food
in them."

"Oh, but that is impossible," retumed Fritz. "I am quite sure this
rind would be burnt through directly it was set on the fire."

"I did not say it was Set on the fire at all. When the gourd has been
divided in two, and the shell or rind emptied 01' its contents, it is filled
with water, into which the fish, or whatever is to be cooked, is put ; red-hut
stones are added until the water boils; the food becomes fit to eat, and the
gourd-rind remains uninjured."

"That is a very clever plan: very simple too. I daresay I should have
hit on it, if I had tried," said Fritz.

"The friends of Columbus thought it very easy to make '1 egg stand
upon its end when he had shown them how to do ii. But now suppose
we prepare some of those calabashes, that they may be ready for use when
we take them home."

Fritz instantly took up one of the gourds, and tried to split it equally
with his knife, but in vain: the blade slipped, and the ealabash was cut
jaggedly. "'What a nuisance!" said Fritz, flinging it down, "the thingr is
spoiled; and yet it seemed so simple to divide it properly."

"Stay," said I; "you are too impatient; those pieces are not useless.

1 then took irom my packet apiece of string, which I tied tightly
round a gourd, as neat one end or it as I eould;tl1en tapping the string
with the back of my knife, it penetrated the outer shell. When this was
accomplished, I tied the string yet tighter, and drawing the ends with all
my might, the gourd fell, divided exactly as I wished.

"That is cleverl" cried Fritz. "What in the world put that plan into
your head?"

"It is a plan," I replied, -" which the negroes adopt, as l have learned
from reading books of travel."

"Well, it certainly makes '11 capital soupatn'een, and a soup-plate too,"
said Fritz, examining the gourd. "Hut supposing you had wanted to 11111111:

"It would he an easier operation than this, if possible. All that is
necessary, is to cut a round hole at one end, then to scoop out the interior,
and to drop in several shot or stones; when these are shaken, any remain-
ing portions of the fruit are detached, and the gourd is thoroughly cleaned,
and the bottle completed."

"That would not make a very convenient bottle though, father; it would
be more like a barrel."

"True, my boy: if you want a more shapely vessel, you must take it
in hand when it is younger. To give it a neck, for instance, you must tie
a bandage round the young gourd while it is still on the tree, and then all
will swell but that part which you have checked."

As I spoke, I filled the guards with sand, and left them to dry; mark-
ing the spot that we might return for them on our way back.

For three hours or more we pushed forward, keeping a sharp look-out
on either side for any trace of our companions, till we reached a bold pro-
montory. stretching some way into the sea, from whose rocky summit I
knew that we should obtain a good and comprehensive view of the sur-
rounding country. With little difficulty we reached the top, but the most
careful survey of the beautiful landscape failed to show us the slightest Sign
or trace of human beings. Before us stretched a wide and lovely hay, fringed
with yellow sands. either side extending into the distance, and almost lost
to View in two shadowy promontories; inclosed by these two arms lay a
sheet of rippling water, which reflected in its depths the glorious sun above.
The scene inland was no less beautiful; and yet Fritz and I both felt a
shade of loneliness stealing over us as we gazed on its utter solitude.

"Cheer up, Fritz, my boy," said I, presently. " Remember that we
chose a settler's life long ago, before we left our own dear country; we
certainly did not expect to be so entirely alone--hut what matters a few
people, more or less? \V'ith God's help, let us endeavour to live here (ton-
teutedly, thankful that we were not east upon some bare and inhospitable
island. But come, the heat here is getting unbearable; let us find some
shady place before we are completely broiled away."

We descended the hill and made for a clump of palm-trees, which we
saw at a little distance. To reach this, we had to pass through a dense
thicket of reeds, no pleasant or easy task ; for, besides the difficult)! of forcing
our way through, I feared at every step that we might tread on some
venomous snake. Sending Turk in advance, I cut one of the reeds, thinking
it would he a more useful weapon against a reptile than my gun. I had
carried it but a l'ttle way, when I noticed a thick juice exuding from one
end. I tasted it, nd to my delight, found it sweet and pleasant. I at once
knew that I was standing amongst sugar-canes. Wishing Fritz to make the
same discovery, I advised him to cut a cane for his defence; he did so, and
as he beat the ground before him, the reed split, and his hand was covered
with the juice. He carefully touched the cane with the tip of his tongue,
then, findingr thc. juice sweet, he did so again with less hesitation; and a
moment afterwards sprang back to me, exclaiming, "Oh, father, sugar-canes.
sugaixcancs! 'l'astc it. Oh, how delicious, how delightful! do let us take
a lot home to mother," he continued, sucking eagerly at the cane.

"Gently there," said 1, "take breath at moment--moderation in all
things, remember. Cut some to take home if you like, only don't take moreTil/2' 3.751." COZLVF'A' l'. 2'

than you can conve-
niently carry."

In spite of my
warning, my son cut
a dozen or more of
the largest canes, and,
stripping them of their
leaves, carried them
under his arm. We
then pushed through
the cane~hrake, and
reached the clump of
palms for which we
had been making; as "am," ,, [Wfl'z'l

been disporting them-
selves on the ground, sprang up, chatter--
ing and grimacing, and before we could
clearly distinguish them', were at the very
top of the trees.

Fritz was so provoked by their im--
pertinent gestures that he raised his gun,
and would have shot one ol' the poor
beasts.

"Stay," cried 1, "never take the life
of any animal needlessly. A live monkey
up in that tree is of more use to us than
a dozen dead ones at our feet, as I will
show you."

Saying this, I gathered a handful of
small stones, and threw them up towards
the apes. The stones did not go near
them, but, influenced by their instinctive
mania for imitation, they instantly seized
all the cocoanuts within their reach, and
sent a perfect hail of them down upon us.

1" ritz was delighted with my stralagem.
and, rushing forward, picked up some of
the finest of the nuts. We drank the
milk they contained, drawing it through
the holes which 1 pierced, and then,
splitting the nuts open with the hatchet,
ate the cream which lined their shells.
After this delicious meal, we thoroughly

despised the lobster we had been carrying, and threw it to link, who ate
it gratefully: but far from being satisfied, the poor beast began to gnaw
the ends of the sugar-canes, and to beg for cocoanut. I slung a couple of
the nuts over my shoulder, fastening them together by their stalks, and,
Fritz having resumed his burden, we began our homeward march.

l soon discovered that Fritz found the weight of his canes considerably
more than he expected: be shifted them from shoulder to shoulder, then
for a while carried them under his arm, and finally stopped short with a
sigh. "i had no idea," he said, "that a few reeds would be so heavy."

"Never mind, my boy," I said, "patience and courage! Do you not
remember the story of Aisop and his bread--basket, how heavy he found it
when he started, and how light at the end of his journey. Let us each take
a fresh staff, and then fasten the bundle crosswise with your gun."

We did so, and once more stepped forward. Fritz presently noticed that
I from time to time sucked the end of my cane.

"Oh, come," said he, "that's a capital plan of yours, father; I'll do
that too." '

So saying, he began to suck most vigorously, but not a drop of the
juice could he extract. "How is this?" he asked. "How do you get the
juice out, father?"

"Think a little," I replied, "you are quite as capable as I am of finding
out the way, even if you do not know the real reason of your failure."

"0b, of course," said he, "it is like trying to suck marrow from a mar--
row-hone, without making a hole at the other end."

"Quite right," I said; "you form a vacuum in your mouth and the end
of your tube, and expect the air to force down the liquid from the other
end which it cannot possibly enter."

Fritz was speedily perfect in the aceon'iplislnnent of sucking sugar-cane,
discovering by experience the necessity for a fresh cut at each joint or knot
in the cane, through which the juice could not flow; he talked of the plea-
sure of initiating his brothers in the art, and of how Ernest would enjoy
the coeoanut milk, with which he had filled his flask.

"My dear boy," said l, "you need not have added that to your load;
the chances are it is vinegar by the time we get home. in the heat of the
sun, it will ferment soon after being drawn from the nut."

"Vinegar! oh, that would be a horrid bore! I must look directly, and
see how it is getting on," cried Fritz, hastily swinging the flask from his
shoulder, and tugging out the cork. With a loud "pop" the contents came
forth, foaming like champagne.

"There now!" said I, laughing as he tasted this new luxury, "you will
have to exercise moderation again, friend Fritz! I daresa'y it is delicious,
but it will go to your head, if you venture deep into your flask."

"My dear father, you cannot think how good it isl Do take some.
Vinegar, indeed! This is like excellent wine."

We were both invigorated by this unexpected draught, and went on soTill-I .-'\"/:'ll ' ('(z'l'A'TR 1'. "'l

merrily after it, that the distance to the place "here we had lcit our gouid
dishes seemed less than we expected. "c found them quite (hr, and mu
light and easy to carry.

Just as we had passed through the grove in which we breakfasled, 'l'urk
suddenly darted away from us, and sprang furiously among a troop of mon.
keys, which were gambolling playfully on the turf at a little distance from
the trees. They were taken by surprise completely, and the doc

or, now really
ravenous from hunger, had seized, and was fiercely tearing one to pieces
before we could approach the spot.

His luckless victim was the mother of a tiny little monkey, which,
being on her back when the dog flew at her, had hindered her flight; the
little creature attempted to hide amongr the grass, and in trembling fear
watched the tragic fate of" its mother. ()11 perceiving 'lfnrk's bloodthirsty
design, Fritz had eagerly rushed to the rescue, flinging away all he was
carrying, and losing his hat in his haste.

All to no purpose as far as the poor mother ape was concerned, and :1
laughable scene ensued, for no sooner did the young monkey catch sight of him,
than at one bound it was on his shoulders, and, holding fast by his thick
curly hair, it firmly kept its seat in spite of all he could do to dislodge it.
He screamed and plunged about as he endeavoured to shake or pull the.
creature off, but all in vain: it only clung,r the closer to his neck, making
the most absurd grimaccs.

l laughed so much at this ridiculous scene, that I (would scarcely ass
111v tcr1itied boy out of his awkward predicament.

-\.t last, by coaxing the monkey, uttering it a bit of biscuit, and gradu-
ally disentairgling its small sinewy paws from the curls it grasped so tightly,
I managed to relieve poor Fritz, who then looked with interest at the baby
ape, no bigger than a kitten, as it lay in my arms.

"What a jollv little follow it isl" exclaimed he; "do let me try to rear
it, father. 1 (laosay cocoanut milk would do until we can biing the COW

"Well," said I, "let the little orphan be yours. You b1a\ cl) and kindly
exerted yourself to save the mother's life; now you must train lic1 (hild
carefully, for unless you do so its natural instinct will pmvc mischievous
instead of useful to us."

Turk was meanwhile devouring with great satisfaction the little animal's
unfortunate mother. I could not grudge it him, and continued hunger might
have made him dangerous to ourselves. We did not think it necessary to
wait until he had dined, so we prepared to resume our march.

The tiny ape seated itself in the coolest way imaginable on Fri ' s
shoulder, I helped to carry his Canes, and we were on some distance before

Turk overtook us, looking uncommonly well pleased, and licking his chops
as though recalling the memory of his feast.so J'IJE SW'JSS l"/l..'-/]/4l' /\'()/$'/.-\'.\'(').\-'.

He took no notice of the monkey, but it was very uneasy at sight of
him, and scrambled down into Fritz's arms, which was so inconvenient to
him that be devised a plan to relieve himself of his burden. Calling Turk,
and seriously enjoining obedience, be seated the monkey on his back,
securing it there with a cord, and then putting a second string round the
dog's neck that he might lead him, he put a loop of the knot into the
comical rider's hand, saying gravely, "Having slain the parent, Mr, 'l'urk,
you will please-to Carry the son."

At first this arrangement mightily disPIeased them both, but by and
by they yielded to it, quietly; the monkey especialiy amused us by riding
along with the air of a person perfectly at his ease.

"\\"e look just like a couple of mountebanks on their way to a fair
with animals to exhibit," said l. " What, an outcry the children will make
when we appear !"

My son enquired to what species of the monkey tribe I thought his
protege belonged, which led to a good deal of talk on the subject, and,
conversation- beguiling the way, we found ourselves ere long on the rocky
margin of the stream and close to the rest or" our party.

Juno was the first to be aware of our approach, and gave notice of it
by loud barking, to which Turk replied with such hearty good will, that
his little rider, terrified at the noise bis steed was making, slipped from
under the cord and fled to his refuge on Fri ' shoulder, where he regained
his composure and settled himself comfortably.

Turk, who by this time knew where he was, finding himself free,
(lashed forward to rejoin his friend, and announce our coming.

One after another our dear ones came running to the opposite bank,
testifying in various ways their delight at our return, and hastening up on
their side of the river, as we on ours, to the ford at which we had crossed
in the morning. We were quickly on the other side, and, full of joy and
afiection, our happy party was once more united.

The boys suddenly perceiving the little animal which was clinging close
to their brother, in alarm at the tumult of voices, shouted in ecstasy," " A
monkey! a monkey! oh, how splendid! where did Fritz find him 1' What
may we give him to eat? Oh, what a bundle of sticks! Look at those
curious great nuts father has got I"

We could neither check this confused torrent of questions, nor get in
a word in answer to them,

At length when the excitement subsided a little, I was able to say a
few words with a chance of being listened to. "I am truly thankful to see
you all safe and well, and, thank God, our expedition has been very Satis-
factory, except that we have entirely failed to discover any trace of our
sliipinates."

"If it be the will of God," said my wife, "to leave us alone on this
solitary place, let us be content; and rejoice that we are all together in
safety."77-175 .N'lz'i'V (TOWA'I'RY, 3'

"Now we want to hear all your adventures, and let us. relieve you of
your burdens," added she, taking my game-bag. - ,

Jack shouldered my gun, Ernest took the cocoanuts, and little Franz
carried the gourds, Fritz distributed the sugaiut'anes amongst his brothers,
and, handing Ernest his gun, replaced the monkey on Turk's back. Ernest
soon found the burden with which Fritz had laden him too heavy to his
taste. His mother, perceiving this, offered to relieve him of part of the
load. He gave up willingly the cocoanuts, but no sooner had he done so
than his elder brother ex .aimcd, "llullo, Ernest, you surely do not know
what. you are parting with; did you really intend to hand over those good
eocoanuts without so much as tastingr them '3'

"What? ho! are they really cocoanuts? " cried lirnest. "Do let me
take them again, mother; do let me look at them."

"No, thank you," replied my wife, with a smile. "I have no wish to
see you again 0\-'erl)urdened."

"Oh, but I have only to throw away these sticks, which are of no
use, and then I can easily carry them."

" Worse and worse," said Fritz; "I have a panic iar regard for those
heavy useless sticks. Did you ever hear of sugar-canes . '

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Ernest began to suck
vigorously at. the, end of the cane, with no better result, however, than
Fritz had obtained as we were on the march.

"Here," said Fritz, "let me show you the trick of it," and he speedily
set all the youngsters to work extracting the luscious juice.

My wife, as a prudent housekeeper, was no less delighted than the
children with this discovery; the sight of the dishes also pleased her
greatly, for she longed to see us eat once more like civilised beings. We
went into the kitchen and there found preparations for a truly sumptuous
incal. Two forked sticks were planted in the ground on either side of the
lire, on these rested a rod from which hung several tempting--looking fish,
opposite them hung a goose from a similar contrivance, slowly roasting,
while the gravy dropped into a large shell placed beneath it. in the centre
sat the great pot from which issued the smell of a most delicious soup.
To crown this splendid array, stood an open hogshead full of Dutch clicCScs.
All this was very pleasant to two hungry travellers, but I was about to
beg my wife to spare the poultry until our stock should have increased,
when she, perceiving my thought, quickly relieved my anxiety. "This is
not one of our geese," she said, " but a wild bird Ernest killed."

"Yes," said Ernest, "it is a penguin, I think; it let me get quite close.
so that I knocked it on the head with a stick. Here are its head and feet,
which I preserved to show you; the bill is, you see, narrow and curved
downwards, and the feet are webbed. It had funny little bits of useless
wings, and its eyes looked so solemnly and sedately at me. that l was
almost ashamed to kill it. Do you not think it must have been a penguin?"

"l have little doubt on the matter, my boy," and l was about to make32 YHE SI-VISS FAfiI/Z Y Rfllf/A'SOAF.

a few remarks on the habits of this bird, when my wife interrupted me and
begged us to come to dinner and continue our natural history conversation
at some future time. We then sat down before the appetisiug meal pre--
pared for us, our gourds coming for the first time into use, and, having done
it full justice, produced the oocoanuts by way of dessert. "Here is bettcr
{God for your little friend," said I to Fritz, who had been vainly endeavour-
ing to persuade the monkey to taste dainty morsels of the food we had
been eating; "the poor little animal has been accustomed to nothing but
its mother's milk; fetch me a saw, one of you."

I then, after extracting the milk of the nuts from their natural holes,
carefully cut the shells in half, thus pr-'miding several more useful basins.
The monkey was perfectly satisfied with the milk, and eagerly sucked the
corner of a handkerchief dipped in it. Fritz now suddenly reoolleeted his
delicious wine. and, r>roducing: his flask, begged his mother to taste it.

"Try it first yourself," s'lid I; Fritz did so, and I instantly saw by his
countenance that the liquor had passed through the first stage of fermen-
tation and had become vinegar.

" Never mind, my boy," said my prudent wife, when she learned the
(muse of his wry faces, "we have wine already, but no vinegar; I am really
pleased at the transformation."

The sun was now rapidly sinking behind the horizon, and the poultry
retiring for the night warned us that we must follow their example. .Having
offered up 0111' prayers, we lay down on our beds, the monkey crouched
down between Jack and Fritz, and we were all soon fast asleep.

We (lid not, however, long enjoy this repose; a loud barking from our
dogs, who were on guard outside the tent, awakened us, and the fluttering
and cackling of our poultry warned us that a foe was approaching. Fritz
and I sprang up, and, seizing our guns, rushed out. There we found a des-
pemte combat going 011: our gallant dogs, surrounded by a dozen or more
large jackals, were lighting bravely; four of their opponents lay dead, but
the others were in no way deterred by the fate of their comrades. Fritz
and I, however, sent bullets through the heads of a couple more, and the
rest galloped oil". Turk and Juno did not intend that they should escape
so cheaply, and pursuing them, they caught, killed, and devoured another
of the animals, icgardless of then near Ielationship. F1itz wished to save
one of the jackals that he might be able to show it to his brothe1s in the
morning; dragging therefore the one that he had shot near the tent, he
concealed it, and no once more 1eturned to our beds.

Souudly and peacefully we slept until cook'erow next morning, when
my wife and I awoke, and began to discuss the business of the (lay.

"it seems absolutely necessm V my (lcz-u \Vil'e," I- began, " to 1etu1n at

" Return to the wreck

wife cheerihlly. "Pati--

all our work, and I agree
with you that a visit to
the wreck is without
doubt our first duty.
Come, let us wake the
children, and set to work
without delay."

They 'were soon

legs before the tent, in
a most life-like attitude, and stood by to watch the effect upon the family.
The dogs were the first to perceive their enemy, and, growling, seemed
inclined to dispose of the animal as they has disposed of its brethren in the
night, but Fritz called them off. The noise the dogs made, however, had
the effect of bringing out the younger children, and many were the excla-
mations they made at the sight of the strange animal.

"A yellow dog!" cried Franz.

"A wolf!" exclaimed Jack.

" It is a striped fox," said Ernest.

"llullo," said Fritz, "the greatest men may make mistakes. Our
professor does not know a jackal when he sees one."

"But really," continued Ernest, examining the animal, "1 think it is
a fox."

"Very well, very well," retoited Fritz; "no doubt you know better
than your father! He thinks it is a jackal."

"Como, boys," said I, "no more of this qnarrelling ; you are none of
you very far wrong, for the jacltal partnkcs of the nature of all three--(log,
wolf, and fox."

. The monkey had come out on Jack's shoulder, but no sooner did it
catch sight of the jackal, than it fled precipitately back into the tent, and
hid itself in a heap of moss until nothing was visible but the tip ofits little
nose. Jack soothed and comforted the frightened little animal, and I then3, J'WE $717735 /<Ll.-l///. l" Rt')',l?/.7\".X'().-\.'.

summoned them all to prayers, soon after which we. began our breaklast.
So severely had We dealt with our supper the previous night, that we had
little to eat but the biscuits, which were so dry and hard that, hungry as
we were, we could not swallow much. Fritz and i took some cheese to
help them down, while my wife and younger sous soaked theirs in water.
Ernest roamed down to the shore, and looked about for shell-fish. Presently
he returned with a few whclks. "Ab," said be, "if we had but some butter."

"My good boy," I replied, "your perpetual Ir', IF quite annoys me;
why do you not sit down and eat cheese like the rest of us."

"Not while I can get butter," be said; "see here, father," and he
pointed to a large cask: "that barrel contains butter of some sort or another,
for it is oozing out at the end."

"Really, Ernest," J said, "we are indebted to you. I will open the
cask." So saying, I took a knife and carefully out a small hole, so that I
could extract the butter without exposing the mass of it to the effects of
the air and heat. Filling :1 cceoauut shell, we once more sat down, and,
toasting our biscuits before the fire, spread thorn with the good Dutch
butter. We found this vastly better than the dry biscuit, and while we
were thus employed, I noticed that the two dogs were lying unusually
quietly by my side. I at first attributed this drowsiness to their large meal
during the night, but I soon discovered that it arose from a dill'erenr. cause:
the faithful animals had not escaped unhurt from their late combat, but had
received several deep and painful wounds. especiall; about the neck. The
dogs began to lick each other on the places which they could not reach
with their own tongues, and my wife carefully dressed the wounds with
butter from which she had extracted the salt by washing.

A sudden thought now struck Ernest, and he wisely remarked that if
we were to make spiked collars for the dogs, they would in future escape
such dangerous wounds. "Oh, yes," exclaimed Jack, "and i will make
them, may I not, father?"

"Try by all means, my little fellow," said I, "amtpoisuade your mother
to assist yen, and now, Fritz," I continued, " we must be starting, for you
and l are to make a trip to the wreck." l begged the party who were to
remain on shore, to keep together as much as possible, and having arranged
a set of signals with my wife, that we might exchange communications,
asked a blessing on our enterprise. I erected a signal~post, and while Fritz
was making preparations for our departure, hoisted a strip of sailcloth as a
flag; this llag was to remain hoisted so long as all was well on shore, but
should our return be desired, three shots were to be tired and the flag
lowered. -

All was now ready, and, warning my wife that we might find it neces-
sary to remain all night on the vessel, we tenderly bade adieu and embarked.
thcept our guns and ammunition, we were. taking nothing, that we might
leave as much space as possible for the stowage of a large cargo. Fritz,
however, had resolved to bring his little monkey, that he might obtain.7./"/'. _'1\/"H (f'!3'<".\'}'/\'l'. "

little animal immediately sucked the milk with evident relish, chattering
11nd grinning all the while ; the monkey provided for, we refreshed ourselves
with some wine and biscuits. "Now," said I, "we have plenty to do;
where shall we begin ? "

"Let us fix a must and sail to our boat," answered Fritz; "for the
current which brought us out will not take us back; whereas the fresh breeze
we met would help us immensely had "'1: but a sail."36 7'11]! .S'HI'ISS 111,-1/{111'1'208/"30'5.

"Capital thought," I replied; "let as set to work at onee."

I chose a stout spar to serve as a mast, and, having made a hole in
a plank nailed across one of the tubs, we, with the help of a rope and a
couple of blocks, stepped it and secured it with stays. We :then discovered
a lug-sail, which had belonged to one of the ship's boats; this we hoisted,
and our craft was ready to sail. Fritz begged me to decorate the mast-head
with a red streamer, to give our vessel a more finished appearance. Smil-
ing at this childish but natural vanity, I complied with his request. I then
contrived a rudder, that I might be able to steer the boat; for though I
knew that an oar would serve the purpose, it was cumbrous and incon-
venient. While I was thus employed, Fritz examined the shore with his
glass, and soon announced that the flag was flying and all was well.

So much time had now slipped away that we found we could not
return that night, as Iliad wished. We signalled our intention ol'rcniaining
on board, and then spent the rest of our time in taking out the stones we
had placed in the boat for ballast, and stowed in their place heavy articles,
of value to us. The ship had sailed for the purpose of supplying a young
colony, she had therefore on board every conceivable article we could desire
in our present situation; our only diiliculty indeed was to make a wise
selection. A large quantity of powder and shot we first secured, and as
Fritz considered that we could not have too many weapons, we added three
excellent guns, and a whole annful of swords, daggers, and knives. We
remembered that knives and forks were necessary, we therefore laid in a
large stock of them, and kitchen utensils of all sorts. Exploring the cap-
tain's cabin, we discovered a service of silver plate and a cellaret of good
old wine ; we then went over the stores, and supplied ourselves with potted
meats, portable soups, Westphalian hams, sausages, a bag of maize and
wheat, and a quantity of other seeds and vegetables. I then added a barrel
of sulphur for matches, and as much cordage as 1 could find. All this--with
nails, tools, and agricultural implements-completed our cargo, and sank our
boat so low, that I should have been obliged to lighten her had not the
sea been calm.

Night drew on, and a large lire, lighted by those on shore, showed us
that all was well. We replied by hoisting;r four ship's lanterns, and two shots -
announced to us that our signal was perceived; then, with a heart-felt prayer
for the safety of our dear ones on shore, we retired to our boat, and Fritz
at all events was soon sound asleep. For a while I could not sleep, the
thought of my wife and ehildrcn~almic and unprotected, save by the great
dogs--disturbed my rest.

The night at length passed away. At daybreak Fritz and I arose, and
went on deck. I brought the telescope to bear upon the shore, and with
pleasure saw the flag still waving in the morning breeze; while I kept the
glass directed to the land, I saw the door of the tent open, and my wife
appear and look steadfastly towards us.

I at once hoisted a white flag, and in reply, the flag on shore wasFri/s 3/0011 wit/1 lair gut: tr) [2ch .cfwnklyr, flozh/mg l'! at a lmgc .r/zarg- {p' 37%FIIE AVEIT" COZ: 'Z'I'x'i".

the signal!

"Fritz," I said, "I am not now in such haste to get back, and begin
to feel compassion for all these poor beasts. I wish we could dexise some
means for getting them on shore."

"We-might make a raft," suggested Fritz, "and take ofi' one or two at
a time."

"'l'rue," I replied; "it is easy enough to say 'make a ratt,' but to do
it is quite another thing."

"Well," said liritz, "I can think of nothing e2; _. unless indeed we make
them such swimming--belts as you made tor the children."

"Really, my boy, that idea is worth haw g. I am not joking, indeed."
I continued, as I saw him smiie; "we nia__- get every one or the animals
ashore in that way."

So saying", I caught a fine sheep, and proceeded to put our plan into
execution. I first fastened a broad piece of linen round its belly, and to
this attached some corks and empty tins; then, with Fritz's help, I llunlgr
the animal into the sea--it sank, but a moment afterwards rose and lloated
famously.

and let them get ashore as best thev might.

but a few moment. afterwards they appeared, and with a shunt of Joy ran

and replying to a few preliminary questions, proceeded to release our herd

exceedingl)r inconvenient on shore. My wife was astonished at the apparatus.

"' How clever you are!" said she.

"I am not the inventor," I replied; "the honour is due to Fritz. lie
not only thought of this plan for bringing otl" the animals, but saved one
at least of then! from a most fearful death," And 1 then told them how
bravely he had encountered the shark.

My wife was delighted with her son's success, but declared that she
would dread our trips to the vessel more than ever, knowing that such savage
fish inhabited the waters.

Fritz, Ernest, and .[ began the work of unloading our emit, while Jack,
seeing that the poor donkey was still encumbered with his swimming-belt,
tried to free him from it. But the donkey would not stand quiet, and the

Jack was soon on his feet. " But 1 have not been idle all day," he said;
"' look hen: 1" and he pointed to a belt round his waist. It was a broad

Fritz evidently did not approve of the use to which his juckal's hide
had been devoted, and, holding his nose, begged his little brother to keep
at a distance. "Really, jack," he said, "you should have cured the hide
before you used it; the smell is disgusting--don't come near me."

you must take it OR and dry it better."

The jackal was dragged off, and we then finished our work of unloading
our boat. When this was accomplished we started for our tent, and, finding

while Ernest set before me a dozen white balls with parchment--like cm'eriir

Leaving my wife to prepare supper, we returned to the shore and brought
up what of the cargo we had left there ; then, having collected our herd
of animals, we returned to the tent.

The meal which awaited us was as unlike the first supper we had there
enjoyed as possible. My wife had improvised a table of aboard laid on
two ca ; 0:1 this was spread a white damask tablecloth, on which were
placed knives, l'orhs, spoons, and plates for each person. A tureen of good
soup lirst appeared, followed by a Capital omelettc, then ces of the ham:
and finally some Dutch cheese, butter, and biscuits, with a bottle otthe
captain's Canary wine, completed the iepast.

While we thus regaled ourselves, 1 related to my wife our adventures,

pations; truth to tell, .l. spent the time chiefly in anxious thought and
watching your progress and signals. I rose very early this. morning, and with
the utmost joy perceiving,r your signal that all was right, hastened to reply
to it, and then, white my sons )'Ct Sillllll)el'8(l, 1 st down and began to
consider how our position could be improved. 'l'er it is perfectly l!!![)t>SS~$ll)lPS',l
Said I to myself, 'to live much longer where we are now. The sun heats
hnrningly the livelong day on this bare rocky spot; our only 'helter is this
poor tent, beneath the canvas 01' which the heat .5 even more oppressive
than on the open shore.

"'Why should not l. and my little boys ex' t ourselves as well as
my husband and Fritz? Why should not we too try to accomplish some-
thing useful? If we could but exchange. this melancholy and uziwholcsmne
abode for a pleasant shady <<inching-place, we should all improve in health
and spirits. Among those delightful woods and grove when: Fritz and his
father Saw so many charming things, I feel sure there must be some little
retreat where we could establish ourselves comibrtahly; there must be, and
I will find it.'

"By this time the boys were up, and I observed Jan'lt very quietly and
busin occupied with his knife about the spot where liritz's jiwlial lay.
Watching his proceedings, 1 saw that he had cut two lung,r narrow strips or
the animal's skin, which he cleaned and scraped very carefully, and then,
taking a handful of great units out of his pocket, he stuck them through the
skin points outwards, alter which he cut strips of canvas sailcloth twin as
broad as the thongs, doubled them, and laid them on the raw side of the
skin so as to cover the broad flat nail--heads. At this point of the perform-
ance, Master Jack came to me with the agreeable request that l would
kindlyr stitch the canvas and (moist) Skin together for him. l gave him
needles and thread, but could not think of depriving him of' the pleasure of
doing it himself.

"However, when I saw how good-lunnourcdly he persevered in the
work with his awkward unskili'ul fingers, I took pity upon him, and, con--q 2 71115 S I VISS 17/1327]: 1' R 01? [3" SOs-'1

quering the disgust I felt, finished lining the skin dog-collars he had so
ingeniously contrived. After- this I was called upon to complete in the same
way a line belt of shin he had made for himself. l advised him to think
of some means by which the skin might be kept from shrinking.

"Ernest, although rather treating Jae '. manufacture with ridicule, pro-
posed a sensible enough plan, which jack forthwith put in execution. He
nailed the skin, stretched Hat, on a board, and put it in the sun to dry.

"My scheme of a journey was agreed to joyously by my youngr com-
panions. Preparations were instantly set on foot: weapons and provisions
provided: the two elder boys carrying guns, while they gave me charge of
the Pater-flask, and a small hatchet.

" Leaving everything in as good order as we could at the tent, we pro-
ceeded towards the stream, ' 'companied by the dogs. Turk, who had
accompanied you on your first expedition, seemed immediately to under-
stand that we wished to pursue the same route, and proudly led the way.

"As 1 looked at my two young sons, each with his gun, and considered
how much the safety ol' the party depended on these little fellows, I felt
grateful to you, dear husband, for having vauaint-ed them in childhood with
the use of firearms. .

"Filling our water-jar, we crossed the stream, and went on to the height
from whence, as you described, a lovely prospect is obtained, at the sight
of which a pleasurable sensation of buoyant hope, to which I had long been
a stranger, awoke within my breast,

"A pretty little wood in the distance attracted my notice particularly,
and thither we directed our course. But soon finding it impossible to force
our way through the tall strong grass which grew in dense luxuriance higher
than the children's heads, we turned towards the open beach on our left,
and following it we reached a point much nearer the little wood, when,
quitting the strand, we made towards it

"We had not entirely escaped the tall grass, however, and with the
utmost fatigue and dilliculty were struggling through the reeds, when suddenly
a great rushing noise terrified us all dreadfully. A very large and power-
ful bird sprang upward on the wing. Both boys attempted to take aim,
but the bird was far away before they were ready to fire.

"'Oh, dear, what a pity!' exclaimed Ernest; 'now if I hadonly had
my light gun, and it' the bird had not flown quite so fast, I should have
brought him down directly!'

"'Oh, yes,' said l, 'no doubt you would be a capital sportsman if only
your game would always give you time to make ready comfortably.'

"'But I had no notion that anything was going to fly up just at our
feet like that,' (tried he. _

"'A good shot,' I replied, 'must be prepared for surprises: neither wild
birds nor wild beasts will send you notice that they are about to fly or
to run.'

"'What sort of bird can it have been?' enquired Jack.CHAAEZA'G QUARTERS. 43

"'Oh, it certainly must have been an eagle,' answered little Franz, 'it
was so very big!'

"'Just as if every big bird must be an eagle!' replied Ernest, in a
tone of derision.

"'Let's see where he was sitting, at all events? said 1.

"jack sprang towards the place, and instantly a second bird, rather
larger than the first, rushed upward into the air, with a most . .u'tling' noise.

"The boys stood staring upwards, pcriee't1_ stupeiied, while I laughed
heartily, saying, '\\-'ell, you are first-rate sportsmen, to he sure! You cer-
tainly will keep my larder famously well suppliedl'

"At this, Ernest coloured up, and looked inclined to cry, while Jack
put on a comical lace, pulled off his Cap, and with a low how, called after
the fugitive: 'Adieu for the present, sir! I live in hopes of another meetingy !'

"0n searchiiu,r the ground carefully, we discovered a rude sort of ncst
made untidily of dry gru It was empty, although we perceived broken
egg-shells at no great distance, and concluded that the young brood had
escaped among the grass, which, in fact. we could see was waving at a little
distance, as the little birds ran through it.

"'Now look'here, Franz,' said Ernest, presently, 'just consider how this'
bird could by any possibility have been an eagle. Eagles never build on the
ground, neither can their young leave the nest and run as soon as they are
out of the egg. That is a peculiarity of the gallinnceous tribe othirds alone,
to which then these must belong. The species, I think, is indicated by the
white belly and dull red colour 01' the wing,r coverts which .l observed in
these specimens, and i believe them to he bastards, es} "ially as I noticed
in the largest the fine moustache-like leathers over the hcuk, pcculfar to the
Great Bustard.'

"My dear boy,' I said, 'your eyes were actively employed, l must
contes if your fingers were unready with the gun. :--\nd after all, it is just
as well, perhaps, that we have not thrown the hustard's family into mourninn'.

"Thus chatting, we at length approached my pretty wood. Numbers
of birds lluitered and sang among; the high branches, but I did not encourage
the boys in their wish to try to shout any of the happy little creatures.
We were lost. in admiration of the. trees of this grove, and I. cannot describe
to you how wondcrlhl they are, nor Can you form the least idea of their

strange, the roots sustained the massive trunks exalted in the air, forming
Strong arches, and props and stays all around each individual stcm, which
was tirnily rooted in the centre.

"I gave Jack some twine, and, scrambling up one of the curious open--
air roots, he succeeded in measuring,r round the trunk itself, and made it out
to be about eighteen yards. 1 saw no sort of fruit, but the foliage is thick
and abundant, throwing delicious shade on the ground beneath, which is
carpeted with soft green herbage, and entirely free from thorns, hriars, or.14 7'52" 5 I.' 7518' Fri xii/l I" ROEIA'SOEE

Referring to the task she had the previous evening proposed for me, I
remarked that to 111dC't1ke it would involve so many difficulties that it

"I 11g1ee 111th you to a cextain extent, dam husband," replied she; "but.
you do not know how dreadfully the heat among the rocks tries me. It
is almost intolerable to us who remain here all day while you and Fritz
are away out at sea, or wandering among the shady woods, where cool

"Well, I must admit that there is much right on your side," I con-
tinued 3 " suppose we were to remove to your chosen abode, and make this
rocky fastness our magazine and place of retreat in case of danger. I could
easily render it still more secure, by blasting portions of the rock with gun-
powder. But a bridge must be constructed in the first place, to enable us
1.0 cross bag and baggage."

"Oh, I shall be p bed to death before we ran leave this place if a
bridge has to be made," (tried my wife i111patie11tly. "Why not just take
our things on our backs and wade 11(1'oss, as we have done already? The

will turn your attention to providing those, I will set about the bridge at
once. It will be wanted not once, but coniinuallv; the stream will pro--
bablv swell and be impassable at times,- and men as it Is, an accident might
happen.'

"" e;I, well," cried my wife, "I submit to your opinion; only pray
set about it without delay, for I long to be off. It is an excellent idea to
make a strong place among the cliffs here; the gunpowder especially, I shall
be delighted to Sec stored here "hen we go 1111"1\-',for it is {rightfully

"(.1111111011de1 is indeed the most dangeious and at the same time the
most useful thingr we have," said I, "and [or both these reasons we must
be especially careful of it. In time I will hollow out a place in the rock
where we can store it safe from either fire or damp."

By this morning's Consultation we had settled the weighty question
of our change of abode, and also chalked out work for the day.(.'II'A AVG/AV; 0 {IA RI VERSE 4 ,"

When the children heard of the proposed move their joy was bound-
less; they began at once to talk of it as our "journey to the Promised
Land," and only regretted that time must be "wasted," as they said, in
bridge-building before it could be undertaken.

Everyone being impatient for breakfast that work might be begun at
once, the cow and goats were milked, and, having enjoyed a comlortable
meal of biscuit boiled in milk, I prepared to start for the wreck, in order
to obtain planks for the proposed bridge. Ernest as well Fritz accompanied
me, and we were soon within the influence ol' the current, and were carried
swiftly out to sea. Fritz was steering, and we had no sooner passed
beyond the islet at the entrance of the bay, so as to come in sight of its
seaward beach, than we were astonished to see a countless multitude of
seabirds, gulls, and others, which rose like a cloud into the air, disturbed by
our approach, and deafened us by their wild and screaming cries. Fritz
caught up his gun, and would have Sent a shot among them had I per-
mitted it. l was very curious to find out what could he the great attrac-
tion for all this swarm of feathered fowl; and, availing mysell' of a fresh
breeze from the sea, I set the sail and directed our course towards the
island.

The swelling sail and flying pennant charmed Ernest, while Fritz bent
his keen eyes eagerly tm'ards the sandy shore, where the ilocks of birds
were again settling.

Presently he shouted, "Aha! now I see what the; are after! They
have got a huge monster of a fish there, and a proper feast they are
making! Let's have a nearer look at it, father."

We could not take our boat very close in, but we managed to clTeet
a landing at a short distance from the festive scene; and, securing the ralt
by casting a rope round a large stone, we cautiously drew near the object
of interest.

It proved to be a monstrous fish, on whose tlcsh these multitudes of birds
were mvenously feeding; and it was extraordinary to watch the ferocity,
the envy, the gluttony, and all manner of evil passions, exhibited among
the guests at this banquet.

"There was nothing on this sandy beach when we passed yesterday,
I am certain, father," said Fritz. "It seems strange 110 see this creature
stranded here."

"Why, Fritz," cried Ernest, "it must be the shark! your shark, you
know! I believe I can see where you hit him in the head."

"You are right, I do believe, Ernest," said I, "though I think your
imagination only can distinguish the gunshot wounds among all the pecking
and tearing,r of the voracious birds there. Just look, boys, at those terrific
jaws beneath the strangely projecting snout. See the rows upon rows of
murderous teeth, and thank God we were delivered from them! Let us

'try if we can induce these greedy birds to spare us a bit of the shark's
skin; it is extremely rough, and when dry may be used like a file."48 77/]? S U'ISS FA MIL I ' 21' (7.81330,- '.

Ernest drew the rainrod from his gun, nnd charged 50 nmnlhlly into
the crowd that, '2 'king right and left, he speedily killed several, whilst
most of the others took to flight. Fritz detached some broad strips oliskin
with his knife, and we returned towards the boat.

Perceiving with satisfaction that the shore was strewn with just the
sort of boards and planks I wanted, 1 lost no time in collecting them; and,
forming a raft to tow alter us, we were in a short time able to direct our
course homeward, withour visiting the wreck at all. As we sailed along.
extremely well pleased with our good fortune, Fritz, by my (.lireetion, nailed
part of the shark's skin llat on boards to dry in the sun, and the rest on
the rounded mast.

" \\'ill that be a good plan, father 1' " enquired he; "it will be quite bent
and crooked when it hardens."

"That is just what I want it to be," said I; "we may happen to find it
useful in that form as well as flat, it would be beautiful shagwcn if we
could smooth and polish it."

"I thought," remarked Ernest, "that slmgrcen was made from asses'
hide."

"And ' u thought rightly," said I. "The best shagreen is prepared in
Turkey, Pen a, and 'l'artary, Front the skins of horses and asses. ln_r.hese
' ins the. roughness is produced artificially: while the skin is newly flayed
and still soft, hard grains of corn are spread on the under surl'aCe, and pressed
into it as it dries. These grains are alterwards removed, and the roughness
imparted to the appearance of the skin remains indelibly; shagreen is useiul
in polishing: joiner's work, and it is made in France from the rough skin of
a hideous creature called the angel-fish."

"Angehfishl" exclaimed F 1' 2, "what a name to give to anything'hidc-
0ns,' father!"

"There ' '6 bad angels as well as good ones," observed Ernest. in his
dry, quiet way; "it is better to leave people to see for themselves which
is meant."

By this time we were close in shore; and, lowering the sail, we soon
had our craft with the raft in tow, safely moored to the bank.

No one was in sight, not :1 sound to be heard, so with united voice we
gave a loud cheery halloo, which after a while was answered in shrill tones,
and the mother with her two has tame running from behind the high
rocks between us and the stream, .ach carrying a small bundle in a hand-
kerchief, while little Franz held aloft a landing-net.

Our return so soon was quite unexpected, and they anxiously enquired
the reason, which we soon explained: and than the mysterious bundles were

land. Even this apparently simple operation required thought, and I had to --
improvise rope-harness for the cow and the donkey, by which we could
make them drag each board separately from the water's edge to the margin
of the stream.

Jack showed me where he thought the bridge should be, and I cer--
tainly saw no better place, as the banks were at that point tolerably close
to one another, steep, and of about equal height.

"How shall we find out if our planks are long enough to reach across? "
said I. "A surveyors table would be useful new."

" What do you say to a ball of string, father?" said Ernest. "Tic one
end to a stone, throw it across, then draw it back, and measure the line."

Adopting my son's idea, we speedily ascertained the distance across to
be eighteen feet. Then allOwing three feet more at each side, I calculated
twenty-bur feet as the necessary length of the boards.

The question as to how the planks were to he laid across was a diffi--
cult one. We resolved to discuss it (hiring dinner, to which we were now

Dinner was quickly despatchcd, as we were all eager to continue our
engineering work. A scheme had occurred to me for conveying one end
of a plank across the water, and I set about it in this way. There fortu-
nater were one or two trees close to the stream on either side; I attached
a rope pretty near one end of a beam, and slung it loosely to the tree
beside us; then, fastening a long rope to the other end, I crossed with it by
means of broken rocks and stones, and having a pulley and block, 1 soon
arranged the rope on a strong limb of the opposite tree, again returning
with the end to our own side.

Now putting my idea to the proof, I brought the ass and the cow,
and fastening this rope to the harness I had previouslv contrived for them

Now that the wor'k was done, we beuarr to feel how much he were
fatigued, and gladly returned to our tent for refreshment and repose.

Next rrrorning, while we breakthsted, I made a little speech to my sons
on the subject of the important move we were about 1'.) make, wishing to
impress them with a sense of the absolute necessity of great caution.

" Remember," said I, "that, although you all begin to feel very
much at your ease here, we are yet complete strangers to a variety of
dangers which may surprise us nnawarcs. I charge von, therefore, to main-
tain good order, and keep together on the march. No darting oil into In-
ways, Jack. No lingeringr behind to philosophise, Ernest. -\nd now all
hands to work."

The greatest activity instantly prevailed in our camp. Some collected
provisions, others packed kitchen utensils, tools, ropes, and hammocks,
arranging them as burdens for the cow and ass. My wife pleaded for a seat
on the latter for her little Franz, and assuring me likewise that she could
not possibly leave the poultry, even for a night, nor exist an hour without
her magic bag, I agreed to do my best to please her, without downright
cruelty to animals.

Away ran the Children to catch the cocks and liens. Great chasing,
fluttering, and cackliug ensued; but with no success whatever, until the
mother recalled her panting sons, and, scattering some handfuls of grain
within the open tent, soon decoycd the fowls and pigeons into the each>>
sure; where, when the curtain was dropped, they were easily caught, tied
together, and placed 011 the cow. This amiable and phlegmatic animal
had stood calmly chewing the cud, while package after package was dis-
posed on her broad back, nor did she now object even to this noisy addition
to her load. I placed a couple of half--hoops over all; and, spreading sail-
cloth on them, put the fowls in darkness, and they rapidly became quiet;
and the cow, with the appearance of having a small waggon on her back,
was ready to start.

Franz was firmly seated on the ass, amidst bags and bundles of all
sorts and sizes: they rose about him like cushions and pillows, and his curly
head rested on the precious magic bag, which surmounted all the rest.

Having filled the tent with the things we left behind, closing it care-
fully, and ranging chests and casks around it, "e were finally ready to be
off, each well equipped and in the highest spnits.

Fritz and his mother led the van.

Franz (the young ca 'alier) and the sober-minded cow followed them
closely.

Jack conducted the goats; one of these had also a rider, for Knips,' the

his restlessness and playful tricks.

"We seem delightfully like those simple and pastoral tribesl have

1 soon found we must, as before, turn down to the sca~bcach, for not
only did the rank grass impede our progress, but it also tempted the ani-
mods to break away from us, and, but for 0111' watchful dogs, we might have
lost 50.11.1171] of them.

On the firm open sands we were making good way when, to my 1111-
noyance, both our dogs suddel'y left us and, springing into the thick cover
to our right, commenced a furious barking, following by howling,r as it' in
fear and violent pain.

Not for a moment; doubting-3r that some dangerous animal was at hand,
I hastened to the spot, remarking 1 s 1 went the characteristic behaviour of
niy three sons.

Fritz cocked his gun and advanced boldly, but with caution.

Ernest looked disconcerted, and drew back, but got ready to fire.

While Jack hurried after Fritz without so much as muslinging his gun
from his shoulders.

Before I could come up with them, I heard Jack shouting excitedly,
"Father! father! come quickly! a--~l111ge porcupine! a most enormous por-
cupine l"

Sure enough the dogs were rushing round and round a porcupine, and,
having attempted to seize it, were already severely wounded by its quills.(.'HAA'G/A-'G QCHRTERS. ,5

Each time they came near, the m'calure, with a rattling noise, hi'iatlecl up

in bloody fingers, till Ja:k, taking his pocket-handkerehicf, and fastening
one corner round its neck, ran off, dragging it after him to where his mother
awaited us.

"Hallo, mother! here's a jolly beast, isn't it? I shot it, and it's good
to eatl Father says so! Ionly wish you had seen how it terrified the
dogs, and heard the rattling and rustling of its spines. Oh, it isialfearful
creature ! "

Ernest, examining it carefully, pronounced its incisor teeth, its ears, and
feet to resemble those of the human race, and pointed out the curious crest
of stiff hairs on its head and neck. .

"I have read of another species," said he, "called the Taft--tailed Por-
cupine, which must be even more curious-lookineY than this is. it has short
flat quills, and a scaly tail endingr in an extraordinary tuft, like a bunch of
narrow strips of parchment. lt cannot be such a disagreeable enemy to
encounter as this foll0w."

"Were you not afraid, Jack," asked I, "lest the porcupine should east
some of his quills like darts at you '3"

"Of course not," returned he; "I know well enough that is nothing: but
a fable!"

"A fable!" said l. "why, look at your mother; she is drawing five or
six spines out of each of the dogs!"

"Ah, those stuck into them when they so fiercely fell upon it in their
attack. Those are the shortest quills, and seem very slightly fixed in its
skin. The long quills bent aside when Juno pressed against them.n

"You are perfectly right, my boy," said I; "there is no truth in the
old idea of shooting out the spines. But now, shall we leave this. prickly
booty of yours, or attempt to take it with us?"

"Oh, please, father, let us take it! Why, it is good to eat!"

Smiling at the child's eagerness, and willing to please him, I made a
somewhat awkward bundle of the porcupine, wrapping: it in several folds of
cloth, and added it to the donkey's load. We had scarcely started when the
porcupine quills entered the donkey's hack, causing it to kick and plunge.
This I soon altered, and our party then resumed the march, which was
continued steadily until we came in sight of our future place of residence.

The wonderful appearance of the enormous trees, and the calm beauty
of the spot altogether, fully came up to the enthusiastic description which
had been given to me.

And my wife gladly heard me say that if an abode could be contrived
among the branches, it would be the safest and most charming home in
the world. -

We hastily unloaded the ass and cow, securing them, as well as the
sheep and goats, by tying their fore-feet loosely together. The doves and
poultry were set at liberty, and we sat down to rest among the soft herb-
age while we laid our plans for the night.

Fritz soon left us, but presently two shots were fired, and he appeared,(ill/I .w; (M; (iv. (Ni/75.185. 55

holding a fine tiger--cat by the hind legs, which, with the intensest delight,
be exhibited to each in turn.

" Well done, l'ritzl" cried 1. "Our cocks and hens would have had
an unfortunate night of it but for this lucky shot of yours. It is to be.
hoped he has left no companion near at hand. You must be on the look--out."

" How curious it seems," remarked Ernest, "that God should create hurt--
ful animals like this."

"To our feeble and narrow vision many of the ways of the Infinite
and Eternal Mind are ineomprchensible," I replied. " What our limited
reason cannot grasp, let us be content to acknowledge as the workings of
Almighty power and wisdom, and thankfully trust in that 'Rock,' which,
were it not 'iiigher than' we, could afford no sense of Security to the ini-
mortal soul. That animals should prey upon one another is a means of
preserving a due balance in the world of nature, and in many ways these
beasts of prey are also useful to man. What beautiful and warm furs are
procured by hunters just in those countries where no other coveringy would
defend the inhabitants from the wintry cold l--as, for instance, the. skins of
bears, wolvcrines, and arctic foxes, wild cats, and many others."

"The skin of the seal, or sea-clog, is also valuable," said Ernest.

"It is," l replied, "and in its own element that creature preys on fish
as the dog did on land animals before his race became domesticated by man.
But now, Fritz, tell us how you obtained your prize."

"Observing that something moved among the branches," said he, ",I
went softly round the tree with my gun, and, making sure the Creature was
a wild cat, I fired and brought it down. It was severely wounded, but,
rising in a fury, it attempted to climb the tree, when l, luckily having a
loaded pistol, gave it a quietns. And do tell me, father, what sort of
eat it is."

"It is a mercy the brute did not fly at your throat instead of attempt-
ing to escape," said I. "It belongs to a fierce and bloodthirsty race~that
of the oeclots or tigeizcats, natives of the tropical parts of America. 1 should
say this \'as a margay, and as it would have proved :1 cruel foe, not only
of--our poultry, but also of our sheep and goats, l am well pEensed that you
have rid us of it."

"May I have the beautiful skin, father? And will you tell me what
wiil be the best use to make of it." '

"I advise you to skin the animal very iarefully, and of the handsome
black and yellow tail make a hunting-belt for yourself. The paws-Jet nu:
see--why, I fancy the paws might be made famous cases for knife, fork, and
spoon, and look well hanging from the belt. The skin of the body you
had better preserve until you find some suitable use for it."

"Oh, lather, what a splendid plan!" cried Jack; "do tell me some
good use for my porcupine."

"I think its feet may make cases also; at least, you may try. The
quills, I am sure, may be used for packing-needles, and for tipping arrows,

and I should try to make defensive armour for the dogs out of the rest.
They may fall in with f as more dangerous than any we. have yet seen."

u'To 'be sure, father, the very thing 1" shouted jack in high glee. "l
have seen pictures of boar--hunts, in which the dogs were protected by a
sort of leather coat of mail. That will be grand 1"

After giving this advice, I got no peace until I had shown my boys
how lit) act upon it, and in a short. time each had his prize fastened up
by the hind legs, and, carefully slitting the skin, was stripping it from
the carcass.

Ernest, meanwhile, was fetching large flat stones in order to fomi a
fireplace, while Franz gathered sticks, as his mother was anxious to pre-
pare some. food.

"What sort of tree do you suppose this to he, lather?" enquired Ernest,
seeing me examining that under which we were encamping. "ls not the
leaf something like :1 Walnut ?"

"There is a resemhlmice, but in my opinion these gigantic trees must
he mangroves or \\'ll(l figs. I have heard their enormous height described,
and also the peculiarity ot' the arching roots supporting the main trunk raised
above the soil."

Just then little Franz bamc up with a large brindle of sticks, and his
mouth full of something he was eating with evident satisfaction.

"Oh, motherl" cried he, "this is so good! so delicious!"

"Greedy little boy " exclaimed she, in a fright. "What have you got
there? Don't swallow it, whatever you do. Very likely it is poisonous!
Spit it all out this minute!" And the anxious mother quickly extracted
from the rosy little mouth the remains of a small lig.

"Where did you find thi. "' said i.

" T here are thousands lyinn alllOIl" the <<:1 iss yonder." replied the little
boy. "They taste very nice. l. thought poison "as nasty. Do you think
they will hurt me? The pigeons and the hens are gobbling them up with
all their might and main, papa."

"I think you have no cause for alarm, dear wife," I said. -"'l'he trees

you must never eat anything without first showing it to me, never mind
how good it seems. it birds and monkeys eat a fruit or vegetable, it is
usually safe to believe it wholesome," added I, turning to the other boys,
who instantly takingr the hint, coaxed Franz to give them the figs he still
had in his pocket, and ran to offer them to Knips, who was closely watching
the skinning ol the tigr. r--Cat and porcupine, apparently giving his opinion on
the subject with much chattering and gestieulation.

" Here, Knips, allow me to present you nith a fig! " cried Jack, holding
one out to the funny little creature.

for making proper harness for
our beasts of burden, but could
not attempt to begin that. while
so many wants more pressing:
demanded attention.

a great height above us, and 1 made the boys try it" it were possible to
throw sticks-or stones over one of these, my intention being to construct a
rope ladder it" we could once succeed in getting a string across a strong;
bough.

Finding we could not succeed in that way, I revolved other schemes in
my mind, and meantime went with Jack and Fritz to a small brook close
by, where l showed them how to place the skins to steep and soften in the
water, with stones placed on them to keep them beneath the surface.

\thn dinner was over, Iprepared our night quarters. i first slum: our
hammocks from the roots of the tree, which, meeting above us, formed an
arched roof, then Covering the whole with sail-cloth, we made a temporary
tent, which would at least keep off the night (lamps and noxious insects.

if possible, some light rods to form a ladder. For some time we hunted in
vain, nothing but rough driftwood was to be seen, utterly unfit for our
purpose. Ernest at length pointed out a quantity of bamboos half buried
in the sand. These were exactly what I wanted, and, stripping thcni oi'their
leaves, I cut them into lengths of about five feet each; these I bound' in
bundles to carry to the tree, and then began to look about for some slight
reeds to serve as arrows.

I presently saw what I required in a copse at a little distance. We
advanced cautiously lest the thicket should contain some wild beast or
venomous serpent. Juno rushed ahead; as she did so a flock offlamingofls,
which had been quietly feeding, rose in the air. Fritz, instantly firing,
brought a couple of the birds to the ground, the rest of the squadron sailingr
away in perfect order, their plumage continually changing, as they (lew,
from beautiful rose to pure white, as alternately their snowy wings and rosy
breasts were visible. One of those which fell was perfectly dead, but the
other appeared only slightly wounded in the wing, for it made off across the
swampy ground. I attempted to follow, but soon found that progress was
impossible on the marsh; Juno, however, chased the bird and, seizing i:
speedily brought it to my feet. Fritz and Ernest were delighted at the sight
of our prize.

"What a handsome bird I" exclaimed they. "Is it much hurt? Let us
tame it and let it run about with the fowls."

"Its plumage is much more brilliant than that of the dead one," re-
marked Fritz.

"Yes," said Ernest, "this is a fullogrown bird, while yours is younger;
it is some years before they reach perfection. &e what long active legs it
has, like those of a stork, while with its great webbed feet it am swim
faster than a goose. Earth, air, or water is all the same to the flamingo---
it is equally at home in any one of the three."

"Well," said Fritz, " let us take the dead one to mother and get her
to introduce it to the other element, and See what it will make of that; if
it is young and tender, as you say, it should make a delicious roast."

Fritz and Ernest then carried the birds and bamboos to the tree, while
1 proceeded to cut my reeds. I chose those which had flowered, knowing
that they were harder, and, hafing cut a sufficient quantity of these, I
selected one or two of the tallest canes I could find to assist me in mea-
suring the height of the tree. I then bound them together and returned
to my family.

" Do you mean to keep this great hungry bird Fritz has brought?"
said my wife; "it is another month to feed, remember, and provisions are
still scarce."

"Luckily," I replied, "the flamingo will not eat grain like our poultry,
but will be quite satisfied with insects, fish, and little crabs, which it will
pick up for itself. Pray reassure yourself, therefore, and let me see to the
poor bird's wound."C [1.4 .-\"(.'l'-'\"G (215-311? '/'/:'/\'.S'. = r1

So saying, I procured some wine and butter and, anointing the win
which, though hurt, was not broken, I hound it up, and then tool; the bird
to the stream, where l fastened it by a long cord to a stake and left it to
shift for itself. In a few days the wound was healed, nnd the bird, subdued
by kind treatment, became rapidly tame.

While I was thus employed my sons were endeavouring to ascertain

the height of the lowest branch of the tree from the ground. They Inul
fastened together the long reeds I had brought with twine, and were trying
to measure the distance, but in vain: they soon found that, were the rods
ten times their length, they could not touch the branch.

"Hillo, my boys," I said, when I discovered what they were about,
"that is not the way to set to work. Geometry will simplify the operation
considerabl 3; with its help the altitude of the highest mountains is
ascertained: we may, therefore, easily find the height of that branch."60 III/45 S I! 'ISS FA .-'l)'//. V A'Ol}/r\-'.SS'O;V.

So saying, I measured out a certain distance from the base of the tree
and marked the spot, and then by means of a rod, whose length I knew,
and inmginary lines, I calculated the angle subtended by the trunk of the
tree from the ground to the root of the branch. This done, I was able to
discover the height required, and, to the astonishment of the younger
children, announced that we should henceforth live thirty fecr. above the
ground. This I wanted to know, that I might construct a. ladder of the
necessary length.

Telling Fritz to colicct all our cord, and the others to roll all the twine
into a ball, I S'll down and, taking the reeds, speedily Inamrlactured half a
dozen arrows and feathered them from the dead flamingo. 1 then took a
strong bamboo, heut it and strung it so as to form a bow. When the boys
saw what I had done they were delighted, and begged to have the plea-
sure of fining the first shot. _

"No, no!" said I, "I did not make this [or mere pleasure, nor is it
even intended as a weapon: the arrows are pointless. Elizabeth," I (2011-
tinucd to my wife, "can you supply me with a hall of stout thread from
your wonderful bag 'r'"

"Certainly," replied she, ,"l think that 21 ball of thread was the first
thing to enter the bag," and, diving her hand deep in, she drew out the
very thing I wanted.

"Now, boys," I said, "I am going to fire the first shot," and l l'asrcncd
one end of the thread to one of my arrows and aimed at a large branch
above me. The arrow llew upwards and bore the thread over the branch
and fell at our feet. Thus was the first step in our undertaking accom-
plished. Now for the rope ladder!

Fritz had obtained two coils of cord each about forty feet in length;
these we stretched on the ground side by side ; then Fritz cut the bamboos
into pieces of two feet for the steps of the ladder, and as he handed them
to me, I passed them through knots which I had prepared in the'ropes,
while Jack fixed each end with a nail driven through the wood. When the
ladder was finished, I carried over the bough a rope by which it might be
hauled up: This done, I fixed the lower end of the ladder firml to the
ground by means of stakes, and ail was ready for an ascent. The boys,
who had been watching me with intense interest, were each eager to be
first.

"Jack shall have the honour," said I, "as ho is the lightest; so up with
you, my boy, and do not break your neck."

Jack, who was as active as a monkey, sprang up the ladder and quickly
gained the top.

"Three cheers for the nest!" he exclaimed, waving his cap. "lltu'rah,
hurrah, hurrah for our jolly nest! ""hat a grand house we will have up
here; come along, Fritz."

His brother was soon by his side, and with a hammer and nails
secured the ladder yet more securely. I followed with an axe, and took asurvey of the tree. lt
was athnimbly suited to
our purpose; the branches
were very strong and so
closely interwoven that

I now called {or a

hauled it up, and, finding
the boys rather in my
way, told them to go
down while I proceeded
to fasten the pulley to 21

should require the next day.

I reached the ground, but to my surprise found that the two
They had not been seen.

A moment atterwards, however, all anxiety was dispelled, for amongst
the topmost boughs I heard their young voices raised in the evening hymn.(12 713E SIP--[$5 II'Arl'f/l. l" ROB/A '037.

instead of descending, they had, while I was 'busy, climbed upwards, and
had been sitting in silent admiration of the moonlight scene, high above.
They now joined us, and my wife showed me the results of her labour.
She had made two complete sets of harness. I congratulated her upon her
success, and we then sat down to supper. On a cloth spread out upon the
grass were arranged a roast shoulder of porcupine, a delicious bowl of soup
made from a piece of the same animal, cheese, butter, and biscuits, forming
a most tempting repast.

Having done this ample justice, we collected our cattle, and the
pigeons and fowls having retired to roost on the neighbouring trees, and
on the steps of our ladder, we made up a glorious lire to keep off any
prowling wild beasts, and ourselves lay down. The children, in spite of the
novelty of the hammocks, were quickly asleep. ln vain l tried to follow
their example; a thousand anxious thoughts presented themselves, and as
quickly as l dispelled them others rose in the float). The night wore on,
and I \'as still awake; the fire burned low, and l rose and replenished
it with dry fuel. Then again I climbed into my hammock, and towards
morning fell asleep.

Early next morning we were astir, and dispersed to our various occu--
pations. My wife milked the goats and cow, while we gave the animals
their food, after which we went down to the beach, to collect. more wood
for our bu ding;r operations. To the larger beams we harnessed the cow
and ass, while we ourselves dragged up the remainder. Fn'tz and I then
ascended the tree, and finished the preparations 1 had begun the night
before; all useless boughs we lopped ell; leaving a few about six feet from
the floor, from which we might sling our hammocks, and others still higher,
to support a temporary roof of sailcloth. My wife made fast the planks to
a rope passed through the block 1 had lixed to the bough above us, and by
this means Fritz and I hauled them up. These we arranged side by side
on the foundation of boughs, so as to form a smooth solid floor, and round
this platform built a bulwark of planks, and then throwing the saileloth
over the higher branches, we' drew it down and firmly nailed it.

Our house was thus enclosed on three sides, for behind the great trunk
protected us, while the front was left open to admit the fresh sea
breeze which blew directly in. We then hauled up our hammocks and
bedding, and slung them from the branches we, had left for that purpose.
A few hours of daylight still remaining, we cleared the floor from leaves
and chips, and then descended to fashion a table and a few benches
from the remainder of the wood. After working like slaves all day, Fritz
and I flung ourselves on the grass, while my wife arranged supper on the
table we had made. .

"Come," said she at length, "come and taste flamingo stew, and tcli
me how you like it. Ernest assured me that it would be much better stewed
than roasted, and l have been following his directions."

Laughing at the idea of Ernest turning scientific cook, we sat down.(37/14 {VG/A7} (7 (L4 13 Y'IL'A'S. in;

T he fowls gathered round as to pick up the crumbs, and the tame flamingo
joined them, while Master Knips skipped about from one to the other,
chattering and mimicking our gestures continually. To my wife's joy, the
sow appeared shortly after, and was presented with all the milk that
remained from the day's stock that she might be persuaded to return every
night.

"For," said my wife, "this surplus milk is really of no uSe to us, as it
will be sour before the morning in this hot climate."

"You are quite right," I replied, "but we must contrive to make it 01'
use. The next time Fritz and I return to the wreck we will bring off a
churn amongst the other things we require."

"Must you really go again to that dreadful wreck?" said my wife,
shuddering. "You have no idea how anxious i am when you are away
there."

"Go we must, I am ai'raid," l replied, "but not for a day or two yet.
Come, it is getting late. We and the chickens must go to roost."

We lit our watch--fires, and, leaving the dogs on guard below, ascended
the ladder. Fritz, Ernest, and Jack were up in a moment. Their mother
followed very cautiously, for, though she had originated the idea of building
a nest, she yet hesitated to entrust herself at such a terrific height from
the ground.

When she was safely landed in the house, taking little Franz on my
back, I let go the firstenings which Secured the lower end of the ladder
to the ground, and, swinging to and fro, slowly ascended.

Then for the first time we stood all together in our new home. 1
drew up the ladder, and, with a greater sense of security than l had enjoyed
since we landed on the island, ofiercd up our evening prayer, and retired
for the night.CHAITJ'l'ZR l\'.

EXT morning all were early awake, and the children sprang about
i the tree like young monkeys.

"Whatshall we begin to (lo, lather?" they cried. " What do you want
us to (lo to-day?"

"' Rest, my boys," I replied, "rest."

"Rest?" repeated they. "\\'li_\' should we rest '9"

""Six days shalt thou laliour and do all that thou hast to do, but on
the seventh thou shalt do no manner of work.' This is the seventh day,"
I replied; "on it, therefore, let us: rest."

"_\\"hat, is it really Sunday?" said Jack; "how jolly ! Oh, I won't do
any work ; but I'll take a bow and arrow and shoot, and we'll climb about
the tree and have fun all day

"That is not resting," id 1, "that is not the way you are accustomed
to spend the Lord's (la
"No! but. then we can't go to Church here, and there is nothing else
to do."

"We can worship here- as well as at home," said I.

"But there is no church, no clergyman, and no orgzui," said Franz.

"The lealy shade of this great tree is far more beautiful than any
church," I said; " there will we worship our Creator. Come, boys, down
with you: turn our dining-hall into a breakfiist-room."

The children, one by one, slipped down the ladder.

"My dear Elizabeth," said I, " this morning we will devote to the ser~
vice of the Lord, and by means of a parable I will endeavour to give the
children some serious thoughts; but, without books, or the possibility of
any of the usual Sunday occupations, we cannot keep them quiet the whole
(.11 '; afterwards, therefore, l shall allow them to pursue any innocent re-
creation they choose, and in the cool of the evening we will take a walk."

My wife entirely agreed with my proposal, and, having breaktasted, the
family assembled round me, as we sat in the pleasant shade on the fresh
soft grass.

:1. parable instead of preaching a. Sermon.

" Oh, that will be delightful! I like the parables in the Bible better
than anything," said Franz. " When can we hear you read out of the Bible
again, father? ' '

"Ah, my little boy, your words reproach 1116:," returned 1. "While
eaverlv striving to procure from the ship what would feed our bodies and

sure to find one."

At these words, my wife arose, and, fetching her magic bag, she drew
from it a copy of the Holy Scriptures, which I thankluliy rcceired from her
hand; and alter reading aloud from its sacred pages, I spoke as follows:

"A Great King, ruling in power and splendour over a vast realm of
light and love, possessed within its boundaries a desolate and uni'ruitt'ul
island. This spot he made the object of his special care; and, lavishing on
it all the varied resources of his 111ig'l1t and goodness. it bloomed in beauty,
and became the happy residence of" a band of colomsts who were charged,
not only with the cultivation and improvement of the soil, but each indi-
vidua'dy was bound to cherish in l 5 soul the spirit of lore and true allc-
giance to his Sorereign. While 1.111s t thful union was 111ai111.:1i11cd, the colony
flourished; and the noblest virtues exalted and rendered happy the existence
of every 111e111hc1' of the race. That a discontented and rebellious spirit
should ever have inlectcd these fortunate subjects of so loving a master,
seems incredible, y "t so it was; disobedience and pride brougnt misery and
punishment, the fair prospects of the colony were. blighted, the labours of
the colonists were unblcsscd, and tota'; separation from the parent kingdom
seemed ine '1ble. A 111 11gb: of pardon 01' free Ibrgireness was never--
theless accorded to these rebels; and to all who, humbly accepting it,
moulded their future 1 L. to the will of the Great King (HOW revealed in
a character even 11101'1': gracious than before), was hold out the promise of
removal at last from among the ruins (111151.11 by the gr :11t rebellion, to the
giory and undinnned splendour of the rcnhn of Light. and ls'lessedness."

Having interested the children. i then, leaving allegory, pro 'ed simply
and earnestly home to each young heart the truths I sought to teach; and
with a short prayer for a blessing on my words, brought the service to
a close.

After a thoughtful pause, we separated, and each employed himsell" as
he felt disposed.

I took some arrows, and endear-owed to point them \\:tl1 porcupine
quills.

Fran/ came to beg me make a little bow and ariow 1111 hi: 11 to shoot

a sharp spine at one end of each reed, made it fast with pack-thread, and
began to wish for glue to ensure its remaining firm.

"Oh, Jack !' mamma's soup is as sticky as anything!" cried Franz;
"shall I run and ask for a take of it?"

"No, no, little goose! better look for some real glue in the tool-box."

"There he will find glue, to be sure," said I, "and the soup would
scarcely have answered your purpose. But, Jack, my boy, I do not like to
hear you ridicule your little brother's idea. Some of the most valuable dis-
coveries have been the result of thoughts which originally appeared no wiser

than his."
While thus directing and assisting my sons, we were surprised by

hearing a shot just over our heads; at the same moment two small birds
toll dead at our feet, and, looking up, we beheld Ernest among the branches,
as, bending his time joyfully towards us, he cried, "Well hit! well hit! a
good shot, wasn't it?"

Then, slipping down the ladder, and picking up the birds, he brought
them to me. One was a kind of thrush, the other a small dove called the
ortolan, and esteemed a very great delicacy on accmmt of its exquisite
flavour. As the figs on which these birds came to feed were only just
beginning to ripen, it was probable that they would soon flock in numbers
to our trees; and by waiting until we could procure them in large quantities,
we might provide ourselves with valuable food for the rainy season, by placing
them, when half cooked, in cases with melted lard or butter poured over
them.

By this time Jack had pointed a good supply of arrows, and industriv
ously practised archery. I finished the bow and arrows for Franz, and
expected to be left in peace; but the young man next demanded a quiver,
and I'had to invent that also, to complete his equipment. It was easily
done by stripping a piece of bark from a small tree, fitting a flat side and
a bottom to it, and then a string. Attaching it to his shoulders, the youth-
i'ul hunter filled it with arrows and went oil"; looking, as his mother said,
like an innocent little Cupid, bent on conquest.

Not long after this, we were sunnnoncd to dinner, and all right will-
ingly obeyed the call.

During the meal I interested the boys very much by proposing to decide
on suitable names for the different spots we had visited on this coast.

"For," said i, "it will bacon-re more and more troublesome to explain
what we mean, unless we do so. Besides which we shall feel much more
at home if we can talk as people do in inhabited countries: instead or"
saying, for instance, 'Lhe little island atthe mouth of our hay, where we
found the dead shark,' 'the large stream near our tent, across which we
made the bridge,' 'that wood where we found cocoauuts, and caught the
inonkey,' and so on. Let us begin by naming the bay in which we landed.
What shall we call it?"

" Oyster Bay," said Fritz.SL'Y'I'IJA'U Dunn-1 e>>;-

"No, moi--Lobster Bay," cried Jack, "in memory of the old fellow
who took a. [army to my leg I"

"I think," observed his mother, "that, in token of gratitude for our
escape, we should call it Safety Bay."

This name met with general approbation, and was forthwith fixed upon.

Other names were quickly chosen. Our first place of abode we called
'l'entholm; the istet in the hay, Shark's Island; and the reedy swamp.
Flamingo Marsh. It was some time before the serious question of a name
for our leafy castle could be decided. But finally it was entitled Falcon-
hurst;' and we then rapidly named the few remaining points: Prospect
Hill, the eminence we first ascended; Capo Disappointment, from whose
rocky heights we had strained our eyes in vain search for our ship's com-
pany; and jackal River, as a name for the large stream at our landing--
plar'e, concluded Our geographical nomenclature.

In the afternoon the boys went on with their various eniployments.
Fritz finished his cases, and Jack asked my assistance in carryingr out his
plan of making a cuirass for Turk out of the porcupine skin. After thO<
roughly cleansing the inside, we cut and tilted it round the body of the
patient dog; then when strings were sewn on, and it became tolerably dry,
he was armed with this ingenious coat-of--mail, and a most singular figure
he cut!

Juno strongly objeCLed to his friendly approaches, and got out of his
way as fast as she could; and it we clear that he would easily put to
flight the fiercest animal he might encounter, while protected by armour at
once defensive and offensive.

I determined to make also a helmet for Jack out of the remainder of
the skin, which to his infinite delight l speedily did.

Amid these interesting occupations the evening drew on, and after a
pleasant walk among the sweet glades near our abode, we closed our Sab--
bath (lay with prayer and a glad hyrrni-ofpraise, retiring to rest with peace-
ful hearts.

Next morning, 1 proposed an expedition to Tenthohn, saying I wished
to make my way thither, b; a different route. We left the tree wcll armed;
l and my three elder sons each Carrying,r a gun and game bag, while little
Franz was equipped with his bow and quiver full of arrows. A most curious
party we formed: Fritz adorned with his belt of" margay skin, and Jack,
with his extraordinary head-dress, looked like a couple of young savages.
Their mother and I walked together; she, of the whole party, being the
only one unarmed, carried a jar in which to get butter from Tentholm;
we were preceded by the dogs--Turk armed most effectually with his
cuirass of porcupine skin, and June keeping at a respectful distance from so
formidable a ceinpanion. Master Knips fully intended to mount his charger
as usual; but when he saw him arrayed apparently in a new sum, hc

approached him carefully, and, touching him with one paw, discovered that
such :1 hide would make anything but an agreeable seat; the grimace he
made was most comical, and, chattering vociferously, he bounded towards
Juno, skipped on her back, seated himself, and soon appeared perfectly
reconciled to the Change. of Steed. The flamingo saw us starting, and,
having been zuuch potted during,r the last day or two, Considered himself
entitled to accompany "5' for some time he kept beside the children, following
first one and then another as they explored the wood on either side; their
irregular course, however, at length disgusted him, and, abandoning;r them,
he walked scdatelv by my side. We strolled on in the cool evening air,
following the course of the stream; the great trees overshadowed us, and
the cool green svard stretched away between them at our feet. The boys
roamed ahead of me, intent on exploration. Presently l heard a joylul
shout, and saw Ernest running at full speed towards me, followed by his
brothers. In his hand he held a plant, and, panting for breath, and with
sparkling eyes, he held it up to me.

"Potatoes! potatoes, father!" he gasped out.

"Yes," said Jack, "acres and acres of potatoes!"

"My dear Ernest," saidl, for there was no mistaking the flower and
leaf, and the light clear-green bulbous roots, "you have indeed made a dis-
covery; with the potato we shall never starve."

"But come and look at them," said Jack, "come and feast your eyes
on thousands of potatoes."

We hurried to. the spot; there, spread out before us, was a great tract
of ground, Covered with the precious plant.

"It would have been rather dillicult," remarked Jack, "not to have dis--
covered such a great field."

"Very likely," replied Ernest, smiling; "but I doubt il'you would have
discovered that it W' a potato-field."

"Perhaps not," said Jack, "you are quite welcome, at all events, to
the honour of the discoverv; I'll have the honour of being the first to get
a supply of them." So sewing, he dug up, with hands and knife, a number
of plants, and filled his game-bag witn the roots. The monkey followed
his example, and, scratching away with his paws most cleverly, soon had a
heap beside him. So delighted were we with the discovery, and so eager
were we to possess a large supply of the roots, that we stopped not dig-
ging until ever} hag, pouch, and pocket was filled. Some wished to return
at once to Falconhurst, to cook and taste our new acquisition; but this 1
overruled, and we continued our march, heavily laden, but delighted.

"How," said I, "can we thank the Giver of all these blessings suiti-
(iicntly ? "'

"Oh," said Franz, "we can say, '\-\"0 thank thee, O Lord, for all thy
goodness and mercy; and bless us, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."

"That would not be sufiicicnt," said Fritz. "Do you think it would
be enough, just to say to father and mother. "l'hank you for all you do,'SE Tum-Y; no WN. 69

  
  

and not to show that
we were really thank--

and doing what we

"You 2 'e quite
right, Fritz,' said I;
" l-'ranz did not say all
that was necessary;
he slwuld have added,
'Givc me grace 3.0 do
Thy will, and to obey
Thee in all things."
As we thus tallied,
we reached the head

delighted with the pineapple, and so eagerly did they fall to, that my
wife had to caution them that there were no doctors on our territory, and
that if they became ill, they would have to cure themselves as best they
might. This advice, however, seemed to have small cfl'ect on my Sons,
and, showing Knips what they wanted, they sent him after the ripest
and best fruit.

\Vhile they were thus employed, I examined the other Shrubs and
bushes. Among these I presently noticed one which I know well from des'
Cription to be the karz as.

"Come here, boys," I said, " here is something of far more value than
your pineapples. Do you see that plant with long pointed leaves and
beautiful red flower? 'l'hat is the karatas. The filaments of the leaves
make capital thread, while the leaves themselves, bruised, form an invalu-
able salve. The pith of this wonderful plant may be used either for tinder
or bait for fish, Suppose, Ernest, you had been wrecked here, how would
you have made a fire without matches, or flint and steel ?"

"As the savages do," replied he,- "I would rub two pieces of wood
together until they kindled."

"Try it," I said; "but, if you please, try it when you have a whole
day before you, and no other work to be done, for I am certain it would
be night before you accomplished the that. But see here," and I broke a
dry twig from the kamtas, and peeling off' the bark, laid the pith upon a
stone. l. struck a couple of pebbles over it, and they emitting a spark, the
pith caught fire.

The boys were delighted with the experiment. I then drew some of
the threads from the leaves, and presented them to my wife.

"But what," said Fritz, " is the use of all these other prickly plants,
except to annoy one? Here, for instance, is a disagreeable little tree."

"That is an Indian fig," said I. "It grows best on dry, rocky ground;
for most of its nourishment is derived from the air. Its juice is used, I
believe, medicinally, while its fruit is pleasant and wholesome." _

Master Jack was off in a moment when he heard of a new delicacy,
and attempted to gather some of the fruit, but in vain ; the sharp thorns
deficduhis efforts, and with bleeding hands and rueful countenance, he
returned. I removed the thorns from his hands, and making a sharp wooden
skewer, I thrust it into a fig, and quickly twisted it from its branch and
split it open with a knife, still holding it upon the skewer. The rest fol-
lowed my example, and we regaled ourselves upon the fruit, which we
found excellent. Ernest carefully examined the fig he was eating. "What
are these?" he exclaimed presently; "little red insects! they cling all over
the fruit, and I cannot shake them off. Can they be cochineal?"

Ile handed me the fig, and I examined it attentively.

" You are quite right, my boy," I said; "there is no doubt this is the
real cochineal. However, though it is worth its weight in gofd to Euro-
pean traders, it is of little use to us, I am afraid, unless any of you care$151 '7 7511VG D 0 IVA". 7 1

to appear in gay colours. The cooliineal, you know, forms the most lovely
scarlet dye."

"No,_ thank you," said Jack, "but we will take a lot of it when we go
home again. Now let us find something more useful to us. And they
thereupon plied me incessantly with questions conceming every plant and
shrub we passed.

"Stop, stop," 1 said at Eength; "the most learned naturalist would be

tell you the names, or explain to you the uses of one quarter of them."
Discussing, however, the properties of such shrubs n31 (lid know,
we at length reached 'l'entholm. Everything was safe, and we set to work
to collect what we wanted. I opened the butter cask, from which my wife
filled her pot. Fritz saw after the ammunition, and Jack and Ernest ran
down to the beach to capture the geese and ducks. This they found no
easy matter, for the birds, left so long alone, were shy, and nothing would
induce them to come on shore and be caught. Ernest at length hit upon
an ingenious plan. He took some pieces of Cheese, and tied them to long

n72 7111/"! .S'Il/'/._SL\' f'L/i'rllll. V ROBL'iISOA'x-'Z

strings. This bait he threw into the water, and the hungry ducks instantly
made a grab at it; their with a little skilful manteui-'ring he drew them on
shore. While Jack and he were thus busily employed catching and tying
the rebels together by the feet, we procured a fresh sup; _\.- of salt, which
we packed upon Turk's back, first relieving,r him of his Coat-of--inail. The
birds we fastened to our garlic--bags, and carefully closing the door of' our
tent, started homewards by the sea-shore. Ailcr a cheerful and pleasant
walk, we once more reached out' woodland abode. T released the birds, and,
clipping their wings to prevent their leaving us, established them on the
stream. Then, after a tlelicnms supper of potatoes, milk, and butter, wr:
ascended our tree and turned in.

llaring remarked a great deal or" drift-wood on the sands the prcccdinn'
evening, it occurred to me that it would be wail to get some of it, and
make a kind of sledge, so that the labour of i'htching what we wanted from
our stores at Tentholm might not fall so heavily on ou-solxt.

I awoke early, and roused Ernest as my as . ring to encourage
him to overcome his natural fault or" indo'iuncc. a littu: st :lching and
)awziing, he got up cheerfully, pleased with the idea of an cxl -diti0n "hilt:

in bringing back our load.

As we went along, 1 remarked to Ernest that I supposed he was
rather sorry for himself, and grudgcd lcm'ing his cosy hannuock and plea-
sant dreams at this untimely hour.

"Oh, Father, do not laugh at my laziness! lndccd I mean to Cure

"Why not, pra} "enquired l.

"I don't believe they will know what shot to use at first, and, besides,
they will most likely shoot upwards at the birds and be sure to miss them,

"Well, Ernest, you ccrtarily pus ss the gifts ofprntlencc and reduction,

may he acquired in a certain degree by all who train themselves to it."

Once on the sea-shore, our work was quickly accomplished, for, select-
ing the wood 1 thought fit for my purpose, We laid it acrt the broad
leafy branch, and, with some help from us, the donkey (Lagng a v~'\f lair

The boys exhibited an m ' 01' overall dnzun birds. and related, during
breakfast, the various. maidens of" Lulurc and success which had attended
their guns. Ernest had rightly guessed the mistakes they would make, but
practice was making them perfect, and they seemed disposed to continue their

than those. nl ,ndy killed, a. 'ed ifI did not think some means of Sharing:

they lircd on at this rate.

Entirely agreeing with this View of the subject, I desired the lads to
lay aside their guns for the present, and 1a; yc'inngcr ones readily applied
themselves to making snares of the long threads drawn from the leaves 01'
the karatas in a simple way I taught them, while Fritz and lirncst gave
me substantial as ice in the mamniurture of the new sledge.

We. were busrly at work, when a tremendous disturbance among our
{owls led us to suppose that a fox or wild cat had got into their midst.

The cocks crowed defiantly, the liens fluttered and tackled in a state
of the. wildest excitement. We hastened towards them, but Ernest, remark--
inf?-v Master Knips slipping away. as thnugh Conscious of some niisdunmmn'nn',
went to wa 'h him, and presently caught. him in the act of eating :1 now-

Ernest found several others. 'l'ncsc \vcrc very welcome to my wife, for
hitherto the hens had not presented us with any eggs. Hereafter shc deter-
mined to imprison the monkey every morning until the eggs had been
collectc't.

Soon after this, as Jack was setting the newly--made snares among the.
branches, he. discorcrcd that a pair of our own pigcnns were building in
the tree. it was very dc {ble to increase our stock 0!" these pretty birds,
and it cautioned the boys against shooting near our tree while they had
nests there, and also with regard to the Snares, which were meant only to
entrap the \i-'Eld-lig-cntcrs.

Although my sons were interested in sr'tting the snares, they by no
means approved of the new order to ocononusc the ammunition. No doubt
they had been discussing this hardship, for little Franz came to me with a
brilliant proposal of his own.

" "apa," said he, "why should not we begin to plant some powder and
shot immediately? It would be so much more useful than bare grain tor
the fowls."74 THE Sir/[SS [TAJIILY ROBLVSOA'.

His hrothcrs burst into a roar of laughter, and I must confess I found
it no easy matter to keep my countenance.

"Come, Ernest," said I ; " now we have had our amusement, tell the
little fellow what gunpowder really is.'

"It is not seed at all, Franz," Ernest explained. "Gunpowder is made
of charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre, mixed cleverly together; so you see it
cannot be sown like corn, any more than shot can be planted like peas
and beans."

My earpenteriug meantime went on apace. In order to shape my
sledge with ends properly turned up in front, I had chosen wood which
had been part of the bow of the vessel, and was curred in the necessary
way for my purpose. Two pieces, perfectly similar, formed the side of my
sleigh, or sledge, and I simply united these strongly by fixing short bars
across them. Then, when the ropes of the donkey's harness were attached
to the raised points in front, the equipage was complete and ready for use.

My attention had been for some time wholly engrossed by my work,
and 1 only n0w observed that the mother and her little boys had been
busily plucking above two dozen of the wild birds, and were preparing to
roast them, spittcd in a row on a long, narrow sword-blade, belonging to
one of our ship's officers.

It seemed somewhat wasteful to cook so many at once; but my wife
explained that she was getting them ready for the butter-cask I was going
to fetch for her on the new sledge, as I had advised her to preserve them
half-cooked, and packed in butter.

Amused by her promptitudc, I could do nothing less than promise to
go for her cask directly after dinner. For her part, she was resolved in
our absence to have a grand wash of linen and other clothes, and she
advised me to arrange regular baths for all the boys in future.

Early in the afternoon Ernest and l were ready to be oli', equipped as
usual. Fritz presented us each with a neat case of margay skin to hang
at our girdles.

We harnessed both cow and ass to the sledge, and, accompanied by
Juno, cheerfully took our departure, choosing the way by the sands, and
reaching Tcntholm without accident or adventure.

There, unharncssing the animals, we began at once to load the sledge,
not only with the butter-cask, but with a powder-chest, a barrel of cheese,
and a mriety of other 'articlcs- ball, shot, tools, and 'l'urk's armour, which
had been left behind on our last visit.

Our work had so closely engaged our attention that, when we were
ready to leave it and go in search of a good bathing-place, we discovered
that our two animals had wandered quite out of sight, having crossed the
bridge to reach the good pasture beyond the river. '

I sent Ernest after them, and went alone to the extremity of the bay.
It terminated in bold and precipitous clills, which extended into the deep
water, and rose abruptly, so as to form an inaccessible wall of rock andSETIZING' DO IVA-'1

while the cow and the ass, grazing at will, were again making for the bridge.

"Get up, Ernest, you lazy fellowl" exclaimed I, much annoyed; "why
don't you mind your buszness? Look at the animals! They will be over
the river again!"

"No fear of that, father," returned he, with the utmost composure.
"l have taken a couple of boards 03 the bridge. They won't-pass the
gap."

I could not help laughing at the ingenious device by which the boy
had spared himself all trouble; at the same time lobserred that it is wrong
to waste the precious moments in sleep when duty has to be performed.
1 then bid him go and collect some salt, which was wanted at home, while
I went to bathe.

On coming back, much refreshed, I again missed Ernest, and began to
wonder whether he was still gathering salt, or whether he had lain down
somewhere to finish his nap, when I heard him loudly calling, "Father,
father! I've caught a fish! an immense follow be is. I can scarcely hold
him, he dmgs the line so 1"76 TIIE SPY/[SS FA 1V1]. Y A'O/s'erSO/V.

Hastening towards the spot, I saw the boy lying in the grass, on a
point of land close to the mouth of the stream, and with all his might
keeping hold of a rod. The line was strained to the utmost by the frantic
efforts of a very large fish, which was attempting to free itself from the
hook.

I quickly took the rod from him, and, giving the fish more line, led
him by degrees into shallow water. Ernest ran in with his hatchet and
killed him.

It proved to be a salmon of full fifleen pounds weight, and I was
delighted to think of taking such a '11Iuable prize to them.

" this is capital, Emest!" cried I; "you l1a1e clea1ed yoursell lo1 once

All this being accomplished, we harnessed our beasts to the well-Zaden
vehicle, and, replacing the boards on the bridge, commenced the journey
home.

a sitting posture, and got over the ground at an astonishing rate, I attempted
to shoot it as it passed, but missed.

Ernest, who was behind me, observed its movements very coolly, and
seeing that the dog was puzzled, and that the animal, having paused, was
crouching among- the grass, wont cautiously nearer, fired 111. the spot he had
marked, and shot it dead.

The extraordinary appearance of this creature surprised us very much.
It was as large as 11 sheep, its head was shaped like that of 11 mouse; its
skin also was or" a mouse- colour, it had 10116 ears like 11 hare, and a tail

For some time we stood silently wondering at the remarkable creature

"Well, fatl1er,"'said Ernest at last, "I should say this was about the
queercst beast to be met with anywhere. I am glad I knocked it over.

"You have had a lucky day altogether, certainly," said I; "butI
cannot think what this animal can be. Examine its teeth, and let us see
to what class of mammalia it belongs. We may be led to guess at its name
in that way."

"I see four sharp incisor teeth, father--two upper and two under, as
a squirrel has."

The kangaroo was added to the already heavy load on our sledge, and
We proceeded slowly, arriving late at Falconhurst, but meeting with the
usual bright welcome.

Very eager and inquisitive were the glances turned towards the sledge,
for the load piled on it surpassed all expectation: we on our part staring
in equal surprise at the extraordinary rigy of the young folks who came to
meet us.

One wore a long night-shirt, which, with a belt, was a convenient
length in front, but trailed behind 1'11 orthodox ghost fashion.

Another had on a very wide pair of trousers, braced up so short that
each little leg looked like the clapper in a bell.78 TIIE SWISS Iv'Afie'ILY ROBINSOIV.

The third, buttoned up in a pea-jacket which came down to his ankles,
looked for all the world like a walking portmanteau.

Amid much joking and laughter, the mother explained that she had
been washing all day, and while their clothes were drying, the boys amused
themselves by dressing up in things they found while rummaging the sailor's
chest, and had kept them on, that Ernest and I might see the masquerade.
lt certainly amused us, but made me regret that so little belonging to our-
selves had been saved from the wreck, in consequence of which the children
had scarcely a change of linen.

Turning now to our new acquisitions, we excited great interest by
exhibiting each in turn; the large salmon, but more especially the kangaroo,
surprised and delighted everyone.

Fritz alone were a look expressive of dissatisfaction, and I saw that he
was envious of his younger brother's succes. Vexed that so noble a prize
had fallen to Ernest's gun, instead of his own, he treated it rather slight-
ingly; but I could see that he was struggling against his jealous feelings,
and he, after a while, succeeded in recovering his good humour, and joined
pleasantly in the conversation.

"What a famous day's sport you have had altogether!" said he, com-
ing close up to me. "It will be my turn to go out with you next, will it
not, father? Just about here there is nothing to shoot, and I have found
it very dull."

"Still you have been doing your duty, my dear boy: you were en-
trusted with the care of the family, and a. youth of manly character will
not depend for happincss on mere excitement."

As the shades of" night approached, we made haste to conclude the day's
work, by preparing the kangaroo, part for immediate use, and part for salt-
ing. The animals were fed, and a plentiful allowance of salt made to them.
Our own supper of broiled salmon and potatoes was dcspatehed with great
appetite, and we retired, with thankful hearts, to sound and well-earned
repose.FRESH DISCOVERIES.

NEXT morning, while the breakfast was getting ready, I attended to the

beautiful skin of the kangaroo, which I was anxious to preserve entire,
and afterwards, when Fritz had prepared everything in readiness for our
trip to the wreck, I called Ernest and Jack in order to give them some
parting injunctions Thev, however, had disappeared directly after breakfast
and their mother could only guess, Ithat, as we required potatoes, the\-'
might have gone to fetch a supply. Idesircd 1101 to rcpror 0 them, on their
return, for starting away without leave; but, as it appeared they had taken
Turk, I satisfied myself that no harm was likely to befall lthcm, although
it was not without reluctance tIratI left my dear wife alone with little
Franz, cheering her with hopes of our speedy return with new trcasurcs
from the wreck.

Advancing steadily on our way we crossed the bridge at Jackal River,
when suddenly, to our no small astonisl1111cnt,]ach and Ernest burst out
of a hiding-place where thev had lain in wait for us, and were enchanted
with the startling effect of their 1111e\pccted appearance upon their unsus-
pecting lather and brother. It was eridcnt that they luliy believed they
might now go with us to the wreck.

To this notion I at 011Ce put a decided stop, althOngh I could not find
in my heart to scold the two rrrerry rogues for their thoughtless frolic, more
especially as I particularly wished to send back a message to my wife. I
told them they must hurry home, so as not to leave their mother in sus-
pense, although, as they were already so far, they might collect some salt.
And I instructed them to explain that, as my work on board would take
up a long time, she must try to bear with our absence for a night. This
I had meant to say when we parted, but my courage had failed, knowing
how much she would object to such a plan, and I had resolved to return
in the evening.

On consideration, however, of the importance of constructing a roll,
which was my intention in going, and finishing it without a second trip, l
determined to remain on board for the night, as the boyshad, unintention-
all), given inc the chance of sending a mefidge to that eifect.

" Good by (-2, boys; take care of yourselves! were off," shouted Friu, as
I joined him in the tub- boat, and we shoved off.80 THE S IVISS FAAIIL Y R OBLVSOAF.

 

The current carried us brie _-' out of the bay; we were very soon
moored safely alongside the wreck, and, scrambling up her shattered sides,
stood on _what remained of the deck, and began at once to lay our plans.

I wanted to make a raft lit to carry on shore a great variety of articles
[at too large and heavy for our present boat. A number of empty water-
casks seemed just what was required lor a foundation: we closed them
tightly, pushed them orrrrb .d, and, arranging twelve of them side by side
in rows of three, we firmly secured Lh'eni together by means of spars, and
then proceeded to la); a good substantial floor of planks, which was defended
by a low bulwark. In this way we soon had a first-rate ral't, exactly suited
to our purpose.

It would have been impossible to return to land that same evening,
for we were thoroughly fatigued by our labours, and had eaten only the
light refreslnnen'. we had brought in our wallets, scarcely desisting'a moment
from our work,

Rejoicing that we were not expected home, we now made an excellent
supper from the ship's provisions, and then rested for the night on spring
mattresses, a perfect luxury to us, alter our hard and narrow hammocks.

Next morning we actively set about loading the raft and boat: first
carrying off the: entire contents of our own cabins; and, pa' '12 on to the
captain's room, we removed the. furniture, as well as the door and window--
frames, with their bolts, bars, and locks. We next tool; the ollicers' chests,
and those belonging to the carpenter and gunsmith; the contents of these
latter we had to remove in portions, as their weight was far beyond our
strength.

One large Chest was filled with an assortment of fancy goods,- and re-
minded us of a jewellers shop, so glittering was the display of gold and
silver watches, snull'boxes, buckles, studs, chains, rings, and all manner of
trinkets; these, and a box of money drew our attention for a time; but
more uscihl to us at present was a case of common kni s and forks, which
I was glad to find, as more suited to us than the smart szlver ones we had
previously taken on shore. To my delight we found, most carefully packed,
a number of young fruit--trees; and we read on the tickets attached to them
the names, so pleasant to European ears, of the apple, pear, chestnut, orange,
almond, peach, apricot, plum, cherry, and vine.

The cargo, which had been destined for the supply ol'a. distant colony,
proved, in fact, a rich and almost inexhaustible treasure to us. lrmnnong'ery,

maize, peas, oats, and wheat, 21 hand-mill, and also the parts of a saw-mill

put it up, had been stewed away.

So bewildered were we by the wealth around us that for some time
we were at a loss as to what to remove to the raft. It would be impos-
sible to take everything; yet the first storm would complete the destruction[C'i'ESH DISCO i'L'RIES. $1

(11" the ship, and we should lose all we left behind. Selecting,1 a number of
the most useful aniclcs, however, including, of course, the grain and the fruit--
trees, we graduallv loaded our raft. Fishing-lines, reels, (ordage, and a
couple o1 hamoons were put on l1oa1d, as 11 ell as 11 111111'ine1's compass.

anxzety, as, with the rail in tow, there was some danger of an accident.

But the son. being: cahn and the mad ourable, we found we could

and the broad sail was between 1' so that I could 210111c1'cei1el1is actions;

(.'itcnient. .

To 1111- amazement, I perceived that he 1'11all_\_'l1.'11lstruch the turtle
with a harpoon; a rope was attached to it, and the 1:1' ature was running
away \\'lLl1 us.

I..0\\'ering the sail and seizing my hatchet, I hastened forward, in order
to cut Lhe line, and cast adril't at. once turtle and haz'poon.

"My dear boy, the LurLlc will he a very dear bargain if he upsets all

sake, be careful! I will wait a few minutes, but the instant there is danger,
cut the line."

As the turtle began to make for the open sea, l hoisted the sail again:
and, findzng the opposition 100 11111111 1111 it, the creature again directed ils

shouted he, in eager ex-82 I'll]:~ 5 #7153 I?! MIL 1' R 081375 04V.

The turtle was evidently greatly exhausted, and no wonder, since it
had been acting the part of a steam-tug, and had been dragging, at full
speed, a couple of heavily-laden vessels. Its intention was to escape to
land; but I leaped into the water, and wading up to it, despatched it with
my axe. Such was its tenacity of life, however, that it did not cease its
struggles until 1 had actually severed its head from its body.

As we were by no means far from Falconhurst, Fritz gave notice of
our approach by firing oil" his gun, as well as shouting loudly in his glee;
and, while we were yet engaged in securing our boats and getting,y the turtle
on shore, the whole family appeared in the distance hastening eagerly
towards us; and our new prize, together with the well-laden boat and rai't,
excited the liveliest interest. My wife's chief pleasure, however, consisted
in seeing us safely back, as our night's absence had disturbed her, and she
was horrified by the description oi" our dangerous run in the wake of the
fugitive turtle.

Being anxious to remove some of our goods before night, the boys ran
oil" to: fetch the sledge; while I, having no anchor, contrived to moor
the boats by means of some of the heavy blocks of iron we had brought.

It required our united strength to get the turtle hoisted on to the
sle(lge,'=its weight being profik'ous; we found it, indeed, with the addition
of the sapling l'ruit~trees, quite a. sufficient load.

We then made the best of our way home, chatting merrily about
our various adventures. The first thing to be done on arriving was to
obtain some of the turtlc's flesh to cook for supper. To my wife this
appeared neee arily a work of time, as well as of dilliculty; but I
turned the beast on its back, and soon detached a portion of the meat
from the breast with a hatchet, by breaking the lower shell; and I then
directed that it should be cooked, with a little salt, shell and all.

"But let me first cut away this disgusting green fat," said my wife,
with a little shudder. " See how it sticks all over the meat. No one
could eattanything so nasty."

"Leave the fat, whatever you do!" exclaimed 1. "Why, my dear,
that is the very best part, and the delight of the epicure. 11' there be
really too much, cut some off--it can be used as lard, and let the dogs
make a supper of the refuse."

"And the handsome shell!" cried Fritz; "I should like to make a
water-trough of that, to stand near the brook, and be kept always full
of clear water. How useful it would be!"

"That is a capital idea," I replied, "and we may manage it easily,
if we 'Can liud clay so as to make a firm foundation on which to place it."

"Oh, as to clay," said Jack, "I have a grand lump of clay there
under that root."

"Well done, my lad! when (lid you find it?"

"He found a bed of clay near the river this morning," said his
mother, "and came home in such a mess, I had regularly to scrape his
clothes and wash him
thoroughly l"

" Well, mother, I can
only tell you I should
never in all my days
have found the clay if I
had not slipped and fallen
amongst it."

"That I can well
believe," retumed his
mother; "only, to hear
your talk this morning,
one would have thought
your discovery of clay
the result of very arduous
search indeed."

"\Vhen you have
ended the question of

look something like rad-
ishcs, although the plant itself was almost a bush; butI have not ventured
to taste them, although our old sow was devouring them at a great rate."

"In that you did wisely, my boy. Swine eat many things injurious
to men. Let me see your roots. How did you discover them '3"

"I was rambling in the wood this morning, and came upon the sow,
very busy gruhbing under a small bush, and eating something ravenously;
so I drove her away, and found a number of these roots, which I brought
for you to see."

"Indeed, Ernest," I exclaimed; after taking the roots in my hand
and considering them attentively, "I am inclined to believe that you
have really made a brilliant discovery! 11" this proves to be, as I expect,
the maniac root, we might lose every other eatable we possess, and yet
not starve. In the West Indies, cakes called cassa'a bread are made
from it; and, already having potatoes, we shall be very independent if we
can succeed in preparing flour from these roots. Great care must be taken
in the 1nanufi'icturc to express the juice, otherwise the flour may be in-
jurious and even poisonous. If we can collect a sulllcieut quantity, we will
attempt bread--making. 1 think I know how to set about it."

Finding there was still time to make another trip with the sledge,
1 went off with the elder boys, leaving Franz with his mother; and we8; 1/111? S IVISS FA 3112 1" 1203137501 '.

all looked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of the princely supper
they were to have ready for us, for om' day's work had been none 01'
the lightest.

"I have been thinkingr about my turtle, father," said Fritz. as we
went along; "' is not the shell very valuable? Surely beautiful. combs,
boxes, and a number 01' ornamental things are made of tortoise-shell, and
it so, it seems a pity to use it for a water--trough."

"Your turtle, Fritz, is only (it for eating, its shell is worthless as,

the sledge quickly 1cc1'1cd its se 11nd load from the it. Chests,
four cart-wheels, and the had-mill were placed on it, with all manner
of smaller articles, and we lost no time in returning to Falconhaz'st.

The mother welcomed 115 j _\.-'t'ully, for she said we had been regu-
larly overworked during the last two days. "However, now you are
(tome home to rest," said she, "and you little think what reli'eslnnent
awaits you here in the shade. Come and see my Cellar!" andshc smil--
ingly exhibited a small cask, halt sunk in the ground, and well sheltered
with leaves and branches.

"Ah! you wonder where this came 1"1'0111," continued the mother;

"well. 1 found i'. itlyselt' on ilze sands to-dny, while you were all
absent; and tau ying it was wine of some sort, I got it up here on
purpose to in; ready for you. The boys are most anxious to know
what sort of wine it will prove to b0."
\" the si111plcst method 01' ascertaining this, I inserted a straw at
the vent-hole, and presently announced that in all my life I hnrl never
enjoyed a more delicious draught of canary sack. The mother was im--
mensely pleased to find that her exertior' in my behalf had not. been
thrown away, and the boys pressed round me, armed with straws, and
begging for a taste.

.-\t'ter so stro 1' expr 3' my 01111 enjoyment of the wine it
seemed unreasonable to den1 them this, and I 'et them come in turns,
btt 11" s speedily obliged to call a halt; 1'01 the 1ogues got so c'tgcr
and excited that I had to reprovc them for their greediness, and warn
them of the risk they ran 02' being intoxicated. In fact, I blamed my-
self for allowing them to have this Strong wine as a beverage at all.
They were who lv unaccustmncd to it, and were besides fatigued and
very hungry. Supper was more to the purpose; and, as the turtle
proved delicious, it. was heartily enjoyed, and gave as strength to haul
the mattresses we had brought from the ship up into our steeping--rooms,
so that very refreshing slumbers closed the day.

Eat}! next morning I got up without rousing any of the others,
intending to pay a fish to the beach; for I had my doubts about
thefsal'ety of my vessels on the open shore. The dogs were delighted
when I descended the ladder, and bounded to meet me ; the cocks
crowed and {lapped their wings; two pretty kids gambolled around; all
was life and energy; the ass alone seemed disinclined to begin the day,
and as l especially required his 5 'es this was unlortunate. I put
his morning dreams to flight, howei r, and harnessed him to the sledge ;
the cow, as she had not been milked, enjoyed the privilege of further
repose, and with the rest of the family, I left her dozing.

My fears as to the safety of the boats were soon dispelled, for they
were all right; and, being in haste to return, the load I collected from their
freight was but a light one, and the donkey willingly trotted home with
it, he, as well as I, being uncommonly ready For breakfast. .-'\1.n)rmu:hi11;,r
the tree, not a sound was to be heard, not a soul was Lobe seen, although
it was broad day; and great was my good wife's surprise, when, roused by
the clatter and hullaballoo I made, she started up, and became aware of the
late hour.

"What can have made us orersleep ourselves like this?" she exclaimed.
"It must be the fault of those mattresses: they are delightful, but really
too lulling; see, the children are sound asleep still."

\Vith much stretching and many yawns, the boys at last came tumbling
down from the tree, rubbing their eyes and seeming but half awake ; Ernest
last, as usual.

"Come, my boy ,' said I, "this will never do! Your beds were too
luxurious last night, I see; in my own Opinion, however, l felt there was
something else to blame besides the comfortable mattresses, and I made a
mental resolve that the captain's fine canary should be dealt with very
sparingly in future. "So now for prayers and breakfast," Icontinued, " and
then off to work; I must have our cargo landed in time to get the boats
off with the next tide."

By dint of downright hard work, we accomplished this, and I got on
board with Fritz as soon :' they were afloat; the rest turned homewards,
but Jack lingered behind with such imploring looks, that I could not resist
taking him with me.

My intention had been simply to take the vessels round to the harbour
in Safety Bay, but. the calm sea and fine weather tempted me to make
another trip to the wreck. It took up more time than I expected, so that
when on board, we could only make a further examination of the cargo,
collect a few portable articles, and then mail ourselves of the sea-breeze,
which would fail us later in the evening.

To Jack the pleasure of hunting about in the hold was novel and
charming, and very soon a tremendous rattling and clatteriug heralded his
approach with a wheel--barrow, in the highest spirits at his good fortune in
having found such a capital thing in which to bring home potatoes.

He was l'ollorred by Fritz, whose DEV ' was still more important. He
had found, carefully packed and enclosed \\- hin partitions, what appeared

hastened to see if the lad was right. Indeed he was, but my pleasure was
qualified by a sense of the arduous task it would he to put such a eral't
together so as to be lit for 31:11. For the present, 111: had ba1elv time to get

This scene, and the examination
of our burdens, caused great incrri-
ment, the tobacco-grater and iron plzttes
evidently puzzling everybody.

I sent the boys to :ntch some
of our geese and ducks, and bid
them fasten a penguin to each by the leg, thinkingr that it \'218 worth
while to try to tame them.

My wife. had exerted herself in our absence to provide a good store
of potatoes, and also of maniac. root. I admired her industry, and little
Franz said, "Ah. father! I wonder what you will say when mother and
I give you some Indian corn, and melons, and pumpkins, and cucumbers!"

"Now, you little Chatterbox!" cried she, "you have let out my secret!
I was to have the pleasure of surprising your father when my plants
were growing up."

"Ah, the poor disappointed little mother!" said I. "Never mind!
I am charmed to hear about it. Only do tell me, where did those seeds
come from '3"

"Out of my magic bag, of course," replied she. "And each time
l have gone for potatoes, l have sown seeds in the ground which was
dug up to get them; and l have planted potatoes also."

"Well done, you wise little womanl" I exclaimed. "Why, you are
a model of prudence and industry 1"

"But," continued she, "I do not half like the appearance of those
tobaccmgratcrs you have brought. Is it possible you are going to make
snuff? Do, pray, let us make sure of abundance of food [or our months,
before we think of our noses l"

"Make your mind easy, my wife," said I. "I have not the remotes:
intention of introducing the dirty, ridiculous habit of snufiing into your
family! Please to treat my graters with respect, however, because they
are to be the means of providing you with the first fresh bread you
have seen this many a long day."

"What possible connection can there be between bread and tobacco--
grators? I cannot imagine What you mean, and to talk of bread where
there are no ovens is only tantalising."

"All, you must not expect real loaves," said I. "But on these flat
iron plates 1 can bake fiat cakes or scones, which will be excellent
bread 5 I mean to try at once what I can do with Ernest's roots. And
first of all, I want you to make me a nice strong canvas bag."

This the mother willingly undertook to do, but she evidently had
not much faith in my powers as a baker, and I saw her set on a good
potiul or" potatoes before beginning to work, as though to make sure of
a meal without depending on my bread.

Spreading a large sail-cloth on the ground, I summoned my boys
and set to work. Each took a grater and a supply of well-washed
manioo root, and when all were seated round the cloth- ~"Once, twice,
thn'cel Off!" cried 1, beginning to rub a root as hard as I could against
the rough surface of my grater. My example was instantly followed by
the whole party, amid bursts of merrimcnt, as each remarked the funny
attitude and odd gestures ol' his neighbours while vehemently rubbing, rasp-
ing, grating, and grinding down the roots allotted to him. No one was
tempted by the look of the flour to stop and taste it, for in truth it looked
much like wet sawdust.

"Cassava bread is highly esteemed in many parts of the New World,
and I have even heard that some Europeans there prefer it to the Wheaten
bread of their own country. There are various species of maniac. One
sort grows quickly, and its roots ripen in a very short time. Another kind[fir/{Sf} DISC 0 VERIE S. 89

is of somewhat slower growth. The roots of the third kind do not come
to maturity for two years. The two first are poisonous it eaten raw, yet-
they are preferred to the third, which is harmless, beratise they are so much
more fruitful, and the flour produced is excellent if the scrapings. are care--
fully pressed."

"What is the good of pressing them, father?" inquired Ernest.

"It is in order to express the sap, which contains the poison. The dry
pith is wholesome and nourishing. Still, 1 do not mean to taste my cakes,
until I have tried their effect on our lowls and the ape."

By this time our supply of roots being reduced to damp powder. the
canvas bag was filled with it, and, tying it tightly up, l attempted to squeeze
it, but soon found that mechzmical aid was necessary in order to express
the moisture. My arrangements for this purpose were as follows: a strong
straight beam was made flat on one side, smooth planks were laid across
two of the lower roots of our tree; on these we placed the sack, above
the sack another plank, and over that the long beam; one end was passed
under a root near the sack, the other projected far tbrward. And to that
we attached all the heaviest weights we could think of, such as an anvil.
iron bars, and masses of lead. The consequent pressure on the bag was
enormous, and the sap flowed from it to the ground.

"\Vill this stall" keep any time?" enquired my wife, who came. to see
how we were getting on. " Or rnu all this great bagl'ul be used at once?
In that case we shall have to spend the whole of to-morrow in baking
cakes."

"I\'ot at all." I replied; " once dry, the flour in barrels will keep fresh
3. long time. "-"e shall use a great deal of this, however, as you shall see."

" Do you think we might begin now, father .7 " said Fritz. "T here does
not seem the least moisture remaining."

"Certainly," said 1. "But I shall only make one cake to--day for an
experiment; we must see how it agrees with Master Knips and the hens
before we set up a bakehouse in regular style."

I took out a couple of handfuls of flour for this purpose, and with a
stick loosened and stirred the remainder, which I intended should again be
pressed. While an iron plate placed over a good fire was getting hot, I
mixed the meal with water and a little salt, kneaded it well, and forming
a thickish cake, laid it on the hot plate, when, one side presently becom-
ing a nice yellow brown colour, it was turned and was quickly baked.

monkey, who were selected as the subjects of this interesting experiment,
and they silently watched them gobbling up the bits of cake 1. gave them,
until Fritz turned to me, saying, "Suppose the cake is poisonous, what ellkct
will it have on the creatures '3 Will they be stupefied, or will they suffer
pain ?"

"That depends upon the nature of the poison. Some Cause violent pain,
as colchicum, helleborc, and aconite. Others produce stupefaction and paralysis,90 THE .WVISS 1414111le ROBIA'SOA'.

as opium, hemlock, and pl't'lSSiC acid; while others again, as strychnine,
are followed by violent convulsions, or, as belladonna, by delirium. The
effects, of course, vary according to the quantity taken, and such remedies
should be applied as will best counteract the effect of each poison: enietics
in any case to remove as much as possible of the noxious substance, com--
bined with oils and mucilaginous drinks to soothe and protect the stomach
in the case of irritants ; stimulants, such as spirits, ammonia, or strong coffee,
to rouse from the stupor oi" the narcotics; and sedative drugs, which are
perhaps in themselves poismis, to counteract the over-stimulation ol" the
nerves caused by the convulsant poisons. But now let us think no more
of poisons; here is supper ready, and we need not be afraid to eat roast
penguin and potatoes."

No sooner said than done; we left the fowls picking up the least Crumb
they could find of the questionable food, and assembled to enjoy our evening
meal. The potatoes were as usual excellent, the penguin really not so bad
as I expected, although fishy in taste and very tough.

Next morning everyone expressed the tendercst concern as to the
health of Knips and the hens; and lively pleasure was in cverycountenancc
when Jack, who ran first to make the visit of inquiry, brought news of their
perfect good health and spirits.

No Lime was now to be lost, and bread-baking commenced in earnest.
A large tire was kindled, the plates heated, the meal made into cakes, each
of the boys busily preparing his own, and watching: the. baking most eagerly.
Mistakes occurred, of course; some of the bread was burnt, some not done
enough; but a pile of nice tempting cakes was at length ready, and with
plenty of good milk we breakfasted right royally, and in high spirits at our
success.

Soon after, whilst feeding the poultry with the fragments of the rcpast,
I observed that the captive penguins were quite at ease among them and
as tame as the geese and ducks; their bonds were therefore loosed, and they
were left as free as the other fowls.A.\ ADDI'I'ION TO OUR 1-'i.i-:i-'_'r.

AVING now discovered how to provide bread for my linuily. my
thoughts began to revert to the wreck and all the. valuables yet Con-
tained within it. Above all, I was bent on acquiring posStzssion ol' the
beautiful pinnace, and, aware that our united 't'fin'ts would he required to
do the necessary work,l began to coax and pe . adc the mother to let me
go in force with all her boys except l-'ranz.

She very unwillingly gave her consent at last, but not until I had thith--
fully promised never to pass a night on board. I did so with rc-Iuvtnnvc,
and we parted, neither feeling quite satisfied with the arrangement.

The boys were delighted to go in so large :1 party, and merrily :arricd
provision-bags filled with cassava bread and potatoes.

Reaching Safety Bay without adventure, we first paid a visit to the
geese and ducks which inhabited the marsh there. and hayingr fed them and
soon they were thriving well, we buckled on each his cork-belt, stepped
into the tub~hoat_. and, with the raft in tow, steered straight for the wreck.

When we got on board, I desired the boys to Collect whatever name
lirst to hand, and load the raft to be ready for our return at night, and
then we made a minute inspection of the pinnace.

I came to the conclusion that difliitulties, well-nigh iusuperahle, lay he-
tween me and the safe possession of the beautiful little vessel. She lay in
a most un-get-at-able position at the farther end of the hold, stowed in so
confined and narrow a space that it was impossible to think of fittingr the
parts together there. At the same time these parts were so heavy that
removing them to a convenient place piece by piece was equally out or" the
question.

1 sent the boys away to amuse themselves by rummaging out any-
thing they liked to carry away, and sat down quietly to consider the matter.

As my eyes became used to the dim light which entered the compart--
ment through a think or crevice here and there, 1 perceived how carefully
every part of the pinnaee was arranged and marked with ruunhcrs. so that
if only I could hestow suflicieut time on the work, and contrive space in
which to execute it, I might reasonably hope for success.

" Room ! room to work in, boys! that's what we need in the first place !"
I cried, as my sons came to see what plan I had devised, for so great was
their reliance on me, that they never doubted the pinnaCe was to be ours.n2 IHE .S'I!"1,.\'.5' F/LVIL Y ROB/IVSOA'.

"Fetch axes, and let us break down the compartment and clear space
all round."

To work we all went, yet evening drew near, and but little impression
was made on the mass of woodwork around us. We had to acknowledge
that an immense amount of labour and perseverance would be required
before we could call ourselves the owners of the useful and elegant little craft,
which lay within this vast hulk like a lesil shell embedded in a rock.

Preparations for returning to shore were hastily made, and we landed
without much relish for the long walk to lt'alconhurst, when to our great
surprise and pleasure, we found the mother and little Franz lat 'l'enthohn
awaiting us. She had resolved to take up her quarters there during the
time we should be engaged on the wreck. "In that way you will live
nearer your work, and I shall not quite lose sight of you!" said she, with
a pleasant smile.

"You are a good, sensible, kind wife," .I. exclaimed, delighted with her
plan, "and we shall work with the greater diligence, that you may return
as soon as pessible to your dear balconhurst."

"Come and see what we have brought you, mother!" cried Fritz; "a
good addition to your s ores, is it not 2' and he and his brothers exhibited
two small tasks of butter, three of flour, corn, rice, and many other articles
welcome to our careful housewife.

Our days were now spent in hard work on board, first cutting and
clearing an open space round the pinnace, and then putting the parts
together. We started early and returned at night, bringing each time a
valuable freight from the old vessel.

At length, with incredible labour, all was Completed. The pinnace stood
actually ready to he launched, but imprisoned within massive wooden walls
which defied our strength.

It seemed exactly as though the graceful vessel had awakened from
sleep, and was longing to spring into the free blue sea, and spread her
wings to the breeze. .l could not bear to think that our succewso far
should be followed by failure and disappointment. Yet no possible means
of setting her free could .l conceive, and I was almost in despair, when an
idea occurred to me which, if I could carry it out, would ell'ect her release
without further labour or delay.

Without explaining,r my purpose, I got a large cast-iron mortar, filled it
with gunpowder, secured a block of oak to the top, through which Ipierced
a hole for the insertion of the match, and this great petard [so placed,
that when it exploded, it should blow out the side of the vessel next which
the pinnace lay. Then Securing it with chains, that the recoil might do 'no
damage, I {01d the boys I was going ashore earlier than usual, and calmly
desired them to get into the boat. Then lighting a match I had prepared,
and-which would burn some time before reaching the powder, I hastened
after them with a beating heart, and we made for the land.

mother, as I did not speak, "perhaps you have left a light burning near

"Not at all, unlikely," replied l quietly; "we had a fire below when
we were caulking the seams of the pinnace. I shall go oil" at once and see
what has happened. \Vill anyone come '3"

The boys needed no second invitation, but sprang into the boat, while
I lingered to reassure my wife by whispering a few words of explanation,
and then joining them, we pulled for the wreck at a more rapid rate than
we ever had (lone before

No alteration had taken place in the side at which we usually boarded
her, and we pulled round to the further side, where a marvellous sight
awaited us. A huge rcnt appeared, the decks and bulwarks were torn open,
the water was covered with floating wreckage--all seemed in ruins; and the
compartment where the pinnace rested was fully revealed to view. There
sat the little beauty, to all appearance uninjured; and the boys, whose
attention was taken up with the melancholy scene of min and confusion
around them, were astonished to hear me shout in enthusiastic delight:
"Hurrah! she is oursl The lovely pinnace is won! we shall be able to

The boys gazed at me for a moment, and then, guessing my secret,
"You planned it yourself, you clever, cunning father! Oh, that machine
we helped to make was on purpose to blow it up!" cried they; and
eagerly they followed me into the shattered opening, where, to my intense
satisfaction, I found everything as I could wish, and the captive in no way
a sufferer from the violent measures I had adopted for her deliverance.

The boys were deeply interested in examining the effects of the94 IRE STVI'SS PS43111!" [I'D/3133011.

way to manage a petartl.

It 11' s evident that the launch could now be effected without much
trouble; I had been careful to place rollers beneath the keel, so that by
means of le1'e1s 21nd pulleys we might, with our united strength, move her

The pinnace was fully equipped and ready to sail, while yet no idea.

We. all landed, and with great curiosity followed lire mother up the
river towards Lhc Cascade; where, to our nstonislnnenl, we found a garden
neatly laid out in beds and walks; and she continued, " We don't frighten

"My dear wife," I exclaimed, "this is beautiful! You have done
wonders! Did you not find the work too hard?"

"The ground is light and easy to dig hereabouts," she replied. "I have
planted potatoes, and cassava roots, there is space for sugar-canes and the
young fruit-trees, and .l. shall want you to contrive to frriga'te them, by lead-
ing water from the cascades in hollow bamboos. Up by the sheltering
rocks I mean to have pineapples and melons; they will look splendid when
they spread there. To shelter the beds of European vegetables from the
heat of the sun I have planted seeds of maize round them. The shadow
of the tail plants will afford protection from the binning rays. Do you
think that is a good plan?"

"I do indeed; the whole arrangement is capital. Now, as Sunset ap-
proaches, we must return to the tent for supper and rest, for hothof which
we are all quite ready."

The time passed in happy tall: over our inanv new interests; every-
one had the pleasant sensation which attends succeasful labour, as well as
experiencing the joy of affording unexpected pleasure to others ; and I especi-
allv pointed out to my sons how truly genuine happiness consists in that,
rather than in mere scltlgratilication.

Next morning, my wife said: "If you can exist on shore long enough
to visit Falconhurst, dear husband, I should like you to attend to the little
unit-trees. I fear they have been too much neglected. I have watered thorn
occasionally, and spread earth over the roots as they lay, but I could not
manage to plant them."

"You have done far more than I could have expected, my wife," I
replied, "and provided you do not ask me to give up the sea altogether,
I most willingly agree to your request, and will go to lialconhurst as soon
as the raft is unloaded, and everything safely arranged here."

Life on shore was an agreeable change for us all, and the boys went
actively to work, so that the stores were quickly brought up to the tent,
piled in order, and carefully covered with sachloths, fastened down by pegs
all round. The pinnace being provided with an anchor, was properly moored,
and her elegant appearance quite altered the look of our harbour, hitherto
occupied only by the grotesque tub-boat, and flat uninteresting raft.

Taking an ample supply of everything we should require at Falcon-
hurst, we were soon comfortably re-established in that charming abode, its
peaceful shade securing more delightful than ever, after the heat and hard
work we had lately undergone.

Several Sundays had passed during our stay at Tentholm, and the
welcome Day of Rest now returned again, to be observed with heartfelt
devotion and grateful praise. I did not attempt too much in the form of
preaching, as .I could not have secured the attention of my hearers to any
long-winded discourse, but they were interested in the Bible-reading and
simple instructions I drew from it, and their young voices joined sweetly
in favourite hymns, which my wife sang from memory..4.-V ADD/770A" TO OUR FLEET. 9;

In the evening, I desired my boys to let me see their dexterity in ath-
letic exercises, such as running, leaping, wrestling, and climbing; tellinffir
them that the)' must keep up the practice of these things, so as to grow
strong active mcn, powerful to repel and cope with danger, as well as agile
and swift--footed to escape from it. No man can be really courageous and
self--rciiant without an inward consciousness of physical power and Cilpz'ibility.

"I want to see my sons strong, both morall)r and physically," said 1 ;
"that means, little Franz" (as the large blue eyes looked inquiringiy up at
me), "brave to do what is good and right, and to hate evil, and strong to
work, hunt, and provide for themselves and others, and to fight if necessary."

On the following,r day, the boys seeming disposed to carry out my
wishes by muscular exercise of all sorts, l encouraged them by saying I
meant to prepare a curious new weapon for them, only they must promise
not to neglect the practice of archery ; as to their guns, 1 had no reason
to fear they would be laid aside.

Taking a long cord, I attached a leaden bullet to each end, and had
instantly to answer a storm of questions as to what this could possibly be for.

"This is a miniature las'o," said I; " the Mexicans, Patagonians, and
various tribes of South America make use of this weapon in hunting, with
marvellous dexterity, onl having no bullets, they fasten stones to their
ropes, which are immen v longer than this. One end is swung round and
round the mounted h nter's head, and then east with skill and precision to
wards the animal he wishes to strike; immediately drawing it back, he can
repeat the blow, and either kill or wound his prey. Frequently, however,
the intention is to take the animal, wild horse, or bufialo, or whatever it
may be, alive; and in that case, the lasso is thrown, while riding in hot
pursuit, in such a way as to make the stone twist many times round the
neck, body, or legs of the fugitive, arresting him even in full career."

" Oh, father, what a splendid contrivance! Will you" try it now ? There
is the donkey, lather! do catch the donkey."

Not at all certain of my powers, I declined to practise upon a live
subject, but consented to make a trial of skill by aiming at the stump
of a tree at no great distance.

My success surpassed my own expectations; the stirrup was entwined
by the cord in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever as to the
feasibility 01' the wonderful performances I described; and I was assailed
by petitions from the boys, each anxious to possess a lasso of his own
without a moment's delay.

As the manufacture was simple, their wishes were speedily gratified,
and lasso-1 tactice became the order of the day.

nothing to call us to the wreck for the next few (1

My attention was by no means iuonopoliscd lr. my sons and their
amusements. The good mother had much to show me demanding my .ppproval,
advice, or assistance, as the case might be.

A good Supply of wild pigeons and ortolans had been snared, partly
Cooked, and preserved in lard. Of these she showed me her small cask
well filled.

Then the nests of various pairs of tame pigeons were exhibited, but her
(thief care was the unproniising condition of her dear little fruit-trees, for,
having been forgotten, they were so dry and withered that, unless planted
without further delay, she feared we should lose them.

This ueedful work we set about, therefore, at once, proposing afterwards
an excursion to the Calabash Wood, in order to nianuiacture a large supply
of vessels and utei ils of all sorts and sizes.

Everyone was inclined for this expedition; consequently the planting
of the orchard was carried on with surprising vigour, but was not completed
until towards evening; and then all sorts of arrangements were made for an
early start: next day. The mother and Franz were to be of the party, and
their equipment wok some time, for we meant to make a grand family
excursion attended by our domestic pets and servants!

By sunrise we were all astir, and everything quickly made ready for
a start.

The slcdn'c, loaded with anrnunition and baskets of provisions, and drawn
by the donk ', was to be used for on 'iug home our gourd manutacturcs,
as well as any other prize we might fall in with.

Turk, as usual, headed the procession, clad in his Coat of mail.

Then came the boys with their guns and game-bags. 'l.'hr:ir mother and

on her back.

On this occasion I took two guns with me, one loaded with shot for
game, another with ball for our defence against beasts of prey.

Flamingo Marsh was quickly (to and the magnificent; country beyond

my w e and two of the boys, and the lovely prospect enchanted them.

" urc Fritz and Jack turned aside into the hush, whore presently loud
barking was followed by the quick report of a gun, and a large bird, which
had risen from the thicket, fell heavily to the ground before us. Far from
resigning itself, however, to death or captivity, it sprang to its feet, and,
unable to fly, rushed away with extraordinary spec-d, hotly pursued by the
excited dog, while Fritz ran panting in the same direction, and Juno, agar
to join the chase, sprang aside so suddenly that her rider was llung' uncere-

bird. This she cleverly accomplished, but its defence was maintained so
fiercely, as it struek out with its pmverfid legs and sharp claws, that neither
Fritz nm' the dogs could master it.

I hastened to their assistance, and found Juno holding on nobiy by Lhc
wing she had seized, while the bird, which proved to be a magnificent
bustard, struggled and fought fiercely. Watching my opportunity, I threw

a large handkerchief over it, and with dilliculty succeeded in binding its
legs and wings. It was borne in triumph to the rest of our party, who
meantime had been reclining on the sand.

"What have you got?" "What has Fritz shot?" (tried the boys,
starting up at our approach. "A hnsiard! oh. that is splendid! "'

"To be sure, it is the one we missed that day, don't you remember,
mother? Ah, ha! old follow, you are done for this time!" said Jack.

" I think this is a hen bustard, it is the mother bird," said Ernest.100 77-115 SIP/XS 1753/1121" .lx'Ob'I.-\"SO.-'\-'.

"Ah, yes, poor thing! " exclaimed my wife, in a tone of concern; " it
is most likely the same, and I know she had a brood of young birds, and
now they will be left unprotected and miserable. Had we not better let
her go '3"

"'Why, my dear, kind-hearted wife, that was weeks and weeks ago!

Bastard here has forgotten all about them, Besides, she is badly wounded,
and we must. try to cure the hurt. If we succeed, she will be a valuable
addition to our paid: ard; if we cannot, you shall roast her for dinner."

Resuming our niar,i, we next arrived at the Monkey Grove, which was
the scene of the magi-comic adventure by which Fritz became the guardian
of the orphan ape.

While be amused us all by a lively and graphic description of the
scene, lirnest was standing apart under a splendid cocoanut palm, gazing in
fixed admiration at the grand height of the stem, and its beautiful graceful
crown of leaves. The- cluster of nuts beneath these evidently added interest
to the spectacle, for, drawing quietly near him, I heard a long-drawn sigh,
and the words--

"lt's awfully high! I wish one would fall down I"

Scarcely had he uttered these words than as if by magic, down
plumpcd a huge nut at his feet.

The boy was quite startled, and sprang aside, looking timidly upwards,
when, to my surprise, down :ame another.

"Why, this is just like the fairy tale of the wishing--cap l" cried Ernest.
"My wish is granted as soon as formed!"

"I suspect the fairy in this instance is more anxious to pelt us and
drive us away than to bestow dainty gifts upon us," said I. "1 think there
is most likely a cross-grained old ape sitting up among those shadowy leaves
and branches."

We examined the nuts, thinking they were perhaps old ones, and had
fallen, in consequence, naturally, but they were not even quite ripe.

Anxious to discover what was in the tree, we all sun'ounded it, gaping
and gazing upwards with curious eyes.

" Hollo ! I see him !" shouted Fritz presently. " Oh, a hideous creature 1
what ran it be? flat, round, as big as a plate, and with a pair of horrid
clawsl Here he comes! He is going to creep down the tree!"

At this, little liz'anz slipped behind his mother, Ernest tool; a glance
round to mark a place of retreat, Jack raised the butt-end of his gun, and
every eye was fixed on the trunk of the tree, down which a large laud-crab
commenced a leis 'cly descent. As it approached within reach, Jack hit at
it boldly, when it suddenly (hopped the remaining distance, and openingr its

jacket and spreading it wide out in both hands, he returned to the charge,
suddenly tbrcw hi garment over the creature, wrapped it well round it, and
then pummclled it with all the strength of his fists.

For a few minutes 1 could do nothing but laugh, but then running to
him with my hatchet, I struck several sham blows on his bundle, which
we opened carefully, and found within the landmrab perfectly dead.

"Well, this is an uglv rascal!" cried luck; "it" he hadn't been so

"This is a crab, a land-crab," said I, "of which there are many varieties,
and this, I think, is called a cocoa-nut crab, or at least it deserves the name,
for it is evidently very fond of eating these nuts, since it takes the trouble
to climb the trees for them; the difficulty of getting at the kernel, too, is
considerable. You showed no little presence of mind, Jack, when you
thought of ratching it in your jacket; in fact it might have been more than
a match for you otherwise, for some are most determined fighters, and are
Very swift too. Now let us take it, as well as the nuts, to the sledge, and
go on our way."

Progress became difficult, for we were constantly stopped in passing
through the wood, by'having to cut away the hanging honghs and creeping
plants which interlaced them. Ernest was behind, and by-'md-by called me
back to see what proved to be an important discovery; from the several
stalks of one of these creepers flowed clear cold water, and I recognised the
"liane rouge," which is known in America, and is so precious to the thirst.)- _

and days without being near a proper spring of water."

"But are you certain it is safe to drink this?" asked she.

I assured her it was so, and advised the boys to cut enough to quench
the thirst of the whole party, including,r our animals. This they did, only
finding it necessary, as with the sugar canes, to cut air holes above
the joints.

After struggling onward for a short time, we emerged from the thickets
into open ground, and saw the unlabash trees in the distance. As we drew
near, their curious appearance and singular fruit caused much surprise and
also amusement, for we were speedily established among the trees, where,
as I chose and cut down the gourds most likely to be useful, every one
engaged merrily in the work of cutting, carving, sawing, and scooping some
manner of dish, bowl, cup,_ jai, or platter, according to his several taste

 

 

 

 

 

 

We were to dine here, and after a time Fritz and Jack began to prepare
a fireplace, their great ambition being to heat the stones red hot, and cook
the crab in a hollow gourd. Their mother, therefore, left them to their own1 ()3 'l'// 11' S Y V15 S IO] R! If. Y 11' 0813-501"

woods. The wounded bustard had been completely forgotten, and from heat
and thirst was sull'cring greatly until her friendly care revived it, and it was
tied to a tree and allowed to more about, its fierce spirit greatly tamed
by adversity.

The cooking operations came to a stand soon after the fire was lighted,
for it appeared that we had no more water in the jars we had brought. so
the boys proposed to go in search of a sprinn'. I agreed to accompany
them; Ernest also wished to join us, and as our intention '11'as to examine
merely the surrounding wood, 1 saw no objection to leaving their mother
and Franz for a short time.

Very soon after our exploration hogan, Ernest, who was in front, turned
with :1 face of terror, shouting, "A wild hear! an immense wild boar, father I

iv munching and crunching this fruit at a great rate. I'ritz feared that it
might be the poisonous manehineel, against which I once warned them, but
on examining- ii, I was induced to pronounce a more favourable opinion.
and we collected a quantity in hopes that, if the monkey approved of it
as well as the old sow, we might be able to enjoy a feast ourselves.

All this time not a drop of water had we seen, and our own thirst
increasing, we felt eager to procure some before returning to our resting--
place.

Jack preceded us. and we made our way towards a high rock, which
rose above the thick 5, when he suddenly startled us by a loud cry of
"'.--\ crocodile! father! father! .-\ crocodile!"

"Nonsense, boy! A crocodile of all things, in this dry, parched forest,
where we can't get so much as a mouthful of water!"

On advancing to where Jack stood, I perceived that his mistake was
not so very silly after all, for I beheld an iguana, one of the largest of
the lizard species, and a truly immutable-looking fellow. I was glad to
assure .Jack that the strange creature he had found was perfectly harmless,
and that its flesh being esteemed a delicacy, it would he a valuable prize
to Carry back with us.

In another moment Fritz would have fired, but arresting his hand,
"Your shot," I said, "would probably only wound the animal, and being
extremely tenacious oi'lil'e, it would certainly escape us; we must gain
possession of the sleeping beauty by a gentler method."

"You are not going,r to kiss ii', are you, father?" asked Jack, with
a grin.

I tried to rebuke him for his irnpertinencc, but, failing, I commenced
operations. I first attached a cord and running-noose to a stout stick, and
holding a light switch in my other hand, I began to approach the creature
with soft, slow steps, while the boys looked on with the utmost curiosi

Presently I began very softly to whistle a sweet, yet very lively air,
which I continued more and more distinctly as I drew near the lizard;
until, awaiting, it seemed to listen with pleasure "raising its head as though
better to catch the sounds, or to discover whence they came.

When near enough, I began gently to stroke and tickle him with the
wand, continuing to whistle the prettiest tunes I could think of; and the
lizard gave signs of pleasurable contentment, stretching his limbs and moving
his tail in token of enjoyment.

Suddenly, availing,r myself of a movement of his head, I cast the noose
over it, drew the cord tight, and placing my foot on the body, I was about
to kill it by piercing the nostril--almost the only vulnerable part in this
singular reptile--when Jack received such a slap from its tail, which it was
furiously driving in all directions, as sent him rolling over like a nine-pin.
At the same time he opened his jaws, when the boys took fright at the
row of sharp teeth, and thinking that: the sooner he was dead the better,

were for battering him with sticks; but I assuring them my method would
kill him more quickly and without pain, thrust my rod into his nostril, on
which the blood flowed and the lizard soon expired.

The boys secured to think me as wonderful :1 person as a 52 kc--

cliarmer, and the success of ' y stratagem, as well as of the means by
which the lizard was slain, led forth great. admiration, Since they never
had heard of the animal, nor of the method of capturing it so commonly
prac ed in the West Indies. _
Now came the question of how we were to carry this unwieldy burden.
J had a great dislike to killing any creature and leaving it useless behind
me; 50, Without more ado, l fairly took it on my back, and marched off
with it.

As we came towards the Calabash \\'ood, we could hear the voices of
the deserted mother and child calling us in anxious tones; for indeed our
protracted absence alarmed them. We shouted joyously in reply, and our
appearance, as we issued from the woods, afforded them welcome relief from
their fears, although the dreadful creature on in): back startled them not
a little. '

There was so much to tell, so much to be seen, that for a time hunger
and thirst were forgotten; and no one thought even of the water we had
vainly gone in search of, until Master Knips, having slyly possessed him<<
self of seine of our new-found apples, was discovered munching away and
enjoying them amazingly--which instantly gave the boys :1 strong wish to
eat some also ; and as the bastard likewise peaked at them without hesitation,
I felt sure there could be no danger; and on tasting them, I concluded it
was the fruit of the guava, a \Vest Indian plant, w .(:h we were delighted
to have.

Although retreshing, this fruit rather sharpened than appeased our appetites,
and we were glad to cat the provisions we had brought from home, with--
out waiting to cook anything, as we had originally intended.

It was, in fact, high time to more homcwards, and we thought it best
not to encumber ourselves with the sledge and the greater part of its load,
but to leave it until the next day. The ass was laden with the iguana and
the bastard; and little Franz, tired as he was, looked in vain for a spare
seat on its back.

Our road heme lay through a majestic forest of oak trees, beneath
which lay numbcrlcss acorns, some of which we gathered as we went along;
and at length, before night closed in, we all reached Falconhurst in safety.

When supper was ready, we were thankful to recruit our exhausted
stre 4.11 by eating heartily 01' a piece of broiled iguana, with potatoes and
roast acorns, which tasted like excellent chestnuts.FALCON] | I <<51' :\l'i.-\lr\'.

ill? first thing to he done on the following day was to return to the
Caiahash Wood, to fetch the sledge with the dishes, bowls, and baskets
we had made.

Fritz alone accmnpanied me. I desired the other boys to remain with
their mother, intending to explore beyond the chain of rocky hills, and
thinking a large party undesirable on the occasion.

Passing through the wood. of evergreen oaks, we observed om sow
feasting on the acorns, eiidentl) not a \\ hit the worse. for the tright we had
.r'iven her the p)"(':\l0ll$ day in fact, she appeared more friendlx disposed
towards us than usual, possibl} coilsidering us as her deli\eiers trom the
jaws oi" the savage dogs.

Many birds tenanted this grove, and were undisturbed by our move-
ments, until lfritz tired and shot a beautiful blue jay, and a couple of par-
roquets, one a brilliant scarlet, the other green and gold.

Fritz was in the act of res--loading his. gun, when an unaccountable noise
struck our ears, and put us instantly on the alert, because it appeared like
the dull thumping sound of a muillcd drum, and reminded us of the possible
presence of savages.

With the greatest caution we drew nearer the sound, concealing our-
selves among the low bushes and thick grass and creepers, until we reached
an open gladc; where, standing on an old prostrate log, was a beautiful
bird, about the size ofa cock, ofa rich chestnut-brown colour, liner mottled
with dark brown and grey. 0n the shoulders were curious tufts of velvety
hlack leathers, glossed with green. lie was rulllinlgv his wings, erecting his
tail and neck feathers, strutting and 'w'heelin's:r about in a most strange and
Stately fashion. After manteuvring for some time in this manner, greatly to
the editimtion of a party of birds resembling him but without any ruff, who.
assembled round the stump, were enjoying his performances, be spread onL
his tail like a fan, stiffened his wings, and began to strike with them in
short, rapid heats, taster and faster, until a rumbling sound like very distant
thunder was produced, and the whirring wings enveloped him as in a cloud.
This was the drumming noise which had alarmed us, increased, as I imagine,

the wing strokes fallino at times on the deczu ed and hollow stump on
which the curious pantomime was acted.106 THE SIVISS 1711171114 V lr'U/I/'1\'.S'(A-\-'.

I was watching it with the. utmost interest, when a shot from behind
me was fired, and in a moment the play was at an end; my over--hasty sun
had changed the pretty comedy into a sad and needless tragedy. The
enthusiastic drummer r'oll dead from his perch, and the crowd of admiring
companions lled in dismay.

The cruel interruption of a scene so rare and remarkable annoyed me
evtremely, and l blamed Fritz for tiring without my leave. l felt sure the
bird was the i'iifi'cd grouse, and avery tine specimen. We placed it on the
ass, which was patiently awaiting our return, and went. on our way.

The sledge was quite sate where we had left it; it was early in the
day, and I resolved to explore, as I had intended, the line oi'clill' and rocky
hills, which, at more or less distance from the sea-shore, extended the whole
length of coast known or visible to us.

I desired to discover an opening, if any existed, by which to penetrate
the interior or' the country, or to ascertain positively that we were walled
in and isolated on this portion of the coast.

Leaving Calabash Wood behind us, we advanced over ground covered
with manioc, potatoes, and many plants unknown to as; pleasant streamlets
watered the fruitful soil, and the view on all sides x'as open and agreeable.

Some bushes attracted my notice, loaded with small white berries, of
peculiar appearance like wax, and vet sticky when plucked. I recognised
in this a plant called by botanists Jinan r.' rfzrm, and with much pleasure
explained to Fritz that, by melting and straining these berries, we might
easily succeed in making candles, and afford very great satisfaction to the
mother, who did not at all approve ol' ha ring to lay her work aside and
retire to rest the moment the sun set. The greenish wax to he obtained
would be more brittle than bees' wax, but it would burn very fairly, and-
dill'use an agreeable perfume. Having the ass with us, we lost no time in
gathering berries enough to fill one 01" the large canvas bags he carried, and
we then continued our route.

Very soon we met with another natural curiosity, the curious appearance
(if which surprised us much. This was the abode, under one root, of a whole
colony of birds, about the size of yeltowhammei's, but of plain brown
plumage. T he nests were built in a mass round the stem and among the
branches of a tree standing.r alone, and a kind of roof Formed ot'grass, strax's,
and fibres covered them all, and sheltered the community from rain and the
heat of the sun. There were numbers of openings into the irregular sides
of the group of dwellings, the nests resembling,r different apartments in a
house common to all ; twigs and small branches emerged here and there iron:
the walls, and served as perches for the young birds, and restingvplaces and
posts of observation for all. The general appearance of the establishment
reminded us of a huge bath-sponge. The feathered inhabitants swarmed in
and out by thousands, and we saw among them many beautiful little parrots,

who seemed in many instances to contest possession of the nest with the
lawful owners.Iv'A LC'OA'IIL'JI'S] A GA IA". [0;

numbers of the captire's relations, who darted from the other holes and new
round the robber, screeching and pecking at him in a rage.

Fritz's prize was not one ol' the real owners ol' the nests, \\'lllt'll were
those of the soein'nle grosbeak, but a very pretty small green parrot, with
which he was greatly pleased, and which he at once determined to tame
and teach to speak; for the present, it was carefully remanded to prison in
his pocket.

This curious colony of birds afibrdeil us matter for mjinrirrsation as we
went, on our way; their cheerful sociable habits, and the instinct which
prompted them to unite in labour for the connnon good, appearing most
wonderful to us.

"Examples of the kind, however," said I, "are numerous, in various
classes of animals. Beavers, for instance, build and live together in a very
remarkable way. Among insects, bees, wasps, and ants are well known as
social architects; in like manner, the coral insect works wonders beneath the
ocean waves, by force of perseverance and united effort."

" l have often watched ants at work," said Fritz; "it is most amusing to
see how they carry on the various works and duties of their commonwealth."ms THE SI'VISS FA dill. Y ROB/JKS'OJV.

"Have you ever noticed how much trouble they take with the eggs?"
enquired I, to see how far he understood the process, "carrying them about
in the warmth of the sun until they are hatched?" '

"Ah! that is rather the chrysalis of the nntworm, or larva which is
produced from an egg. .1. know they are called ants' eggs, but, strictly
speaking, that is incorrect."

"You are perfectly right, my boy. "'0", it you have taken so much
interest in watching the little ants oi" your native country, how delighted
and astonished you would hr: to see the wonders performed by the vast
[rites of large ants in lbrcig'n lands.

"Some ot these build heaps or nests, four or sa'\ feet high and propor-
tionately broad, which are so strong and firm that they defy equally sun--
shine and rain. The; are. within, divided into regular streets, galleries, vaults,
and nurseries. So firmly are these mounds built that, with interior alterations,
a deserted one might be used for a baking-oven.

"The ant, although respected since the days of King Folomon as a
model of industry, is not in itself an attractive insect.

"It exudes a sticky moisture, its smell is unpleasant, and it destroys:
and devours whatever catable comes in its w: '. Although in our own
country it does little harm, the large ants of foreign lands are most destruc--
tive and troublesome; it being very dillicult to check their depredatirms.
Fortunately they hay enemies by whose exertions their numbers are kept
down; birds, otheri cts, and even four--footed beasts prey upon them.
Chief among the latter the Ant-bear, or Tamanoir, of South America, a
larg> creature six or seven feet in length, covered with long coarse hair,
drooping like a heavy phnne over the hind quarters. The head is wonder-
fully elongated and very narrow; it is destitute of teeth, and the tongue
resembles somewhat a great red earth-worm. It has immensely strong curved
claws, with which it tears and breaks down and scratches to pieces the hard
walls oi" the ant~heaps; then, protruding its sticky tongue, it coils and twis
it about among the terrified millions disturbed by its attack; they adhere
to this horrible invader, and are drawn irresistibly backwards into the hungry
toothless jaws awaiting them.

"The little Ant-eater is not more than about t\\'ent_\_'-one inches in length,
has a shorter and more natural looking head, and fine silky far. It usually
lives in trees."

l was pleased to find my memory served me so well on this subject,
as it interested my boy amazingly; and occupied us for a considerable time
while we travelled onwards.

Arriving presently at a grove of tall trees, with very strong, broad, thick
leaves, we paused to examine them; they bore a round fig-like fruit, full of
little seeds and of a sour harsh taste.

Fritz saw some gummy resin exuding from cracks in the bark, and it
reminded him of the boyish delight attorded by collecting gum from cherry-
trccs at home, so that he must: needs stop to scrape oil" as much as he/"/f /.C.'0.~\-'HU11'S7' A (".4 11V. :0!)

could. lie rejoined me presently, attempting to soften what he had collected
in his hands; but finding it would not work like gum, he was about to fling-
it away, when he suddenly found that he could stretch it, and that it sprang
hack to its original size.

"Oh, father, only look! this gem is quite elastic! Can it possibly be
indiarubber ?"

"\Vhat?" cried I; " let me see it! a valuable discovery that would he,
indeed: and I do believe you are perfectly right!"

"\Vhy would it he so very valuable, father?" enquired Fritz. "l have
only seen it used for rubbing out pencil 111arks."

"Indiarubber," Ireplied, "or, more properly, caoutchouc, is :1 millu
resinous juice which flow from certain trees in considerable quantities \\hci1
the stem is purposely tapped. These trees are indigenous to the South
American countries of Brazil, Guiana, and Cayenne. The natives, who first
obtained it, used to form bottles l)\ smearing earthen flasks with repeated
coatings of the gum when just fresh from the t1ees; and when hardened
and stiffieiently thick, they broke the mould, shook out the f1a-unents, and
hung the bottles in the smoke, "hen they became [inner and 01 a dark
colour. While moist, the savages were in the habit of drawing rude figures

observed, for the bottles, obtained {10:11 the natix es by the Spaniards and
Portuguese, have for years been brought to Luiope, and cut into poilious to

delighted to have it here, as we shall, 1 hope, be able to make it into
difl'ercnt forms; first and foremost, 1 shall try to manufacture boots and
shoes."

Soon after xriaking this discovery, we reached the cocoa-nut wood, and
saw the bay extending before us, and the great promontory we called Cape
Disappointment, which hitherto had alvays bounded our excursions.

In passing through the wood, I remarked a smaller sort of palm, which,
among its grand companions, I had not previously noticed. One of these
had been broken by the wind, and I saw that the. pith had a peculiar mealy
appearance, and I felt convinced that this was the world-renowned sage-palm.

In the pith I saw some lat worms or 111aggots, and suddenly reeollectcd
that I had heard of them before :15 feeding on the sago, and that in the
West Indies they are eaten as a delicacy.

I felt inclined to try what they tasted like; so at once kindling a lire,
and placing some half-dozen, sprinkled with salt, on a little wooden spit, I
set them to roast. _

Very soon rich fat began to drop from them, and they smelt So tempt-

putting one like a pat of butter on a baked potato, I l)oldl_, s11alloned it,

Being once more ready to start, we found so dense a thicket in the
direct route that we turned aside without attempting to penetrate it, and
made our way towards the sugar brake near Cape Disappointment. This we
could not pass without cutting a handsome bundle of sugar-canes, and the
donkey carried that, in addition to the bag of wax berries.

In time we reached the sledge in Calabash Wood: the ass was unloaded,
everything placed on the sledge, and our patient beast began calmly and
readily to drag the burden he had hitherto borne on his back.

No further adventure betel us, and we arrived in the evening at Falcon-
lmrSL, where our welcome \'as as warm as usual--all we had to tell listened
to with the greatest interest, all we had to show most eagerly examined,
the pretty green parroquet enchanting the boys most particularly.

An excellent supper \'as ready for us, and with thankful hearts we
enjoyed it together; then, ascending to our tree-castle, and drawing,r up the
ladder after us, we betook ourselves to the repose well earned and greatly
needed after this fatiguing day.

The idea of candleunaking seemed to have taken the lancy of all the
boys; and next morning they woke, one alter the other, with the word
candle on their lips. When they. were thoroughly roused they continued to
talk candles; all breakfast-time, candles were the subject of conversation;
and after breakfast they would hear of nothing else but setting to work at
once and making candles.

"So be it," said I; " let us become Chandlers."

I spoke confidently, but, to tell the truth, I had in my own mind cer-
tain misgivings as to the result ofour experiment. In the first place, I knew
that we lacked a very important ingredient animal fat, which is necessary
to make candles burn for any length of time with brilliancy. Besides this,
I father doubted how far my memory would recall the various operations
necessary in the manufacture. Of all this, however, Isaid nothing; and the
boys, under my direction, were soon at work. We first picked ofi'thc berries
and threw them into a large shallow iron vessel placed on the lire. The
green sweet-scented wax was rapidly melted, rising to the surface of the
juice yielded by the berries. This we skimmed off and placed in a separate
pot by the tire, ready for use; repeating the operation several times, until
we had collected sufficient liquid wax [or our purpose. l then took the
wicks my wife had prepared, and dipped them one after the other into the
wax, handing them as I did so to Fritz, who hung them up on a bush to
dry. The coating they thus obtained was not very thick; but, by repeating
the operation several times, they at length assumed very fair proportions,
and became real sturdy candles. Our wax being at an end, we hung these
in a cool shady place to harden; and that same night we sat up like civilized
beings three whole hours after sunset, and Falconhurst was for the first time
brilliantly illuminated.

We were all delighted with the success of our experiment.

"You are indeed clever," said my wife; "J only wish that with yourlv'A l.(.'0;'\-"/l/.-"/K'e"l A GA IN: I l 1

ingenuity you would Show me how to make butter. Day after day I have
the annoyance of seeing a large supply of good cream go bad under my
very eyes, simply because i have no use to which to put it. Invent :1 plan,
please do." .

".1 think that perhaps 1 can help you," 1 replied alter a little con-
sideration; "not that ] can claim the honour of the invention of my plan,
that is due to the Hottcnrots. I will see what i can do. Jack, bring me
one of" our gourd bottles."

1 took the gourd, one of those I had previously prepared, with a small
hole at one end and well hollowed out and cleaned; this I partially filled
with cremn and then corked up the hole tightly.

"Mere, boys," said 1, "you
can continue the operation, while
I turn carpenter and make a cart
to take the place of our sledge."

I gave them their directions,
and then set about my own work.
They fixed {our posts in the
ground, and to them fastened tl
square piece of sailcloth bv {our
cords attached to the corn

In this cradle they placed
the gourd of cream, and each
taking a side, rolled it backwards
and forwards continuously for half
an hour.

"New," I cried, looking up
from my work, "open the gourd
and take the contents to your
mother, with my compliments."

They did so; and my good
wife's eyes were delighted with
the sight ofa large lump of capital
fresh butter.

With my sons' assistance the
cart was in timc.complcted; a
clumsy vehicle it was, but strong
enough for any purpose to which
we might put it, and, as it proved,
of immense use to us in collecting
the harvest.

We then turned our attention
to our fruit-trees, which we had
planted in a plot ready for trans-
plantinor, The walnut, cherry, and

chestnut trees we arranged in parallel rows so as to form a shady avenue from
Falconhurst to Family Bridge; and between them we laid down a tolerable
road, that we might have no dilliculty in reaching Tentholm, be the weather
had as it might. We planted the vines round the arched roots of our great
mangrove, and the rest of the trees in suitable spots; some near Falcon-
hurst, and others away over Jackal River, to adorn Tentholm. 'l'enthohn
had been the subject of serious thoughts to me for some time past, and I
now turned all my attention thither. It was not my ambition to make it
beautiful, but; to form of it a safe place of refuge in a case of emergency.
My lirst Care, therefore, was to plant a thick prickly hedge, Capable of pro-
tecting us from any wild animal, and forming a tolerable obstacle to the
attack of even savages. should they appear. Not satisfied with this, however,
we fortified the bridge, and on a couple of hillooks mounted two guns which
we brought from the wreck, and with whose angry mouths we might bark
defiance at any enemy, man or beast.

Six weeks . 'ppcd away while we were thus busily occupied, six weeks
of hard yet pleasant labour. "'0 greeted each Sunday and its accompanying
rest most gratefully, and on that day always especially thanked God for our
continued health and safety. I soon saw that this hard work was developing
in the boys remarkable strength, and this 1 encouraged by making them
practise running, leaping, climbing, and swimming; ,l. also saw, however, that.
it was having a less satisfactory elk-act upon their clothes, which. though a
short time before remarkably neat, were now, in spite of the busy mother's
mending and patching, most untidy and disreputable. 1 determined, there--
fore, to pay another visit to the wreck, to replenish our wardrobe and to
see how much longer the-vessel was likely to hold together. Three of the
boys and I went oil' in the pinnace. The old ship seemed in much the
same condition as when we had left her, a few more planks had gone, but
that was all.

"Come, boys," cried I, "not an article of the slightest value must be
left on board; rummage her out to the very bottom of her hold."

They took me at my word: sailors' chests, bales of cloth and linen, a
couple of small guns, ball and shot, tables, benches, window shutters, bolts
and locks, barrels of pitch, all were soon in a heap on the (leek. We loaded
the pinnacc and went on shore. We soon returned with our tub-boat in
tow, and after a few more trips nothingr was left on board.

."Onc more trip," said I to my with, before we started again, " and there
will be the end of the brave ship which carried us from Switzerland. I have
left two barrels of gunpowder on board, and mean to blow her up."

Before we lighted the fusee, I discovered a large copper cauldron which
I thought I might save. I made fast to it a couple of empty (tasks, that.
when the ship went up it might float. The barrels were placed, the train
lighted, and we returned on shore.

The supper was laid outside the tent, at a spot from whence we might
obtain a good View or" the wreck. Darkness came on. Suddenly a vivid14)} 1. (70'1fo UA'SI ' A CA 12V. 1 i3

pillar of tire rose from the black waters, at sullen rear boomed across the
sea, and we knew that our good old ship was no more.

We had planned the.(l(:struction ot' the vessel, we knew that it was for
the best; and yet that night we went to bed with a feelingr of sadness in
our hearts, as though we had lost a dear old friend.

Next morning all our sadness was dispelled, and it was with pleasure
that we saw the shore lined with a rich store of planks and beams, the
remnants of the wreck. I soon found, too, the copper cauldron, which was
successfully floated by the c: ks; this I got on shore, and hauling it up
among the rocks, stored under it the powder casks we had landed the day
before. Collecting all these valuables gave us some little trouble, and while
we were thus engaged my wife brought us good now: She harl'discovered
that two ducks and a goose had each reared a large family among the reeds
by the river; and they presently appeared waddling past us, apparently
vastly well--pleased with their performance. We greeted them joyfully.

"Hurrah!" cried Ernest, "we'll be able to afford duck and green peas
some day soon, and imagine we're once more civilized mortals."

The sight of these birds reminded me of our family at Falconhnrst, and
I announced my intention of paying them a visit.

Every one was delighted, and every one would come with me. As we
approached Falconhnrst I noticed that several young trees in our avenue
were considerably bent by the wind, and this resolved me to make an ex-
pedition next day to cut bamboos for their support. .-\s Fritz was the only
one besides myself who had Visited Cape Disappointment and the surrounding
country, my wife and the younger boys begged hard to be allowed to
accompany me. I consented; and next morning we started, bringingr with
us the cart, drawn by the cow and ass, and laden with everything necessary
for an expedition of several days--a tent, provisions, :1 large supply of
ammunition, and all sorts of implements and utensils; for I intended to make
a great collection of fruits and the produce ol'rlillerent trees. It was a lowly
morning, and passing gaily through the plantations of" potatoes, maniac, and
cassavas, wc Came to the nests of the sociable grosbcak, the sight of which
charmed the children immensely.

We reached the wax trees, and there I called a halt, for I wished to
gather a sack or two of the berries that we might renew our stock of Candles.
The berries were soon plucked; and I stored them away amongst the bushes,
marking the spot that we might find them on our return.

"Now for the caoutchonc tree," said I; "now for waterproof boots and
leggings to keep your feet dry, Ernest." To the caoutchouc tl'cc we Llll'CC-U--'(l
our steps, and were soon busily engaged in stabbing the bark and placing
vessels beneath to catch the sap. We again moved lbrward; and, crossing:
the palm wood, entered upon a delightful plain bounded on one side by an
extensive field of waving sugar-cane, on the other by a thicket of bamboos
and lovely palms, while in front stretched the shining sea, calm and
noiseless.ll.[ Til/1' 5117.55 Elli/I'll V A'OBIA'SOA".

"How beautiful!" exclaimed Jack, "let us
pitch our tent here and stay here always instead
of living at Falcouhurst. it would he jolly."

"Very likely," replied I, "and so would be
the attacks of wild beasts; imagine a great tiger
lying in wait in the thicket yonder, and pouncing
out on us at night. No, no, thank you, I much
prefer our nest in the tree, or our impregnalfle
position at Tentholm. We must make this our
headquarters for the present, however; for,
though perhaps dangerous, iL is the most convenient
spot we shall find. Call a halt and pitch the
tent."

Our beasts were quickly unyoked, the tent
arranged, a. large firc lit, supper prepared, and
we dispersed in various directions, some to cm
bamboos, and some to collch sugar-cane. We
then returned ; and, as supper was still not quite
ready and the boys were hungry, they decided
to obtain some cocoa-nuts. This time, however,
no assistance was to be had from either monkeysI'L/IIICOA'IIIJ'IWS'Z' A (7A Irv. 1 i3
or illiltli'l'flbb', and they gazed up with longing eyes at the fruit nhovc
them.

"We can climb," said Fritz, "up with you, boys."

Jack and he each rushed at one of the smooth slippery trunks; right
vigorously they struggled upwards, but to no purpose, before they had
accomplished one quarter of the distance they found themselves slipping
rapidly to the ground.

"Here, you young athletes," cried I, "I foresaw this difliculty, and have
provided for it." So saying I hold up buskins of shark's skin which 1 had
previously prepared, and which I now bound on to their legs. Thus equipped
they again attempted the ascent, and with a loop of rope passed round their
body and the trunk of the tree, quickly reached the summit. My wife
joined me, and together we watched the boys as they aSCended tree after
tree, throwing down the best fruit from each.

They then returned, and jestingly begged Ernest to produce the result
of his labour. The professor had been lyint,r on the grass gazing at the
palms; but, on this sarcastic remark, he sprangr to his feet. ""'illinglyg"
he exclaimed, and seizing a pair of buskins he quickly donned them. "(live
me a cocoa-nut shell," said he. I gave him one, and he put it in his pocket.
He ran to a tree, and, with an agility which surprised us all, quickly reached
the top. No sooner had he done so than Fritz and Jack burst into a roar
of laughter. He had swarmed a. tree which bore no nuts. Ernest apparently
heard them; for, as it seemed in a fit oi'ang'er, he drew his knife and severed
the leafy crest, which fell to the ground. I glanced up at him, surprised at
such a display of temper. But a bright smile greeted me, and in a merry
tone he shouted:

"Jack, pick that paint-cabbage up and take it to father; that is only
half my contribution, and it is worth all your nuts put together."

He spoke truly: the cabbage palm is rare, and the tuft of leaves at its
summit is greatly prized by the South Americans for its great delicacy and
highly nutritive qualities. V

"Bravo!" 1 cried, "you have retrieved your character; come down and
receive the thanks of the company. What are you waiting up there for?"

"I am coming presently," he replied, " with the second half of my con-
tribution; I hope it will be as fully appreciated as the first."

In a short time he slipped down the tree, and, advancing to his mother,
presented her with the nutshell he had taken up with him.

"Here," he said, "is a wine which the greatest connoisseur would prize.
Taste it, mother."

The Shell was filled with a clear rosy liquor, bright and sparkling. My
wife tasted it. "Excellent, excellent," she exclaimed. "Your very good
health, my dear boy!"

We drank the rosy wine in tum, and Ernest received hearty thanks
from all.

It was getting late, and while we were enjoying our supper before our11.6 77/13 SII'JSS 1'21 .flz'll. 'l' 11'()/J'I.-'\I'.,\'O_=\-'.

Lent, our donkey, who had been quietly browsing,r near us, suddenly set up
a loud bray, and, without the least apparent cause, prickcd up his ears,
threw up his heels, and galloped off- into the thicket of baniboos. We
follow ed fox :1 short distance, and I sent the dogs in chase, but they returned
\1: -thout 0112 blend, and, as it \1 as late, 110 w erc obliged to abandon the chase

I was annoyed by this :ncidcnt, and oven alarmed; lor not only had
we lost the ass, but I knew not what had oc ioned his sudden flight. I
knew not whether he was aware, by instinct, of the approach of some fierce
wild beast. I said nothing of this to my family, but, making 11p an un-
usually large fire, I bade them sleep with their arms by their sides, and we
all lay down.

.\ bright morning awoke as early, and I rose and looked out, thinking
that perhaps our poor donkey might have been attracted by the light of
the tires, and have returned. Alas, not a sign of him was to be seen. As
we could not afibrd to lose so valuable a beast, I determined to leave no
attempt untried to regain him. We hurriedly breaki'asted, and, asl required
the dogs to assist me in the search, I left my elder sons to protect their
mother, and bade Jack get ready for a day's march. This arrangement
delighted him, and we quickly set out.

For an hour or more we trudged onwards, directed by the print of the
ass's hoofs. Sometimes we lost the track for a while, and then again dis-
covered it as we reached softer soil. Finally this guide failed us altogether,
for the donkey seemed to hare joined in with a herd of some larger animals,
with whose hoof-prints his bad mingled. I now almost turned back in
despair, but Jack urged me to continue the search: "For," said he, "if we
once get upon a hill we shall see such a large herd as this must be at
almost any distance. Do let us go on, father."

I consented, and we again pushed forwards, through bushes, and over
torrents, sometimes cutting our way with an axe, and sometimes plunging
knee-deep through a swamp. We at length reached the border or" a wide
plain, and on it, in the distance, I could see a herd of animals, browsing
on the rich grass. It struck me that it might be the very herd to which
our good donkey had joined himself; and, wishing to ascertain whether this
was so, I resolved to make a detour through a bamboo marsh, and get as
near as possible to the animals withoutdisturbing them. The bamboos were
huge, many of them 0161 thirty feet in height; and, as we made our way
tluough them, I 1e111embered an account of the giant cane of South America,
which is greatl1'p1ized by the Indians an account of its exticmc uselulness;
the reeds themselves make masts for their canoes, while each joint will lorm
a cask or box. I was delighted, for I had little doubt that the bamboos
we were among were of the same species. I explained this to Jack, and
as we discussed the possib'litv of cutting one down and earning a portion
of it home, we icached the boidei or the mar,sh and e1ne1ged upon the
plain. I' here we suddenly found ourselves face to face with the he1d which
we sought--a held of bul'fldoes. They looked up, and stared i11q11isiti1ely7711' 1134,50' .m'fz'l'f fire-'1! _221:'r':I/1.-'{l' M Mr :'x({',"" (y. 117).FA [ICON'IIC 71957 A CA IA". 1 I;

at us, but withou: moving. jack would have. fired, but I checked him.
"Back to the thicket," I said, "and keep back the dogs!"

We began to retreat, but before we were again under cover, the dogs
joined us; and, in spite of our shouts and efforts to restrain them, they
dashed ibrwm'd, and seized a buffalo calf. This was a signal to the whole
herd to attack us. They bellowed ioudly, pawed the ground, and tore it
up with their horns, and then dashed madly towards us. "1*, had not time
to step behind :1 rock before the leader was upon us. So close was he that
'00m to use my gun. l tired, however, and he tell dead at my
feet. H, 'all checked the advance of the rest. 'l'hey halted, snuffed the air,
turned tail and gallopcd ofi' across the plain. They were gone, but the
dogs still held gallantly to the cali'. 'l'hcy dragged and tusslcd with him,
but with their utmost ctl'brts could not bring him to the ground. How to
a _ at them without shooting the poor boast, I knew not; and this 'I was
unwilling to do, for I hoped that, it" we could but capture him alive, we
might in time manage to tame him, and use him as n. beast of burden.
Jack's Clever little head, however, suddenly devised :1 plan for their aid,
and with his usual promptitudo he at once put it into execution. Hc un-
wound the- lasso, which was coiled round his body, and, as the young hull
flung up his heels, he cast it and caught him h_\_' his hind legs. The noose
drew tight, and in a twinkling the beast was upon the ground. We fastened
the other end of the cord round a stout bamboo, called oh" the (logs, and
the animal was at our mercy.

"Now we have got him," said Jack, as he looked at the poor heast,
ing' panting on the ground, "' what. are we to do with him?"

"I will Show you," said I; "help inc to fasten his l'nrc-h:
and you shall see the next operation."

_ The hull, thus secured, could not more; and while Jack held his head
I drew my knife and pierced the cartilage of his nose, and when the blood
flowed less freely, passed a stout cord through the hole. I felt some repug-
nance at thus naming the animal, but it was a CitEt': nl'nercssity, and '1 could
not hesitate. We united the ends ol' the cord, tread the animal, set him
upon his legs, and, subdued and orcrawed, he followed us without resistance.
I now turned my attention to the dead buffalo, but as i could not then
skin it, .t contented myself with cutting off the most delicate parts, its
tongue, and a couple of'steaks, and, packingy them in salt in my wallet,
abandoned- the rest to the dogs. They fell upon it grecdily, and we retired
under the shade to enjoy a meal after our hard work. The dogs. however,
were not to have undisputed possession of the carcase; vultures, crows, and
other birds ol' prey, with that marvellous instinct which always leads them
to a dead body, quickly filled the air, and, with discordant cries, swooped
down upon the bufi'hlo. An amusing contest ensued; the dogs again and
again drove on" the intruders, and they, as often, returned reinforced by
others. who swarmed to the spot. Jack, with his usual iinpetuosity, wished
to send :1 shot in amongst the robber band, but I prevented him, for I knew

that the bird or two he might kill would he of no use to us, while his she:
would not drive away the rest even had we wished it. Both we and the
dogs were at length satisfied, and as it was getting late, 1 determined to
give up for the present the search for the ass, and to return to our camp.
We again made our way through the bamboos, but before we loll; the thicket
I cut down one of the smallest of the reeds, the largest of whose joints
would form capital little barrels, while those near the tapering top would
serve as moulds [or our next batch of candles.

T he buffalo, with a dog on either side and the rope through his nose,
was following us passively, and we presently induced him to submit to a
package of our goods laid upon his back. We pushed rapidly forward, Jack
eager to display our latest acquisition. As we repassed the rocky bod ol' a
stream we had crossed in the morning, Juno (lashed ahead, and was about
to rush into a cleft between the rocks, when the appearance of a large
jackal suddenly checked her further progress. Both dogs instantly llcw at
the animal, and though she fought desperately, quickly overpowered and
throttlod hcr. From the way the beast had shown fight, I concluded that
her young must be close by, probably within the very cleft June was about
to enter.

Directly Jack heard this, lie-wished to creep in and bring out the young
jaekals. l hesitated to allow him to do so, for I thought it possible that.
the male jaekal might he still lyingr in wait within the care. We peered
into the darkness, and after a while, Jack declared he could discern the
little yellow jacltals, and that he was quite sure the old one was not there.
He then crept in, followed closely by the dogs, and presently emerged
hearing in his arms '1 handsome cub of a beautiful golden yellow and about
the size of a small cat. He was the only one of the brood he had managed
to save, for Turk and juno, without pity for their youth or beauty, had
worried all the rest. I did not much regret this, however, for I firmly
believe that, had he saved them, Jack would have insisted upon bringing
up the whole litter. As it was I considered that one jackal was, with our
young hull, quite Sullicient an addition to our live stock.

During the halt we had made, I had fastened the buffalo to a small
tree, and as 1 now was again about to more on, I recognized it as the
dwarf-palm, whose long sharp leaves form an excellent barrier if it is planted
as a hedge. 1 determined to return and get some young plants to strengthen
our hedge at 'l'entliolm. It. was late belore we reached our camp, where
we found our family anxiously awaiting our return.

The sight of the new animals delighted the children immensely, and in
their opinion amply compensated for the loss of our poor donkey. Jack
had to answer a host 01" questions concerning their capture, and to give a
minute account of the afi'ray with the buffaloes. This he did, with graphic
power certainly, but with so much boasting and self-glorification, that I
was'ohlig'ed to check him, and give a plain and uni-"amishcd account of
the affair.1-24 I C'(_).-'\-'[1{'/\'.S'7' A 0.1/93. I l i)

Supper--time arrived, and as we sat at. that meal, [or which lack and I
were heartily thankful, m)- wile and her party proceeded to give an account
of their day's work. -

Emest had discovered a sago-palm, and had, alter much labour, eon--

a huge heap now stood before the tent sullieient to keep up a fire all the
rest of the time we should stay on the spot. Fritz had gone of? shooting
and had secured a good bag. While they had been thus variously employed

a troop of apes had visited the tent, and when they returned, they found

the place ransacked and turned upside down. The provisions were eaten
and gnawed, the potatoes thrown about, the milk drunk and spilt, every
box had been peeped into, every pot and pan had been divested of its lid,
the palisade round the hut had been partly destroyed, nothing had been
left untouched. Industriously had the boys worked to repair the damage,
and when we returned not a sign was to be seen of the disorder. No one
would have guessed what had occurred from the delicious supper we were

After matters had been again arranged Fritz had gone down to the
shore and, amongst the rocks at Cape Disappointment, had discovered ano 7'///:' Sir/SN ['15le Y RON/A'A'Ox'l".

young eaglet which Ernest declared to be a Malabar or lndian eagle; he
was much pleased with his discovery, and 1 recommended him to bring the
bird up and try to train it to hunt as a falcon.

" Look here though, boys," said I, "you are now collecting a good
many pets, andI am not going to have your mother troubled with the care
of them all; each must look after his own, and if I find one neglected;
whether beast or bird, I set it at liberty. Mark that and remember it ! "

My wife looked greatly relieved at this announcement, and the boys
promised to obey my directions. Before we retired for the night I prepared
the bullalo meat 1 had brought, l lit a large fire of green wood, and in the
smoke of this thoroughly dried both the tongue and steaks... W e then properly
secured all the animals, Jack took his little pet in his arms, and we lay
down and were soon fast asleep.

At daybreak We were on foot, and began to prepare for a return to
Falconhnrst.

" You are not going to despise my sago, I hope," said Ernest; " you
have no idea what a trouble it was to cut it down, and I have been thinking
too that if we could but split the tree, we might make a couple of long
useful troughs which might, I think, be made to carry water from Jackal's
River to Tentholm. Is my plan worth consider" tion .7"

" Indeed it is," I replied; "and at all events we mustnot abandon
such a valuable prize as a Sago-palm. I would put off our departure for a
da)', rather than leave it behind." .-

We went to the palm, and with the tools we had-with us attempted
to split the trunk. We first sawed oil' the upper; end, and then with an
axe and saw managed to insert a wedge. This accomplished, our task was
less difficult, for with a heavy mallet we forced the wedge in further and
further, until at length>> the trunk was split in twain. From one half of the
trunk we then removed the pith, disengaging it, with difficulty, from the
tough w'ood fibres; at each end, however, I left a portion of the pith un-
touched, thus forming a trough in which to work the Sago.

"New, boys," said I, when we had removed the .pith from the other
half of the trunk, "off with your coats and turn up your shirt-sleeves; I
am goingr to teach you to knead."

They were all delighted, and even little Franz begged to be allowed
to help. Ernest brought a couple of pitchers of water, and throwing it in
amongst the pith, we set to work right heartily. As the dough was formed
and properly kneaded, I handed it to the mother, who spread it out on a
cloth in the sun to dry. This new occupation kept us busy until the
evening, and when it was at length completed we loaded the cart with the
sago, a store of cocoa-nuts and our other possessions, that we might be ready
to start. early on the following morning. As the sun rose above the horizon,
we packed up our tent and set forth, a goodly caravan. I thought it unfair

They had not long been gone when I was alarmed by a most terrible
noise accompanied by the furious barking of the dog and shouts from Jack
and Ernest. Thin ing that the boys had been attacked by sortie wi'.d beast,
I ran to their assistance. A most ludicrous scene awaited me when .I
reached the Spot. They were dancing and shouting round and round a
grassy glade, and I as nearly as possible followed their example, for in the
centre, surrounded by a promising litter, lay our old sow, whose Squeals,
previously so alarming, were now subsiding into comfortable grunts of recog-
nition. I did not join my boys in their triuniphal dance, but I was never-
theless very much pleased at the sight of the flourishing iiunily, and iininc-.
diately returned to the cart to obtain biscuits and potatoes for the benefit
of the happy mother. Jack and Ernest meanwhile pushed further on, and
brought back the sack of candleberries and the-caoutchouc, and as we could
not then take the sow with us, we left her alone with her family and pro-
ceeded to Falconhnrst

The animals were delighted to see us back again, and l'k:('t:l\'0tl us with
manifestations of joy, but looked askance at the now pets. The angle
especially came in for shy glances, and promised to be no favourite. Fritz,
however, determined that his pet should at present do no harm, scoured
him by the leg to a root of the fig--tree and uncovered his eyes. In a
moment the aspect of the bird was changed; with his sight returned all his
savage instincts, he flapped his wings, raised his head, darted to the full
length of his chain, and, before any one could prevent him, seized thei2: ' 77/143 .S'II'ISS FAMILY [JO/FIA'SOA".

" Stop," said Ernest, "don't kill the poor creature, he is but {allowing

Fritz hesitated. "No, no," he said, "I don't want really to kill the
bird, but I can't give him up; tell me how to tame him, and you shall
have Muster Knips." _

"\'ery well," replied Ernest, " 1 will tell ynu my plan, and if it succeeds,

the trees, and digging deeply at their roots, drove in stout bamboo props,

"Papa," said Franz, as we were thus engaged, and he handed me tin:

"Oh, these are wild trees, most ferocious trees," laughed jack, "and

"That's not true," replied Franz, gravely, "but there are wild and
lame trees, the wild ones grow out in the woods like the crab-apples, and
the tame ones in the garden like the pears and peaches at home. Which
are these, papa?" _

"They are not wild," I replied, "but grafted or cultivated, or, as you
call them, tame trees. No European tree hears good fruit until it is g1 al'tcdl"
I saw a puzzled look come over the little boy's face as he. heard this new
word, and I hastened to explain it. "Chatting," I continued, "is the process
of inserting a. slip or twig of a tree into what is called an eye; that is, a
knot or hole in the branch of another. This twig or slip thou grows and
produces, not :such fruit as the original stock Would have borne, but such

"I am afraid we cannot even claim cherries as our own, not even the

"Do you think all these trees will grow 1'" asked Fritz, as we crossed
Jackal River and entered our plantation at 'l'entholni; "here are lemons,
pomegranates, pistachio nuts, and nullbcrries."

"I have little doubt of it," I replied, " we are evidently within the
tropics, where such trees as these are sure to llonrisb. These pines, now,
come from France, Spain, and Italy ; the olives from Armenia and Palestine ;
the figs originally from the island of Chios; the peaches and apricots from
Persia; plums from Damascus in Syria, and the pears of all sorts from
Greece. However, if our countries have not been blessed in the same wa1r
with fruit, we have been given wisdom and skill, which has enabled us to
import and cultivate the trees of other lands."

We thus talked and worked until every tree that required 1118 treat-
ment was provided with a stout bamboo prop, and then, with appetites
which a gounnaud might well have envied, we returned to Falconhurst. I
think the good mother was almost alarmed at the way we fell upon the
corned beef and palm-cabbage she set before us, but at length these good
things produced the desired effect, and one after another decla1ed himsell'

above us; I think that the nest itself is perfect, I really wish for nothingr
better, but I should like to be able to get to it without scaling that. dreadful
ladder every time; could you not make a flight of steps to reach it?"

I carefully thought over the project, and turned over every plan for
its accomplishment.

"It would be impossible, I am afraid," said I, " to make stairs outside,
but within the trunk it might be done. More than once have I thought
that this trunk might be hollow or partly so, and if such be the case our
task would be comparatively easy. Did you not tell me the other day that
you noticed bees coming from a hole in the tree-'5"

"Oh, yes," said little Franz, "and I want to look at them and one
flew right against my face and stung me, and l almost cried, but 1 didn't."

"Brave little boy," said 1. "Well, now, it" the trunk be sulliciently
hollow to contain a swarm of bees, it may be, for all we can tell, hollow the
greater part of its length, for like the willow in our own country it might
draw all its nourishment through the bark, and in spite ofits real unsoundness
retain a flourishing appearance."

Master jack, practical as usual, instantly sprang to his feet to put my
conjecture to the proof. The 1 st followed his example, and they were all
soon climbing about like squirrels, peeping into the hole, and tapping the
wood to discover by sound how far down the cavity extended.

They forgot, in their eagerness, who were the tenants of this interesting
trunk. They were Soon reminded of it, however, for the bees, disturbed by
this unusual noise, with an angry buzz burst out and in an instant attacked
the causers of' the annoyance; they swarmed round them, stung them on
the hands, face, and neck, settled in their hair, and pursued them as they
ran to me for assistance. It was with difficulty that we got rid of the
angry insects, and were able to attend to the boys. Jack, who had been
the first to reach the hole, had fared the worst and was soon a most piti-
able sight, his face swelled to an extraordinary degree, and it was only by
the Constant application of cold earth that the pain was alleviated. They
were all eager to continence an organized attack upon the bees at once, but
for an hour or more by reason of their pain they were unable to render
me much assistance. In the meanwhile I made my arrangements. 1 first
took a large calabash gourd, for I intended to make a beehive, that, when
we had driven the insects from their present abode, we might not lose them
entirely. The lower half" of the gourd I flattened, I then cut an arched
opening in the front for a doorway, made a straw roof as a protection from
the rain and heat, and the little house was complete.

Nothing more, however, could then be done, for the irritated bees were
still angrily buzzing round the tree. I waited till dark, and then when all
the bees again returned to their trunk, with Fritz's assistance I carefully
stopped up every hole in the tree with wet clay, that the bees might not
issue forth next morning before we could begin operations. Very early were126 THE SN'IXS FAA/1], l" .li'O/}/.-\-".S'0.\'.

we up and at work. I first took a hollow Tone, and inserted one end
through the clay into the tree; down this tube with pipe and tobacco l
smoked most furiously.

The humming and buzzing: that went on within was tremendous; the
bees evidently could not understand what was going to happen. I finished
my first pipeful, and putting my thumb over the end of the cane I gave
the pipe to .liritZ to relill. He did so and I again smoked. The buzzing
was now becoming less noisy, and was subsiding into a mere murmur. By
the time I had finished this second pipe all was still; the bees were
stupefied.

"Now then, Fritz," said I, " quick with a hammer and chisel, and stand
here beside me."

He was up in a moment, and, together, we cut a small door by the
side of the hole; this door, however, we did not take out, but we left it:
attached by one corner that it. might be removed at a moment's notice ; then,
giving the bees a final dose of tobacco smoke, we opened it.

Carefully but rapidly we removed the insects, as they clung in clusters
to the sides of the tree, and placed them in the hive prepared for their
reception. .\s rapidly I then tool; every atom of wax and honey from their
store house, and put it in a cask I had made ready for the purpose.

The bees were now safely removed from the trunk, but I could not
tell whether, when they revived from their temporary stupor, they might
not refuse to occupy the house with which I had presented them, and insist
on returning to their old quarters. To prevent the possibility of this occur-
rence l tool>>; a quantity of tobacco, and, placing it upon :1 board nailed
horizontally within the trunk, I lighted. it and allowed it to burn slowly
that the fumes might fill the cavity. It was well I did so, for, as the bees
returned to consciousness, they left their pretty hive and buzzed away to
the trunk of the tree. They seemed astonished at finding this uninhabitable,
and an immense deal of noisy humming ensued. Round and round they
flew, backwards and lbrvards between the gourd and tree, now settling here
and now there, until, at length, after due consideration, they took possession
of the hive and abandoned tleir former habitation to us, the invaders of
their territory. By the evening they were quite quiet, and we ventured to
open the cask in which we had stored our plunder. We first separated the
honey from the honeycomb and poured it oil" into jars and pots; the rest
we then tool: and threw into a vessel of water placed over a slow fire. It
soon boiled and the entire mass became fluid. This we placed in a clean
canvas bag, and subjected to a heavv pressure. The honey was thus soon
forced out, and we stored it in a e' and, though not perhaps quite equal
to the former batch in quality, it was yet capital. The wax that remained
in the bag I also carefully stored, for I knew it would be of great use to
me in the manufacture of candles. Then after a hard day's work we
_turued in.

The internal architecture of the tree had now to be attended to, and771/5 /1'.'i/1\"1' Ski/501': 12;

beside the remaining puppies, and, to his joy, found it readily adopted.128 '/'///r.' Sill/INS /~'/i'.-'.'UPS Y ROBIA'SOEV.

The other pots were also flourishing, and were being usefully trained. The
hullalo, after giving us much trouble, had now become perfectly domesticated,
and was a very useful beast of burden, besides being a capital steed for the
boys. 'l'hey guided him by a bar thrust through the hole in his nose, which
was now perfectly healed, and this served the purpose "just as a bit in the
mouth of a horse. I began his education by securing round him a broad
girth ol'buffalo--hide and hastening to it various articles, to accustom him to
carrying a burden. Hy degrees he permitted this to be done without making
the slightest re Stance, and soon carried the panniers, before borne by the
ass, readily and wilhzr ly.

I then made Master Knips sit upon his back and hold the reins I had
prepared for him, that the animal might become accustomed to the feeling
of a rider, and finally allowed Fritz himself to mount. The education of
the eagle was not neglected. I'ritz every day shot small birds [or his food,
and these he placed sometimes between the wide--spreading horns of the
buffalo or goat, and. sometimes upon the hack of the great bastard, that he
might become ace stomed to pounce upon living prey. These lessons had
their due client, and the bird, having been taught to obey the voice and
whistle oi" his master, he was soon allowed to bring down small birds upon
the wing, when he swooped and' struck his quart in most sportsmanlike
manner. \Ve kept him well away from the poultry--yard, lest his natural
instincts should show themselves, and he should put an untimely end to
some of our feathered pets.

Neither was Master Knips allowed to remain idle, for Ernest, new that
he was in his possession, wished to train him to he of some use. ""ith
Jack's help he made a little basket of rushes, which he so arranged with
straps that it might be easily fitted on to the monkey's buck. Thus equipped,
he was taught to mount cocoa--nut palms and other ":rll'ty trees, and to bring
down their fruit in the hamper.

Jack was not so successful in his educational attempts. Fangs, as he
had christened his jackal, used his fangs indeed, but only on his own account;
nothing could persuade him that the animals he caught were not at once
to be devoured, consequently poor Jack was never able to save from his
jaws anything but the tattered skin of his prey. Not disheartened, however,
be determined that Fangs could be trained, and that he would train him.

These and such like etnplovments afforded us the rest and recreation
we required while engaged in the laborious task of stair se building.

Among my minor occupations, I applied myself to no improvement 01"
our candles. Though the former batch had greatly delighted us at first, yet
we were soon obliged to acknowledge. that the light they gave was imper-
fect, and their appearance was unsightly; my wife, too, begged me to find
some substitute for the threads of our cotton necletics, which I had previ-
ously used as wicks. To give the proper shape and smoothness to the
candles, I determined to use. the bamboo moulds l had prepared. My iirst
lllL'Zl was to pour the wax in a': the end of the mould, and then when the7YIE RALVY SEASOA-K 129

candles were cooled to slip them out; but I was soon convinced that this
plan would not succeed. I therefore determined to divide the moulds length-
ways, and then, having greased them well, we might pour the melted wax
into the two halves bound tightly together, and so be able to take out the
candles when cool without i it 'ng them. The wieks were my next diiheulty,
and as the mother positively refused to allow us to devote our tics and

the proof.

On a large tire we placed a pot, in which we prepared our wax mixture
--half bees' wax and half wax from the candleherries. The moulds care--
fully prepared--hall" with karata fibre, and half with wooden splint wicks---
stood on their ends in a tub of cold water, ready to receive the w x. They
were filled; the wax cooled; the candles taken out and Sahiected to the
criticism of all hands. When night drew on, they were formally tested.
The decision was unanimous: neither gave such a good light as those with
the cotton wicks; but even my wife declared that the light from mine was
far preferable to that emitted by here for the former, though rather Haring,
burned brilliantly, while the latter gave out such a iirchlc and flickering
flame that it was almost useless.

I then turned shoemaker, for I had promised 111yscli" a pair of water--

separation from our fellow-creatures.

One morning, as we were completing our spiral staircase, and giving it.
such finish as we were Capable of, we were suddenly alarmed by treating a
most terrific noise, the roaring or bellowing of a wild beast; so strange a
sound was it that I could not. imagine by what animal it was uttered.

Jack thought it perhaps a lion, Fritz hazarded a gorilla, while titties-i
gave it as his opinion, and I thought it possrole that he was right, that: it
was a hyzona.

"Whatever it is," said I, "we must prepare to receive it; up with you
all to the nest while I secure the door."

Then arming the dogs with their collars, I sent them out to prnt .t

all \\ still; nothing was to be seen. 1 determined to descend and recon-

glided amongst the trees; noiselessly and quickl) we pushed on further and
farther; suddenly, close by, we heard the terrific sound again. l'ritz raised
his gun, but almost. as quickly again dropped it, and bunst into a hearty fit
of laughter. There was no mistaking those dulcet tones--ho--haw, lie-haw,
lie--haw, resounded through the forest, and our ass braying his approach
right merrily appeared in sight. To our surprise, however, our friend was
not alone: behind him trotted another animal, an ass no doubt, but slim
and graceful as a horse. \Ve watched their movements anxiously.

"Fritz," l whispered, "that is an onager. Creep back to Falconliurst
and bring: me a piece of cord--quietly now!"

\\'hile he was gone, I cut a bamboo and split. it halfway down to form
a pair of pincc s, which i knew would be of use to me should i get near
the animal. Fritz soon returned with the cord, and l was glad to observe
also brought some oats and salt. We made one end of the cord fast to a
tree, and at the other end made a running noose. Silently we watched the
animals as they approached, t; ietly browsing; FHEZ then mac, holding ll:
one hand the noose, and in the other some oats and salt. The ass, seeing:
his lavourite food thus held out, advanced to "take it; Fritz allowed him to
do so, and he was soon munching contentedly. The stranger, on seeing
Fritz, started back; but linding her companion show no signs of alarm, was
reassured, and soon approached snilling, and was about to take some of the
tempting food. in a moment the noose left l"rit7."s adroit hand and fell
round her neck; with a single bound she . 'ang bacltw' 'ds the full length
of the cord, the noose drew tight, and she fell to the earth half strangled.
I at once ran up, loosened the rope and replaced it by a halter; and placing
the pincers upon her nose, secured her by two cords fastened between two
trees, and then left her to recover herself.

Everyone hastened up to examine the beautiful animal as she rose fromIn a vitamin! l/I'L' micro [tr/I ["1- fi": adi'oi'f 1mm! um! fall Nil/mi I'm" "Mk I'p x30)

the ground and cast iiery glances around. She lashed out with her heels
on every side; and, giving vent to angry snorts, struggled violently to get
free. All her endeavours were vain: the cords were stout, and alter awhile
she quieted down and stood exhausted and quivering. 1 then approached:
she suffered me to lead her to the roots of our tree, which for the present
formed our stables, and there I tied her up close to the donkey, who was
likewise prevented from playing truant.

Next morning lfound the onagcr after her night's rest as wild as ever,
and as I looked at the handsome creature lalmost despaired of ever taming
her proud spirit. Every expedient was tried, and at length, when the animal
was subdued by hunger, I thought i might venture to mount her; and
having given her the strongest curb and shackled her feet, I attempted to
do so. She was as unruly as ever, and as a last expedient I resolved to
adopt a plan which, though cruel, was, i knew, attended with wonderful.
success by the American Indians, by whom it is practised. \V'atching a
favourable opportunity, I sprang upon the ouagcr's back, and seizing her
long ear in my teeth, in spite of her kicking and plunging, bit it through.
The result was marvellous, the animal ceased plunging, and, quivering vio-
lently, stood stock still. From that moment We were her toasters, the
children mounted her one after the other, and she carried them obedieutly
and quietly. Proud, indeed, did l feel as I watched this animal, which
naturalists and travellers have declared to be beyond the power of man to
tame, guided hither and thither by my youngest son.

Additions to our poultry yard reminded me of the necessity of provid<<
ing some substantial shelter for our animals before the rainy season came
on; three broods of chickens had been successfully hatched, and the little
creatures, forty in all, were my wife's pride and delight. We began by
making,r a roof over the vaulted roots of our tree, forming the framework
of bamboo canes which we laid close together and bound tightly down;
others we fixed below as supports. The interstices were filled up with clay
and moss; and coating the whole over with a mixture of tar and lime-water,
we obtained a firm balcony, and a capital root" impervious to the severest:
fall of rain. I ran a light rail round the balcony to give it a more orna-
mental appearance, and below divided the building into several compartments.
Stables, poultry yard, hay and provision lofts, dairy, kitchen, larder, and
dining~ball were united under one roof.

Our wintenquarters were now completed, and we had but to store
them with food. Day after day we worked, bringing in provisions of every
description.

As we were one evening returning from gathering potatoes, it struck
me that we should take in a store of acorns; and sending the two younger
boy's home with their mother and the cart, I took a large canvas bag, and
with Fritz and Ernest, the former mounted on his onager, and the latter
carrying his little favourite, Knips, made a detour towards the Acorn Wood.

We reached the spot, tied Ligbtfoot to a neighbouring tree, and began

5.1;, z '1 HIE S 137/55 ['11 All]. Y R GRIN 501V.

rapidly to fill the sack. As we were thus engaged, Knips sprang suddenly
into a bush close by, from which, a moment afterwards, issued such strange
cries that Ernest followed to see what could be the matter.

"Cornel" he shouted; "come and help me! I've got a couple of birds
and their eggs. Quick! Ruffetl grouse!"

We hurried to the spot. There was Ernest with a fluttering, screaming
bird in either hand; while, with his foot, he was endeavouring to prevent
his greedy little monkey from seizing the eggs. We quiCkly tied the legs-
of the birds, and removing the eggs from the nest, placed them in Ernest's
hat; while he gathered some of the long, broad grass, with which the nest
was woven, and which grew luxuriantly around, for Franz to play at sword-
drill with. We then loaded the onager with the acorns, and moved home--
wards. The eggs I covered carefully with dry moss, that they might be
kept warm, and as soon as possible I handed them over to my wife, who
managed the mother so cleverly that she induced her to return to the eggs,
and in a few days, to our great delight, we had fifteen beautiful little
Canadian chicks.

Franz was greatly pleased with the "swords" his brother brought him;
but having no small companion on whom to exercise his valoar, he amused
himself" for a short time in hewing down imaginary fees, and then cut the
reeds in slips, and plaited them to form a whip for Lightfoot. The leaves
seemed so pliable and strong that I examined them to see to what further
use they might be put. Their tissue was composed of long silky fibres.
A sudden thought struck rue--this must be New Zealand flax. I could not
rest till I had announced this invaluable discovery to my wife. She was
no less delighted than I was.

"Bring me the leaves!" she exclaimed. "Oh, what a delightful dis-
coreryl No one shall now be clothed in rags ; just make me a spindle, and
you shall soon have shirts and stockings and trousers, all good homespun!
Quick, Fritz, and bring your mother more leaves!"

, We could not help smiling at her eager zeal; but Fritz and Ernest
sprang on their steeds, and soon the onager and buffalo were galloping
home ag.in, each laden with a. great bundle of flax. .The boys dismounted
and deposited their offering at their mother's feet.

"Capital!" she exclaimed. "I shall now show you that I am not at
all behindhand in ingenuity. This must be rettcd, carded, spun, and woven,
and then with scissors, needle, and thread I will make you any article of
clothing you choose."

We decided that Flamingo Marsh would be the best spot for the
operation of sleeping or "retting" the flax, and next morning we set out
thither; the cart drawn by the ass, and laden with the bundles, between
which sat Franz and Knips, while the rest of us followed with spades and
hatchets. I described to my boys as we went along the process of rotting,
and explained to them how steeping the flax leaves destroys the useless
membrane, while the strong fibres remain.r115 RA [NY SEA son: .33

As we were employed in making beds for the flax and placing it in
them, we observed several nests of the flamingo. These are most curiously
and skilfully made of glutinous clay, so strong that they can neither be
overturned nor washed away. They are fomied in the shape of blunted
cones, and placed point downwards; at the upper and broader end is built
a little platform to contain the eggs, on which the female bird sits, with
her long legs in the water on either side, until the little birds are hatched
and can take to the water. For a fortnight we left the flax to steep, and
then taking it out and drying it thoroughly in the sun, stored it for future
use at Falconhnrst.

Daily did we load our cart with provisions to be brought to our winter-
quartcrs: manioc, potatoes, cocoanuts, sweet acorns, sugar-canes, were all
eollected and stored in abundance--tor grumbling thunder, lowering skies,
and sharp showers warned us that we had no time to lose. Our corn was
sowed, our animals housed, our provisions stored, when down came the rain.

To continue in our nest we found impossible, and we were obliged to
retreat to the trunk, where we carried such of our domestic furniture as
might have been injured by the damp. Our dwelling was indeed crowded:
the animals and provisions below, and our beds and household goods around
us, hemmed us in on every side; by degrees, by dint of patience and better
packing, we obtained sullicient room to work and lie down in; by degrees,r34 T115 .S'LVISS FAMILY ROB/JVSOA'.

too, we became accustomed to the continual noise of the animals and the
smell. of the stables. The smoke from the fire, which we were occasionally
obliged to light, was not agreeable; but in time even that seemed to become
more bearable.

To make more space, we turned such animals as we had captured, and
who therefore might be imagined to know how to shift for themselves, out-
side during the daytime, bringing them under the arched roots only at night.
To perform this duty Fritz and I used to sally forth every evening, and as
regularly every evening did we return soaked to the skin. T o obviate this,
the mother, who {cared these continual wettings might injure our health,
mntn'ved waterproofs: she brushed on several layers of caoutchouc over stout
shirts, to which she attached hoods: she then fixed to these duck trousers,
and thus prepared for each of us a complete waterproof suit, clad in which
we might brave the severest rain.'

In spite of our endeavours to keep ourselves busy, the time dragged
heavily. Our mornings were occupied in tending the animals; the boys
amused themselves with their pets, and assisted me in the manufacture of
carding-combs and a spindle for the mother. The combs I made with nails,
which I placed head downwardson a sheet of tin about an inch wide;
holding the nails in their proper positions, I poured solder round their heads
to fix them to the tin, which I then folded down on either side of them
to keep thorn perfectly firm. In the evening, when our room was illumi-
nated with wax candles, I wrote a journal of all the events which had
occurred since our arrival in this foreign land; and, while the mother was
busy with her needle and Ernest making sketches of birds, beasts, and
flowers with which he had met during the past months, Fritz and Jack
taught little Franz to read.

Week after week rolled by. Week after week saw us still close pri--
soners. Ineessant rain battered down above us, constant gloom hung over
the desolate scene.\ri-z roan A NEW cotoxr.

HE winds at length were lulled, the sun shot his brilliant rays through

the liven clouds, the rain ceased to fall--spring had come. No prisoners

set at liberty 'could have felt more joy than we did as we stopped forth

from our winter abode, refreshed our eyes with the pleasant vcrdurc around

us, and our ears with the merry songs of a thousand happy birds, and drank
in the pure balmy air of spring.

Our plantations were thriving vigorously. The seed we had sown was
shooting through the moist earth. All nature was refreshed.

Our nest was our first care; filled with leaves and broken and torn by
the wind, it looked indeed dilapidated. We worked hard, and in a few dz
it \'as again habitable. My wife begged that 1 would now start her with
the flax, and as early as possible I built a drying-oven, and then prepared
it for her use; I also, after some trouble, manufactured a beetle--reel and
spinning--wheel, and she and liranz were soon hard at work, the little boy
reeling oil" the thread his mother spun.

_ I was anxious to visit 'l'enthohn, for l feared that much of our precious
stores might have suffered. Fritz and I made an excursion thither. The
damage done to Falconhurst was as nothing compared to the Scene that
awaited us. T he tent was blown to the ground, the can 'as torn to rags,
the provisions soaked, and two casks of powder utterly destroyed. We
immediately spread such things as we hoped yet to preserve in the sun to
dry. The pinnace was. safe, but our faithful tub-boat was dashed in pieces,
and the irreparable damage we had sustained made me resolve to contrive
some safer and more stable winter-quarters before the arrival of the next
rainy season. Fritz proposed that we should hollow out a cave in the rock,
and though the dilliculties such an undertaking would present appeared
almost insurmountable, 1 yet determined to make the attempt; we might
not, '1 thOught, liew out a cavem of sullicient size to serve as a room, but
we might at least make a collar for the more valuable and perishable of
our stores. .

Some days afterwards we left Falconhurst with the cart laden with a
cargo of spades, hammers, Chisels, pit-kaxes, and crowbars, and began our[36 THE 5 H7155 FA Jill/C Y ROBLVSOIV.

undertaking. 0n the smooth face of the perpendicular rock I drew out in
chalk the size of the proposed entrance, and then, with minds bent on
success, we battered away. Six days of hard and incessant toil made but
little impression; I do not think that the hole would have been a satis-
factory shelter for even Master Knips; but we still did not despair, and
were presently rewarded by coming to softer and more yielding substance;
our work progressed, and our minds were relieved.

0n the tenth day, as our persevering blows were falling heavily, Jack,
who was working diligently with a hammer and crowbar, sliOuted--

"Gone, father! Fritz, my bar has gone through the mountain!"

"Run round and get it," laughed l'ritz; "perhaps it has dropped into
Europe--you must not lose a good crowbar."

"But, really, it is through; it went right through the rock; I heard it
crash down inside. Oh, do come and see l" he shouted excitedly.

We sprang to his side, and l thrust the handle of my hammer into
the hole he spoke of; it met with no opposition, I could turn it in any
direction I chose. Fritz handed me a long pole; I tried the depth with
that. Nothing could I feel. A thin wall, then, was all that intervened be.
tween us and a great cavern.

With a shout of joy, the boys battered vigorously at the rock; piece
by piece fell, and soon the hole was large enough for us to enter. I stepped
near the aperture, and was about to make a further examination, when a
sudden rush of poisonous air turned me giddy, and shouting to my sons to
stand oil", I leaned against the look.

When I came to myself I explained to them the danger of approaching
any cavern or other place where the air has for a longr time been stagnant.
"Unless air is incessantly renewed it becomes vitiatod," I said, "and fatal
to those who breathe it. T he safest way of restoring it to its original state
is to subject it to the action of fire; a few handfuls of blazing hay thrown
into this hole may, if the place be small, sufficiently purify the air within
to allow us to enter without danger." We tried the experiment. The flame
was extinguished the instant it entered. Though bundles of blazing grass
were thrown in, no difi'crencc was made.

I saw that we must apply some more efficacious remedy, and sent the.
boys for a chest of signal-rockets we had brought from the wreck. We let
lly some dozens of these fiery serpents, which went whizzing in, and dis-
appeared at apparently a vast distance from us. Some flow like radiant
meteors round, lighted up the mighty circumference, and displayed, as by a
niagieian's wand, a sparkling glittering roof. They looked like avcnging
dragons driving a foul malignant fiend out of a beauteous palace.

We waited for a little while after these experiments, and I then again
threw in lighted hay. It burned clearly; the air was purified.

Fritz and I enlarged the opening, while jack, springing on his buffalo.
thundered away to lialconhurst to bear the great and astonishing news to
his mother.7V]? FORJI A N'lz'lrf/ {'01 ONY. :3;

All were in the highest state of excitement. Jack had stowed in the
cart all the candles he could find, land we now, lighting these, shouldered
our arms and entered. I led the way, sounding the ground as I advanced
with a long polo, that we might not Fall unexpectedly into anymgreat holel 38 77111' S lV/SS FA 1V] I. Y 'R 0811\75 02V.

or chasm. Silently we marched--the mother, the boys, and even the dogs
seeming overawed with the grandeur and beauty of the scene. We were
in a grotto of diamonds--a vast cave of glittering crystal; the candles
reflected on the walls a golden light, bright as the stars of Heaven, while
great crystal pillars rose from the floor like mighty trees, mingling their
branches high above us and drooping in hunlreds of stalactites, which sparkled
and glittered with all the colours of the rainbow.

The floor of this magnificent palace was formed of hard, dry sand, so
dry that I saw at once that we might safely take up our abode therein,
without the slightest fear of danger from damp.

From the appearance of the brilliant crystals round about us, I suspected
their nature.

I tasted a piece. This was a cavern of rock-salt. There was no doubt
about it--here was an unlimited supply of the best and purest salt! But one
thing detracted from my entire satisfaction and delight--large crystals lay
scattered here and there, which, detached from the roof, had fallen to the
ground; this, if apt to recur, would keep us in constant peril. I examined
some of the masses and discovered that they had been all recently separated,
and therefore concluded that the concussion of the air occasioned by the
rockets had caused their fall. To satisfy ourselves, however, that there
were no more pieces tottering above us, we discharged our guns from the
entrance, and watched the effect. Nothing more fell--our inaginficent abode
was safe.

We returned to 1"'alconhurst with minds full of wonder at our new dis--
covery, and plans for turning it to the best possible advantage.

Nothing was now talked of but the new house, how it should be
arranged, how it should be fitted up. The safety and comfort of l'alcon-
hurst, which had at first seemed so great, now dwindled away in our opinion
to nothing; it should be kept up, we decided, merely as a summer residence,
while our cave should be formed into a winter house and iinpregnable castle.
Our attention was now fully occupied with this new house. Light and air
were to be admitted, so we hewed a row of windows in the rock, where
we fitted the \x-'in(low-cases we had brought from the officers' cabins. We
brought the door, too, from Falconhurst, and fitted it in the aperture We
had made for the opening in the trunk of the tree, which 1 determined to
conceal with bark, as less likely to attract the notice of wild beasts or
savages should they approach during our absence. The cave itself we divided
into four parts: in front, a large compartment into which the door opened,
subdivided into our sitting, eating, and sleeping apartments; the right-hand
division containing our kitchen and workshop, and the left our stables;
behind all this, in the dark recess of the cave, was our storehouse and
powder-magazine. Having already undergone one rainy season, we knew
well its discomforts, and thought of many useful arrangements in the laying
out of our dwelling. We did not intend to be again smoke-dried; we,
therefore, contrived a properly built fire-place and chimney; our stable17V}? FORM' A {VIN/V COZOJVY. '39

arrangements, too, were better, and plenty of space was left in our work-
shop that we should not be hampered in even the most extensive operations.

Our frequent residence at Tentholm revealed to us several important
ztd-'antages which we had not foreseen. Numbers of splendid turtles olten
Came ashore to deposit their eggs in the sand, and their delicious flesh
alibrded us many a sumptuous meal. When more than one of these crea-
tures appeared at a time, we used to cut off their retreat to the sea, and,
turning them on their backs, fasten them to a stake, driven in close b_\-' the

water's edge, by a cord passed through a hole in their shell. We thus had
fresh turtle continually within our reach; for the animals throvc well thus
secured, and appeared in as good condition, after having: been kept thus for
several weeks, as others when freshly caught. Lobster-s, crabs, and mussels
also abounded on the shore. But this was not all; anaulditional surprise
awaited us.

' As we were one morning approaching Tentholm, we were attracted by
a most curious phenomenon. The waters out to sea appeared agitated by
some unseen nmvement, and as they heaved and boiled, their surface, struck
by the beams of the morning sun, seemed illuminated by flashes of fire.
Over the water where this disturbance was taking place hovered hundreds
of birds, screaming loudly, which ever and anon would dart downwards,
some plunging beneath the water, some skimming the surface. Then again
they would rise and resume their harsh cries. 'l'he shining, sparkling mass
then rolled onwards, and approached iii a direct line our bay, followed by
the feathered lloek above. We hurried down to the shore to further examine
this strange sight.

I was convinced as we approached that it was a shoal or bank of herrings.

.\lo sooner did I give utterance to rnv conjecture than I was assailed
by a host oi questions concerning this herring-hank, what it was, and what

occasioned it
"A her ring--bank," I said, "is composed of an immense number of

horrings swimming together. I (an scarcely express to you the huge size
oi this liring bank, which extends over a great area many fathoms deep.
It is lollowed by numbers of great ravenous fish, who devour quantities oi
the herrings, while aboxe horer birds, as you have just seen, ready to pounce
down on str _glers near the top. To escape these enemies, the shoal makes
for the nearest shore, and seeks safety in those shallows where the large
fish cannot follow. But here it meets with a third great enemy. It may
escape from the fish, and elude the vigilance of sharp--sighted birds, but from
the ingenuity of man it can find no escape. In one year millions of these
fish are caught, and yet the roes of only a small number would be sufficient
to supply as many fish again."

Soon our fishery was in operation. Jack and Fritz stood in the water
with baskets, and baled out the fish, as one bales water with a bucket,
throwing them to us on the shore. As quiekl -' as possible we cleaned them,
and placed them in caslis with salt, first a layer of salt, and then a layer
of herrings, and so on, until we had ready many casks of pickled fish.

As the barrels were filled, we closed them carefully, and rolled thorn
away to the cool vaults at the back of our cave.

Our good fortune, however, was not to end here. A day after the
herring fishery was over, and the shoal had left our bay, :1 great number
ot'scals appeared, attracted by the refuse of the herrings which we had
thrown into the sea. Though I feared they would not be suitable for our
table, we yet secured a score or two for the sake of their skins and fat.
The skins we drew carefully olt for harness and clothing, and the fat we
boiled down for oil, which we put aside in easks for tanning, soap-making,
and burning in lamps.

'l'hcse occupations interfered for some tirrre with our work at Rock
House ; but as soon as possible we again returned to our labour with renewed
vigour.

I had noticed that the salt crystals had for their base a species of
gypsum, which I knew might be made of great service to us in our building
operations as plaster.5.510 ImIJZu Infra? Tim ..,L57' grouse, mnocpem",

_P. 142..IVE FORK-ll A Air/517' COLOA'K [.11

As an experiment, I broke off some pieces, and, after subjuutiug them
to great heat, reduced them to powder. The plaster this formed with water
was smooth and white, and as l had then no particular use to which I
might put it,_I plastered over some of the herring (:asks, that I might be
perfectly certain that all air was excluded. The remainder of the casks I
left as they were, forI presently intended to preserve their contents by
smoking. To do this, the boys and I built a small hut ol' reeds and branches,
and then we strung our herrings on lines across the roof. ()n the lloor we
lit a great fire of brushwood and moss, which threw out a dense smoke,
curling in volumes round the fish, and they in a few days seemed perfectly
cured.

About a month alter the appearance of the herrings we were favoured
by a visit from other shoals of fish. jack espied them first, and called to
us that a lot of young whales were off the coast. We ran down and dis-
covered the hay apparently swarming with great sturgeon, salmon, and trout,
all making for the mouth of Jackal River, that they might ascend it and
deposit their spawn amongst the stones.

Jack was delighted at his discovery.

"Here are proper fish I" he exclaimed; "none of your paltry fry. How
do you preserve these sorts of fish ? Potted, salted, or smoked .7"

"Not so fast," said I, " not so fast; tell me how they are to be caught,
and 1 will tell you how they are to be cooked."

"Oh! I'll catch them fast enough," he replied, and darted off to Rock
House.

While 1 was still puzzling my brains as to how I should set to work,
he returned with his fishing;r apparatus in hand: a bow and arrow, and a
ball of twine.

At the arrow-head he had fastened a l).rbcd spike, and had secured
the arrow to the end of the string. Armed with this weapon, he advanced
to the river's edge.

His arrow flew from the bow, and, to my surprise, struck one of the
largest Iish in the side.

"Help, father, helpi" he cried, as the great fish darted off, carrying
arrow and all with it; "help! or he will pull me into the water."

I ran to his assistance, and together we struggled with the finny monster.
He pulled tremendously, and lashed the water around him; but we held
the cord fast, and he had no chance of escape. Weaker and weaker grew
his struggles, and, at length, exhausted by his exertions and loss of blood,
he allowed us to draw him ashore.

He was a noble prize, and Fritz and Ernest, who came up just as we
completed his capture, were quite envious ofJaek's success. Not to be be-
hindhand, they eagerly rushed off for weapons themselves.

_ We were soon all in the water, Fritz with a harpoon, Ernest with a
rod and line, and I myself, armed, like Neptune, with an iron trident, or
more properly speaking, perhaps, a pitchfork. Soon the shore was strewnr 4 2 THE S HUSKY F/l .-i///. Y lx'OfllA-iS'OA'.

with a goodly number of the finest fish--monster after monster we drew to
land. At length Fritz, after harpooning a great sturgeon full eight feet long,
could not get the beast ashore; we all went to his assistance, but our united
efforts were unavailing.

" The bull'alo!" proposed my wife, and or?" went Jack for Storm. Storm
was harnessed to the harpoon repe, and soon the monstrous fish lay panting-
on the sand. -

We at length, when we had captured as many fish as we could possibly
utilize, set about cleaning" and preparing their flesh. Some we salted, some
we dried like the herrings, some we treated like the tunny of the Mediter-
ranean--we prepared them in oil. or the me of the sturgeon I decided to
form caviarc, the great Russian dish. I removed l'rom it all the membranes
by which it is surrounded, washed it in vinegar, salted it, pressed out all
the moisture caused by the wet-absorbing properties of the salt, packed it
in small barrels and stowed it away in our storehouse.

I knew that of the sturgeon's bladder the best isinglass is made, so
carefully collecting the air--bladders from all those we had killed, I washed
them and hung them up to stilfen. The outer coat or membrane 1 then
peeled off, cutting the remainder into strips, technically called staples. These
staples I placed in an iron pot over the fire, and when they had been re--
duced to a proper consistency I strained ofl' the glue through a clean cloth,
and spread it out on a slab of stone in thin layers, letting them remain
until they were dry. The substance I thus obtained was beautifully trans-
parent, and promised to serve as an excellent substitute for glass in our
window-frames.

Fortunately, in this beautiful climate little or no attention was necessary
to the kitchen garden, the seeds sprang up and flourished without apparently
the slightest regard for the time or season of the year. Peas, beans, wheat,
barley, rye, and Indian corn seemed constantly ripe, while cucumbers,
melons, and all sorts of other vegetables grew luxuriantly.

The success of" our garden at Tentholm encouraged me to hope that
my experiment at Falconhurst had not failed, and one morning we started to
visit the spot. As we passed by the field from which the potatoes had been
dug, we found it covered with barley, wheat, rye, and peas in profusion.

I turned to the mother in amazement.

"Where has this line crop sprung from?" said I.

"From the earth," she replied, laughing, "where Franz and I sowed
the seed I brought from the wreck. The ground was ready tilled by you
and the boys; all we had to do was to scatter the seed."

I was delighted at the sight, and it augurcd well, I thought, for the
success of my maize plantation. We hurried to the field. The crop had
indeed grown Well, and, what was more, appeared to be duly appreciated.
A tremendous [lock of feathered thieves rose as we approached. Amongst
them Fritz espied a few ruffed grouse, and, quick as thought unhooding
his eagle, he started him off in chase, then sprang on to his onager and"'7'! 101?le A .NfilV' (.'(7/.()1VY. 1.13

Close at hand, and springing through the bushes he saved the bird from

stood idle, for slipping his pet Fangs, he had started him among some quails
who remained upon the field, and to my surprise the jackal secured some
dozen of the birds, bringing them faithfully to his master's feet.

We then turned our steps towards Falconhurst, where we were refreshed
b\-' a most delicious drink the mother prepared for us; the stems of the
young Indian corn crushed, strained, and mixed with water and the juice
of the sugar-cane.

We then made preparations for an excursion the following day, for I
wished to establish a sort of semi-civilized 941111 at some distance from Fal-
conhurst, where we might place some of our animals, which had become too
numerous with our limited means to supply them with food. 111 the large
cart, to which we harnessed the buffalo, cow, and ass, we placed a dozen
fowls, four young pigs, two couple of sheep, and as many goats, and a pair
of hens and one cock grouse. Fritz led the way on his onager, and by a
new track we forced a passage through the woods and tall grasses towards
Cape Disappointment. >>

'lhe difficult march was at length mm, and we emerged from the forest
upon a large plain covered with curious little bushes; the branches of
these little shrubs and the ground about them were covered with pure
white flakes.i 44 YWE 5 W755 FA 1W ll. Y It' 0/3/.-'\-'.S'().-'\'.

"Snow! snow!" exclaimed Franz. " Oh, mother, come down from the
cart and play snowballs. This is jolly; much better than the ugly rain."

I was not surprised at the bOy's mistake, for indeed the flakes did look
like snow; but before 1 could express my opinion, Fritz declared that the
plant must be a kind of dwarf cotton-tree. We approached nearer and
found he was right-<<soft line wool enclosed in pods, and still hanging on
the bushes or lying on the ground, aboundcd in every direction. We had
indeed discovered this valuable plant. The mother was charmed; and
,gathering a great quantity in three capaeious bags, we resumed our journey.

Crossing the cotton-field, we ascended a pretty wooded hill. The View
from the suunnit was glorious: luxuriant grass at our feet stretching,r down
the hill-side, dotted here and there with shad)r trees, among which gushed
down a sparkling brook, while below lay the rich green forest, with the
sea beyond.

What better situation could we hope to find for our new farm? Pasture,
water, shade, and shelter, all were here.

We pitched our tent, built our fireplace, and, leaving the mother to
prepare our rcpast, Fritz and I selected a spot for the erection of our shed.
We soon found a group of trees so situated that the trunks would serve as
posts for our intended building. Thithcr we carried all our tools, and then,
as the day was far advanced, enjoyed our supper, and lay down upon most
comfortable beds which the mother had prepared for us with the cotton.

The group of trees we had selected was exactly suited to our purpose,
for it formed a regular rectilinear figure, the greatest side of which faced
the sea. I cut deep mortices in the trunks about ten feet from the ground,
and again ten feet higher up to form a second storey. In these mortices I
inserted beams, thus forming a framework for my building, and then, making
a roof of laths, I overlaid it with bark, which I stripped from a neighbouring
tree, and fixed with acacia thorns, and which would effectually shoot ofl
any amount of rain.

While clearing up the scraps of bark and other rubbish for fuel for our
fire, I noticed a peculiar smell, and stooping down I picked up pieces of the
bark, some of which, to my great surprise, I found was that of the terebinth
tree, and the rest that of the American lit. The goats, too, made an im-
portant discover; amongst the same heap, for we found them busily routing
out pieces of cinnamon, a most delicious and aromatic spice.

"From the lit," said I to the boys, " we get turpentine and tar, and
thus it is that the fir tree becomes such a valuable article of commerce.
So we may look forward to preparing pitch for our yacht with tar and oil,
you know, and carbgrease, too, with tar and fat. I do not know that you
will equally appreciate the terebinth tree; a gum issues from incisions in
the bark which hardcns in the sun, and becomes as transparent as amber;
when burned it gives forth a most delicious perfume, and when dissolved
in spirits of wine, forms a beautiful transparent varnish."

The completion of our new farmhouse occupied us several days; weIVI'.' fill/"Ell A A'EN' C01: 03'1". Li;

wore strong lianas and other creepers together to form the walls to the
height of about six feet; the rest, up to the roof, we formed merely of :1
lattice-work of laths to admit both air and light. Within we divided the.
house into three parts; one subdivided into stalls for the auimals; a second
titted -wit'.h perches for the birds; and a third simply furnished with a rough
table and benches, 'to serve as a sleeping-apartment for ourselves, when \Yl:
should lind it necessary to pay the place a visit. in :1 short time the
dwelling was most comfortably arranged, and as we daily filled the feeding-
troughs with the food the animals host liked, they showed no inclination
to desert the spot we had chosen for them. '

Yet, hard as we had worked, we found that the provisions we had
brought with us would be exhausted before we could hope to be able to
leave the farm. I therefore despatched Jack and Fritz for fresh supplies.

During their absence, Ernest and I made a short excursion in the
neighbourhood, that we might know more exactly the character of the
country near our farm,

Passing over a hrook which llowcd towards the wall of rocks, we
reached a large marsh, and as we walked round it, I noticed with delight
that it was Covered with the rice plant growing wild in the greatest pro-
fusion. l-lert: and there only were there any ripe plants, and from these
rose a number of rull'cd grouse, at which both Ernest and I let lly. 'l'wo
fell, and Yang's, who was with us, brought them to our feet. A. we ad-
'anced, linips skipped from the hack of his steed Juno and began to
regale himself on some fruit, at a short distance off; we followed the little
animal and found him devouring delicious strawberries. Having enjoyed the
fruit ourselves, we filled the hamper Knips always carried, and secured the
fruit from his pill'eringr paws with leaves fixed lirmly down.

I then took a sample of the rice seeds to show the mother, and we
continued our journey.

Presently we reached the borders of the pretty lake which we had seen
beyond the swamp. The. nearer aspect ol' its calm blue waters greatly
charmed us, and still more so, the sight of numbers ol' black swans dis-
por'ting themselves on the glassy Surfilcc, in which their stately forms and
gracelhl movements were reflected as in a mirror. It was delightful to
watch these splendid hirds, old and young swimmingr together in the peace-
l'ul enjoyment 0!" life, seeking their lbml, and pursuing- om: another play-
fully in the water.

I could not think of breaking in upon their happy beautii'ul existence
by firing among them, but our dog Juno was by no means so considerate;
for all at once I heard a plunge, and saw her drag out of the water a most
peculiar-looking creature, something like a small otter, but not above twenty-
lwo inches in length, which she would have torn to pieces, had we nol.
hurried up and taken it from her. '

This curious little animal was of a soft dark brown colour, the. lnr
being of a lighter shade under the body; its feet were furnished with large

'0r46 THE SWISS FAIIIIL Y ROBLNSON',

claws, and also completely webbed, the head small, with deeply set eyes
and ears, and terminating in a broad flat bill like that of a duck.

This singularity seemed to us so droll that we both laughed heartily,
feeling at the same time much puzzled to know what sort of animal it
could possibly be. For want of a better, we gave it the name of the
"Beast with a Bill," and Ernest willingly undertook to carry it, that it
might be stuffed and kept as a curiosity.

After this we returned to the farm, thinking our messengers might
soon arrive, and sure enough, in about a quarter of an hour, Fritz and Jack
made their appearance at a brisk trot, and gave a circumstantial account of
their mission.

1 was pleased to see that they had fulfilled their orders intelligently,
carryingr out my intentions in the spirit and not blindly to the letter.

Next morning we quitted the farm (which we named Woodlands), after
providing amply for the wants of the animals, sheep, goats, and poultry,
which we left there. _ .

Shortly afterwards, on entering a wood, we found it tenanted by an
enormous number of apes, who' instantly assailed us with showers of fir-
cones, uttering hideous and angry cries, and effectually checking our progress,
until we put them to flight by a couple of shots, which not a little ast0<
nished their weak minds.

Fritz picked up some of their missiles, and, showing them to me, I
recognised the cone of the stone-pine.

"By all means gather some of these cones, boys," said I; "you will
find the kernel has a pleasant taste, like almonds, and from it we can, by
pressing, obtain an excellent oil. Therefore I should like to carry some
home with us."

A hill, which seemed to promise a good View from its summit, next
attracted my notice, and, on climbing it we were nrore than repaid for the
exertion by the extensive and beautiful prospect which lay spread before
our eyes. The situation altogether was so agreeable that here also I resolved
to make a settlement, to be visited occasionally, and, after resting
awhile and talking the matter over, we set to work to build a cottage such
as we had lately finished at Woodlands. Our experience there enabled us
to proceed quickly with the work, and in a few days the rustic abode was
completed, and received, by Ernest's choice, the grand name of Pro-
spect Ilill.

My chief object in undertaking this expedition had been to discover
some tree from whose bark I could hope to make a useful light boat or
canoe. Hitherto I had met with none at all fit for my purpose, but, not
despairing of success, I began, when the cottage was built, to examine care-
fully the surrounding woods, and, after considerable trouble, came upon two
magnificent tall straight trees, the bark of which seemed something like
that of the birch. Selecting one whose trunk was, to a great height, free
from branches, we attached to one of the lower of these boughs the ropeHIE EORJI A A'EW COLONY, 1.17

ladder we had with us, and, Fritz ascending it, Cut the bark tlnongh in a
e1rcle;1 did the same at the foot of the tree, and then, f1om between the
circles, n-e took a nanow perpendicular slip of bark entiicly out, so that
we could introduce the proper tools by which gradually to loosen and
raise the main part, so as finally to separate it from the tree uninjured and
entire. This we found possible, because the bark was moist and flexible.
Great care and exertion were necessaiy, as the bark became detached, to
support it, until the whole was ready to be let gently down upon the
grass. This seemed a great achievement; but our work was by no means
ended, nor could we venture to desist from it until, while the material was
soft and pliable, we had formed it into the shape we desired for the canoe.

 

I!!! 17(13): 3 flu: (11mm.

in order to do this, I cut a long triangular piece out of each end of
the roll, and, placing the sloping parts one over the other, I drew the ends
into a pointed form and secured them with pegs and glue.

This successful proceeding had, liOW'EVel, widened the boat, and made
it too flat in the middle, so that it was necessary to put ropes 1ound it,
and tighten them until the proper shape was restored, before we could
allow it to dry in the sun.

This being all I could do without a greater variety of tools, I deter-
mined to complete my work in a more convenient situation, and forthwith
despatched Fritz and Jack with orders to bring the sledge (which now ran
011 wheels taken from gun-carriages), that the canoe might be transported

direct to the vicinity of the harbour at Tcntholm.
10'148 TIIE S "'755 FARIIL 1" ROBIl-\-'SO'-\-'.

During their absence I fortunately found some wood naturally Curved,
just suited for ribs to support and strengthen the sides of the heat.

When the two lads returned with the sledge, it was time to rest for
the night; but with early dawn we were again busily at work.

The sledge was loaded with the new boat and everything else we
could pack into it, and we turned our steps homewards, finding the greatest
difficulty, however, in getting our vehicle through the woods. We crossed
the bamboo swamp, where I cut a fine mast for my boat, and came at
length to a small opening or defile in the ridge of rocks, where a little
torrent rushed from its source down into the larger stream beyond; here
we determined to make a halt, in order to erect a great earth wall across
the narrow gorge, which, being thickly planted with prickly pear, Indian fig,
and every thorny bush we could find, would in time form an effectual
barrier against the intrusion of wild beasts, the cliffs being, to the best of
our belief, in every other part inaccessible. For our own convenience we
retained a small winding-path through this barrier, concealing and defending
it with piles of branches and thorns, and also we contrived a light draw-
bridge over the stream, so that- we rendered the pass altogether a very
strong position, should we ever have to act on the defensive.

This work occupied two days, and continuing on our way, we were
glad to rest at Falconhinst before arriving (quite tired and wom out) at
'l'eutliohn.

It tool: some time to recruit our strength after this long and fatiguing
expedition, and then we vigorously resumed the task of finishing the canoe.
The arrangements, I llattered myself, were carried out in a manner quite
worthy of a ship-builder; a mast, sails, and paddles were fitted, but my
final touch, although I prized it highly and considered it a grand and ori--
ginal idea, would no doubt have excited only ridicule and contempt had it
been seen by a naval man. My contrivance was this: I had a couple of
large air-tight bags, made of the skins of the dog--fish, well tarred and
pitched, irritated, and made fast on each side of the boat, just above the
level of the water. These lloats, however much she might be loaded,
would ellbctually prevent either the sinking or capsizing of my craft.

1 may as well relate in this place what I omitted at the time of its
occurrence. During the rainy season our cow presented us with a bull-call",
and that there might never be any dillieulty in managing him, i at a very
early age pierced his nose and placed a short stick in it, to be exchanged
{or a ring when he was old enough. The question now Cilllle to be, who
should be his master, and to what should we train hiin? '

"Why not teach him," said Fritz, "to fight with wild animals and
defend us, like the fighting hulls of the l-lottentots? That would be really
useful!"

"I am sure l should much prefer a gentle bull to a fighting one!"
exclaimed his mother; "but do you mean to say tame oxen can he taught
to act rationally on the defensive ': "7V]? [-'0Rflr/ A EVEN' C()/.'0.\'Y. r19

"1 can but repeat what I have heard or read," replied I, "as regards
the race of Hottentots who inhabit the south of Africa, among all sorts of
wild and ferocious animals.

"The wealth of these people consists solely in their flocks and herds,
and for their protection, they train their bulls to act as guards.

"These courageous animal's keep the rest from straying away, and when
danger threatens, they give instant notice of it, drive the herd together in
a mass, the calves and young cows being placed in the centre; around
them the bulls and strong oxen make a formidable circle with their horned
heads turned to the front, offering a determined resistance to the fiercest foe.

"These fighting bulls will even sometimes rrrslr with dreadful bellowing
to meet the enemy; and should it be a mighty lion or other strong and
daring monster, sacrifice their own lives in defence of the herd.

"It is said that formerly, when Ilottentot tribes made war on one
another, it was not unusual to place a troop of these stout-hearted warriors
in the van or" the little army, when their heroism led to decisive victory on
one side or the other.

"But," continued I. "although I can see you are all delighted with my
description of these fine warlike animals, I think we had better train this
youngster to he a pcaceable brill. Who is to have charge of him?"

Ernest thought it would be more amusing to train his monkey than a
calf. Jack, with the buffalo and his hunting jackal, had quite enough on
his hands. Fritz was content with the ouager. Their mother was voted
mistress of the old grey donkey. And T. myself being superintenderrt-irr--nlrit-r'
of the whole establishment of animals, there remained only little Franz to
whose special care the calf could be committed.

"What say you, my boy----will you undertake to look after this little
fellow '3"

" Oh yes, father!" he replied. "Ones you told me about a strong
man, I think-his name was Mile, and he had a tin y calf, and he used to carry
it about everywhere. It grew bigger and bigger, but still he carried it often,
Lill at last he grew so strong" that when it was quite a great big ox he
could lift it as easily as ever. And so, you see, if I take care of our wee
calf and teach it to do what I like, perhaps when it grows big I shall still
be able to manage it, and then--oh, papa--(lo you think I might ride
upon it 'i "

I smiled at the child's simplicity, and his funny application of the story
of Milo of Crotona.

" The calf shall be yours, my boy. Make him as tame as you can.
and we will see about letting you mount him some day; but remember he
will be a great bull long before you are nearly a man. Now what will you
call him E "'

"Shall I call him Grumble, father? Hear what a low muttering noise
he makesl"

"Not a bit," said he , "11hr, vou can't compare the two names. Fancy

Oh, it sounds sublime!"

We named the two puppies Bruno and Fawn, and so ended this im-
portant domestic business.

For two months we worked steadily at our salt--cave, in order to com-
plete the necessary arrangement of partition walls, so as to put the rooms
and stalls for the animals in comfortable order for the next long rainy season,
during which time, _when other work would be at a standstill, we could
carry on many 111inor details for the improvement of the abode.

We levelled the floors first with clay; then spread gravel mixed with
melted gypsum over that, producing a smooth hard surface, which did very-
well for most of the apartments; but I was ambitious of having one 01" two
carpets, and set about making a kind of felt in the following way:

I spread out a large piece of sailcloth, and covered it equally allover.
with a strong liquid, made of glue and isinglass, which saturated it thoroughly.

been carefully cleaned and prepared, and rolled and beat it until it adhcrcd
tolerably- smoothly to the cloth. Finally it became, when perfectly dry, a
covering for the floor of our sitting-room by no means to be despised.

coast, and d1s( ovc1ed to my su1p11se, that the Ker) next day would he the
anniversary of our escape from the wreck. My heart swelled with gratitude
to the gracious God, Who had then granted us deliverance, and ever since
had loaded as with benefits; and I resolved to set to-morrow apart as a
(lay of thanksgiving, in joyful celebration of the occasion.

My mind was full of indefinite plans when 1 rose, and the day's work
began as usual. 1 tool; care that everything should be cleaned, cleared,
and set in order both outside and inside our dwelling: none, however, sus-
pecting that there was any particular object in view. Other more private
preparations I also made for the next day. At supper I made the coming
event known to the assembled family.

"Good people! do you know that to-mormw is a very great and im-
portant day? We shall have to .keep it in honour of our merciful escape
to this land, and call it 'l'hanksgiving Day."

Eycryone was surprised to hear that we had already been twelve
months in the country---~i11dced, my wife believedI might be 111istaken, until
I showed her how I had calculated regularly ever since the 3Ist of January,
on which day we were wrecked, by marking off in my almanac the Sundays
as they arrived for the remaining eleven months of that year.

"Since then," I added, "I have counted 31 days. This is the rst 111

of the day of our escape. As my bookseller has not sent me an almanac
for the present year, we must henceforth reckon for ourselves."

"Oh. that will be good fun {or us," said Ernest. "We must have a
long stick, like Robinson Crusoe, and cut a notch in it every day, and count
them up every now and then, to see how the weeks and months and years

"That is all very well, if you know for certain the number of days in
each month, and in the" year. What do you say, Ernest?"

"The year contains 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds,"
returned he promptly.

"Perfectly correctl" said I, smiling; "but you would get in a mess with
those spare hours, minutes, and seconds in a year or two, wouldn't you ?"

"Not at all! Every four years lwould add them all together, make a
day, stick it into February, and call that year leap year."

"Well done, Professor Ernest! We must clcct you astronomer royal
in this our kingdom, and let you superintend and regulate everything con-
nected with the lapse of time, clocks and watches included."

Before they went to sleep, I could hear my boys whispering among157, 7791'? SU'ISS ['14 31/1: V ROBIJVSOAZ

themselves about. "father's mysterious allusions " to next day's festival and
rcjoicings; but I offered no explanation, and went to sleep, little guessingr
that the rogues had laid a counter-plot, far more surprising than my simple
plan for their diversion.

Nothing less than a roar of artillery startled me from sleep at daybreak
next morning. I sprang up and found my wife as much alarmed as I was
hr the noise, otherwise 1 should have been inclined to believe it fancy.

' "Fritz! dress quickly and come with me!" cried I, turning to his ham--
mock. Let it was empty; neither he nor Jack was to be seen.

Altogether bewildered, l was hastily dres_. g, when their voiees were
heard, and they rushed in shouting:--

"Hurrah! didn't we rouse you with a right good thundering salute?"

But perceivz g at a glance that we had been seriously alarmed, Fritz
hastened to apologise for the thoughtless way in which they had sought to
do honour to the Day of 't'hanksgiving, without considering that an unex~
peeied cannon-shot would startle us unpleasautly from our sluiniaers.

We readily forgave the authors of our alarm, in consideration of the
good intention which had prompted the deed, and, satisfied that the day
had at least been duly inaugurated, we all. went quietly to breakfast.

Afterwards we sat together for a long time, enjoying the calm beauty
of the morning, and talking of all that had taken place on the memorable
days of the storm :1 year ago; for I desired that the awful events of that
time should live in the remembrance of my children with a deepening sense
of gratitude for our deliverance. Therefore I read aloud passages from my
journal, as well as many beautiful verses from the Psalms, expressive of
joyful praise and thanksgiving, so that even the youngest amongns was
impressed and solemnised at the recollections of escape from a terrible
death, and also led to bless and praise the name of the Lord our Delivcrcr.

Dinner followed shortly after this happy service, and I then announced
for the afternoon a "Grand Display of Athletic Sports," in which I and my
wife were to be spectators and judges.

" Father, what a grand idea!"

"011, how jolly! Are we to run races?"

"And prizes! Will there be prizes, father 3"

"The judges otter prizes for competition in every sort of manly exer-
t-isu," replied 1. "Shooting, running, Iriding, leaping, climbing, swimming;
we will have an exhibition of your skill in all. Now for it!

"Truurpcters! sound for the opening of the lists."

arms towards a shady spot, where the ducks and geese were quietly resting,
had the absurd effect I intended.

infinite amusement of the children, who began to hustle about in' eager
preparations for the contest, and begging to know with what they were
to begin.HIT/1' FORM :7 A-"I'IIV COZUA'J'. 153

" Let us have shooting first, and the rest when the heat of the day
declines. Here is a mark I have g'ot ready for you," said I, producing a
board roughly shaped iike a kangaroo, and of about the size of one. This
target was admired, but lack could not rest satisfied till he had added ears,
and a long leather strap for a tail.

It was then fixed in the attitude most characteristic of the creature,
and the distance for firing measured ol't. Each 01' the three competitors was

Fritz hit the kangaroos head each time; Ernest hit the body once; and
jack, by :1 lucky chance, shot the ears clean away from the head, which
teat raised a shout of laughter.

A second trial with pistols ensued, in which Fritz again eaine ol'l'vietor.

In this exercise Jack performed wonders. He ascended with remarkable
agility the highest palms whose stems he could clasp. And when he put
on the shark-skin buskins, which enabled him to take firm hold of larger
trees, he played antics like a squirrel or a monkey: peeping and grinning
at us, at first on one side of the stem, and then on the other, in a most.
diverting way.

Fritz and Ernest climbed well, but could not come near the grace and
skill of their active and lively young brother.

Riding followed, and rrrarvellous feats were performed, Fritz and jack
proving themselves very equal in their management of their diilerent steeds.

I thought the riding was over, when little Franz appeared from the
stable in the cave, leadingr young Crumble, the bullacalf, by a bridle passed
through his nose-ring.

The child saluted us with a pretty little air of confidence, exclainring--

"Now, most learned judges, prepare to see something quite newr and
wonderful! The great hull--tamer, Milo of Crotona, desires the honour of
exhibiting before you."

Then taking a whip, and holding the end of a long cord, he made the
animal, at the word of command, walk, trot, jump, and gallop in a circle
round him.

He afterwards mounted, and showed off Grumble's somewhat awkward
paces.

The sports were concluded by swimming matches, and the competitors
found a plunge in salt water very refreshing after their varied exertions.

Fritz showed himself a master in the art. At home in the element,
no movement betokened either exertion or weariness.

Ernest exhibited too much anxiety and elfort, w'nile Jack was far too
Violent and hasty, and soon became exhausted.

Franz gave token of future skill.

By this time, as it was getting late, we returned to our dwelling, the
mother having preceded us in order to make arrangements for the ceremony
of prize-giving.

We found her seated in great state, with the prizes set out by her side.

The boys marched in, pretending to play various instruments in imita--
tion of a band, and then all four, bowing respectfully, stood before her, like
the victors in a tournament of old, awaiting the reward of valour from the
Queen of Beauty, which she bestowed with a few words of praise and en-
couragement.

Fn'tz, to his immense delight, received, as the prize for shooting and
swimming, a splendid double--barrelled rifle and a beautiful hunting-knife.

To Ernest, as winner of the running match, was given a handsome gold
watch.

For climbing and riding, Jack had a pair of silver-plated spurs and a
riding whip, both of which gave him extraordinary pleasure.

Franz received a pair of stirrups and a driving whip made of rhinocerosIVE HMW .4 .-\-"ls'll5' (rota-Vii 155

hide, which we thought would be of use to him in the character of bull-
trainer.

When the ceremony was supposed to be over, 1 advanced, and solemnly
presented to my wife a lovely work--box, filled with every imaginable re-
quirement for a lady's work-table, which she accepted with equal surprise
and delight.

The whole entertainment afforded the boys such intense pleasure, and
their spirits rose to such a pitch, that nothing would serve them but another
salvo of artillery in order to close with befitting dignity and honour so great
a day. They gave me no peace till they had leave to squander some _gun-

powder, and then at last, their excited feelings seeming relieved, we were
able to sit down to supper; shortly afterwards we joined in family worship
and retired to rest.

S0011 after the great festival of our grand Thanksgiving Day I recollected
that it was now the time when, the figs at Falconhurst being ripe, immense
flocks of ortolans and wild pigeons were attracted thither, and as we had
found those preserved last year of the greatest use among our stores of
winter provisions, 1 would not miss the opportunity of renewing our stock ;
and therefore, laying aside the building work, we removed with all speed
to our home in the tree, where, sure enough, we found the first detachment
of the birds already busy with the fruit.15!: 77"? .S'U'ISS' 17213111. V A'O/f/NSOA'.

In order to spare ammunition, I resolved to concoct a streng sort of
bird-lime, of which I had read in some account of the Palm Islanders, who
make it of fresh caoutchouc mixed with oil, and of so good a quality that
it has been known to catch even peacocks and turkeys.

Fritz and Jack were therefore dispatched to collect some fresh caout-
chouc from the trees, and as this involved a good gallop on Storm and
Lightfoot, they, nothing 10th, set oil".

They took a supply of calabashes in which to bring the gum, and we
found it high time to manufacture a fresh stock of these useful vessels. I
was beginning to propose an expedition to the gourd-tree wood, regretting
the time it would take to go such a distance, when my wife reminded me
or" her plantation near the potato-licld.

There to our joy we found that all the plants were flourishing, and
crops of gourds and pun'ipkins, in all stages of ripeness, covered the ground.

Selecting a great number suited to our purpose, we hastened home,
and began the manufacture of basins, dishes, plates, flasks, and Spoons of
all sorts and sizes, with even greater success than before.

When the riders' returned with the caontchouc, they brought several
novelties besides.

A crane, for example, shot by Fritz, and an animal which they called
a marmot, but which to me seemed much more like a badger.

Anisned, turpentine, and wax berries for candles they had also collected.
and a curious root which they introduced by the name of the monkey plant.

"And pray wherefore 'monkey plant,' may I ask?"

" Well, for this reason, father," answered Fritz; "we came upon an Open
space in the forest near Woodlands, and perceived a troop of monkeys,
apparently engaged, as Jack said, in cultivating the soil? Being curious to
make out what they were at, we tied up the (logs, as well as Storm and
Lightl'oot, and crept near enough to see that the apes were most industri-
ously grubbing up and eating roots. This they did in a way that nearly
choked us with laughter, for when the root was rather hard to pull up, and
the leaves were torn off, they seized it firmly in their teeth, and llung
themselves fairly heels-overhead in the most ludicrous fashion you ever
saw, and up came the root unable to resist the leverage! Of course we
Minted to see what this dainty morsel was like, so we loosed the dogs,
and the apes cleared out double quick, leaving plenty of the roots about.
We tasted them, and thought them very nice. Will you try one 1'"

The plant was quite new to me, but I imagined it might be what is
called in China "gensing," and there prized and valued beyond everything.
The children being: curious to hear more about this gensing, I continued:

" In China it is considered so strengthening and wholesome that it is
used as a sort of universal"medicine, being supposed to prolong human life.

"The emperor alone has. the right to permit it to be gathered, and
guards are placed round land where it grows.

"Gensing is to be found in Tartary, and has lately been discovered inIVE FORAI A _-\-"EN/' C015 03'}: 157

Canada; it is cultivated in Pennsylvania, because the Americans introduce
it secretly into China as smuggled merchandise."

Fritz then continued:--

"Aftcr this we went on to Woodlands; but mercy on us! what a con-
fusion the place was in! Everything smashed or torn, and covered with
mud and dirt ; the fowls terrified, the sheep and goats scattered, the con-
tents of the rooms (lashed about as if a whirlwind had swept through the
house."

"What I" I exclaimed, while my wife looked horrified at the new
conjuring up in her imagination hordes of savages who would soon come
and lay waste Falconhurst and Tenthohn as well as Woodlands. "How can
that have happened? Did you discover the authors of all this mischief .7"

"Oh," said Jack, " it was easy to see that those dreadful monkeys had
done it all. First they must have got into the yards and sheds, and hunted
the fowls and creatures about; and then 1 daresay the cunning rascals
put a. little monkey in at some small opening, and bid hiin uufasteu the
shutters--you know what nimble fingers they hare. Then of course the
whole posse of them swarmed into our nice tidy cottage and skylarked with
every single thing,r they could lay paws on, till perhaps they got hungry
all at once, and bethought them of the 'gensing,' as you call it, out in the
woods yonder, where we found them so busy refreshing themselves, the
mischievous villains ! "

"While we were gazing at all this ruin in a sort of bewilderment,"
pursued Fritz, "we heard a sound of rushing wings and strange ringing cries
as of multitudes of birds passing high above us, and looking up we per-
ceived them flying quickly in a wedge-shaped flock at a. great height in the
air. They began gradually to descend, taking the direction of the lake,
and separated into a number of small detachments, which followed in a long
straight line, and at a slower rate, the movements of the leaders, \\'llu
appeared to be examining the. neighbourhood. We could now see what
large birds they must be, but dared not show ourselves or follow them, lest
they should take alarm.

"' Presently, and with one accord, they quickened their motion, just as
if the hand had begun to play a quick march after a slow one, and rapidly
descended to earth in a variety of lively ways, and near enough for us to
see that they must be cranes.

"Some alighted at once, while others hovered sportix'ely over them.
Many darted to the ground, and, just touching it, would soar : 'ztin upward
with a strong but somewhat heavy flight.

"After gambolling in this way for a time, the whole multitude, as
though at the word of conunand, alighted on the rice--tickle, and began to
feast on the fresh grain.

"We thought now was our time to get a shot at the cranes, and
:autiously approached; but they were too cunning to let themselves be sur-
prised, and we came unexpectedly upon their outposts or sentinels, who
instantly sprang into the air uttering loud trumpet-like'crics, upon which
the whole flock arose and followed them with a rush like a sudden squall
of wind. We were quite startled, and it was useless to attempt a shot;
but unwilling to miss the chance of securing at least one" of the birds, I
hastily unhooded my eagle, and threw him into the air.

" With a piercing cry he soared away high above them, then shot
downwards like an arrow, causing \vild confusion among the cranes. The
one which the eagle attacked sought to defend itself; a struggle followed,
and they came together to the ground not far from where we stood.

"Hasteuing forward, to my grief I found the beautiful crane already
dead. The eagle, luckily unhnrt, was rewarded with a small pigeon from
my game-bag.

"After this we went back to Woodlands, got some turpentine and a bag
of rice--and set off for home."

Fritz's interesting story being ended, and supper ready, we made trial
of the new roots, and found them very palatable, either boiled or stewed;
the monkey plant, however, if it really proved to be the gensing of the
Chinese, would require to be used with caution, being of an aromatic and
heating nature.

We resolved to transplant a supply of both roots to our kitchen garden.PREPARING non \\-'i.\"risn.

ON the following morning we were early astir; and as soon as breakfast
was over, we went regularly to work with the bird-lime. The tough,
adhesive mixture of caoutchouc, oil, and turpentine turned out well.

The boys brought rods, which I smeared over, and made them place
among the upper branches, where the fruit was plentiful, and the birds
most congregated.

The prodigious number of the pigeons, far beyond those of last year,
reminded me that we had not then, as now, witnessed their arrival at their
lecding-places, but had seen only the last body of the season, a mere party
of sti'aggleis, compared to the masses which now weighed down the branches
of all the trees in the neighbourhood.

The sweet acorns of the evergreen oaks were also patronized; large
flocks were there congregated; and from the state of the ground under the
trees it was evident that at night they roosted on the branches. Seeing
this, 1 determined to make a raid upon them by torchlight, after the manner
of the colonists in Virginia.

Meantime, the bird-lime acted well: the pigeons alighting, stuck fast.
The more they iluttcred and struggled, the more completely were they
hedaubed with the tenacious mixture, and at length, with piteous cries, fell
to the ground, bearing the sticks with them. The birds were then removed,
fresh lime spread, and the snare set again.

The boys quickly became able to carry on the work without my
assistance; so, leaving it to them, Iwcnt to prepare torches, with pine-wood
and turpentine, for the night attack.

Jack presently brought a very pretty pigeon, unlike the rest, to show
me, as he felt unwilling to kill it; and seeing that it must be one of our
own European breed, which we wished to preserve until their numbers
greatly increased, I took the trembling captive, and gently cleaned its feet
and wings with oil and ashes from the stiff, sticky mess with which it was
hedaubed, placing it then in a wicker cage, and telling Jack to bring me
any others like it which were caught. This he did; and we secured several
pairs, greatly to my satisfaction, as, having necessarily let them go free1(a) 771/5 ATV/SS FAA/[LY ROBIA'SOA'.

when we landed, they had become quite wild, and we derived no advan-
tage from them; whereas now we would have a cot, and pigeon-pic when-
ever we liked.

When evening drew on, we set out for the wood of sweet acorns,
provided merely with long bamboo canes, torches, and canvas sacks.

These weapons appeared very curious, and insufficient to the children;
but their use w's speedily apparent: for darkness liming come upon us
almost before we reached the wood, 1 lighted the torches, and perceived,
as I expected, that every branch was thickly laden with ortolans and wild
pigeons, who were roosting there in amazing numbers.

Suddenly aroused by the glare of light, confusion prevailed among the
terrified birds, who fluttered helplessly through the branches, dazzled and
bewiidered, and many falling, even before we began to use the sticks, were
picked up, and put in the bags.

When we beat and s ruck the branches, it vas as much as my wife
and Franz could do to gather up the quantities of pigeons that soon lay on
the ground. The sacks were speedily quite full. We tumed homewards,
and on reaching Falconhurst put our booty in safety, and gladly with-
drew to rest.

The following day was wholly occupied in plucking, boiling, roasting
and stewing, so that we could find time for nothing else; but next morningr
a great expedition to "'oodlands was arranged, that measures might there
be taken to prevent a repetition 01" the monkey inva 'on.

I hoped, could I but catch the mischievous rascals at their work of
destruction, to inflict upon them such a chastisement as would elfectually
make them shun the neighbourhood of our farm for the future.

My wife provided us with a good store of provisions, as we were likely
to be absent several days, while she, with Franz and Turk, remained
at home.

I tool; with me abundance of specially prepared bird-lime, far stronger
than that which we used for the pigeons; a number of short posts, plenty
of string, and a supply of cocoa-nut shells and gourds.

The buffalo carried all these things, and one or two of the boys besides.
I myself bestrode the ass, and in due time we arrived at a convenient spot
in the forest. near Woodlands, well concealed by thick bushes and under--
wood, where we made a little encampment, pitching the small tent, and
tethering the animals. The dogs, too, were tied up, Zest they should roam
about and betray our presence.

We found the cottage qui : quiet. and deserted; and I lost no time in
preparing for the reception ol' visitors, hopingr to be all read}: for them and
out of sight before they arrived.

We drove the stake. lightly into the ground, so as to form an irregular
paling round the house, winding string in and out in all directions between
I'Iem, thus making a kind of labyrinth, through which it would be impos-
sible to pass without touching either the stakes or the cords.Jlj- wife (uni 101m: gal/term! :96 Mr 15km"; Mzzf Jay 07; Magyar/7111 (p. 160:.

Everything was plentifillly besnreared with bird-lime; and basins of
the mixture were set in all directions, slrewed with rice, maize, and other
dainties for bait.

Night came without any interruption to our proceedings; and, all being;
their accomplished, we retired to rest beneath the shelter of our little tent.

Very early in the morning we heard a confused noise, such as we knew
betokencd the approach of a large number of apes. We armed ourselves
with strong clubs and cudgels, and, holding;r the dogs in leash, made our
way silently behind the thickets, till, ourselves unseen, we could command
a view of all that went on; and strange indeed was the-scene which ensued!

The noise of rustling, crackling, and creaking among the branches, with
horrid cries, and shrieks, and chattering, increased to a degree sufficient to
make us perfectly giddy; and then out from the forest poured the whole
disorderly rabble of monkeys, scrambling, springing, leaping from the trees,
racing and tumbling across the grassy space towards the house; when, at
once attracted by the novelties they saw, they made for the jars and bowls.

'I'hey seemed innumerable; but the confused, rapid way in which they
swarmed hither and thither made it difficult to judge accurately of their
numbers. They (lashed fearlessly through and over the palings in all directions,
sorrrc rushing at the eatables, some scrambling on to the roof, where they
commenced tugging at the wooden pegs, with a view to forcing an entrance.

Gradually, however, as they rambled over the place, all in turn became
bestnearcd with our bird-lime on head, paws, back, or breast. Tire wretched
predicament of the apes increased every instant.

Some sat down, and with the nrost ludicrous gestures tried to clean
themselves. Others were hopelessly entangled in stakes and cordage, which
they trailed about after them, looking the picture of bewildered despair.

Others, again, endeavoured to help one another, and stuck fast together:
the more they pulled, and tugged, and kicked, the worse became their plight.

Many had the gourds and cocoa-nut shells lumbering and cluttering
about with them, their paws having been caught when they sought to ob-
tain the rice or fruit we had put for bait.

Most ridiculous of all was the condition of one old fellow, who had
found a calabash containing palm wine, and, eagerly drinking it, was im-
mediately fitted with a mask, for the shell stuck to his forehead and whiskers,
of course covering his eyes; and he blundered about, cutting the wildest
capers in his efl'orts to get rid of the encurrrbrance.

Numbers took to flight,- but, as we had spread bird-lime on several of
the trees around, many apes found themselves fixed to or hanging from the
branches, where they remained in woeful durance, struggling and shrieking:
horribly.

The panic being new general, 1 loosed the three dogs, whose impatience
had been almost uncontrollable, and who now rushed to the attack of the
unfortunate monkeys as though burning with zeal to execute justice upon
desperate criminals.

ll'[(11 7111': S Xvi/[5 S 1'}! All]. Y ROB/A'SOAF.

The place soon had the appearance of a ghastly battle-field; for we
were obliged to do our part with the clubs and sticks, till the din of howl-
ing, yelling, barking, in every conceivable tone of rage and pain, gave place
to an awful silence, and we looked with a shudder on the shocking spectacle
around us.

At least forty apes lay mangled and dead, and the boys began to be
quite sad and down-hearted, till I, fully sharing their feelings, hastened to
turn their thoughts to active employment in removing and burying the slain,
burningr the stakes, cordage, bowls. everything concerned in the execution
of our deadly stratagern.

After that we hetook ourselves to the task of restoring order to our
dismantled cottage; and, seeking for the scattered flock of sheep, goats, and
poultry, we gradually collected them, hoping to settle them once more
peacefully in their yards and sheds.

While thus engaged, we repeatedly heard a sound as of something hoary
lalling from a tree. Ongoing to look, we found three splendid birds, caught
on some of the timed sticks we had placed loose in the branches.

Two of these proved to be a variety of the Blue Molucca pigeon; the
third I assumed to be the Nicobar pigeon, having met with descriptions of
its resplendent green, bronze, and steely blue plumage ; and l was pleased
to think of domesticating them, and establishing them as first tenants of a
suitable dwelling near the cave.

"First tenants, father!" said Fritz; "do you expect to catch more like
those C' ..

"Not exactly catch them ; I mean to practise a secret art. Much can
be done by magic, Fritz !"

Further explanation I declined to give.

In a few days Woodlands was once more set in order, and everything
settled and comfortable, so that we returned without further adventure to
l'alconlrurst, where we were joyfully welcomed.

Every one agreed that we must go at once to 'l'entlrohn, to make the
proposed pigeon-house in the rock. Several other things there also requiring
our attention, we made arrangements for a prolonged stay.

My plan for the pigeon-house was to hollow out an ample space in the
cliff, facing towards Jackal River, and close to our rocky home, fitting that
up with partitions, perches, and nesting-places; while a large wooden front
was fitted on to the opening, with entrance-holes, slides, or shutters, and a
broad platform in front, where the birds could rest and walk about.

When, after the work of a few weeks, we thought it was fit for habi-
tation, 'l set the other children to work at some distance from our cavern,
and, summoning Fritz--

"Now, my faithful assistant," said I, "it is time to conjure the new
colonists to their settlement here. Yes," I continued, laughing at his
puzzled look, "1 mean to play a regular pigeon-dealer's trick. You must
know such gentry are very ingenious, not only in keeping their own pigeonsltlx'EPAlr'fi-VG FUR W'LVT'EK'. [6

safe, but in adding to their numbers by
attracting those of other people. .'-\ll I want
is some soft clay, anisecd, and salt, of
whichl will compound a mixture, which
our birds will like very--much, and the smell

of which will bring others to share it with V 1;
them." "
"l can easily get you those things, lather." .

"i shall want some oil of aniseetl besides," said I, "to'put on lllu
pigeon-holes, so that the birds' feathers may touch it as they pass in and
out, and become scented with what will attract the wild pigeons. This I can
obtain by pounding aniseed ; therefore, bring me the mortar and some oil."

When this was strongly impregnated with the aromatic oil from the
seeds (for 1 did not purpose to distil it in regular style), I strained it through
a cloth, pressing it strongly; the result answered my purpose, and the scent

would certainly remain for some days.
All my preparations being completed. the pigeons were "installed in their
new residence, and the slides closed. The European birds were by this
time quite friendly with the three beautiful strangers; and when the other
boys came home, and scrambled up the ladder to peep in at a little pane of
glass I had fixed in front, they saw them all contentedly picking up grain,
and peeking at the "magic foot," as Fritz called it, although he did not
betray my secret arts to his brothe1s.

Early on the third morning I aroused Fritz, and directed him to ascend
the rope ladder, and arrange a cord on the sliding door of the dove-cot,
by which it could be opened or closed from below. Also he poured fresh
aniseed oil all about the entrance, after which we returned, and awoke
the rest of the family, telling them that if they liked to make haste they
might see me let the pigeons fly.

Everybody came to the dove--cot, understanding that some ceremony
was to attend the event, and I waved a wand with mock solemnity, while
I muttered a seeming incantation, and then gave Fritz a sign to draw rip
the sliding panel.

Presently out popped the pretty heads of the captives, the soil eyes
glanced about in all directions; they witluhew, they ventured forth again,
they came timidly out on "he Verandah," aslittlc I'ranz expressed it; then,
as though suddenly startled, the u hoe party took wing, with the shrill
whizzing sound peculiar to the flight of pigeons, and circling,r above us, they
rose higher, higher, finally darting quite out of sight.

While we were yet gazing after them, they reappeared, and settled
quietly on the dove-cot; but as we congratulated ourselves 011 a return
which showed they accepted this as a home, 111) sprang the three blue
pigeons, the noble foreigners, for w 10m chiefly I had planned the house,
and rising in circles high in air, winged their rapid way direct towards
Falconluust'.

Their departure had such an air of determination and resolve about it
that I feared them lost to us for ever. _

Endeavouring to console ourselves by petting our four remaining birds,
we could not rorget this disappointment, and all day long the dove- cot re-
mained the centre of atnaction.

Notlung, IlO"e\ e1, was seen of thc fugitives until about the middle of

next day; when most of us were hard at work inside the cavern, Jack sprang
in lull of excitement, cxclaiming --

"He is there! He is come! he really is!"

"Who? Who is there? What do you mean ?"

"The blue pigeon, to he sure! Hurrah! hunah!

"0h, nonsense!" said Emest'. " You want to play as a trick:

"th should it be 'nonsense'? ' cried I. "I fully believe we shall see
them all soon!"

Out ran everybody to the dove-cot, and there, sure enough, stood the
pretty fellow, but not alone, for he was billing and cooing to a mate, aPREPARIA'G FOR {VIA-'TER. 165

stranger of his own breed, apparently inviting her to enter his dwelling;
for he popped in and out at the door, bowing, sidling, and cooing, in a
most irresistible manner, until the shy little lady yielded to his blandish~
ments, and tripped daintily in.

"Now, let's shut the door. Pull the cord and close the panel !" shouted
the boys, making a rush at the string.

"Stop!" Cried I, "let the string alone! I won't have you frighten the
little darlings. Besides, the others will be coming--would you shut the
door in their faces?"

"Here they come! here they come!" exclaimed Fritz, whose keen eye
marked the birds afar, and to our delight the second blue pigeon arrived.
likewise with a mate, whom, alter a pretty little flirtation scene of real and
assumed modesty on
her part, he succeeded
in leading home.

The third and
handsomest oi" the new
.pigeons was the last
in making his appear-
ance. Perhaps he had
greater difiiculty than
the Others in finding a
mate as distinguished
in rank and beauty as
himself.

However, we fully
expected them, and
the boys talked of the
arrival of " Mr. and
Mrs. Nicobar" as a
matter of course. Late in the day Franz and his mother went out to
provide for supper, but the child returned directly, exclaiming that we must
hasten to the dove-cot to see something beautiful.

Accordingly a general rush was made out of the cave, and we saw with
delight that the third stranger also had returned with a lovely bride, and.
encouraged by the presence of the first arrivals, they soon made themselves
at home.

In a short time nest-building commenced, and among the materials
collected by the birds I observed a long-grey moss or lichen, and thought
it might very possibly be the same which, in the West Indies, is gathered
from the bark of old trees, where it grows, and hangs in great tuft-like beards,
to be used instead of horse-hair for stuffing mattresses.

Cushions she would stnfi" with it. For the discovery of nutmegs we had
also to thank the pigeons, and they were carefully planted in our orchard.

For some time no event of particular note occurred, until at length
Jack, as usual, got into a scrape, causing thereby no little excitement.
at home.

He went off early on one of his own particular private expeditions.

He was in the habit of doing this, that he might surprise us with some
new acquisition on his return.

This time, however, he came back in most wretched plight, covered
with mud and green slime; a great bundle of Spanish canes was on his
back, muddy and green like himself; he had lost a shoe, and altogether
presented a ludicrous picture of misery, at which we could have laughed,
had he not seemed more ready to cry!

"My dear boy! what has happened to you? Where have'you been ?"

"Only in the swamp behind the powder magazine, father," replied he.
"I went to get reeds for my wicker--work, because I wanted to weave some
baskets and hencoops, and I saw such beauties a little way offin the marsh,
much finer than those close by the edge, that Itricd to get at them.

"I jumped from one firm spot to another, till at last I slipped and sank
over my ankles; I tried to gel. on towards the reeds, which were close by.
but in 1 went deeper and deeper, till I was above the knees in thick soft:
mud, and there 1 stuck!

"I screamed and shouted, but nobody came, and l can tell you I was
in a regular fright. '

"At last who should appear but my faithful Fangs! He knew my
voice and came close up to me, right over the swamp, but all the poor
beast could do was to help me to make a row; I wonder you did not
hear us! The very rocks rang, but nothing came of it, so despair drove me
to think of an expedient. I cut down all the reeds I could reach round
and round me, and bound them together into this bundle, which made a
firm place on which to lean, while I worked and kicked about to free my
feet and legs, and after much struggling I managed to get astn'dc on
the reeds.

"There I sat, supported above the mud and slime, while Fangs ran
yelping backwards and forwards between me and the bank, seeming surprised
I did not follow. Suddenly I thought of catching hold of his tail. IIe dragged
and pulled, and I sprawled, and crawled, and waded, sometimes on my reeds
like a raft, sometimes lugging them along with me, till we luckily got back
to [arm fir/1m. But I had a near squeak for it, I can tell you."

"A fortunate escape indeed, my boy!" cried I, "and I thank God for
it. l-'angs has really acted an heroic part as your delix-'erer, and you have
shown great presence of mind. Now go with your mother, and get rid of
the slimy traces of your disastcrl You have brought me splendid canes,
exactly what I want for a new scheme of mine."

The fact was, I meant to try to construct a loom for my wife, for IPREP/2 R/A'G FOR WYA-"IT/fki 157

knew she understood wearing, so I chose two fine strong reeds, and splitting
them carefully, bound them together again, that when dry they might be
quite straight and equal, and fit for a frame. Smaller reeds were out into
pieces and sharpened, for the teeth of the comb. The boys did this for me
without in the least knowing their use, and great fun they made of "father's
monster toothpicks."

In time all the various parts of the loom were made ready and put
together, my wife knowing nothing of it, while to the incessant questions
of the children I replied mysteriously--

"Oh, it is an outlandish sort of musical instrument; mother will know
how to play upon it."

And when the time came for presenting it her joy was only equalled

 

['7ng 41733ng and 101111612? it'll ji'zu'd' gut baht f>> far/qr firma (p. 161)).

by the amusement and interest with which the children watched her move-
ments while "playing the loom," as they always said.

About this time, a beautiful little foal, a son of the onager, was added
to our stud, and as he promised to grow up strong and tractable, we soon
saw how useful he would be. The name of Swift was given to him, and
he was to be trained for my own riding.

The interior arrangements of the cavern being now well- forward, I
applied myself to conniving an aqueduct, that fresh water might be led
close up to our care, for it was a long way to go to fetch it from Jackal
River, and especially inconvenient on washingr days. As I wanted to do
this before the rainy season began, I set about it at once.

Pipes of hollow bamboo answered the purpose well, and a large cask168 I'll/5 S {IV/SS FAM'IL Y ROBIAVSOA".

formed the reservoir. The supply was good, and the comfort of having it
close at hand so great, that the mother declared she was as well pleased
with our engineering as it' we had made her a fountain and marble basin
adorned with mermaids and dolphins.

Anticipating the setting in of the rains, I pressed forward all work
connected with stores for the winter, and great was the in-jathering of roots,
fruits, and grains, potatoes, rice, guavas, sweet acorns, pine-cones; load after
load arrived at the cavern, and the mother's active needle was in constant.
requisition, as the demand for more sacks and bags was incessant.

Casks and barrels of all sorts and sizes were pressed into the service,
until at last the raft was knocked to pieces, and its tubs made to do "duty
in the store-rooms.

The weather became very unsettled and stormy.

Heavy clouds gathered in the horizon, and passing storms of wind, with
thunder, lightning, and torrents of rain, swept over the face of nature from
time to time. -

The sea was in frequent commotion; heavy ground-swells drove masses
of water hissing and foaming against the cliffs. Everything heralded the
approaching rains. All nature joined in sounding forth the solemn overture.
to the grandest work of the year.

It was now near the beginning of the month of June, and we had
twelve weeks of bad weather before us.

We established some of the animals with ourselves at the salt-cave.
'l'he cow, the ass, Lightfoot, Storm, and the dogs were all necessary to us,
while Knips, Fangs, and the eagle were sure to be a great amusement in
the long evenings.

The boys would ride over to Falconhurst very often to see that all
was in order there and fetch anything required.

Much remained to be done in order to give the cave a comfortable
appearance, which became more desirable now that we had to live indoors.

The darkness of the inner regions annoyed me, and l set myself to
invent a remedy.

Al'tcr some thought, I called in Jack's assistance, and we got a very
tall, strong bamboo, which would reach right up to the vaulted roof. This
we planted in the earthen floor, securing it well by driving wedges in round
it. Jack ascended this pole very cleverly, taking with him a hammer and
chisel to enlarge a crevice in the roof so as to fix a pulley, by mcans of
which, when he descended, I drew up a large ship's lantern, well supplied
with oil, and as there were four wicks it afforded a veryr fair amount
of light. '

Several days were spent in arranging the tlilTerent rooms.

Ernest and Franz undertook the library, fixing shelves and setting the
books in order.

Jack and his mother took in hand the sitting-room and kitchen, while
Fritz and l, as better able for heavy work, arranged the workshops. The
carpenter's bench, the turning-lathe, and a large chest of tools were set in
convenient places, and many tools and instruments hung on the walls.

An adjoining chamber was fitted up as a forge, with fire-place, bellows,
and anvil complete, all which we had found in the ship, packed together,
and ready to set up.

When the great affairs were settled, we still found in all directions work
to be done. Shelves, tables, benches, movable steps, cupboards, pegs, door
handles, and bolts--there seemed no end to our requirements, and we often
thought of the enormous amount of" work necessary to maintain the comforts
and conveniences of life which at home we had received as matters of course.

But, in reality, the more there was to do the better; and I never ceased
contriving fresh improvements, being fully aware ofthc importance of constant
employment as a means of strengthening and maintaining the health of
mind and body. This, indeed, with a consciousness of continual progress
towards a desirable end, is found to constitute the main element of
happiness.

Our rocky home was <<greatly improved by a wide porch which I made
along the whole front of our rooms and entrances, by levelling the ground
to form a terrace, and sheltering it with a verandah of bamboo, supported
by pillars of the same.

Ernest and Franz were highly successful as librarians.

The books, when unpacked and arranged, proved to be a most valuable
collection, capable of all'ording,r every sort of educational advantage.

Besides a variety of books of voyages, travels, divinity, and natural
history (several containing line coloured illustrations), there were histories
and scientific works, as well as standard fictions in several languages; also
a good assortment of maps, charts, mathematical and astronomical instruments,
and an excellent pair of globes.

I foresaw much interesting study on discovering that we possessed the
grammars and dictionaries of a great many languages, a subject {or which
we'all had a taste. With French we were well acquainted. Fritz and
Ernest had begun to learn English at school, and made further progress
during a visit to England. The mother, who had once been intimate with
a Dutch family, could speak that language pretty well.

After a great deal of discussion, we agreed to study different languages,
so that in the event of meeting with people of other nations there should
be at least one of the family able to communicate with them.

All determined to improve our knowledge of German and French.

The two elder boys were to study English and Dutch with their
mother.

Ernest, already possessing considerable knowledge of Latin, wished to
continue to study it, so as to be able to make use of the many works on
natural history and medicine written in that language.

Jack announced that he meant to learn Spanish "because it sounded
so grand and imposing."r;o 771E SIT/75$ .FA [VIZ Y ROBIA'S 01"

I myself was interested in the Malay language, knowing it to be so widely
spoken in the islands of the Eastern Seas, and thinking it as likely as any
other to be useful to us.

Our family circle by-and-by represented Babel in miniature, for scraps
and fragments of all these tongues kept buzzing about our cars from morning
to night, each sporting his newly acquired word or sentence on every possible
occasion, propounding idioms and peculiar expressions, like riddles, to puzzle
the rest.

In this way, the labour of learning was very considerably lightened,
and every one came to know a few words of each language.

OCC sionally we amused ourselves by opening chests and packages hitherto
untouched, and brought unexpected treasures to light--mirrors, wardrobes,
a pair of console tables with polished marble tops, elegant writing--tables
and handsome chairs, clocks of various descriptions, a musical-box, and a
clironometer were found; and by degrees our abode was fitted up like a
palace, so that sometimes we wondered at ourselves, and felt as though we
were strutting about in borrowed plumes.

The children begged me to decide on a name for our salt-cave dwelling,
and that of Rockhurg was chosen unanimously.

The weeks of imprisonment passed so rapidly that no one found time
hang heavy on his hands.

Books occupied me so much that but little carpentering was done, yet
l made a yoke for the oxen, a pair of cotton-wool carders, and a spinning--
wheel for my wife.

As the rainy season drew to a close, the weather for a while became
wilder, and the storms liercer than ever. Thunder roared, lightning blazed,
torrents rushed towards the sea, which came in raging hillows to meet
them, lashed to fury by the tempests of wind which swept the surface of
the deep.

The uproar of the elements came to an end at last.

Nature resumed her attitude of repose, her smiling aspect of peaceful

eauty; and soon all traces of the ravages of floods and storms would dis-
appear bencath the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics.

Gladly quitting the sheltering walls of Rockburg to roam once more in
the open air, we CI'()SS'CEUR1 Jackal River for a walk along the coast, and presently
Fritz with his sharp eyes observed something on the small island near
Flamingo Marsh, which was, he said, long and rounded, resembling a boat
bottom upwards.

Examining it with the telescope, I could form no other conjecture, and
we resolved to make it the object of an excursion next day, being delighted
to resume our old habit of starting in pursuit of adventure.

T he beat \"as accordingly got in readiness; it required some repairs
and fresh pitching, and then we made for the point of interest, indulging
in a variety of surmiscs as to what we should find.

It proved to be a huge stranded whale.PREP/1 RING ["012 I'VL'VI 151?. l'.' l

The island being steep and rocky, it was necessary to be careful; but
we found a landing place on the farther side. The boys hurried by the
nearest way to the beach where lay the monster of the deep, w'nilel
clznnbered to the highest point of the islet, which commanded a View of the
mainland from Rockburg to Falconhurst.

0n rejoining my sons, 1 found them only half way to the great fish,
and as I drew near they shouted in high glee:

"Ohl father, just look at the glorious shells and coral branches we are
finding. How does it happen that there are such quantities 1'"

"Only consider how the recent storms have stirred the Ocean to its
depths! No doubt thousands of shell-fish have been detached from their
rocks and dashed in all direcLions by the waves, which have thrown ashore
even so huge a creature as the whale yonder."

"Yes; isn't he a frightful great brute!" (tried Fritz. "Ever so much
larger than he seemed from a distanw. The worst of it is, one does not
well see what use to make of the huge carcasc."

"Why, make train-oil, to be sure," said Ernest. "I can't Say he's a1'72 I'll/2' Sill/INS Fri 1-! ll Y RORIAWOA-'I

beauty, though, and it is much pleasantcr to gather these lovely shells
than to cut up biubbcr."

"Well, let us amuse ourselves with them for the present," said I, "but
in the afternoon, when the sea is calmer, we will return with the necessary
implements, and see it' we can turn the stranded whale to good account,"

We were soon ready to return to the boat, but Ernest had a fancy for
remaining alone on the island till we came back, and asked my permission
to do so, that he might experience, for an hour or two, the sensations of
Robinson Crusoe.

To this, however, I would not consent, assuring him that our fate, as
a solitary family, gave him quite sullicient idea of shipwreck on an unin--
habited island, and that his lively imagination must supply the rest.

The boys found it hard work to row back, and began to beg of me to
exert my wonderful inventive powers in contriving some kind of rowing--
machine.

"You lazy fellows!" returned 1 ; "give me the great clockwork out ol"
a church tower, perhaps I might be able to relieve your labours."

"Oh, fatherl" cricd Fritz, "don't you know there are iron wheels in
the clockwork of the large kitchen-jacks? I'm sure mother would give
them up, and you could make something out of them, could you not?"

" By the time I have manufactured a rowing-machine out of a roasting-
jaek, I think your arms will be pretty well inured to the use of your oars!
However, I am far from dcspising the hint, my dear Fritz."

"Is coral of any use ?" demanded Jack suddenly.

"In former times it was pounded and uscd by chemists; but it is now
chiefly used for various ornaments, and made into beads for necklaces, Sec.
As such, it is greatly prized by savages, and were we to fall in with natives
we might very possibly find a store of coral useful in bartering with
them. _

"For the present we will arrange these treasures of the deep in our
library, and make them the beginning of a Museum of Natural History,
which will afford us equal pleasure and instruction."

" One might almost say that coral belongs at once to the animal, vege-
table, and mineral kingdoms," remarked Fritz; "it is hard like stone, it has
stems and branches like a shrub, and I believe tiny insects inhabit the Cells,
do they not, father?"

"You are right, Fritz; coral consists of the calcareous cells of minute
animals, so built up as to form a tree--like structure.

"The coral fishery gives employment to many men in the Persian Gulf,
the h'chitcrranean Sea, and other places. The instrument commonly used
consists of two heavy beams of wood, secured together at right angles, and
loaded with stones. Hemp and netting are attached to the under side of
the beams, to the middle of which is fastened one end of a strong rope, by

which the apparatus is let down from a boat, and guided to the spots where
the coral is most abundant. -PRlz'PAlf/JVG FOR "7377178. r73

"The branches of the coral become entangled in the hemp and net-
work; they are broken 09f from the rock, and are drawn to the surface 01'
the water.

"liclt undisturbed, these coral insects, labouring incessantly, raise l'onn-
dations, on which, in course of time, fertile islands appear, clothed with
verdure, and inhabited by man."

"Why, father, here we are at the landing place!" exclaimed Jack: " It
has seemed quite easy to pull since you began to tell us such interesting
things."

"Very interesting indeed; but did you notice that the wind had
changed, Jack ?" remarked Ernest, as he shipped his oar.

'l'hc animated recital of our adventures, the sight of the lovely shells
and corals, and the proposed work for the afternoon inspired the mother
and Franz with a great wish to accompany us.

To this I gladly consented, only stipulating that we should go pro-
vided with food. water, and a compass. " For," said I, "the sea has
only just ceased from its raging, and, being at the best of times of un-
certain and capricious nature, we may charm: to be detained on the island,
or forced to land at a considerable distance from home."

Dinner was quickly despatched, and preparations set on foot.

The more oil we could obtain the better, for a great deal was used
in the large lantern which burnt day and night in the recesses of the
cave; therefore all available casks and barrels were pressed into the ser--
vice; many, of course, once full of pickled herrings, potted pigeons, and
other winter stores, were now empty, and we took a goodly fleet of these
in tow.

Knives, hatchets, and the boys" climbing bnskins were put on board,
and we set forth, the labour of the oar beingY greater than ever now
that our freight was so much increased.

The. sea being calm, and the tide suiting better, we found it easy
to land close to the whale; my first care was to place the boat, as well
as the casks, in perfect security, after which we proceeded to a close
inspection oi our prize.

Its enormous size quite startled my wife and her little boy, the
length being from sixty Lo sixty-live feet, and the girth between thirty
and forty, while the weight could not have been less than 50,000 pounds.

The colour was a uniform velvety black, and the enomious head
about one-third of the length of the entire bulk, the eyes quite small,
not much larger than those of an ox, and the cars almost undiscernible.

The jaw opened very far baclt, and was nearly sixteen feet in length,
the most curious part of its structure being the remarkable substance
known as whalcbonc, masses of which appeared all along the jaws, solid
at the base, and splitting into a sort of fringe at the extremity. This
arrangement is for the purpose of aiding the whale in procuring its food
and separating it from the water.174 ' III/1' SJ-l/ISS Iv'A rid/LY ROBIA'SOJV.

The tongue was remarkably large, soil, and full of oil; the opening
of the throat wonderfully small, scarcely two inches in diameter.

"Why, what can the monster eat?" exclaimed Fritz; "he never
can swallow a proper mouthful down this little gulle'tl"

"The mode of feeding adopted by the whale is so curious," I replied,
"' that I 'must explain it to you before we begin to work.

"This animal (for I should tell you that a whale is not a fish, he
possesses no gills, he breathes atmospheric air, and would be drowned if
too long detained below the surface of the \mter')----this animal, then,
frequents those parts of the ocean best supplied with the various crea--
tures on which he feeds. Shrimps, small fish, lobsters, various inolluscs,
and medusau form his diet. Driving with open mouth through the cou-
gregated shoals of these little creatures, the whale engulfs them by inil~
lions in his enormous jaws, and continues. his destructive course until he
has sufficiently charged his mouth with prey.

"Closing his jaws and forcing out through the interstices of the whale'
bone the water which he has taken together with his prey, he retains
the captured animals, and swallows them at his leisure.

"The nostrils, or blow-holes, are placed, you see, on the upper part
of the head, in order that the whale may rise to breathe, and repose
on the surface of the sea, showing very little of his huge carcasc.

"The breathings are called 'spoutings,' becaus'c a column of mixed
vapour and water is thrown from the blow-holes, sometimes to a height
of twenty feet.

"And now, boys, fasten on your buskins, and let me see if you can
face the work of climbing this slippery mountain of flesh and cutting
it up."

Fritz and Jack stripped, and went to work directly, scrambling over
the back to the head, where they assisted me to cut away the lips, so
as to reach the whalebonc, a large quantity of which was detached and
carried to the boat.

Ernest laboured inaufully at the creature's side, cutting out slabs of
blubbcr, while his mother and Franz helped as well as they could to
put it in (tasks.

Presently we had a multitude of nnbidden guests.

The air was filled by the shrill screams and hoarse croaks and cries
of numbers of birds of prey; they flow around us in ever narrowing
circles, and becoming bolder as their voracity was excited by the near
view of the tempting prey, they alighted close to us, snatching morsels
greedily from under the very strokes of our knives and hatchets.

Our work was seriously interrupted by these feathered maranders,
who, after all, were no greater robbers than we ourselves. We kept them
01f as well as we could by blows from our tools, and several were killed,
my wife taking possession of them immediately for the sake of the
feathers.PREP/i Ir'IA-'L' FOR 1471A"! Eli'r 1:3

it was nearly time to leave the island, but first I stripped off a
long piece of the skin, to he used for traces, harness, and other leather-
work. It was about three-quarters of an inch thick, and very soft and
oily--but I knew it would shrink and be tough and durable.

I also took a part of the gurus in which the roots of the halceu,
or whalebone, were still imhcdded, having read that this is considered quite
a delicacy, as well as the skin, which, when properly dressed and cut
in little cubes, like black dice, has been compared by enthusiastic and
probably very hungry tmvellers to cocoanut and cream-cheese.

The boys thought the tongue might prove equally palatable, but I
valued it only on account of the large quantity of oil it contained.

With a heav v freight we put to sea, and made "hat haste we could
to reach home and cleanse our perSOns item the unpleasant traces ol
the disgusting work in which we had spent the da).

Next morning we started at dawn. My wife and Franz were left
behind, for our proposed work was even more horrible than that or" the
preceding day; they could not assist, and had no inclination to witness it.

It was my intention to open the cat-case completely, and, penetratingr
the interior, to 'obtain various portions of the intestines, thinking that it
would be possible to convert the larger ones into vessels lit for holdingr
the oil. This time we laid aside our clothes and were only strong canvas
trousers when we commenced operations, which were vigorously carried
on during the whole of the day; then, satisfied that we could do so
with a clear conscience, we abandoned the remains to the birds of
prey, and, with a full cargo, set sail for home.

On the way, it appeared to strike the boys (who had made not
the slightest objection to the singularly unpleasant task 1 had set them)
as very strange that I should wish to p0SSess what they had been working
so hard to procure for me.

"What can have made you wish to bring away that brute's entrails,
father? Are they of any use?"

"There are countries," I replied, "where no wood grows of which
to make barrels, and no hemp for thread, string, and (tordage. Necessity,
the mother of all the more valuable inventions, has taught the inhabitants
of those countries, Greenlanders, Esqniinaux, and others, to think of sub-
stitutes, and they use the intestines of the whale for one purpose, the
sinews and nerves [or the other."

We were right glad to land and get rid, for the present, of our
unpleasant materials, the further preparation of which was work in store
for the following day. A refreshing bath, clean clothes, and supper cheered
us all up, and we slept in peace.AN uxn-'Ereom: VISITOR.

" 1 TOW for the finishingr up of this dirty job," cried I, merrily, as we all

woke up next morning at daybreak. And after the regular work
was done, we commenced operations by raising a stand or rough scaffold,
on which the tubs hill of blubber were placed and heavily pressed, so that
the purest and finest oil overflowed into vessels underneath.

The biubber was afterwards boiled in a cauldron over a fire kindled at
some distance from our abode, and by skimming and straining through a
coarse cloth, we succeeded in obtaining a large supply of excellent train-oil,
which, '11 ca ' and bags made of the intestines, was safely stowed away in
the "cellar," as the children called our roughest storea'oom. This day's work
was far from agreeable, and the dreadful smell oppressed us all, more
especially my poor wife, who, nevertheless, endured it with her accustomed
good temper, although she very urgently recommended that the new island
should he the headquarters for another colony, where, said she, "any animals
we leave would be safe from apes and other plunderers, and where you
would lind it so very Convenient to boil whale-blubber, strain train--oil, and
the like."

This proposal met. with hearty approval, especially from the boys, who
were always charmed with any new plan ; and the} were eager to act. upon
it at once, hut. when l reminded them of the putri ying carcasc which lay
there, thev confessed it would be better to allow wind and storms, birds
and insects, to do their work in purging the atmosphere and reducing the
whale to a skeleton before we revisited the island.

The idea of a rowingdnaehine kept recurring to my brain. 1 determined
to attempt to make one. i took an iron bar, which when laid across the
middle of the boat projected about a foot each way. I provided this bar
in the middle with ribbed machinery, and at each end with a sort of nave,
in which, as in a cartwhcel, four flat spokes, or paddles, were fixed obliquely.
These were intended to do the rowers' part.

Then the jack was arranged to act upon the nmchincry in the middle
ol' the iron cross-bar, in such a ray that one ol' its strong cogwheels bit.4 .-\' taro-1'1. (12315 i- is; 7013. l ;: ;-

firmly into the ribs, so that when it was wound up, it caused the bar to
revolve rapidly, or" course turning with it the paddles fixed at either end,
which consequently struck the water so as to propel the boat.

Although this contrivance loft much to be desired in the way of im-
provement, still when Fritz and l wound up the machinery, and went otl~
on a trial trip across the bay, we splashed along at such a tamous rate that
the shores rang with the cheers and clapping of the whole l'amilv, delighted
to behold what they considered my brilliant success. '

the dresses, arms, and food which would be required, and we retired early
to rest.

Intendingr to ix: out all da\'. the house was left in good order, and we
departed on our expedition, provided, among other things, with spades and
mattoeks, for I wished to get young cocoanut trees and shrubs of ditl'erent
kinds, that, on our way back, we might land on Whale island, and begin

our plantation there.

We directed our course towards the opposite side of the bay. The sea
was smooth, my rowing-machine performed its work easily, and leaving
Safety Bay and Shark Island behind us, we enjoyed at our ease the panorama
of all the coast scenery.

Landing near Prospect Hill, we moored the boat, and walked through
the woods to our little farm, obtaining son-re fresh cocoanuts, as well as
young plants, on the way.

Before coming in sight of the. cottage at the farm, we heard the cocks
qrow, and I experienced a sudden rush of emotion as the sound recalled in
a degree painfully vivid the recollection of many a ride and walk at home,
when we would be greeted by just such familiar sounds as we approached
some kind friend's house. llere, but for the unconscious animals, utter soli-
tude and silence prevailed, and I with my dear family, whose visit would
have been hailed with delight in so many homes, advanced unnoticed to
this lonely cottage. So long had been our absence that our arrival created
a perfect panic. The original animals had forgotten us, and to their progeny,
lambs, kids, and chickens, who had never seen the face of man, we Seemed
an army of fierce foes.

The boys found it impossible to milk the goats, until, by the use 0!
the lasso, they captured them one after the other, bound their legs; then,
giving them salt to lick, they soon obtained a supply of excellent milk, which
was poured from the cocoanut shells they used into calabash flasks, so that
we could take with us what was not required at dinner.

The {owls were enticed by handfuls of grain and rice, and my wife
caught as many as she wished for.

We were by this time very ready for (linncr, and the cold provisions
we had with us were set forth, the chief dish consisting of the piece of
whale's tongue, which, by the boys' desire, had been cooked with a special
view to this entertainment.

But woeful was the disappointment when the tongue was tasted! One
after another, with dismal face, pronounced it "horrid stint," begged for some
pickled herring to take away the taste of train~oil, and willingly bestowed
on Fangs the cherished dainty.

Fortunately there was a sullicient supply of other eatables, and the fresh
delicious cocoannts and goat's milk put every one in good humour again.

While the mother packed everything up, Fritz and I got some sugar-
cane shoots which I wished to plant, and then we returned to the shore
and again embarked.

Before returning to Whale Island, I felt a strong wish to round Cape
Disappointment and survey the coast immediately beyond, but the promon-
tory maintained the character of its name, and we found that a long sand-
bank, as well as hidden reefs and rocks, ran out a great way into the sea.

Fritz eSpying breakers ahead, we put about at once, and, aided by a
light. breeze, directed our course towards Whale Island.

boys assisted me for awhile, but wearied somewhat of the occupation, and
one after another went off in search of shells and coral, leaving their mother
and me to finish the work.

Presently Jack came back, shouting loudly:

"Father! Mother! do Come and look. There is an enormous skeleton
lying here; the skeleton of some fearful great beast--a mammoth, I should
think."

"Why, Jack!" returned I, laughing, "have you forgot our old acquain-
tance, the whale? What else could it be?

"Oh no, father, it is not the whale. This thing has not lish bones, but
real good honest huge beast bones. I don't know what can have become
of the whale--floated out to sea most likely. This mammoth is ever so
much bigger. Come and see i"

As I was about to follow the boy, a voice from another direction smi-
(lenly cried:

"Father! father! a great enormous turtle! Please make haste. It is
waddling back to the sea as hard as it can go, and we can't stop it."

This appeal being more pressing, as well as more important than Jack's.
I snatched up an oar and hastened to their assistance.

Sure enough a large turtle was scrambling quickly towards the water.
and was within a few paces of it, although Ernest was valiantly holding on
by one of its hind legs.

I sprang down the bank, and making use of the oar as a lever, we
succeeded with some difficulty in turning the creature on its back.

It was a huge specimen, fully eight feet long, and being now quite
helpless, we left it sprawling, and went to inspect Jack's mammoth skeleton,
which, of course, proved to be neither more nor less than that of the whale.
I convinced him of the fact by pointing out the marks of our feet on the
ground, and the broken jaws where we had hacked out the whalebone.

" What can have made you take up that fancy about a mammoth, my
boy?"

"Ernest put it into my head, father. He said there seemed to be the
skeleton of an antediluvian monster there, so I ran to look closer, and 1
never thought of the whale, when I saw no fish bones. I suppose Ernest
was joking."

"Whales are generally considered as fishes by those little acquainted
with the animal kingdom, but they belong to the class of mannnals, which
comprises man, the monkey tribes, the bats, the dogs and eats, all hoofed
animals, whales and their allies, with other animals, the last on the list
being the sloth.

"The name by which they are distinguished is derived from the Latin
word 'mamma,' a breast, and is given to them because all the species
belonging to this class are furnished with a set of organs, called the
mammary glands, secreting the liquid known as milk, by which the young
are nourished.
"The bones or" the whale differ from those of animals simply in being
of a hollow construction, and filled with air so as to render the carmse more
buoyant. The bones of birds are also hollow, for the same reason, and in
all this we see conspicuously the wisdom and goodness oft'ne great Creator."

"What a marvellous structure it is, father I" said Fritz. "What a pon-
dcrous mass of bones! Can we not make use of any of them?"

"Nothing strikes me at this moment; we will leave them to bleach
here yet awhile, and perhaps by sawing them up afterwards, make a few
chairs, or a reading-desk for the museum. But now it is time to return
home. Bring the boat round to where the turtle awaits his fate; we must:
settle how to deal with him."

It was soon decided that he must swim. I fastened the empty water-
cask to a long line, one end of which was made fast to the bow of the
boat, the other carefully passed round the. neck and fore paws of the creature,
who was then lifted, so as to let him regain his feet, when he instantly
made for the water, plunged in; the cask floated after him, and prevented
his sinking. \Ve were all on board in a moment; and the worthy fellow.
after Wtinly attempting to dive, set himself diligently to swim right forwards
towing us comfortably after him. I was ready to cut the line on the least
appearance of danger, and kept him on the course for Safety Bay l ' striking
the water with a boat-hook right or left, according as the turtle was disposed
to turn too much one way or the other.

The boys were delighted with the fun, and compared me to Neptune
in his car, drawn by dolphins, and accompanied by Amphitrite and attendant
'l'ritons.

\V'c landed safely at the usual place, near Rockburg, and the turtle
was condemned and executed soon afterwards; the shell, which was quite
eight feet long and three broad, was, when cleaned and prepared, to form
a trough for the water supply at the cave, and the meat was Ca'efnlly salted,
and stored up for many a good and savoury meal.

It had been my intention to bring a piece of land under cultivation
before the next rainy season, to be sown with different sorts of grain; but
many unforeseen circumstances had intervened to hinder this, and our ani-
mals, unaccustomed to the yoke, were not available for the plough.

I therefore gave up the idea for the present, and applied myself,
with Ernest's assistance, to completing the loom, which, although the work--
manship was clumsy, l suc;eeded in making quite fit for use.- I had for--
tunately in my younger days spent many hours in the workshops of weavers
and other artizans, and therefore I understood more than might have been
expected of their various crafts. ._

l'nstc 01' size was required to smear over the threac'; but we could
not spam flour for such a purpose, and I used isinglass, which kept the warp
moist perfectly well, and spared us the necessity of setting up' the loom in
a damp, uncomfortable place, which has often to be done trfpi'ereut the

the spoils of the chase having furnished as with plenty of leather, with

stuffing; and ere long the animals were equipped with saddles. stirrups,

riders and drivers.

This occupation was followed by a great deal of work connected with
the annual return 01' the herring.r shoals, which now took place; to them
succeeding, as on former occasions, shoals 01" other fish, and many seals.
More than ever aware of the value ol' 1111 of these, we (lid not fail to 11111111:
good use of our opportunities, and captured large 1111111bers.

The boys were getting anxious for another shooting expedition: but
before undertaking that I wished to do some basket-111aking, as sacks were
beginning to fail us, and there was constant. 111111111111] for baskets in which
to carry and keep our roots and fruits. Our first attempts were clumsy
enough; but, as usual, perseverance was rewarded, and we produced a
good supply of" all sorts and sues. One very large basket 1 furnished
with openings through which to pass a strong suck, so that 11: might. when
heavily laden, be carried by two persons.

No sooner did the children see the force of this idea than they
got a bamboo, and, popping little Franz into the basket, carried him about
in triumph.

This amusement Suggested a fresh notion to Fritz "' 011,1'11ther."
111611 111:, "dont \011 think no might make something like this 1'01 niothm,
and carrv hei much more coun'ortablv than jolting along in the cait. "'

The boys shouted with glee at the proposal, and though tl1e1r mother
thought the plan feasible enough, she confessed that she did not much like
the thoughts of sitting in the middle of a basket, and just looking out now
11nd then over the rim.

However, I assured her it should be a well-shaped Quintoitable sedan--
1:hair, or litter; and the next question was how it should be carried, sinc:
the boys could not play the part of Indian palanqnimbearers, either 11'1'111
safety to their mother or with any pleasure to themselves.

"The hull and the buffalo!" cried Jack. "Why not use them for it?
Let's go and try them now 1"

Off ran the boys, and in a short time the basket was securolv hung

appearing onlv a little surmised at the new 'rangenicnt.

as they passed us; "it snings and rocks wally soothingly. ()uicke1, F1itz!182 7H}? SIVISS [21511.]..1/ 180518239015

  

go quit er!" and the trot pleasing him equally well, the pace gradually
quickened, till the animals were going along at a rate which shook and
jolted the basket about most fearfully. Ernest called and'screamed in vain
for a halt. llis brothers thought it capital fun to "shake up" the "professor,"
and made the circuit of the level ground near Rockburg, finally pulling
up in front of us, like performers stopping to receive the applause of
spectators. . .

It was impossible to help laughing, the scene was so ridiculous, but
lirucst was very angry with his brothers, his reproaches provoked high words
in reply, and a quarrel was imminent, but I interfered, and showed them how
easily a joke carried too far would lead to disputes and bad feeling, urging
them to avoid on all occasions any breach of the good-fellowship and bro--
therly lure which was the mainstay of our strength and happiness.

Good humour was soon restored, Ernest himself helped to uuharness
the. hens's and got some handfuls of salt and barleyr to reward their exer-
tions. saying that they must have some more palanquin practice another day.

l was seated with my wife and. Fritz beneath the shade of the ver-
andah, engaged in wicker-"wilt, and Chatting pleasantly, when suddenly Fritz
got up, advanced a step or two, gazing fixedly along the avenue which led
from Jackal River, then he exclaimed--

"1 see something so strange in the distance, father! What in the
world can it he? lirst it seems to be drawn in coils on the ground like a
cable, then upriscs as if it were a little mast, then that sinks, and the coils
move along again. It is comingr towards the bridge."

My, wife took alarm at this description, and calling the other boys,
retreated into the cave, where I desired them to close up the entrances, and
keep watch with firearms at the upper windows. These were openings we
had made in the rock at some elevation, reached within by steps, and a kind
of gallery which passed alongr the front of the rooms.

1" ritz remained by me while I examined the object through my spy--glass.

"It is, as I feared, an enormous serpent!" cried I; "it advances
(iircctfy this way, and we shall be placed in the greatest poss: 1e danger, for
it will cross the bridge to a certainty."

"May we not attack it, father?" exclaimed the brave boy.

"Only with the greatest caution," returned I; "it is far too formidable,
and too tenacious of life, for us rashly to attempt its destruction. Thank
(Sod we are at Roekbnrg, where we can keep in safe retreat, while we watch

 

- for an opportunity to destroy this frightful enemy. Go up to your mother

new. and assist in preparing the firearms; I will join you directly, but 1
must'further observe the monster's movements."

Fritz left me unwillingly, while 1 continued to watch the serpent, which
was of gigantic size, and already much too near the bridge to admit of the
possibility of removing that means of access to our dwelling. l recolleetcd,
too, how easily it would pass through the walls. The reptile advanced with

the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and slowly turning it about, as though
on the look--out for prey.

As it Crossed the bridge, with a slow, suspicious motion, I withdrew,
and hastily rejoined my little party, which was preparing to garrison our
fortress in warlike array, but with considerable trepidation, which my pre--
sence served in a measure to allay.

We placed ourselves at the upper openings, after strongly harrieadiug
everything below, and, ourselves unseen, awaited with heating hearts the
further advance of the foe, which speedily became visible to us.

Its movements appeared to become uncertain, as though puzzled by the
trace of human habitation; it turned in different directions, coiling and un-
eoiling, and frequently rearing its head, but keeping about the middle ol'the
space in front of the cave, when suddenly, as though unable to resist doing
so, one after another the boys fired, and even their mother discharged her
gun. The shots took not the slightest effect beyond startling the monster,
whose movements were acetalerated. Fritz and I also fired with steadier
aim, but with the same want of success, for the monster, passing on with
:1 gliding motion, entered the recdy marsh to the left, and entirely dis--
appeared.

A wonderlhl weight seemed lifted from our hearts, while all eagerly
discussed the vast length and awful, though magnificent, appearance of the
serpent. I had recognised it as the boa constrictor. It was a vast specimen.
upwards of thirty feet in length.

I explained to the children that its name in South America is Boaguacu;
the first syllable of that word, with the Latin addition, which indicates that
it kills its prey by pressure, or "constriction," gives the name by which it
is commonly known.

The'near neighbourhood of this terrible reptile occasioned me the ut-
most anxiety; and I desired that no one should leave the house on any
pretence whatever, without my express permission.

During three whole days we were kept in suspense and fear, not daring
to stir above a few hundred steps from the door, although during all that
time the enem}r showed no sign of his presence.

In fact, we might have been induced to think the boa had passed across
the swamp, and found his way by some cleft or chasm through the wall 01'
cliffs heyond, had not the restless behaviour of our geese and ducks given
proof that he still lurked in the thicket of reeds which they Were accustomed
to 'make their nightly resting place.

They swam anxiously about, and with much clapping,r of wings and
disturbed cackling showed their uneasiness; finally, taking wing, they crossed
the harbour, and took up their quarters on Sharks Island.

My embarrassment increased as time passed on. I could not venture
to attack with insufficient force a monstrous and formidable serpent concealed
in dense thickets amidst dangerous swamps; yet it was dreadful to live in
a state of blockade, cut off from all the important duties in which we were- 134 777/? SUI'INS FAR/H, l" NDBIA-"SOA-i

engaged, and shut up with our animals in the unnatural light of the cave,
enduring constant anxiety and perturbation.

Out of this painful state we were. at last delivered by none other than
our good old simple-hearted donkey; not, however, by the exercise of a
praiseworthy quality, such as the vigilance olithe time-honoured geese oi" the
Capitol, but by sheer stupidity.

Our situation was rendered the more critical from having no great. stock
of provisions or fodder for the animals; and the hay failing us on the
evening of the third day, I determined to set them at liberty by sending
them, under the guidance of Fritz, across the river at the ford.

He was to ride Lightfoot, and they were to be fastened together until
safely over. .

Next morning we began to prepare for this by tying them in a line,
and while so engaged my wife opened the door, whcn old Grizzle, who was
l'resh and l'rolicsome alter the long rest and regular feeding, suddenly broke
away from the halter, cut some awkward capers, then, bolting ouz, careercd
at full gallop straight for the marsh.

In vain we called him by name; Frill would even have rushed alter.
him, had not I held him back. In another moment the ass w close to
the thicket, and with a cold shudder of horror we beheld the snake rear
itself from its lair, the fiery eyes glanced around, the dark deadly jaws
opened widely, the forked tongue darted grcedily forth--poor Grizzle's fate
was sealed.

Becoming aware on a sudden of his danger, he stopped short, spread
out all four legs, and set up the most piteous and discordant bray that ever
wrung echo from rocks.

Swift and straight as a {cutters thrust, the destroyer was upon him,
wound round him, entangled, eni'olded, compressed him, all the while
cunningly avoiding the convulsive kicks oi' the agonised animal.

A cry of horror arose from the spectators of this miserable tragedy.

"Shoot him, father! oh, shoot him--(lo save poor Grizzle I"

"My Children, it is impossible !" cried 1. "Our old friend is lost to us
for ever! T have hopes, however, that when gorged with his prey, we may
be able to attack the snake with some chance of" success."

"But the horrible wretch is never going to swallow him all at once,
father?" cried Jack. "That will be too shocking!"

"Snakes have no grinders, but only fangs, therefore they cannot chew
their food, and must swallow it whole. But although the idea is startling,
it is not really more shocking than the rending, tearing, and shedding of
blood which occurs when lions and tigers seize their prey."

"But," said Franz, "how can the snake separate the flesh from the
bones without teeth? And is this kind of snake poisonous?"

"No, dear child," said I, " only fearfully strong and ferocious. And it
has no need to tear the flesh from the bones. It swallows them, skin, hair,
and all, and digests everything in its stomach."A A" C-'_\'."l'"/','i. (TL-TIE IVS]? OR_ 185

"it seems utterly impossible that the broad ribs, the strongr legs, heals.
and all, should go down that throat," exclaimed Fritz.

"Only see," I replied, " how the monster deals with his victim; closer
and more tightly he curls his crushing folds, the bones give way, he is
kneading him into a shapeless mass. He will soon begin to gorge his prey,
and slowly but surely it will disappear down that distended maw !"

The mother, with little 'Franz, found the scene all too horrible. and
hastened into the cave, trembling and distressed.

To the rest of us there seemed a fearful fascination in the dreadful
sight, and we could not move than the spot. I expected that the boa,
before swallowing its prey, would cover it with saliva, to aid in the ope--
ration, although it struck me that its very slender forked tongue \-as about
the Worst possible implement for such a purpose.

It was evident to us, however, that this popular idea was erroneous.

The act of lubricating the mass must have taken place during the process
of swallowing; certainly nothing was applied beforehand.114.1"; 1'11]: .5 "USS I'L/l iii/I Y 11' OBIA" 50.1".

lhis 11'ond'eriul performance lasted lrom seven in the morning until
noon ' \V11en the 1111 kward morsel was entirely swallowed the serpent lav
stiff, (lmrted, and apparently insensible along the edge of the marsh.

I felt that now or never was the moment lor attack!

Calling on "my sons to maintain their courage and presence of mind, I
left our retreat with a feeling of joyous emotion quite new to me, and ap-
proached with rapid steps and levelled gun the out--stretched form of the
serpent._

Fritz followed me closely. Jack, somewhat timidly, came several paces
behind; while Ernest, after a little hesitation, remained where he was.

The monsters body was stiff and motionless, which made its rolling
and liery eyes and the slow spasmodic undulations of its tail more fearful
by contrast.

\Ve fired toget he1, and both halls entered the skull; the light 01" the
eye 1115 extinguished, and the only movement "as 111 the t1uthe1 e\'t1'en1it_1'
of the body, 1:1-'l1icl1 rolled, writhed, coiled, and lashed from side to side.

Advancing closeI, we [11 ed our pistols directly into its head, a convulsive
quiver 11111 through the mighty frame, and the boa constrictor lay dead.

As no raised a crv of victory, Jack, desirous of a share in the glory of
econqu st, ran close to the crcnt111e,lirimr his or stol into its side, when he
was sent sprawling over and over by a 11101e1nu11t of its tail excited to a
last galvanic effort by the shot.

Being in no way hurt, he speedily recovered his feet, and declared he
had given it its quietus.

"I hope the terrific noise v01; made just now was the szgnal of victory,"
said my wife, draining near, with the utmost cilcumspection, and holding
Franz tightly by the hand. "I was half afraid to come, I assure you."

"See this dreadful creature dead at our feet; and let us thank God that
we have been able to destroy such an enemy."

"What's to he done with him now?" asked Jack.

" Let us get him stlillhd," said l'ritz, " and set him up in the museunr
amongst our shells and corals."

"' Did anybody ever think of eating serpents ?" enquired Franz.

" Of course not I" said his mother. "Why, child, serpents are poisonous
~it would be very dangerous."

" Excuse me, my dear wife," said I. "Firstcf all, the boa is not
poisonous; and then, besides that, the flesh even of poisonous snakes can
be eaten without danger; as, for instance, the rattlesnake,' from which can

"Oh, what is a secretary bird?" interrupted Franz. "I thought :1

"So it does, Franz, and the bird Ernest spoke of has curious long
leathers projecting from either side of its head something like pens stuck
behind a. man's car; hence its name.

"It is perfectly true that it lives on snakes, lizards, toads, and frogs,

bird is an inhabitant of Southern Africa, and is never seen in North America,
neither does it ever fly in a flock; still, so ravenous is its appetite that, no
doubt, even one or two, had they by some miracle found themselves on
Lake Superior, would have been able to give a very good account of the
deadly reptiles, and at least shared in the glory of their extermination."

My wife having gone to prepare dinner, we continued talking as we
rested in the shade of some rocks, near the serpent, for a considerable time.
The open air was welcome to us after our long imprisonment; and we
were, besides, desirous to drive ofi' any birds ofprey who might be attracted
to the carcase, which we wished to preserve entire.

My boys questioned me closely on the subject of serpents in general;
and I described to them the action of the poison fangs; how they folded
back on the sides of the upper jaw; and how the poison~secreting glands
and reservoir are found at the back and sides of the head, giving to the
venomous serpents that peculiar width of head which is so unfailing a
characteristic.

"The fangs are hollow," said _I, " and when the creature bites, the
pressure forces down a tiny drop of the liquid poison, which enters the
wound, and, through the veins, quickly spreads over the entire system-
Sometimes, if taken in time, cures are et'feeted, but in most cases the bite
of a serpent is followed by speedy death."

The children were much interested in my account of the snake-charmers
ol' lndia, how they fearlessly handle the most deadly of the serpent tribe,
the Cobra di Capello--or Hooded Cobra--cause them to move in time to
musical sounds from a small pipe, twine the reptile about their arms and
bare necks, and then, to prove that the poison fangs have not been removed,
make them bite a fowl, which soon dies from the effects.

"How is it possible to extract the fangs, father?" asked Ernest.

"No instrument is required," replied l; "l have read the account written
by a gentleman in India, who saw a snake-charmer catch a large cohra in
the jungle, and for the purpose of removing the lungs, hold up a cloth at
which the irritated snake flew, and the fangs being caught in it, the man
seized the reptile by the throat, extracted them. and then squeezed out the
poison, a clear oily substance, upon a leaf."

"What does the rattle of the rattlesnake look like? and how does it
sound?"

"At the tip of the tail are a number of curious loose, horny structures
formed of the same substance as the scales. A very good idea of the
structure of the rattle may be fonned by slipping a number of thiinbles
loosely into each other.

" The rattlesnake lies coiled with its head llat, and the tip of its tail
elevated; when alarmed or irritated it gives a quivering movement to the
tail, which causes the joints of the rattle to shake against each other with a
peculiar sound not easily described: all animals, even horses newly brought
from Europe, tremble at this noise, and try to escape.":l .\-" I. '.\'H"/:'/. (DJ/If {7X17 (3'18. 15:;

" What is the best thing to ho (lone for the bite of a serpent?" en-
quired Fritz.

" Remedies are very various, Very uncertain, and differ with the species
inflicting the bite.

"Suction, ammonia, oii, the use 01' thu knife, application of fresh mould,

There is a creeping plant, Called Arislolodzrkz inn/(m, the leaves of which
have, in repeated instances, (lone wonders for fearful bites. It is found
in many parts of the world, but most plentifully in the hotter regions.

"A mode of cure adopted by the natives of India, Ceylon, and parts
of Africa is by the application of a remarkable object called snake-
stone. These are described'as llattish, something like half an almond with
squared ends, rather light, bearing a very high polish, and of an intense
jetty black.

" On being bitten by a cobra, the sufferer applies one of these 'stones'
to each puncture, where they adhere strongly for a time, live or six minutes
lacing about the average. They seem to absorb the blood as it flows
from the wound, and at last {all oil", when the danger is considered to
be over.

" But now we must leave this fertile subject of discussion, and 1 can
only say I sincerely trust we may never have cause to resume it from
the appearance of another serpent here, of any sort, size, or description.

"Corrie, Ernest, can you not give us an epitaph for our unfortunate
friend the donkey?

"\Vc must afi'm'd him more honourable sepnltnre than he enjoys at
present, when we proceed, as we speedily must, to disembowel his
murderer."

Ernest took the matter quite seriously, and planting his elbows on his
knees, he bent his thoughtful brow in his hands, and remained wrapt in
poetic meditation for about two minutes.

"1 have it!" cried he, " but perhaps you will all laugh at me?"

"No, no, don't be shy, oid fellow; spit it out!" and thus encouraged
hy his brother, Ernest, with the biush of a modest author, hogan--

" llurrah for the epitaph ! Well done, Emest I" resounded on all sides,
and taking out a large red pencil 1 used for marking,r wood, the lines were
forthwith inscribed on a great flat stone, being, as I told the boy, the very
best poetry that had ever been written on our coast.

We then had dinner, and afterwards went to work with the serpent.

The first operation was to recover the mangled remains of the a s,
which being effected, he was buried in the soft marshy ground close by,
and the hole filled up with fragments of rock.111V (.i';\7ItVl:'/L(.'()xiz'/5 l>>'/S/7'O/'\'. up

The double meaning of this sentence pleased us all immensely.

1.1EXPLORING l-ZXP!-'.I)i'l'l(').\'.'<,

lll$ vreatest danger to which we had yet been exposed was now over,

but there remained much anxiety in my mind lest another serpent

might, nnSoon by us, have entered the swamp, or might appear, as this had
(lone, from the country beyond Falcozihurst.

l projected then two excursions, the first to make a thorough examination
of the thicket and morass; the next right away to the Gap, through which
alone the arch-enemy could have entered our territory.

On summoning my sons" to accompany me to the marsh, I found neither
lirncst nor Jack very eager to do so, the latter vowing he had the cold
shivers each time he thought how his ribs might have been smashed by the
last flap of the snake's tail; but I did not yield to their reluctance, and we
finally set about crossing the marsh by placing planks and wicker hurdles
on the ground, and changing their places as we advanced.

Nothing vas discovered beyond traeks in the reeds and the creature's
lair; where the rushes, grass, and bogplants were beaten down.

Emergingr beyond the thicket we found ourselves on firm ground, near
the precipitous wall of rock, and perceived a clear sparkling brook flowing
from an opening, which proved to be a cave or grotto of considerable size.

The vaulted roof was covered with stalactitcs, while many formed stately
pillars, which seemed as though supporting the roof. The floor was strewn
with fine snow-white earth, with it smooth soapy feeling, whiCh I felt eon-
vinced was l'uller's earth.

"Well, this is a pleasant discovery!" said i. "This it as good as soap
for washing, and will save me the trouble of turning soap-boiler."

l'ereeiving that the streamlet flowed from an opening of some width in
the inner rock, Fritz passed through, in order to trace it to its source, pre-
sently shouting to me that the opening widened very much, and begging
me to follow him.

I (lid so, leaving the other boys in the outer cave, and fired a pistol--
shot--the reverbemting echoes of which testified to the great extent of the
place; and iighting the bit of candle I always carried with me, we advanced,

so vast a spam.EXPL 01cm? ,' zxzuxwmz . 193

 

Suddenly Fritz exclaimed 7'

"I verily believe this is a second cave of salt! See how the walls

"These cannot be salt crystals," said I; "the water which llows over
them leaves no track, and tastes quite sweet. I am rather inclined to
believe that we have penetrated into a cave of rock crystal!"

"Oh, how splendid! Then we have discovered a great treasure!"

"Certainly, if we could make any use of it; otherwise, in our situation,
it is about as valuable as the lump of gold found by good old Robinson
Crusoe."

"Anyhow, l will break OH" :1 piece for a specimen. See, here is a fine

is that of a pyramid, with six sides or

We had examined it in different directions;
and Fritz having secured a large lump,

a farewell shot for the sake of hearing

On reaching the open air we saw poor Jack sobbing bitterly, but as
soon as \'c appeared he ran joyfully towards us, and threw himself into
my arms.

"My child, what is the matter?" I cried, anxiously.

"Oh, I thought you were lost! I heard a noise twice, as if the rocks
had shattered down; and i. thought you and Fritz were crushed in the
ruins! it was horrible! I'Iow glad I am to see you!"

I comforted the child, and explained the noises he had heard, enquiring
why he was alone.

"Ernest is over there mnong the reeds; I daresay he did not hear the
shots."

I found Ernest busily engaged in wearing a basket in which to catch
fish; he had devised it ingeniously, with a funnel-shaped entrance, through
which the fish passing would not easily find their wa)r out, but would remain
swimming about in the wide part of the apparatus.

"I shot a youngr serpent while you were away, father," said he. " It
ies there covered with rushes; it is nearly four feet long, and as thick as
my arm."

"A serpent!" cried I, hurrying towards it in alarm, and fearing there
must be a brood of them in the swamp after ail.

"A line large eel, you mean, my boy. This will provide an excellent
supper for us to--night. I am glad you had the courage "to kill it, instead
of taking to your heels and fleeing from the supposed serpent." I

A "W ell, I thought it would be so horn'd to be pursued and caught that
I preferred facing it; my shot took effect, but it was very difficult to kill
the creature outright, it moved about, although its head was smashed."

"The tenacity of life possessed by eels is very remarkable," I said.
"I have heard that the best mode of killing them is to grasp them by the
neck and slap their tails smartly against a stone or post."

We made our way back more easily by keeping,r close to the chills,
where the ground was firmer, and found the mother washing clothes at the
fountain. She rejoiced greatly at our safe return, and was much pleased
with the supply of fuller's earth, as she said there was now very little soap
lelt. The eel was cooked for supper, and during the evening a full account
was given of our passage through the swamp, and discovery of the rock-
crystal cavern.

It was most important to ascertain whether any serpent lurked among
the woods of our little territory between the cliffs and the sea. Prepa4
rations were set on foot for the second and greater undertaking of a search
throughout the country beyond the river, as far as the Gap. I wished all the
family to go on the expedition, a decision which gave universal satisfaction.

Intending to he engaged in this search for several weeks, we took
the small tent and a store of all sorts of necessary provisions, as well
as firearms, tools, cooking utensils, and torches.

All these things were packed on the cart, which was drawn by Storm/;'.\'1'12 018ij G EXP/{DI 7702\"5. HIS

and (irumble. Jack and Franz mounted them, and rifled at once the part
of riders and drivers. My wife sat comfortably in the cart, Fritz rode in
advance, while Ernest and I walked; we were protected in flank by the
dogs and Fangs, the tame jackal.

Directing our course towards Woodlands, we saw many traces of the
serpent's approach to Rockburg. In some places, where the soil was loose,
the trail, like a broad furrow, was very evident indeed.

At Falconhurst we made a halt, and were, as usual, welcomed by the
poultry, as well as by the sheep and goats.

We then passed on to \\'oodlauds, where we arrived at nightfall. All
was peaceful and in good order; no track of the boa in that direction; no
signs of visits from mischievous apes; the little farm and its inhabitants
looked most. flourishing,

Next day was passed in making a survey of the immediate neighbour-
hood, at the same time collecting a quantity of cotton, which was wanted
for new pillows and cushions. In the afternoon Franz was my companion,
carrying a. small gun, entrusted to him for the first time.

We took Fan and Bruno with us, and went slowly along the left bank
of the lake, winding our way among reedy thickets, which frequently turned
us aside a considerable distance from the water. The (logs hunted about in
all directions, and raised duck, snipe, and heron. These usually flew directly
across the lake, so that Franz got no chance of a shot. He began to get
rather impatient, and proposed firing at the black swans we saw sailing
gracefully on the glassy surface of the lake.

Just then a harsh booming sound struck our ears. I paused in wonder
as to whence the noise proceeded, while Franz exclaimed, "Oh, father! can
that he Swift, our young onagcr ?"

" It cannot possibly be Swift," said I; adding, after listening attentively
a minute or two, "I am inclined to think it must be the cry of a bittern,
:1 line handsome bird of the nature of a heron."

"Oh! may I shoot it, father? But I wonder how a bird can make
that roaring noise! One would think it was an ox, it is more like lowing
than braying."

"'l'he noise creatures make depends more on the construction of the
windpipe, its relation to the lungs, and the strength of the muscles which
force out the breath, than on their size. As, for example, how loud is the
song of the nightingale and the little canary bird. Some people say that
the bittern booms with his long bill partly thrust into the boggy ground,
which increases the hollow niullled sound of its very peculiar cry."

Franz was very anxious that the first trophy of his gun should be so
rare a bird as the bittern ; the dogs were sent into the wood, and we waited
some distance apart, in readines to fire.

All at once there was a great rustling in the thicket. Franz fired, and
I heard his happy voice calling out:

"I've hit him! I've hit him!"
" What have you hit ?" shouted I in return.

"A wild pig," said he; "but bigger than Fritz's."

"Aha! I see you remember the agoutil Perhaps it is not a hog at
all, but one of our little pigs from the farm. What will the old sow say
to \ou, Franz?"

I soon joined my boy, and found him in transports of joy over an
animal certainly very much like a pig, although its snout. was broad and
blunt. It was covered with bristles, had no tail, and in colour was a yellow-
ish grey.

Examining it Carefully and noticing its webbed feet and its curious
teeth, I decided that it must be a capybara, a water-loving animal of South
America, and Franz was overjoyed to find that he had shot "a new crea-
ture," as he said. It was difficult to carry it home, but he very sensibly
proposed that we should open and clean the carcase, which would make it
lighter--and then, putting it in a game-bag, he carried it till quite tired out,
when he asked if I thought Bruno would let him strap it on his back. We
found the dog willing to bear the burden, and reached Woodlands soon
afterwards.

There we u ere surprised to see Ernest surrounded by a number of large
rats which lay dead on the ground.

"Where can all these have eonre from? ' exclaimed I "Have you and
your mother been rat- hunting instead of gathering rice as you intended?"

"We came upon these creatures quite unexpectedly," he replied; " while
in the rice swamp, Knips, who was with us, sprang away to a kind of
long~shaped mound among the reeds, and pounced upon something, which
tried to escape into a hole. He chattered and gnashed his teeth, and the
creature hissed and squeaked, and running up, I found he had got a big
rat by the tail; he would not let go, and the rat Could not turn in the
narrow entrance to bite him, but I soon pulled it out and killed it with
my stick.

"the mound was a curious-- looking erection, so I broke it open with
some diiliculty, and in doing this dislodged quite a dozen of the creatur.es

"On examining their dwelling I found it a vaulted tunnel made of clay

to one I stretched my game-bag across it, and then hammered on the roof
till a whole lot of rats sprang out, several right into the bag. I hit away
right and left, but began to repent of my audacity when I found the whole
community suarnriug about in the wildest cwitenrent, some escaping, but
manv stopping in bewilderment, "hile others actually attacked me.

"It was any thing but pleasant, I assure you, and I began to think of

"My mother had great (lifliculty in forcing her way through the marsh
to the scene of action, but reached me at last; and we collected all the
slain to show you, and for the sake of their skins."

This account exciLed my curiosity, and I went to examine the place
Ernest described; where I found, to my surprise, an arrangement much like
a beaver dam, though on a small scale, and less complete.

"You have discovered a colony of beaver rats," said I to Ernest, "so
called from their resemblance in skill and manner of life to that wonderful
creature.198 77f/t.' .S'I/VISA' PAM/Z Y ROBIA'SOIV.

We sat. do" 11 to supper, Franz eager to pa1take of his capybara. Even
he hinisrdl'111ade a l'uce at the peculiar flavour ol the meat.

"It is the musk which you taste," said I; and I desc1ihed to them the
various anzma'; s in which this strange liquid Is found; the musk-deer, musk- ~0x,
crocodile, musk-rat of ludia (also Called soudeli, uhich taints a corked bottle
of wine if it only runs across it'), ceneluding' with an account of the civet,
called also civet--C' t.

"The civet," said I, "is a handsome black and white animal, and the
nerfume obtained from it was fo1111eil_\_ considcwd a valuable medicine; in
the p1cscut day it is used chieflr as a scent. '1 his odo1il'erous substance

cannot turn round, 21 horn spoon is then introduced, and the perfume, a
thick oily stuff something like butter, is coolly scraped from the pouch, the
plundered Civet being then released from strait dumnce, until the supply is
re-l'orrned."

Presently Jack ran for his gmne-bag, producing some fruit which he had
forgotten. Several pale green apples, quite new to us, excited general
attention.

"Why, what are those? Are they good 2 l asked.

"I hope so, for we sadly want something to take away the taste of
Franz's beast," said jack; "but Fritz and I were afraid of eating some awful
poison or other, like the manchineel, so we brought them for the inspection
of the learned master Knips."

I took one and cut it in two, remarking that it contained a circle of
seeds or pips, instead of the stone of the manchincel. At that moment
Knips slyly came behind me, and snatching up one half, began to munch
it with the liveliest satisfaction, an example which the boys were so eager
to follow that 21 general scramble ensued, and I had some trouble in securing
a couple of the apples for myself and their mother.

Everyone SCClnlllg wearied by the fatigues
of the day, our mattresses and pillars were
arranged, and the inmates of "-'oodlands
betouk themselves 1.0 repose.

With early light we connnenced the next day's
icinnev, directing our course to a point between the stigm--
brake and the Gap, where "e had once made a sort of
arboui Ol the branches or trees; a: this remained in pretty <<and condition,
we spread a sail- cloth mm the top of it, instead oi pitching the tent, and
made it very comfortable quarters for the short time I proposed to stay
there.

Our object being to search the neighbourhood l'or traces of the boa
constrictor or any of his kindred, Fritz, Jack, and Franz went with me to
the sugar-cane brake, and satisfied ourselves that our enemy had not been
there. It was long since we had enjoyed the fresh juice of these canes, and
we were refreshing ourselves therewith when a loud barking ol' dogs and
rustling and rattling through the thicket of canes disturbed our pleasant
occupation, and, as we could see nothing a yard ol'l' where we stood, I
hurried to the open ground, and with guns in readiness we awaited what
was coming.

In a few minutes a herd of creatures like little pigs issued from the
thicket, and made off in single file at a lm'sk trot; they were of a uniform
grey colour, and showed short sharp tusks.

My trusty double-barrel speedily laid low two of the fugitives; the
others continued to follow the leader in line, scarcely turning aside to pass
the dead bodies of their comrades, and 111aintaining the same steady pace,
although Fritz and Jack also fired and killed several.200 THE S PVISS 17A 3112 l" /" 01?./.-'\".S'(')/\-'.

I felt. certain that those were peccaries, and recoilcctcd that an odorifer-
ous gland in the back must be removed immediately, otherwise the meat
will become tainted, and quite unfit to eat. This operation, with the help
of my boys, I accordingly performed at once.

Presently hearing shots in the direction of the hut where we had left
Ernest and his mother, I sent Jack to their assistance, desiring him to [etch
the cart, that the booty might be conveyed to our encampment, employing
the time of his absence in opening and cleaning the animals, thus reducing
their weight.

Ernest came back with Jack and the cart, and told us that the proces-
sion of peccaries had passed near the hut, and that he, with Juno's help,
had secured three of them.

I was glad to hear this, as I had determined to Cure a good supply of
hams, and we made haste to load the cart; the boys adorned it with flowers
and green boughs, and with songs of triumph which made the woods ring
they conveyed the valuable supply of game to the hut, where their mother
anxiously waited for us.

After dinner we set to work upon our pigs, singeiug and scalding off
the bristles; I cut out the hams, divided the flitchcs, bestowed considerable
portions of the carcase on the dogs, and diligently cleansed and salted the
moat, while the boys prepared a. shed, where it was to be hung to be cured
in the smoke of fires of green wood.

This unexpected business of course detained us in the place for some
time. On the second day, when the smoking shed was ready, the boys
were anxious to cool: the smallest porkcr in the Otaheitian fashion. For
this purpose they dug a hole, in which they burnt a quantity of dry grass,
sticks, and weeds, thus heating stones which were placed round the sides of
the pit.

While the younger boys made ready the oven, Fritz singed and washed
his peccary, stuffing it with potatoes, onions, and herbs, and a good sprink-
ling of salt and pepper.

He then sewed up the opening, and enveloped the pig in large leaves
to guard it from the ashes and dust of its cooking-place.

The fire no longer blazed, but the embers and stones were glowing
hot; the pig was carefully placed in the hole, covered over with hot ashes,
and the whole with earth, so that it looked like a big mole-heap.

Dinner was looked forward to with curiosity, as well as appetite; my
wife, as usual, distrusting our experiments, was not sanguine of success, and
made. ready some plain food as a [his d/lfil'.

She was well pleased with the curing-hut, which was roomy enough to
hang all our hams and bacon. On a wide hearth in the middle we kindled
a large: lire, which was kept constantly smouldering by heaping it with damp
grass and green wood. The hut being closed in above, the smoke filled it,

and penetrated the meat thoroughly; this process it had to undergo for
several days.LYPLOIHA-"G l:'.\'l'lz'/),/I'[01VS. 201
In a few hours Fritz gave notice that he was going to open his oven.
Great excitement prevailed as he removed the earth, turf, and stones,

and a delicious appetising odour arose from the opening. it was the smell

of roast pork, certainly, but with a flavour of spices which surprised me,
until I thought of the leaves in which the food had been wrapped.

'l'ho peccary was carefully raised, and when a few cinders were picked
oil, it looked a remarkably well-cooked dish. Fritz was highly complimented
on his success, even by his mother.

The scented leaves were, I thought, those of a tree which I knew to
be found in Madagasxu', called, by the natives, Ravensara, or "good leaf."
it is said to combine the scent of the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon. The
fruit is a species of nut, possessing the scent of the leaves in a more delicate
degree, and from it an oil or essence is diSLilled, which is highly valued in
native cookery.

During the process of curing our large supply of hams and bacon, which
occupied several days, we roamed about the neighbourhood in all directions,
finding no trace of the serpent, but making many valuable acquisitions,
among which were some gigantic bainboos from fifty to sixty feet in length,
and of proportionate thickness. These, when out across near the joints.
formed capital caslts, tubs, and pots; while the long sharp thorns, which
hcgirt the stem at intervals, were as strong and useful as iron nails.

One day we made an excursion to the farm at Prospect llill, and were
grievously provoked to find that the vagabond apes had been there, and
wrought terrible mischief, as before at Woodlands.

The animals and poultry were scattered, and everything in the cottage
so torn and dirtied that it was vain to think of setting things right that
day. We therefore very unwillingly left the disorder as we found it, pur-
posing to devote time to the work afterwards.

When all was in readiness for the prosecution of our journey, we closed
and barricaded the hut, in which, for the present, we left the store of bacon;
and arranging our march in the usual patriarchal style, we took our way to
the Gap, the thorough defence of which defile was the main object we had
in View.

Our last halting~place being much enclosed by shrubs, bamboos, and
limshwood, we had during our stay opened a path through the cane thicket
in the direction we were about; to travel ,- this we now found of the greatest
assistance, and the loaded cart passed on without impediment.

The ground was open and tolerably level beyond, so that in a few hours
we arrived at the extreme limit of our coast territory.

We halted on the outskirts of a little wood, behind which, to the right,
rose the precipitous and frowning cliffs of the mountain gorge, while to the
left flowed the torrent, leaving between it and the rocks the narrow pass
we called the Gap, and passing onward to mingle its waters with the sea.

The wood afforded us pleasant shelter, and standing high, and within
gunshot of the mouth of the rocky pass, I resolved to make it our camping:02 7'17]? SIT/[SS 17/1 ill/IL 1" 1C ()BIIVIS'OAF'.

place. We therefore unpacked the cart, and made our usual arrangements
for safety and comfort, not forgetting to examine the wood itsell, so as
to ascertain whether it harhonred any dangerous animals.

Nothing worse than wild cats was (1' covered. We disturbed severai
of these creatures in their pursuit of birds and small game, but they
tied at our approach.

By the time dinner was ready we felt much fatigued, and some
hours of unusually sultry and oppressive heat compelled us to rest until
towards evening, when returning coolness revived our strength. We
pitched the tent, and their occupied ourselves with preparations tor the
next day, when it was my intention to penetrate the country beyond
the defile, and make a. longer excursion across the Savannah than had
yet been undertaken. '

All was ready for a start at an early hour; my brave wife con-
sented to remain in camp with Franz as her companiomz while the three
older boys and all the dogs, except Juno, went with me.

We expected to find it somewhat difficult to make Olll' way through
the narrowest part of the pass, which 'had been so strongly barricaded
and planted with thorny shrubs, but found on the contrary that the
fences and walls were broken down and disarrangcd. It was thus very
evident that the great snake, as well as the herd of pe<'('a1'ics, had made
an entrance here.

This barricade was the lirst check that had been placed by hand
of man upon the wild free will of nature in this lonely place.

With one consent storms, Hoods, torrents, and the wild beasts of the
forest had set themselves to destroy it. We resolved to make the defences
doubly strong, being convinced that the position was capable of being barri-
(titled and fortified 50:15 to resist the invaders we dreaded.

The prospect which opened before us on emerging from the rocky pass
was wide and varied. Swelling hills and verdant wooded rules were seen
on one hand, while a great plain stretched before us, extending from the
banl's of the river towards a chain of loft}; mountains, whose summits were
rendered indistinct in the haze of the distance.

We crossed the stream, which we named East River, filling 'our flasks
with water, and it was well we did so, for in continuing our journey we.
found the soil become more arid and parched than we had expected; in
fact, we soon appeared to be surrounded by a desert.

The boys were astonished at the altered appearance of the country,
part of which had been explored when we met with the buffaloes. I re-
minded them of the difference of the season; that the expedition had been
made directly after the rains, when vegetation had clothed with transient
beauty this region, which, possessing no source of moisture in itsel , had
become seathed and bare during the blazing heat of summer..

Our march proceeded slowly, and many were the untromplimentary
remarks made on the "new country."EXl'L (UV/AL" 15A [Vi/J} 7'1' (INS. 20.;

It was "Arabia Pctrca,"
groaned one, "Desert of Sahara ,"
sighed another. "Fit abode for

"subterranean volcanic fires are
raging beneath our feet."

"Patience, my good fel-
lows!" cried I; "you are too
easily discouraged. Look beyond
the toilsome way to those grand
mountains whose spursar'c already
stretching forward to meet us.
Who knows what pleasant sur--
prises await us amid their steep
declivities 2' I, for my part,expect
to find water, fresh gr; s, trees,
and a lovely resting-place."

We were all glad to repose
beneath the shade of the first
overhanging rock we came to,
although by pressing farther up-
wards we might have' attained
to a pleasanter spot.

Looking back towards the Gap, we marked the strange contrast of the
smiling country bordering the river, and the dreary, menotonous plain we
had traversed.

After gazing on the distant scene, we produced Our store of provisions,
and were busily engaged, when Knips (our constant companion) suddenly
began to sniff and smell about in a very ridiculous way; finally, with a
shriek which we knew was expressive of pleasure, he set of? at full speed,
followed by all the dogs,' up a sort of glen behind us.

We left them to their own devices, being far too pleasantly engaged
with our refreshments to care mrrch what fancy the little rogue had got in
his head. '

When hunger was somewhat appeased, Fritz once more cast his eyes
over the expanse of plain before us, and after looking fixedly for a moment,
exclaimed :

"Is it possible that I see a party of horsemen riding at full gallop to~
wards us! Can they be wild Arabs of the desert 2'"

"Arabs, rrry boy! certainly not; but take the spy--glass and make them
out exactly. We shall have to be on our guard, whatever they are l "

"I cannot see distinctly enough to be sure," said he presently, "and
imagination supplies the deficiency of sight in most strange fashion. I could
fancy them wild cattle, loaded carts, wandering hay-cocks, in fact almost
anything I like."

The spy-glass passed from hand to hand. Jack and Ernest agreed in
thinking the moving objects were men on horseback; but when it came to
my- turn to look, I at once pronounced them to be very large ostriches.

" This is fortunate indeed !" I exclaimed; "we must try to scoure one
of these magnificent birds; the feathers alone are worth having."

".-\ live ostrich, father; that would be splendid. Why, we might ride
upon him i"

As the ostriches approached, we began to consider in what way we
should attempt a capture. I sent Fritz and Jack to recall the dogs, and
placed myself with Ernest behind some shrubs which would conceal us from
the birds as they came onwards.

The boys did not rejoin us for some little time; they found Knips and
the dogs at a pool of water formed by a small mountain stream, which the
monkey's instinct had detected; his sudden departure was thus accounted
for, and they availed themselves right gladly of his discovery, filling their
.flflSILS, and hastily bathing before their return.

The ostriehes continued to come in our direction, varying their pace as
though in sport, springing, trotting, galloping, and chasing each other round
and round, so that their approach was by no means rapid.

I could now perceive that of the five birds one only was a male, the
white plumes of the wings and tail contrasting finely with the deep glossy
black of the neck and body.

The colour of the females being ashen-brown, the effect of their white
plumes was not so handsome.

"I do not believe we shall have a chance with these birds," said i,
" except by sending Fritz's eagle in pursuit; and for that we must bide our
time, and let them come as near as possible."

"In what way, then, are ostrichcs caught by the natives of the African
deserts?" enquired Fritz.

" Sometimes by chase on horseback; but their speed is so very great
that even that must be conducted by stratagem.

"When these birds are pursued, they will run for hours in a wide circle;
the hunter gallops alter them, but describes a much smaller circle, and can
therefore maintain the pace for a longer time, waiting to make the attack
until the bird is fatigued.

"Among the bushmen, the hunter sometimes envelops himself in the
skin of an ostrich, his legs doing duty for those of the bird, and his arm
managing the head and neck so as to imitate the movements of the bird
when feeding. The enterprising hunter is. thus enabled to get among a flock
of ostriches, and to shoot them with arrows one alter another.

"When aware of an enemy they defend themselves desperately, using
their powerful legs as weapons, always kicking forwards, and inflicting dread-
ful injuries on dogs, and even on men if attacked without due precaution.

But let us take up our positions, and keep perfectly still, for the ostriehes
are at hand I"EXP/L (JR/NO EXP/VII)! 7 'IUNS. 205

We held the dogs concealed as much as possible; the stately birds,
suddenly perceiving us, paused, hesitated, and appeared uneasy. Yet, as no
movement was made, they drew a few steps nearer, with outstretched necks,
examining curiously the unwonted spectacle before then).

The dogs became impatient, struggled from our grasp, and furiously rushed
towards our astonished visitors. In an instant they turned and {led with the
speed of the wind; their feet seemed not to touch the ground, their wings
aiding their marvellously rapid progress.

In a few moments they would have been beyond our reach, but as they
turned to fly the eagle was unhooded. Singling out the male bird, the
eagle made his fatal swoop, and, piercing the skull, the magnificent crcatnrc
was laid low. Before we could reach the spot the dogs had joined the bird
of prey, and were fiercely tearing the flesh and bedabblingr the splendid
plumes with gore.

This sight grieved us.

" What a pity we could not capture this glorious hird alive l" exclaimed

more than six feet high, and two of us might have mounted him at once 5"

" In the vast sandy deserts where nothing grows, what can flocks of
these birds find to live upon?" enquired'lflmest.

"That would indeed be hard to say, if the deserts were utterly barren
and unfruitful," returned I; "but over these sandy wasws a benefit-em Pro-
vidence scatters plants of wild melons, which absorb and retain every drop
of moisture, and which quench the thirst as well as satisfy the hunger of
the ostriches and other inhabitants of the wilds. These melOns, however,
do not constitute his entire diet; he feeds freely on grasses, dates, and hard
grain, when he can obtain them."

"Does the ostrich alter any cry 2'"

"The voice of the ostrich is a deep hollow rumbling sound, so much
reSembling the roar of the lion as to bc occasionally mistaken for it. But
what does Jack mean by waving his cap, and beckoning in that excited
fashion? What has the boy found, I wonder?"

He ran a little way towards us, shouting:

"Eggs, father! Ostriches' cggsl a huge nest-full--do come quick!"

We all hastened to the spot, and in a slight hollow of the ground beheld
more than twenty eggs, as large as an infant's head.

The idea of carrying more than two away with us was preposterous,
although the boys, forgetting what the weight would be, seriously contem-
plated clearing the nest.

They were satisfied when a kind of landmark had been set up, so that
if we returned we might easily find the nest.

As each egg weighed about three pounds, the boys soon found the burden
considerable, even when tied into a handkerchief and carried like a basket.
To relieve them, I cut a strong elastic heath stick, and suspending an egg
in its sling at each end, laid the bent stick over Jack's shoulder, and, like a
Dutch dairy-maid with her millhpails, he stepped merrily along without
inconvenience. _

We presently reached a marshy place surrounding a little pool cvidentiy
fed by the stream which Knips had discovered. The soft ground was Lrodden
and marked by the footsteps oi" many different sorts of animals; we saw
tracks of hullaloos. antelopcs, onagers or quaggas, but no trace whatever of
any kind of serpent; hitherto our journey in search of monster reptiles had
been signaliscd by very satisfactory failure.

By this brook we sat down to rest and take some food; Fangs pre-
sently disappeared, and Jack calling to his pet discovered him gnawing aL
something which he had dug from the marsh. Taking it for a root ofsome
sort, Jack brought it for my inspection. l dipped it in water to clear oil'
the mud, and to my surprise found a queer little living creature, no bigger
than half an apple, in my hand. it was a small tortoise.

"A tortoise, I declare!" cried Fritz. "What a long way from the sea!
Llow came it here, I wonder?"

"Perhaps there has been a tortoise-shower," remarked Ernest. "One
reads of frog-showers in the time or" the ancient Romans."

"Hollo, Professor! you're out for once," said I. "This is nothing,r but
a mud-tortoise, which lives in wet, marsh -' ground and fresh water. They
are useful in gardens; for although they like a few lettuce leaves now and
then, they will destroy numbers of snails, grnbs, and worms."

Resuming our journey, we arrived at a charming valley, verdant, fruitful,
and shaded by clumps of graceful trees. It afforded us the greatest delight
and refreshment to pass along this cool and lovely vale, which we agreed
to call Glen Verdant.

In the distance we could see herds of antelopes or l)iiifalocs feeding ; but
as our dogs continually ranged a long way ahead of us, they were quickly
startled, and vanished up one or other of the narrow gorges which opened
out of the valley.

Following the imperceptible windings of the vale, we were surprised,
on quitting it for the more open ground, to find ourselves in country we
were already acquainted with and not far from the Jackal Cave, as we called
the place where Fangs had been captured in cubhood.

On recognising the spot, Ernest, who was in advance with one of the
dog's, hastened towards it. We lost sight of him for a few minutes, and their
arose a cry of terror, violent barking, and deep, surly growls.

As we rushed forward, Ernest met us, looking white as ashes, and
calling out:

"A bear, a bear, father! He is coming after me!"

The boy clung to me in mortal fear. I felt his whole frame
quivering. ,

"Courage, my son !" cried l, disengaging myself from his grasp; "we
must prepare for instant defence l"

The dogs dashed forward to join the fray, whatever ii. was; and not:_Z7.u7,- (3m? 'IU' 1,,

long were we in doubt. To my no small consternation, an enormous hear
made his appearance, quickly followed by another.

With levelled guns, my brave Fritz and 1 ad 'aneed slowly to meet them.
Jack .was also ready to tire, but the shock had so unnerved Ernest that he
fairly tOok to his heels. We fired together, one at each bear; but though
hit, the monsters were unfortunately only wounded. ""e found it most
dillicult to take aim, as the dogs beset them on all sides. However, they
were much disabled, one having the lower jaw broken, and the other, with
a bullet in its shoulder, was effectually lamell. The dogs, perceiving their
advantage, pressed more closely round their foes, who yet defended them--
selves furiously, with frightful yells of pain and rage. Such was the cou--
l'usinn and perpetual movement of the struggle that I dared not fire again,
seeing that even slightly wounding one of our gallant hounds wouldinstantly
place him in the power of the raging bears.

Watching our opportunity, we suddenly advanced with loaded weapons
to within a very few paces of the animals, and, firing, both fell dead, one shot
through the head; the other, in the act ot'rcaring to spring on Fritz, received
his charge in its heart.

"Thank Heaven !" cried I, as with dull groans the brutes sank to the
ground. "We have escaped the greatest peril we have yet encountered! "

The dogs continued to tear and worry the fallen foe, as though unwilling
to trust the appearance of death. With feelings somewhat akin, I drew my

_ hunting-knife, and made assurance doubly surc.

Seeing all safe, Jack raised a shout of victory, that poor Ernest might
gain courage to approach the scene of conllict, which at last he did, and
joined us in examining the dangerous animals as they lay motionless
before us.

Every point was full of interest, their wounds, their sharp teeth, their
mighty claws, the extraordinary strength of neck and shoulder, all were
remarked and commented on, and observing that the shaded brown hair was
tipped with glossy white, I thought that these might be the silver bears
mentioned in Captain Clarke's journey to the north-west coasts of America.

"Well, my lads," said I, "if we have failed to catch sight of serpents,
we have at least made good riddance of some other bad rubbish! These
fellows would one day have worked us woe, 01' l am much mistaken. What's
to be done next ?"

"Why, skin them, to be sure," said Fritz. " We shall have a couple of
splendid hear-skin rugs."

As this process would take time and evening drew on, we dragged the
huge carcases into their den, to await our return, concealing them with
boughs of trees and fencing the entrance as well as we could. The ostrich
eggs we also left behind us, hidden in a sandy hole.

By sunset we reached the tent, and joyfully rejoined the mother and
FranZ, right glad to [ind a hearty meal prepared for us, as well as a large
heap of l)rushw0od for the watch-fire.

When a full account of our adventures had been given, with a minute
and Special description of the bear-fight, the mother related what she had
done during our absence. She and Franz had made their \'hy through the
wood 11p to the rocks behind it, and discovered :1 bed of pure white clay,
which it seemed to her might be used for making porcelain. Then she had
contrived a drinking-trough {or the cattle out of a split bamboo.

She had arranged a hearth in :1 sheltered place by building up large
stones, cemented with the white clay; and, finally, she had cut a quantity
of canes and brought them, on the cart, to be in readiness for the building
we had in hand.

I praised the thoughtful diligence which had cllbeted so much that was
of real and definite use. In order to try the clay I put some balls of it in
the fire now kindled to burn during,r the night, and we then betook ourselves
to rest under shelter of our tent.

1.':unine the clay balls, which I found baked hard and finely glazed, but too

111' the clay, I knew it would be well worth while. to remedy.

After break 11st, and our accustomed devotions, we harnessed the cart,
and took the way to the bears' den. Fritz headed the party, and, coming
in sight ol the entrance to the cave, .21lled out soltlv:

to skin and cut them up, but by dint of perseverance we at last succeeded
in our object.

with the assistance of all sorts of insects, they did so effectually that before
we left the place the skulls were picked perfectly clean, the sun had dried
them, and they were ready for us to carry oft" to our museum.

The skins had to be very carefully scraped, washed, salted, cleansed with
ashes, and dried; which occupied fully two days. '

I was lamenting our distance from the Ravcnsara tree, the leaves of
which had flavoured our roast pcocary so nicely, when I observed among
the brushwood which the boys had brought from the thickets around us a
climbing plant, whose leaves had a very strong smell; the stem resembled
a vine, and the fruit grew in clusters like cut-rants. Some were red, and
some of a green colour, which I supposed to denote various degrees of
ripeness. They were hard, and the outer skin was quite thin.

I recognised in this the pepper plant, a discovery particularly agreeable
at this moment. _

The boys soon gathered a large supply. The red berries were soaked in
salt and water for several days, then washed and rubbed, and finally, becoming
perfectly white, were dried in the sun. The treatment of the green berries
was simple,- they were merely exposed to the sun's heat for a day or two,
and then stored. lu this way we obtained enough, both of black and white
pepper, to last us a very long time.

I took also a number of young plants, that we might have pepper growing
at Rockburg and our various settlements. Some roots of another plant were
also taken, which, from the pods, appeared to be a kind of bean.

We were glad of this Occupation during the tedious business of
smoking the bear's meat, and mailed ourselves or the leisure time by also
preparing for stuffing the condor, the turkey buzzard, and the uruhu or
black vulture--for I could not determine to which species the smaller bird
belonged.

The four boys at length became so weary of inaction" that I deter-
mined to let them make an excursion alone on the Savannah. Three of
them received this permission with eager delight, but Ernest said he would
prefer to remain with us; to which, as the expedition was to be entirely
one of pleasure, I could make no objection.

Little Franz, on the other hand, whom I would willingly have kept
with us, was wild to go with his brothers, and I was obliged to consent,
as I had made .the proposal open to all, and could not draw back.

in the highest spirits they ran to hring their steeds (as we were fain
to call the cattle they rode) from their pastumge at a short distance.
Spccdily were they saddled, bridled, and mounted--the three lads were
ready to be all.

dence, for well I knew that it might be the will of God to deprive them
easily 01' their parents, when, without an enterprising spirit of sclf~reliance,

My gallant Fritz possessed this desirable quality in no small degree, andEXPZ ORAN-"G E37 '1? 0177 0.3/52 2 l l

to him I committed the Care of his young brothers, charging them to look
up to and obey him as their leader.

The)- werc well armed, well mounted, had a couple of good (logs; and,
with a hearty ".Cod speed and bless you, my boys!" I let them depart.

We, who remained behind, passed the day in a variety of useful occu--
nations.

The beur's meat, which was being cured in a smoking shed such as
that we set up for the peccary hams, required a good deal of attention from
my wife. Ernest had a fancy for making ornamental cups from the ostrich
eggs, while I investigated the interior of the cave.

I found the inner wall to consist ofa kind of talc, mingled with threads
of asbestos, and also indications of mica. Examining further, I detached a
large block, and found to my joy that I could split it into clear transparent
sheets, which would serve admirably for window panes.

My wife saw this substitute [or glass with unfeigned satisfiurtion, declaring
that, although she would not complain, yet the want of glass for windows
had been a downright trouble to her.(iPlAP'l'I-ZR XIII.

their speed. When we had passed through the Gap we moderated our
furious pace and kept our eyes open, on the look-out for game. We then
trotted slowly to the top 01' a grassy hill, from whose summit we saw two
herds of animals--whether antelopes, goals, or gazelles we did not know--
grazing by the side of the stream below us. We were about to gallop down
and try to get a shot at them, when it struck me that it would be wiser
to try and drive the whole herd through the Gap into our own domain,
where they would be shut up, as it were, in a park, free and yet within
reach. Down the hill we rode as hard as we could go, formed in a semi--
circle behind the larger herd--magnificent antelopes--and, aided by the dogs,
with shouts and cries drove them along the stream towards the Gap. As
we came near the opening they inclined to halt and turn like sheep about
to be driven into the butcher's yard; and it was all we could do to prevent
them from bolting past us; but, at length, one made a rush at the opening
and, the rest lollowing, they were soon all on the other side of the l'ronticr
and inhabitants of New Switzerland."

"Capital," I said, " capital, my boy! But I don't see what is to make
them remain inhabitants of our domain, or to prevent them from returning
through the Gap whenever they feel inclined."

"Stop, father," he replied, "you interrupted me too soon; we thought
of that possibility too, and provided against it. We stretched a long line
right across the defile and strung,r on it feathers and rags and all sorts of other
things, which danced and fluttered in the wind, and looked so strange that
I am perfectly certain that the herd will never attempt to pass it; in fact
Levaillant, from whom I learnt the trick, says in his 'Voyage an Cap dc
Bonnc Esperance' that the lloltentots make use of the method for penning
in the antelopes they have caught in the chase."

" Well done," said I, "I am glad to see that you remember what you
have read. The antelopes are welcome to New Switzerland; but, my boy,"
I added, "I cannot say the same for the rabbits you have there; they
increase so rapidly that if vou establish a colony of the little wretchos your
new diilicultv will be to get rid of them."

"line," he replied, "but mv idea was to place them upon Whale
Island, where tliev would find abundant food, and at the same time in

so useful. Do vou know mv eagle caught these pretty little fellows [or

"Now, lather," said Jack, interrupting him, "do listen to me and hear

while Fritz was away after the rabbits, out popped these little fawns, and
away they went bounding and shipping at the rate ol' thirty miles an
hour, with Storm, Grumble, and the dogs at their heels. In about a
quarter ol' :1 hour we had left the (lags behind and were close upon our
prey. Down went the little creatures in the grass, and, overcome with
terror and fatigue, they were at our mercy. So we shouted to Fritz, and----"

"My dear boy," said 1, "according to your statement, liritz must
have been seven miles and a half off."

"Oh, well, father, perhaps we did not ride for quite a quarter of an
hour, and of course, 1 can't say exactly how fast we were going; and
then, you see, the fawns did not run in a straight line. At any rate, Fritz
heard us, and he and Franz and I leashed the legs of the prett)r creatures,
and presently saw a wreteh of a cuckoo, who led us ever so far out of our
course by cuckooiug and making faces at us and then hopping away. Franz
declared it must be an enchanted princess, and so I thought I would rid it
of its spell; but Fritz stopped me shooting it, and said it was a 'Honey
Imlicator,' and that it was leading us probably to a bees' byke, so we spared
its life, and presently, sure enough, it stopped close by a bees' nest in a
hollow mound. This was capital, we thought, and, as we were in a great
hurry to taste the honey, I threw in a lot of lighted lucifer matches, but
son'lehow it did not kill the bees at all, but only made them awfully angry.
and they flew out in a body and stung me all over. I rushed to Storm and
sprang on his back, but, though I galloped away for dear life, it was an age
before I got rid of the little wretches, and now my face is in a perfect
fever. I think I will get mother to bathe it for me." And off rushed the
noisy boy, leaving Fritz and me to see to the fawns and examine the
rabbits. With these latter 1 determined to do as Fritz preposed, namely. to
colonise Whale Island with them. 1 was all the more willing to do this
because I had been considering the advisability of establishing on that island
a fortress to which we might retreat in any extreme danger, and where we
should be very thankful, in case or" such a retreat, to possess means of ob-
taining a constant supply of animal food.

Having ministered to the wants of the antelopes, Itn'ed to interest the
boys in my discovery of the block of talc, but just then their mother sum--
moned us to dinner.

The principal dish in this meal consisted of the bears" paws--most
savoury smelling delicacies, so tempting that their close resemblance to
human hands, and even the roguish " FceJo-fum" from Jack, did not prevent
a single member of the family from enjoying them most heartily.

Supper over, we lit our watch--fire, retired to our tent, and slept soundly.

\\'e had been working very diligently; the bears' meat was smoked, the
fat melted down and stored, and a large supply of bamboos collected. But

Fritz mounted the mule, I rode Lighti'oot, Jack and Franz tool; their
usual steeds and, with the two dogs, we galloped off--first to visit the
rauphorbia to collect the gum, and then to discover whether the ostrich had
deserted her eggs in the sand.

Ernest watched us depart without the slightest look or sigh of regret,
and returned to the tent to assist his mother and study his boo s.

Our steeds carried us down the Green Valley at a rapid rate, and we
followed the direction we had pursued on our former expedition. We soon
reached 'ifurtle Marsh, and then, filling our \\'ater-flashs. we arrived at the
rising ground where Fritz discovered the mounted Arabs.

As Jack and Franz wanted a gallop, I allowed them to press for-
ward, while Fritz and I Visited the euphorbia trees. A quantity of the
red guru had exuded from the incisions I had made, and as this had
coagulate-d in the sun, I rolled it into little balls and stored it in a bamboo
jar I had brought with me for the purpose.

As we rode after the boys, who were some way ahead, Fritz remarked :

" Did you not tell me that the juice of that tree was poisonous, father.
Why have you collected such a quantity?"

"1 did indeed say so," I replied; "it is a most deadly poison. The
inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope use it to poison the springs
where wild animals assemble to quench their thirst; and they thus slaughter
an immense number of the creatures for the sake of their hides. Iintend,
however, to use it to destroy the apes should they again commit215 THE 5 ""155 PA 11115 1' [CO/IIIVSOA'.

deprcdations, and also in preparing the skins of animals to Protect them
train the attacks of insects."

The two boys were still at some distance from us, when suddenly
four magnificent ostrichcs rose from the sand where the).r had been sitting.

Jack and Franz perceived them, and with a great shout drove them
towards us. In front ran a splendid male bird, his feathers ofshining black,
and his great tail plume waving behind. Three females of an ashen-grey
colour followed him. They approached us with incredible swiftnew, and were
within gun-shot before they perceived us. I-'ritz had had the forethought to
bind up the heal; of his eagle so that, should he bring down an ostrich, he
might be unable to injure it.

He now threw up the falcon which, towering upwards, swooped down
upon the head of the foremost bird, and so confust and alarmed him that
he couid not defend himself not continue his flight. So greatly was his speed
checked that Jack overtook him, and hurling his lasso, enfolded his wings
and legs in iis deadly coils and brought him to the ground. The other
ostriehes were almost out of sight ; so, leaving them to their own devices,
we leaped from our steeds and attempted to approach the captured bird.
He struggled feariiilly, and kicked with such violence right and 1011 that 1
almost despaired of getting him home alive.

it occurred to me, however, that if we could cover his eyes his fury
might be subdued. Iinstantly acted upon this idea, and flung over his head
my coat and hunting~bag, which effectually shut out the light. .

No sooner had I done this than his struggles ceased, and we were able
to approach. ""e first secured round his body a broad strip of sealskin, on
each side of which I fastened a stout piece of cord, LhatI might be able to
lead him easily. 'l'hen, fastening another cord in a loop round his legs that he
might be prevented from breaking into a gallop, we released him from the
coils of the lasso.

"Do you know," said I to the boys, " how the natives of India secure
a newlycaptured elephant? "

"Oh, yes 1" said Fritz; "they fasten him between two tame elephants.
We'll do that to this fine fellow, and tame him double quick."

"The only dilliculty will be," remarked Jack, " that we have no tame
ostriehes. However, I daresay Storm and Grnmble will have no objeCtiun
to perform their part, and it will puzzle even this great monster to run away
with them."

So we at once began operations. Storm and Grumble were led up on
either side of the recumbent ostrich, and the cords secured to their girths.
Jack and Franz, each armed with a stout whip, mounted their respective
steeds, the wrappers were removed from the bird's eyes, and we stood by to

to his knees. A fruitless struggle ensued, and then at length, seeming to
accommodate himself to circumstances, he set off at a sharp trot, his guards
making the air re-echo with their merry shouts. 'l'hese cries stimulated
the ostrich to yet further exertions, but he was at length brought to a stand
by the determined refusal of his four-footed companions to continue such a
race across loose sand.

The boys having enjoyed the long run, I told them to valk with the
prisoner slowly home, while Fritz and I returned to examine the ostrich's
nest. The eggs were quite warm, and I was certain that the mother had
quite recently left the nest; leaving about half, Ipacked the rest of the eggs
in a large bag 1 had brought for the purpose, and slung it carefully on the
saddle before me. We soon caught up our advance guard, and without other
notable incident reached our tent.

Astonislnnent and dismay were depicted on the face of the mother as
we approached.

"My dear husband," she exclaimed, "do you thinlt our provisions so
abundant that you must scour the dUSerts to find some great boost to assist
us to devour them. You must discover an iron mine next, for iron is what
ostrichcs chiefly live on, is it not? Oh! i do wish you would be content
with the menagerie you have already collected, instead of bringing in a
specimen of every beast you come across. And this is such a useless monster I"

"Useless! mother?" exclaimed Jack, " you would not say so had you
seen him run; why he will be the llcctest coarser in our stables. I am going
to make a saddle and bridle for him, and in future he shall be my only
steed. Then, as for his appetite, father declares it is most delicate; he only
wants a little fruit and grass, and a few stones and tenpenny nails to help
his digestion."

The way in which Jack assumed the proprietorship of our new prize
seemed to strike his brothers as rather cool, and there was instantly a cry
raised on the subject.

"Very well," said Jack, "let us each take possession of the part ofthe
ostrich we captured. Your bird, Fritz, seized the head; keepthat; father
shall have the body, I'll have the legs, and Franz a couple of feathers from
the tail."

"Come, come," said I, "I think that Jack has a very good right to the
ostrich, seeing that he brought it to the ground, and if he succeeds in taming
it and converting it into a saddle-horse it shall be his. From this time,
therefore, he is responsible for its training."

The day was now too far ad -'aneed to allow us to think of setting out
for Rockburg, so we fastened up the ostrich between two trees, and devoted
the remainder of the evening to making preparations for our departure.

At early dawn our picturesque caravan was moving homewards. The
ostrich continued so refractory that we were obliged to make him again march
between Storm and Grurnble, and, as these gallant steeds were thus employed,
the cow was harnessed to the cart, laden with our treasures. Room waszr8 771E SKY/[SS [MAI/LY ROIIIA-"SOA'.

left in the cart for the mother, Jack and Franz mounted Storm and Crumble,
I rode Lightfoot, and Fritz brought up the rear on Swift.

At the mouth of the Gap we called a halt, and replaced the cord the
boys had strung with ostrich leathers by a stout palisade of bamboos. I also
took the opportunity of Collecting a store ofpipe-elay, as Iintended during
the winter months, which were close at hand, to try my hand at china~
making.

When we reached the sugar-cane grove, we again stopped to collect the
peccary hams we had left to be smoked; and my wife begged me to gather
some seeds of an aromatic plant which grew in the neighbourhood, and which
had the scent of vanilla. Iobtained a good supply, and we moved forward
towards Woodlands, where we intended to rest for the night, after our long
and fatiguing march.

Our tent was pitched, and on our beds of cotton we slept soundly.

Next morning early we examined our farmyard, which appeared in a
most prosperous and flourishing condition. The sight of all these domestic
animals made us long even more than ever for our home at Rockburg, and
we determined to hasten thither with all possible speed.

The number of our pigs, goats, and poultry had greatly increased since
we had last visited our colony; and some of these, two fine broods ol'
chickens especially, my wife wished to take back with her.

We found that the herd of antelopes which Fritz and Jack had driven
through the Gap had taken up their abode in the neighbourhood, turd several
times we saw the beautiful animals browsing amongst the trees.

"'hile at the farm, we repaired both the animals' stalls and our dwelling
room, that the former might be more secure against the attacks of wild beasts,
and the latter fitted for our accommodation when we should visit the spot.

Everything at length being satisfactorily arranged, we again retired to
rest, and early next morning completed our journey to Rockburg.

By mid-day we were once more settled at home. Windows and doors
were thrown open to admit fresh air; the animals established in their stalls;
and the carts miscellaneous cargo discharged and arranged.

As much time as I could spare I devoted to the ostrich, whom we
fastened, for the present, between two bamboo posts in front of our dwelling.

I then turned my attention to the eggs we had brought, and which
1 determined to hatch, if possible, by artificial heat. For this purpOSe
I arranged a stove, which I maintained at a uniform temperature, and
on it I placed the eggs carefully wrapped in cotton wool.

Next morning Fritz and I went oil in the boat first to Whale Island,
there to establish our colonists, the Angora rabbits, and then to Shark
Island, where we placed the dainty little antelopes. Having made them
happy with their liberty and abundance of food, we returned as quickly
as possible to cure the bears' skins, and add the provisions we had brought
to the stores lying in our cellar.

As we returned, we caught up Jack, making his way in great gleeOUR HL'XR/x'lfiklfl'lz' S'l'lz'Iz'I). 21-)

towards Kockbu-rg. He was carrying in a basket an immense out, which
he and Ernest had secured.

Ernest had set, on the previous night, a couple of lines; one had
been dragged away, but on the other they found this Splendid fellow.

It proved delicious. Half was prepared for dinner, and the other half
salted and stowed away.

We now, for a short time, again turned our attention to our duties
about the house.

Thinking that the verandah would he greatly improved by some
creepers, l sowed round the foot of each bamboo pillar, 'anilla and
pepper-seed, as well as
that of other creeping
plants, which would
not only give the house
a pleasanter aspect, but
also afford us shade
during the summer
months.

I constructed a
couple of hen-coops
too, for the hens and
their little chicks which
we had brought from
"'oodlands, as I knew
that, if I left them

might induce them to make anatomical experiments which would be
detrimental to the welfare of the youngsters.

Ernest's rat-skins were voted a nui nice within doors, and were tied
together and hung up outside; so powerful was the odour they emitted
that even then Jack would pretend to faint every time he passed near them.

The museum received its additions; the condor and vulture were placed
there, to be stuffed when we should find time during the rainy season. The
mica and asbestos, too, were brought in for the present, not to lie there
idle, butto wait until 1 could use them as I intended, {or china and
lamp-wicks.

Having occupied two days in this way, we turned our attention to
otherduties 2 the cultivation of a wheat, barley, and maize field, the management
of the ostrich's eggs, and the taming ol' the captives.

As agriculture was, though the least to our taste, the most important
of these several duties, we set about it first. The animals drew the plough,
but the digging and hoeing taxed our powers of endurance to the utmost.

We worked two hours in the morning and two in the evening Fully

did we realise the words of Scripture: " In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread." '

In the interval we devoted our attention to the ostrich. But our efforts
on behalf of his education seemed all in vain. He appeared as unlameablc
as ever. 1 determined, therefore, to adopt the plan which had subdued the
refractory eagle.

'l'he elloet ol'" the tobacco fumes almost alarmed me. The ostrich sank
to the ground and lay motionless. Slowly, at length, he arose, and paced up
and down between the bamboo posts.

He was subdued, but to my dismay resolutely refused all food. l feared
he would die; for three days he pined, growing weakerand weaker each day.

"Food he must have!" said 1 to my wife; "food he must have!" The
mother determined to attempt an experiment. She prepared balls of maize
llour, mixed with butter. One of those she placed within the bird's beak.
He swallowed it, and stretched out his long neck, looking inquiringly for
a second mouthful. A second, third, and fourth ball followed the first. l-lis
appetite returned, and his strength came again.

All the wild nature of the bird'had gone, and I saw with delight that
we might begin his education as soon as we chose. Rico, guavas, maize,
and corn he ate readily--"washing it down," as Jack expressed it, with
small pebbles, to the great surprise of Franz, to whom I explained that the
ostrich was merely following the instinct common to all birds ; that he required
these pebbles to digest his food, just as smaller birds require gravel.

Alter a month of careful training, our captive would trot, gallop, obey
the sound of our voice, feed from our hand, and, in fact, showed himself
perfectly docile. Now our ingenuity was taxed to the utmost. How were
we to saddle and bridle a bird? .l'irst, for a bit for his beak. Vague ideas
passed through my mind, but every one I was obliged to reject. A plan
at length occurred to inc. 1 recoilected the ell'ect of light and its absence
upon the ostrich: how his movements were checked by sudden darkness, and
how, with the light, power returned to his limbs.

I immediately constructed a leathorn hood, to reach from the neck to
the beak, cutting holes in it for the eyes and ears. Over the eye-holes I
contrived square flaps or blinkcrs, which were so arranged with whalcbonc
springs that they closed tightly of themselves. The reins were connected
with those blinkers, so that the flaps might be raised or allowed to close
at the rider's pleasure. _

When both blinkers were open, the ostrich would gallop straight ahead;
close his right eye and he turned to the left; close his left and he turned
to'the right; shut both and he stood stock still.

1 was justly proud of my contrivancc, but, before l could really test its
utility, I was obliged to make a saddle. After several failures, I succeeded
in manulacturing one to my lilting and in properly securing it; it was
something like an old-fashioned troopcr's saddle, peaked before and behind--for
my great fear was lest the boys should fall. This curious-looking contrivancel.) (1/! // (JR/EUR11.71 37'." ..\' 776/51).

I placed upon the shoulders as near the neck as possible, and secured it with
strong girtlis round the wings and across the breast, to avoid all possibility
of the saddle slipping down the bird's sloping back.

I soon saw that my plan would succeed, though skill and considerable
practice were necessary in the use of my patent bridle. It was difficult to
remember that to check the coui'ser's Speed it was necessary to slziclgen min,
and that the tighter the reins were drawn the faster he would fly. We at
length, however, all learned to manage Master Hurricane, and the distance

between Rockburg and Falconhurst was traversed in Van aliiiost incredibly
short space of time. The marvellous speed 01 the bird again rovwed the
dispute as to the ownership, and I was obliged tn'inlerferc. _ .
"Jack shall retain the ostrich," said I, "10': it is most suited to hiin;

Our field work was by this time over. The land had been ploughed
and sown with wheat, barley, and maize. 0n the other side of Jackal River
we had planted potatoes and cassava roots, and all sorts 01' other sccds had
been carefully sown.

We had not neglected the ostrich's eggs, and one day Fritz introduced
me with great glee to three Tittle ostriches. But alas . the little creatures
were not destined to enjoy life for long. One died almost as Soon as it was
hatched, and the others, alter tottering about on their stilt-like legs for a few
days, followed its oxmnple.

I now found time to turn my attention lo the bears' skins, which
required preparation before they would be fit for use as leather. They had
been salted and dried, and now required tanning. I had no tan. hme c:'.
This was unfortunate; but, not to be deterred from my purpose, I determined
to' use a mixture of honey and water in its place.

The experiment proved successful. When the skins were dried they
I remained flexible and free from smell, while the for was soft and glossy.

This was not the only result of the experiment, for the honey-water
which I boiled appeared so clear and tempting that it struck me that I
might prepare from it an excellent drink. Iput by some of the liquid
before making use of it as tan, and reboiled it with nutmeg and cinnamon.
The preparation, which much resembled English mead, was pronounced
delicious, and the mother begged me to brew a large supply. As our cellar
was now well stocked with provisions for the winter, and our other pre'
parations were completed, I was able to turn my attention to details of lesser
i:npor".ance. The boys had been clamouring for hats, and, as my success in
so many trades had surprised me, I agreed to turn hatter for the noncc.
With the rat--shins and a solution of india-mbber, I produced a kind of felt,
which I dyed a brilliant red with cochineal, and, stretching this on a wooden
block I had prepared, I passed over it a hot iron, to smooth the nap, and,
by next morning had the satisfaclion of presenting to my wife a neat little
red Swiss cap, to be lined and finished by her for one of the boys. The
mother admired the production immensely, and, lining it with silk, added yet
more to its gay appearance by adorning it with ribbons and ostrich feathers,
and finally placed it upon the head of little Franz.

So delighted was everyone with the hat that all were eager to be
similarly provided, and begged me to manufacture more. I readily agreed
to do so, as soon as they should furnish me with the necessary materials,
and advised them to make half-a-dozen rat-traps, that they might secure the
water rats with which the stream abounded, and whose rich glosey fur would
serve admirably for felt.

Every fifth animal that they brought me I told them should be mine,
that I might obtain material for hats for myself and their mother.

The boys at once agreed to this arrangement, and began the manufacture
of the traps, which were all so made that they should kill the rats at once,
for I could not bear the idea ol' animals being tortured or imprisoned.0 L716 fiURRIC/t .3.

While they were thus engaged I applied myself" 10 the mannfimlnrc of
porcelain. I first cleaned the pipe-clay and talc. from all foreign substances,
and made them ready to be beaten down with water into a soft mass, and
then prepared my moulds of gypsum plaster. These preparations were at
length made, and the moulds received a thin layer 01' the porcelain material.
When this was partly halted, 1 sprinkled over it a powder of coloured glass

eads which I had crushed, and \\'h.ch looked very pretty in patterns npun
the transparent porcelain.

Some of my china vessels cracked with the heat 01' the Store, some
were re ' illsshapcd; but, after many failures, I succeeded in producing a
set of white cups and saucers, a crcmn-jng, a sugar-basin, and llama-dozen
small piatcs.

I must allow tha'. my china was far n'om perfect: the shape (if some
of the vessels was faulty, and none were really transparent. Nevertheless.
the general appearance gave great satisfaction, and when the plates were
filled with may and golden fruit resting on green leaves, and flagrant tea
filled the cups, it greatly added to the appearance 01' the table.

CARCIELY had I completed my pottery when great black clouds 21nd
terrific storms heralded the approach of another winter. The rainy
season having set in, we were compelled to give up our daily excursions.

and inte1esting emplovments, "e \e'. found the time (hag ' ghcavily. The

"Why, father, should we not make a canoe something swil'ter and more
manageable than those vessels we as yet possess? I often long for 21 light
skill", in which I might skim over the surlaoe of~ the water."

The idea delighted all hands, but the mother, who was never happy
when we were on the sea, declared that our chances of drowning were,
with the pinnaee and wuoe, already sufficiently great, and that. there was
not the slightest neee. y for our adding to these chances by constructing
another 0 1l't which would tempt us out upon the pcrfidious element. My
wife's fears were, however, speedily allaycd, for l assured her that the boat
I intended to construct should he no flimsy cocldcshcll, but as safe and stout

The experiment was most successful, and Ernest, Jack, and Franz, in
spite. of their laughter at their brother's garment, begged their mother to
make for each of them a similar dress.

While on the island we paid a visit to the colonists whom we had
established there the previous autumn. All were well; we could perceive
by the toot-prints that. the antelopcs had discovered and made use of the
shelter we had erected for them, and feeling that we could do nothing more
we scattered handfuls of maize and salt, and strolled across to the other
side ot'thc island. The shore was covered with lovely shells, many of which,
with beautiful pieces of delicate coral, the boys collected for their museum;
strewn by the edge of the water, too, lav a great quantity of sea-weed of
various colours, and, as the mother decl .ed that much of it was of NBC, the
boys assisted her Lo collca it and store it in the boat. As we. pulled back
to the land I was surprised to see that my will) chose from among the
sea-weed a number 0!" curior" lemcs with edges notched like a saw. When
we reached home she carefully washed those and dried them in the oven.
'l'hcrc was evidently something mysterious about this preparation, and my
curiosity at length prompted me to make an attempt to discover the secret.

"Are these leaves to form a substitute for tobacco?" said I. "Do you
so long for i.' refreshing smell.

My wife smiled, {or her dislike to tobacco was well known, and she
answered in the same jocular tone:

"Do you not think that a mattress stuffed with these leaves would be
very cool in summer?"

The twinkle in her eyes showed me that my curiosity must still remain
unsatisfied, but it nercrtheless became greater than ever. The boys and I had
one day made a long and fatiguing expedition, and, tired out, we flung ourselves
down in the verandah. As we lay there resting, we heard the mother's voice.

"Could any ol' you enjoy a little jelly 3'"

She presently appeared, bearing a porcelain dish laden with most lovely
trans; rontjclly. (lut with a spoon and laid before us it quivered and glittered
in the light.

"Ambrosia!" exclaimed Fritz, tasting it. li. was indeed delicious, and,
still marvellingj from whence the mother could have obtained a dish so rare,
we disposed of all that she had set before us.

"Aha," laughed the motherI "is not this an excellent substitute for to.
bacon, far more refreshing than the nasty weed it. ' Behold the produce
of my mysterious sea-weed."

"My dear wife," exclaimed I, "this dish is indeed a masterpiece of
culinary art, but where had you met with it 2' W hat put it into your head ?"

"While staying with my Dutch friends at the Cape," replied she, "I
often saw it, and at once recognised the leaves on Shark island. Once
knowing the secret. the preparation of the dish is extremely simple: the leaves
are soaked in water, fresh every day for a week, and then boiled for a few
hours with orange juice, Citron, and sugar."[/11 It VEST/Na. _ 22,-

We were all delighted with the delicacy, and thanked the mother for
it most heartily, the boys declaring that they must at once go off again to
the island to collect as many of the leaves as they could find. I agreed to
accompany them, for I wished to examine the plantations we had made there.

All were flourishing, the palms and mangroves had shot up in a most
marvellous manner, and many of the seeds which I had cast at random
amongst the cliffs in the rocks had germinated, and promised to clothe the
nakedness ol" the frowning boulders.

A ay up among the rocks, too, we discovered a bright. sparkling spring
01' delicious Water, at which, from the tool--prints around, we saw the ante-
lopes must have refreshed themselves.

Finding everything so satisfactory, we were naturally anxious to di'
cover how our Colony and plantations on Whale Island had fared. It \r' .
evident at a glance that the rabbits had increased, the trees bore the marks
of many greedy, mischievous little teeth. The eocoamn palms alone had
they spared.

Such depredations as these could not he allowed, and with the help of
the boys I erected round each stem a hedge of prickly thorn, and then
prepared again to embark; before we did so, however, I noticed that some
of the sea-weed had also been gnawed by the rabbits, and wondering what
it could have been to tempt them, I collected some of it to examine more
fully at home.

The skeleton of the whale, too,_ atiratted our attention ; for, picked Clean
by the birds and bleached by sun and rain, the bones had been purified to
a most perfect whiteness. Thinking that the joints 0! the 'ertehra; might
be made of use, I separated some ten or twelve, and rolled them down to
the heat, and then returned to the shore, towing them alter us.

A scheme now occupied my mind for the construction of a crushing
machine which "'0an prove of the greatest service to us. I knew that to
make such a machine or stone was far beyond my power, but it had struck
me that the vertebra". of the whale might serve my purpose.

1 determined next morning to look out a tree from which I might cut
the blocks of wood that. I should require to raise my Crushers.

My expedition was destined to he a solitary one; for when I went to
the stables for ahorsc, l discovered that the boys had gone off by then-wolves
with their guns and traps, and had left to me a choice between the hull and
huflalo.

With Storm, thm'elbre, I was lain to be content. I crossed the bridge,
bu'. as 1 reached the cassava field I noticed to my great annoyance that it
had been overrun and laid waste by some mischievous animals. I examined
the footprints, and seeing that they greatly resembled those of pigs, deter--
mined to follow the trail, and see who these invaders of our territory would
prow to he. The track led me on for some way until I almost lost sight
of it near our old potato field. For some time I hunted backwards and
forwards without seeing a sign of the animals; at length aloud barking228 THE S "7155 FAJIIZ Y ROBIA'SOA".

from Floss and Bruno, who were with me, announced that they had been
discovered.

The whole family of our old sow, and she herself, were standing at bay,
showing their teeth and grunting so savagely that lhc dogs feared to approach
them.

I raised my gun and fired twice amongst the herd; two of the pigs
fell, and the rest fled, followed by the dogs. I picked up the pigs, and,
calling back the pursuers, continued my way through the forest.

A tree suited to my purpose was soon found; I marked it, and returned
home. .

Ernest, who had remained at home, assisted me to flay the young porkers,
and I handed them over to the mother to prepare for supper, by which
time I hoped the other lads would have returned.

Late in the evening we heard the sounds of trampling heels, and presently
Jack appeared, thundering along upon his two-legged steed, followed in the
distance by Fritz and Franz. These latter carried upon their cruppcrs game
bags, the contents oi'whieh were speedily displayed: four birds, a kangaroo,
twenty musk-rats, a monkey, two hares. and half--a-dozcn beaver rats, were
laid before me. Besides these, Fritz threw down,Krithout a word of ex-
planation, a bundle of thistles.

The boys seemed almost wild with excitement at the success of their
expedition, and presently Jack exclaimed: _

"0h, father, you can't think what grand fun hunting on an ostrich is.
We flew along like the wind; sometimes I could scarcely breathe, \ve wcre
going at such a rate, and was obliged to shut my eyes because of the terrific
rush of air; really, father, you must make me a mask with glass eyes to
ride with, or I shall be blinded one of these fine days."

"Indeed ! " rcplicrl l,. "I must do no such thing."

"Why not?" asked he, with a look of amazement upon hi: face.

"For two reasons: firstly, because I do not consider that l mus! do
anything that you demand; and, secondly, because I think that you are very
Capable of doing it yourself. However, I must congratulate you upon your
abundant supply of game; you must indeed have worked hard. Yet I wish
that you would let me know when you intend starting on such along
expedition as this; you forget that, though you yourselves know that you
are quite safe, and that all is going on well, yet that we at home are kept
in a constant state of anxiety. Now, oil" with you, and look to your animals,
and then you may find Supper ready."

Presently the boys returned, and we prepared for a most appetising'
meal which the mother set before us.

While we were discussing the roast pig, and washing it down with
fragrant mead, Fritz described the day's expedition. 4

it was with immense pride that Jack displayed the kangaroo which he
had run down with his swift oourser. Contributions to the garden had not
been forgotten, and Fritz handed over to his mother several cuttings from
cinnamon and sweet-apple trees. li'inally, when all the other treasures had
been displayed, Fritz begged me. to examine the thistlcs which he had
gathered, thinking, he said, that it was a plant used in the inanul'acture of
wool. He was perfectly i'ight, for I recognESed it at once as the "fuller-'5

tezillc," a plant whose sharp little thorns, which cover the stem and leaves,
are used to raise the nap of cloth.

We resolved to be up hctimcs the following morning, that we might
attend to the preparation at" the booty, and as I now noticed that the boys
were all becoming: extremely drowsy: I closed the day with eveningr devotions.

The number of the creatures we killed rendered the removal of their
shins a matter of no little time and trouble. I: was not an agreeable task
at any time, and When 1 saw the array of animals the boys had brought
me to flay, I determined to construct. :1 machine which would considerably
lessen the labour. Amongst the ship's stores, in the surgeon's chest .1 dis-
covered a large syringe. his, with a few alterations, would serve my purpose230 71115 XIV/SS 10111172! l7 ROIYLVSON.

admirably. Within the tube I first fitted a couple of valves, and then, pcr--
I'orating the stopper, 1 had in my possession a powerful air pump.

The boys stared at me in blank amazement when, armed with this
instrument, 1 took up the kangaroo, and declared myself ready to commence
operations.

"Skin a kangaroo with a squirt?" said they, and a roar of laughter
followed the remark.

lumdc no reply to the jests which followed, but silently hung the ham
game by its hind legs to the branch of a tree. I then made a small incision
in the skin, and, insert' 1g the mouth of the syringe, forced air with all my
might between the skin and the body of the animal. By degrees the hide
of the kangaroo distended, altering the shape of the creature entirely.

Still I worked on, forcing in yet more air until it had become a more
shapeless mass, and l' soon round that the skin was almost entirely separated
from the caroasc. A hold cut down the hu' v, and a few touches here and
there where the ligaturcs still bound the him: to the body, and the animal
was flayed. _

"What a splendid plan i" cried the boys; "but why should it do it?"

" For a most simple and natural reason," I replied; "do you not know
that the skin of an animal is attached to its flesh merely by slender and
delicate fibres, and that between these exist thousands 01" little bladders or
air chambers; by forcing air into these bladders the fibres are stretched,
and at length, elastic as they are, cracked. The skin has now nothing to
unite it to the body, and, consequently, may be drawn off with perfect ease.
'l'his scientific fact has been known for many year: The Creenlanders make
constant use of it; when they have killed a seal or walrus they distend the
skin that they may tow the animal more easily ashore, and then remove
its hide at a moment's notice."

The remaining animals were subjected to the same treatment, and, to
my great joy, in a couple of days the skins were all off, and being prepared
for use.

I now summoned the boys to assist me in procuring blocks of wood
for my crushing machine, and the following day we set forth with saws,
ropes, axes, and other tools. We soon reached the tree I had selected for
my purpose, and I began by sending Fritz and Jack up into the tree with
axes to cut off the larger of the high branches, that, when the tree tell, it
might not injure its neighbours. They then descended, and Fritz and I attacked
the stem. As the easiest and most speedy method we used a saw, such an
one as is employed by Sawyers in a saw-pit, and, Fritz taking one end and
l the other, the tree \vas soon out half through. We then adjusted ropes that we
might guide its fall, and again began to cut. It was laborious work, but
when l considered that the cut was sulliciently deep we took the ropes and
pulled with our united strength. The trunk cracked, swayed, tattered, and
fell with a crash. The boughs were speedily topped off, and the trunk
sawed into blocks four feet long.17' i' if 1' 'l:'.S'}"'/.-\-'(,'. 2

While engaged on this undertakingy I had paid little attention to our
fields of grain, and, accordingly, great was my surmise when one evening

and with their crops perfectly full. It suddenly Struck me that these birds233 JfIE SIVISS [MJIILY ROBIJVSOA'.

damage they had done, and then found to my great joy that the grain was
perfectly ripe. -

The amount of work before us startled my wife. This unexpected liar-
vest, which added reaping and threshing to the fishing, salting, and pickling
already on hand, quite troubled her.

"Only think," said she, "of my beloved potatoes and manioc roots!
What is to become of them, I should like to know? it is time to take
them up, and how to manage it with all this press of work I can't see."

"Don't be down-hearted, wife," said I; "there is no immediate hurry
about the manioc, and digging potatoes in this fine light soil is easy work
compared to what it is in Switzerland; while, as to planting more, that will
not be necessary it we leave the younger plants in the ground. The harvest
we must conduct after the Italian fashion, which, although anything but
economical, will save time and trouble, and its we are to have two crops in
the year, we need not lie too particular."

Without further delay, I commenced levelling a I'rge space of firm
clayey ground to act as a threshing floor; it was well sprinkled with water,
rolled, beaten, and stamped. As the sun dried the moisture it was watered
anew, and the treatment continued until it became as flat, hard, and smooth
as a threshing-floor need be.

Our-largest w"~ker basket was then slung between Storm and Grumble;
we armed ourselves with reaping--hooks, and went forth to gather in th;
corn in the simplest and most expeditious manner imaginable. I told my
rcapers not to concern themselves about the length of the straw, but to
grasp the corn where it was convenient to them, without stooping. Each
was to wind :1 stalk round his own handfu'1, and throw it into the basket;
in this way great labour was saved. The plan pleased the boys immensely,
and in a short time the basket had been filled many times, and the
lield displayed a quantity of tall headless stubble, which perfectly horrified
the mother, so extmvagant and untidy did she consider our work.

"This is dreadful! " cried she; "you have left numbers of ears growing
on short stalks, and look at that splendid straw completely wasted! I
don't approve of your Italian fashion at all."

"It is not a bad plan, I can amure you, wife, and the Italians do
not waste the straw by not cutting it with the grain. Having more arable
than pasture land, they use this high stubble for their cattle, letting them
feed in it, and eat what grain is left; afterwards, allowing the grass to
grow amongst it, they mow all together for winter fodder. And now for
threshing, also in Italian fashion. We shall find it spare our arms and
backs as much in that as in reaping."

The little sheaves were laid in a large circle on the floor; the boys
mounted Storm, Crumble, Lightfoot, and Hurry, starting off at a brisk
trot, with many a merry jest, and round they went, trampling and stamping
out the grain, while dust and chali' flew in clouds about them.l'l/I R 1'17: TIA-'0. 233

My wife and I Were incessantly occupied with hay-forks, by means
of "hieh we shook up and inevcd the sheaves over which the threshers
1ode, so as to throw them in the tiaek.

l'rom time to time the animals took mouthluls of the tempting food
they weie beating out; no thought they well deserved it, and called to
mind the command given to the Jews, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
that treadeth out the Corn."

After threshing, we proceeded to winnowing. By simply throwing the
threshed corn with shovels high in the air when the land or sea-breeze
blew strong, the chafi" and refuse was carried away by the wind and the
grain fell to the ground.

During these operations mir poultry paid the threshing-floor many visits,
testifying :1 li1'c3y interest in the success of our labours, and gobbling
up the grain at such a rate that my wife was obliged to keep them at
a reasonable distance; but I would not have them altogether stinted in
the midst of our plenty. I said: "Let them enjoy themselves; what we
lose in grain we gain'in flesh. I anticipate delicious chicken-pie, roast
goose, and boiled turkey!

When our harvest stores were housed, we found that we had reaped
sixty, eighty, even a hundred fold what had been sown. ()nr garner was
truly filled with all manner of store.

Expecting a second harvest, we were constrained to prepare the field
for sowing again, and immediately, therefore, commenced mowing down
the stubble. \Vl1ile engaged in thi , flocks of quails and partridges came
to glean among the scattered ears. We did not secure any great number,
but resolved to be prepared for them next season, and by spreading
nets to catch them in large quantities.

My wife was satisfied when she saw the straw carried home and
stacked; our crop of maize, which of course had not been threshed like
the other corn, afforded soft leaves which were used for stalling mattresses,
while the stalks, when burnt, left ashes so rich in alkali as to be
especially useful.

I changed the crops sewn on the ground to W e, barley, and oats, and
hoped tl1e1' would ripen before the rainv season.

1' he shoals of herring made their appeaiance just as we finished our
ag1icultural operations. This year we pickled only two barrels of them;
but we were not so merciful towards the seals, which arrived on the
coast directly afterwards. We hunted them vigorously, requiring their
skins for many purposes, more especially for the completion of the
cajack. On the little deck of that tiny vessel I had made a kind of
magazine, in which to store pistols, ammunition, water, and provisions,
and this I meant to cover with seal-skin, so as to be quite water-tight.
A couple of harpoons furnished with seal bladders were to be suspended
alongside.we START A I'lGEON Post

T last came the day when Fritz was to make his trial trip with the

cajack. Completely equipped in swimming costumc----trouscrs, jacket,

and cap--it was most ludicrous to see him cower down in the canoe and
put? and blow till he began to swell like the frog in the table.

Ail trace of his original figure was speedily lost, and shouts of laughter
greeted his comical appearance. Even his mother could not resist a smile,
although the dress was her own invention.

I got the other boat out, that my wife might see we were ready to
go to his a ' tauce the moment it became necessary.

The cajaclt was launched from a convenient shelving point, and floated
lightly on the sea-green ocean mirror. li'ritz with his paddles then began
to practise all manner of evolutions: darting along with arrowy swil'tness,
wheeling to the right, then to the left, and at last, flinging himself quite
on his side, while his mother uttered a shriek of terror, he showed that the
tiny craft would neither capsizc nor sink. Then, recovering his balance, he
sped securely on his further way.

Encouraged by our shouts of approbation, he now boldly ventured into
the strong current of Jackal River, and was rapidly carried out to sea.

This being more than I had bargained for, I lost no time in giving chase
in the boat, with Ernest and Jack, my wife urging us to greater speed,
and declaring that some accident could not fail to happen to "that horrid
soap-bubble."

W e soon arrived outside the bay, at the rocks where formerly lay the
wreck, and gazed in all directions for signs of the runaway.

After a time we saw, at a considerable distance, a faint pull" of smoke,
followed by the crack of a pistol. Upon this we fired a signal shot, which
was presently answered by another, and, steering in the direction of the
sound, we soon heard the boy's cheery halloo ; the cajacl: darted from behind
a point of land, and we quickly joined company.

"Come to this rocky beach," cried Fritz; "I have something to
show you."

With blank amazement we beheld a fine well-grown young walrus, liar-
pooned and quite dead."-75 SEWER] .Il l'lUEO.\-" ['05]: 'j

"Did you kill this creature, my dezn' Fritz?" I exclaimed, looking:

these rocks, and expired. I landed, and scrambled to where he lay; but
I took care to give him the contents of my pistol before going close
up, having a salutary recollection of the big serpent's parting fling at you,
Jack."

"You ran a very great risk," said I. " The walrus is an inoffensive
creature; but when attacked and wounded it often becomes furious, and,
turning upon its pursuer, can destroy, with its long tusks, a strongly--built
whale boat. However, thank God for your safety! I value that above a
thousand such creatures. Now what's to be done with him? He must be
quite fourteen feet long, although not full grown."

"I am very glad you followed me, father," said Fritz; "but our united
strength will not move this prodigious weight from among these rocks; only
do let me carry away the head, with these grand snow-white tasks! I
should so like to fasten it on the prow of the cajack, and name it the
Sea-horse." .

"We must certainly carry away the beautiful ivory tusks," said I ; "but
maize haste! The air feels so excessively close and sultry: I think 11 51011"-
is brewing."

"But the head.l the head! we must have the whole head," cried Jack;
" just think how splendid it will look on the eajack!"

"And how Splendid it will smell too, when it begins to pntrefy," added
Ernest; "what a treat for the steersxnan !"

"Oh, we will prepare for that," said Fritz; "it shall he soaked, and
cleaned, and dried till it is as hard as a wooden model; it shall not offend
your delicate nose in the least, Ernest!"

"I supposed the walrus to be an animal peculiar to the Arctic regions,"
remarked Ernest.

"And so it is," I replied; "though they may occasionally be seen else--
where. These may have wandered from the Antarctic seas. I know that
on the eastern coast of Africa is found a smaller species of walrus called the
dugong: it has long incisor teeth, but not tusks, and certainly resembles
a seal rather than a walrus."

While thus speaking, we were activelyengaged in the decapitation of
the walrus, and in cutting oll' long strips of its skin. This took some time,
as we had not the proper implements, and Fritz remarked that in future
the ('ajaek must be provided with a hunting-knife and a hatchet, and adding
that he should like to have a small compzm in a box with a glass top,
fixed in front of the hole where the steersman sits. I saw the necessity of
this, and I promised it should be done. '

Our work being accomplished, we were ready to go, and I proposed to
take Fritz and the canoe on board our heat, so that we might all arrive
together; but I yielded to his earnest wish to return alone as he came.
H0 imiged to act as our avant-courier, and announce our approach to his
mom"; so he was soon skimming away over the surface of the water,
while we followed at a slower rate.IVI'I.' START A It'd/{UA' POST.

 

Black clouds meanwhile gathered thick and fast around us, and a
tremendous storm came on. Fritz was out of sight. and beyond our reach.

""6 buckled on the swimming belts, and firmly lashed ourselves to
the boat, so that we might not be washed overboard by the towering,
seas which broke over it.

The horizon was shrouded in darkness, fearful gusts or" wind lashed
the ocean into foam, rain descended in torrents, while liv'i lightning glared
athwart the gloom. Both my boys faced the danger nobly; and my feelings
of alarm were mingled with hope on finding how well the boat behaved.

'l'he tempest swept on its wav, and the sky began to clear as sud-
denly as it had been overcast; yet the stern waves continued for a
long time to threaten our frail hark with destruction, in spite of its
buoyancy and steadiness.

Yet I never lost hope for ourselves--all my fears were for Fritz; in
fact I gave him up for lost. and my whotc agonised heart arose in prayer
for strength to say, "Thy will be done!"

At last we rounded the point, and, once more entering Safety Bay,
quickly drew near the little harbour.

\Vhat was our surprise--our overwhelming delight--when there we saw
the mother with Fritz, as well as her little boy, on their knees in prayer
so earnest for our deliverance that our approach was unperceived, until with
cries of joy we attracted their notice. T hen indeed ensued a happy meeting,
and we gave thanks together for the mercy which had spared our lives.

Returning joyfully to Rockburg, we changed our drenched garments for
warm dry clothes ; and, seated at a muilortahle meal, Considered and ties
cribed at our ease the perils of the storm.

Afterwards, the head of the walrus was conveyed to our workshop,
where it underwent such a skilful and thorough process of cleaning, embahni if
and drying that ere long it was actually fixed on the prow of the caja .
and a most imposing appearance it presented.

The strips of hide, when well-tanned and prepared, made. valuable leather.

Much damage had been done by the late storm. The heavy rain had
flooded all the streams, and injured crops which should have been housed
and safe before the regular rainy season.

The bridge over Jackal River was partly broken down, and the water
tanks and pipes all needed repair, so that our time was much occupied in
restoring things to order,

On going to work one day near the cascade, we found a great number
of dark red berries scattered on the ground; they were about the size of
ordinary hazel-nuts, with small leafy curonets at the tip.

The boys thought them so inviting that they tasted them at once, but
angry cxclamations and much spitting and spluttering followed the experimeni;
even Knips rejected them, and they would have been cast aside with con-
tempt had not the smell induced me to examine them. Idecided that
this was the fruit of the clove.

Some plants were immediately set in the nursery garden, and my wife
was pleased to have this excellent spice wherewith to flavour her boiled
rice and other dishes, in lieu of pepper--a very welcome variety to
every one.

Having a good supply of clay, brought from the bed near Falconhui'st,
I proposed to use it for making aqueducts ; and, observing how much the
recent rain had promoted the growth of our young com, 1 determined to
irrigate the lields with the drainage from our crushing mill.

The fishing season was again successful. Large takes of salmon, sturgeon,
and herring rewarded our annual exertions, and our store-room again assumed
a well-stocked appearance. Much as I wished that we could obtain a constant
supply of these fish fresh, I was obliged to reject the naive proposal from
Jarl; that we should tether a shoal of salmon by the gills to the bottom
of the buy as we had secured the turtles.

Many quite uneventful days passed by, and l perceived that the boys,
wearied by the routine of farm work at ROCliblll'g, were longing for a cruise
in the yacht or an expedition into the woods, which would refresh both
mind and body.

"Father," said Fritz at length, "' we want a quantity of hurdles, and
have scarcely any more hamhoos or- which to make them. Had we not
better get a supply from Woodlands? And you said, too, the other day,
that you wished you had some. more of the line clay: we might visit the
Cup at the same time."

Ihad really no objection to propose; and it was shortly afterwards
settled that Fritz, jack, and .lfranz should start together; and that Ernest,
who had no great desire to accompany his brothers, should remain with his
mother and me, and assist in the construction of a sugar~mill, the erection
0." which I had long contemplated.

Before they started, Fritz bogged some bear's meat from the mother,
to make pemmiean.

"And what may pcmmican be?" she asked.

"lt is food carried by the fur-traders of North America on their
long journeys through the wild country they traverse; and consists of

His mother consented "to humour him," as shc: said, although with--
out much faith in the value oi" the preparation; and in the course oi"
two days a stock of pennnican sullicient for a Polar expedition was
{an rted by our enthusiastic son.

They were ready to start, when I observed Jack quietly slip a
basket, containing several pigeons, under the packages in the cart.

"Oh, oh!" thought I, "the little fellow has his doubts about that
pemmican, and thinks a tough old pigeon would be preferable."

The weather .was exquisite; and, with cxhorlations to prudence and

very highest spirits. Storm and Crumble, as usual, drew the cart, and were
ridden by Fritz and 1" ram; while Hurry carried Jack swiftly across the Mk ',
in advance of them, followed by Floss. and Bruno, barking at his. heels.

The sugar-mill occupied us for several clays, and was made so much
like our other mills that I need not now describe it.

On the evening of the first. day, as we sat resting in the porch at
Rockburg, we naturally talked of the abscntces, wondering and guessingr
what they might be about.

Ernest looked rather mysterious, and hinted that he might hem:
news of them next morning.

Just then a bird alighted on the dovocot, and entered. 1 could not
see, in the failing light, whether it was one of our own pigeons or an
intruder. Ernest started up, and said he would see that all was right.

In a few minutes he returned with a scrap of paper in his hand.

"News, father! The very latest news by pigeon-post, mother!"~

"Well done, boys! What a capital idea!" said I, and takingr (he

".\ true hunter's letter!" laughed I; "but what exciting news! When

"'l'o-night, l hope," said he, while his mother sighed, and doubted the
value of such glimpses into the scenes of danger through which her sons
were passing, declaring she would much rather wait and hear all about it
when she had them safe home again.

Thus the winged letter-carriers kept us informed from day to day of
adventures which were afterwards more fully described.

On approachi g the farm at Woodlands, the boys were startled by
hearing, as they thought, human laughter, repeated again and again; while,
to their astonishment, the oxen tcstilicd the greatest uneasiness, the dogs
growled and drew close to their masters, and the ostrich fairly bolted with
jack into the rice swamp.

'l'hc laughter continued, and the beasts became unmanageable.

"Something is very far wrong!" cried Fritz. "I cannot leave the
animals; but while I unharness them, do you, Franz, take the dog's, and
advance cautiously to see what is the matter."

Without a moment's hesitation, Franz made his way among the bushes
with his gun, and closely followed by the dogs; until, through an opening in
the thicket, he could see, at the distance of about forty paces, an enormous
liya'na, in the mosr wonderful state of excitement, dancing round a lamb
just killed, and uttering, from time to time, the ghastly hysterical laughter
which had pealed through the forest.

The beast kept running backwards and Forwards, rising on its hind legs,
and then rapidly whirling round and mund, nodding its head, and going
through most frantic and ludicrous antics.

Franz kept his presence or mind very well; for he watched till,
calming down, the lryznna began with horrid growls to tear its prey; and
:hen, firing steadily both barrels, he broke its foreleg and w0unded it in
the breast.

Meanwhile Fritz, having nnyolicd the oxen and secured thorn to trees,
hurried to his brother's assistance. The dogs and the dying hyzena were by
this time engaged in mortal strife; but the latter, although it severely wounded
both bless and Bruno, speedily succumbed, and was (lead when the bOys
reached the Spot. They raised a shout of triumph, which guided Jack to
the scene of action ; and their first care was for the dogs, whose wounds
they drcsscd before minutely examining the hymna. It was as large as a
wild boar, long still" bristles formed a mane on its neck, its colour was grey
marked with black, the teeth and jaws were of extraordinary strength, the
thighs muscular andsinewy, the claws remarkably strong and sharp. Altogether,
but for his wounds, he would certainly have been more than a match for
the dogs.

Alter unloading the cart at the farm, the boys returned for the carcasc
of the tiger--wolf, as it is sometimes called, and occupied themselves in
skinning it during the remainder ol" the day, when, after despatching theWE START A P/Glz'OJV POST. 2.;1

carrier-pigeon to Rockburg, they retired to rest on their hearskin rugs, to
dream of adventures past and future.

The following day they devised no less a scheme than to survey the
shores of Wood Lake, and place marks wherever the surrounding marsh was
practicable, and might be crossed either to reach the water or leave it.

Fritz in the cajack, and the boys on shore, carefully examined the
ground together; and when they found firm footing to the water's edge, the
spot; was indicated by planting a tall bamboo, bearing on high a bundle of
reeds and branches.

'l'hcy succeeded in capturing three young black swans, after considerahie
resistance from the old ones. They were afterwards brought to Rockburg,
and detained as ornaments to Safety Bay. '

Presently a beautiful heron thrust his long neck from among the reeds,
to ascertain what all the noise on the lake was about. Before he could
satisfy his curiosity, Fritz unhooded his eagle, and though the heron vainly
llappcd and struggled, his legs and Wings were gently but firmly bound, and
he had to own himself vanquished, and submit to the inspection of his
delighted captors.

It was their turn to be alarmed next, for a large, powerful auirnal came
puffing with a curious whistling sound through the dense thicket of reeds,
passing close by and sorely discomposing them by its sudden appearance
lt was out of sight immediately, before they could summon the dogs, and
from their description it must have been a tapir, the colour dark brown,
and in form resembling a young rhinoceros, but with no horn on the nose
and the upper lip prolonged into a trunk something like that of an elephant
on a smaller scale. It is a gentle creature, but when attacked becomes a
fierce opponent, and can wound dogs dangerously with its powerful teeth.

The tapir can swim and dive with perfect ease, and abounds in the densely
wooded swamps and rivers of tropical America.

Fritz in his cajack followed for a time the direction in which the tapir
proceeded, but saw no more of it.

Meanwhile the other two boys returned to the farm by the rice-fields,
and there fell in with a flock of cranes, five or six of which they caught
alive, among them two demoiselles or Numidian cranes. These birds they
shot at with arrows arranged in a skilful and original way, with loops of cord
dipped in birdlimc attached to them, so that it often happened that the
bird aimed at was entangled and brought down uninjured.

The young hunters seemed to have lived very comfortably on peccary
ham, cassava bread and fruit, and plenty of baked potatoes and milk.

()ne trial of the pernmican was suflicient, and it was handed over to
the dogs. Fritz, however, determined again to attempt the manufacture,
knowing its value when properly prepared.

After collecting a supply of rice and cotton, they took their way to
Prospect Hill; "and," said Fritz, as he afterwards vividly described the

through it as disagreeable as possible, for they howled and chattered at us
like demons, pelting us as hard as the}. could with pine cones.

"They became so unbearable that at last we fired a few shots right
and left among them; several bit the dust, the rest fled, and we continued
our way in peace to Prospect Hill, but only to discover the havoc the wretches
had 11121th there.

"Would you believe it, father? The pleasant cottage had been over-
run and ruined by apes just as Woodlands last summer! The most dreadful
dirt and disorder met our eyes wherever we turned, and we had hard work
to make the place fit for human habitation; and even then we preferred
the tent. I felt quite at a loss how to guard the farm for the future; but

"l mixed poison with milk, bruised millet, and anything I thought the
monkeys would eat, and put it in cocoa-nut shells, which I hung about in
the trees, high enough to be out of reach of our own animals. The evening:
was calm and lovely. The sea murmured in the distance, and the rising nioou
shed a beauty over the landscape which we seemed never before to have so
admired and enjoyed. The summer night closed around us in all its solemn
stillness, and our deepest feelings were touched; when suddenly the spell
was broken by an outburst of the most hideous and discordant noises.
.-\s by one consent, every beast of the forest seemed to arise from its den
and utter its \iild nocturnal cry. Snorting, snarling, and shrieking filled the
woods beneath us.

"170111 the hills echoed the inournlul bowl of jackals, answered by Fangs
in the yaid, who was backed up by the bailting and yelping of his friends
Hess and Bruno. Faraway beyond the rocky fastnesses of the Gap sounded
unearthly hollow snortings and neighing's, reminding: one of the strange cry
of the hippopotamus; ahovc these, occasional deep majestic roarings made our
hearts quail with the conviction that we heard the voices of lions and elephants.

"Ovenured and silent, \vc retired to rest, hoping to forget in sleep the
terrors of the midnight forest; but cre long the most fearful cries in the
adjoining woods gave notice that the apes were beginning to suffer from the
poisoned repast prepared for them.

"As our dogs could not remain silent amid the uproar and din, we
had not a wink of sleep until the morning. It was late, therefore, when we
rose, and looked 0:1 the awful spectacle presented by the multitude of dead
monkeys and baboons thickly strewn under the trees round the farm. I shall
not tell you how 111a 1v the1e neie. I can only say I \\ishedI had not

The same evening that the boys reached the
rocky pass, a messenger pigeon arrived at Rockburg,
bearing :1 note which concluded in the following
words:

"The barricade at the Cap is. broken down.
Everything laid waste as far as the sugar brake, where
the hut is knocked to pieces, and the fields trampled
over by huge li'wL-niarks. Come to us, father--we
are safe, buL feel we are no maLch for this unknown
danger."

I lost not an instant, but saddled Swift, late as it
was, in order to ride to the assistancc of our boys,
desiring Ernest to prepare the small cart and follow
me with his mother at daybreak, bringing cveqrthing
we should require for camping out for some days.

The bright nmonlight favoured my journey, and
my arrival at the Gap surprised and delighted the
boys, who (lid not expect me till next day. Early
on the. lbllowing morning I inspected the foot--prints
and ravages of the great unknown. The cane brake
had, without doubt, been visited by an elephant.
That great animal alone could have left such traces
and committed such tearful ravages. Thick posts in
the barricade were snapped across like reeds; the2 .3 4 777'}? S 77755 FA 1111'! /, l" I? 03 ILA-"501V.

trees in the vicinity, where we planned to build a cool summer-house,
were stripped of leaves and branches to a great height, but the worst
mischief was done among the young sugar-cane plants, which were all either
devoured or trampled down and destroyed.

. It seemed to me that not one elephant, but a troop, must have invaded
our grounds. The tracks were very numerous, and the foot-prints of various
sizes; but, to my satisfaction, I'saw that they could be traced not only
from the Gap, but back to it in evidently equal numbers.

We did not, therefore, suppose that the mighty animals remained hidden
in the woods of our territory; but concluded that, altcrthis ii'cchooting
incursion, they had withdrawn to their native wilds, where, by greatly in-
creasing the strength of our ramparts, we hoped henceforth to oblige them
to remain.

In what manner to ell'ect this we laid man}- plnns during the night of
my arrival, when, sitting by an enormous watch-iii" l chatted with my boys,
and heard details of their numerous adventures, so interesting for them to
relate that every one was more disposed to act sentinel than retire
to sleep. .

The mother and Ernest arrived next day, and she rejoiced to find all
well, makinglight of trodden fields and trampled sugar-canes, since her sons
were sound in life and limb.

A systematic scheme of defence was now elaborated, and the erection
of the barricade occupied us for at least a month, as it was to be a firm
and durable building, proof against all invasion. As our little tent was un-
suited to a long residence of this sort, I adopted Fritz's idea of a Kams-
ehatchan dwelling, and, to his great delight, forthwith carried it out.

instead of planting four posts on which to place a platform, we chose
four trees of equal size, which, in a very suitable place, grew exactly in a
square twelve or fourteen feet apart. Between these, about twenty feet
from the ground, we laid a flooring of beams and bamboo, smoothly and
strongly plankcd. From this rose, on all four sides, walls of cane; the frame
of the roof was covered so cfiectually by large pieces of bark that no rain
could penetrate.

The staircase to this tree-cottage was simply a broad plank with deep
notches on each side it for steps. The flooring projected like a balcony in
front of the entrance door, and underneath, on the ground, we fitted up
sheds for cattle and fowls.

Various ornaments in Chinese or Japanese style were added to thereof
and caves, and a most convenient, cool, and picturesque cottage, overhung
and adorned by the graceiiil foliage of the trees, was the result of our
ingenuity.

I was pleased to find that. the various birds taken by the boys during
this excursion seemed likely to thrive; they were the first inmates of the

new sheds, and even the black swans and cranes soon became tame and
sociable.i-VE .S'i'L-IRT A PIGEOA' ["0572 245

Constantly roaming through the woods, the children often made new
discoveries.

Fritz brought one day, after an excursion to the opposite side of the
stream beyond the Gap, a cluster of bananas, and also of cacao--beans, from
which chocolate is made.

The banana, although valuable and nourishing food for the natives of
the tropical countries where it grows, is not generally liked by Europeans.
and probably this variety was even inferior to many others, for we found
the fruit much like rotten pears, and almost uneatable.

The cacao seeds tasted exceedingly bitter, and it seemed wonderful
that by preparation they should produce anything so delicious as chocolate.

My wife, who now fancied no manufacture beyond my skill, begged for
plants, seeds, or cuttings to propagate in her nursery garden, already fancying
herself in the enjoyment of chocolate for breakfast, and l promised to make
a cacao plantation ncar homo. _

"Let me have bananas also," said she, "for we may acquire a taste for
that celebrated fruit, and, at all events, 1 am sure i can make it into an
excellent preserve."

The day before our return to Rockburg, l-'ritz went again to the inland
region beyond the river to obtain a large supply of young banana plants
and of the cacao fruit. He took the cajack, and a bundle of reeds to float
behind him as a raft to carry the fruit, plants, and anything else he might
wish to bring back.

Iii-the evening he made his appearance, coming swiftly down stream.
His brothers rushed to meet him, each eager to see and help to land his
cargo.

Ernest and Fritz were quickly running up the bank, with arms full of
plants, branches, and fruit, when Fritz handed to Jack a dripping wet bag
which he had brought along partly under water. A curious pattcring noise
proceeded from this bag, but they kept the contents a secret for the present,
Jack running with it behind a bush before peeping in, and i could just hear
him exclaim:

"I--lollo! i say, what monsters they are! It's enough to make a fellow's
flesh creep to look at them!"

With that he hastily shut up the bag, and put it away safely out of
sight in water.

Securing the Cajack, Fritz sprang towards us, his handsome face radiant
with pleasure as be exhibited a beautiful water-fowl.

Its plumage was rich purple, changing on the back to dark green, the
legs, feet, and a mark above the bill bright red. This lovely bird 1 con--
cluded to be the Sultan cock described by Buffon, and, as it was gentle, we
gladly received it among our domestic pets.

Fritz gave a stirring account of his exploring trip, having made his war
for up the river, between fertile plains and majestic forests of lofty trees,
where the cries of vast numbers of birds, parrots, peacocks, guinea fowls,24f) TFIE SWISS FAJVILY [JO/{IAKWLM

and hundreds unknown to him quite bewildered him, and made him feel
giddy. '

"It was in the Buffalo Swamp," continued he, "that I saw the splendid
birds you call Sultan cocks, and I set my heart on catching one alive, which,
as they seemed to have little fear of my approach, I managed by means of
a wire snare. Farther en Isaw a grove of mimosa trees, among which huge
dark masses were moving in a deliberate way. Guess what they were i"

"Savages?" asked Franz, timidly.

"Black hears, I bet!" cried Jack.

" Your words suggest to my mind the manner and appearance of ele-
phants," said Emest.

" Right you are, Professor t" exclaimed Fritz, gaily, the words producingr
quite a sensation on the whole attentive family. "From fifteen to twenty
elephants were feeding peacefully on the leafy troughs, tearing down branches
with their trunks and shoving them into their months with one jerk, or
bathing in the deep waters of the marsh for refreshment in the great heat.
You cannot imagine the wild granderirof the scene! The river being very
broad, I felt safe from r-"Sld animals, and more than once saw splendid jaguars
crouched on the banks, their glossy skin glancing in the sunlight.

"While considering if it would be simply foolhardy t0 trya shot at
one of these creatures, I was suddenly convinced that discretion is the better
part of valour, and urging my canoe into the centre current, made a rapid
retreat down the river. For just before me, in the calm deep water of a
sheltered bay where I was quietly floating, there arose a violent boiling, bubbling
commotion, and for an instant I thought a hot spring was going to burst
forth--instead of that, up rose the hideous head and gaping jaws of a hippo-
potamus, who, with a hoarse terrific snort, seemed about to attack me. I
can tell you I did not wait to see the rest of him! A glimpse of his enor--
mous mouth and its array of white gleaming tuslrs was quite enough. "Right
about face !" said I to myself, and shot down the stream like an arrow,
never pausing till a bend in the river brought me within sight of the Gap,
where 1 once more felt safe, and joyfully made my way back to you all."

This narrative was of thrilling interest to us, proving the existence of
tribes ofthe most formidable animals beyond the rocky barrier which defended,
in so providential a manner, the small and fertile territory on which our
lot was cast.

During the absence of the adventurer we had been busily engaged in
making preparations for our departure, and everything was packed up and
ready by the morning after his return.

After some hesitation I yielded to his great wish, which was to return
by sea in his cajaclr round Cape l')isappointment, and so meet us at Rockhui'g.

He was much interested in examining the outlines of the coast and the
rugged precipices of the Cape. These were tenanted by vast flocks of sea-
fowl and birds of prey; while many varieties of shrubs and plants, hitherto
unknown to us, grew in the clefts and crevices of the rocks, some of them"'1'; START -I PIG/EON ["0572 24;

diffusing a strong aromatic odour. Among
the specimens he brought lrecognised the
caper plant, and, with still greater pleasure,
a shrub which was, I felt sure, the [621'-
plant of China--it bore very pretty white
liowexs,und the leaves resembled myrtle.

ostrich, carried the mysterious wet bag very carefully slung at his side, and
when near home started oifat a prodigious rate in advance of us.

He let {all the drawbridge, and we saw no more of him until, on reach--
ing Rookburg, he appeared leisurely returning from the swamp, where
apparently he had gone to deposit his "moist secret," as Franz called it.

We were all glad to take up our quarters once more in our large and
convenient dwelling, and my first business was to provide for the great
number of birds we now had on our hands, by establishing them in suitable
localities, it being impossible to maintain them all in the poultry-yard. Some
were, therefore, taken to the islands; and the black swans, the heron, the
graceful demoisclle cranes, and our latest acquisition, the splendid Sultan cock,
soon became perihetl}~ at home in the swamp, greatly adding to the interest
of the neighbourhood of Safety Bay.

The old bustards were the tamcst of ali our feathered pets, and never
more so than at meal-times. They were unfailing in their attendance when
we (lined or supped in the open air.

Towards evening, as we sat in the verandah listening to Fritz's account
of his trip round the Cape, an extraordinary hollow roaring noise sounded
from the swamp, not unlike the angry bellowing of a bull.

The dogs barked, and the {tunily rose in excitement; but I remarked
a look of quiet humour in I'i'itz's eye, as he stood leaning against one of the
verandah pillars, watching Jack, who, in some confusion, started off towards
the marsh. \

"Come back, you silly boy!" cried his mother; "the child has not so
much as a pistol, and is rushing oli' alone to face he knows not what i"

" Perhaps," said I, looking at Fritz, "this is not a case requiring the
use of fire-arms. It may he only the booming of a bittern which we hear."

"You need not be uneasy, mother," Said Fritz; "Jack knows what he
is about; only this charming serenade took him by surprise, and I fancy he
will have to exhibit his treasures before they reach perfection. Yes, here
he comes !"

Logging his "moist secret" along with him, Jack, flushed and breathless,
came up to us, exclaiming:

"They were to grow as big as rabbits before you saw them l Such a
shame! I never thought they would kick up a row like that. Now for
it !"--'1nd he turned out the bani. "This is '(3race,' and this is 'Beauty.""

Two immense frogs rolled clumsily on the ground, and recovering their
feet, sat squat before us, swelling and puffing with a ludicrous air of insulted
dignity, while peals of laughter greeted them on all sides.

"Ladies and gentlemen, these are two very handsome young specimens
of" the famous Ai'riean hull--frog," said Jack, pretending to be oFfendcd at the
mingled disgust and amusement occasioned by their appearance; "they are
but half--grown, and I hoped to maintain them in seclusion until they
reached full size, when I would have introduced them with proper (54'ch1. But

I must beg for your kind and indulgent patronage, and--leave to Lake them
back to the swamp!"

Great. Clapping of hands followed Jack's speech.

"Grace" and " Beauty " were examined, and commented on with much
interest, and voted decidedly handsome "in their way."

'l'heir general colour was greenish brown, mottled and spotted with red-
dish-hromr and yellow; the sides green and black; the under part yellow
mottled with orange. The eyes were positively beautiful, of :1 rich chestnut
hue, cei'ei'ed with golden white dots, which shone with a metallin lustre.
The skin of the body was puckered into longitudinal folds.

By general consent they were remanded to the swamp.

Shortly after our return to Rockhurg, my wife drew my attention to
the somewhat negleCted state of our dear old summer residence at Falcon-
liurst, begging me to devote some time to its restoration and embellishment.

This 1 most willingly undertook, and we removed thither, as soon as
the boys had completed the arrangement of the artificial salt-lick to their
smtisfaclion.
At Fulconhurst things were quickly in good order, and we; made a great
improvement by completing the broad terrace supported on tho arching roots
of the trees---it was hotter floored--and rustic pillars and tn. -worlt sus-

The fountains, trellised verandahs, and plantations round Kochburg com~
pletely changed the character of the residence which, on account of the heat
and want of vegetation, had in former days been so distasteful to my wile.
Flowering creepers Overhung the. balconies and pillars; while shrubs and
trees, both native and European, grew luxuriantly in groves of our planting:

In the distance, Shark Island, now clothed with graceful palms, guarded
the entrance to Safety Bay, the battery and f'lagstaff prominently Visible on
its crested rock.

The swamp, cleared and drained, was now a considerable lake, with just.
marsh and reeds enough beyond it to form good cover for the waterl'owl
whose favourite retreat it w '.

On its blue waters sailed stately black swans, snow-white geese, and
richly-coloured ducks; while out and in among the water-plants and rushes
would appear at intervals glimpses of the brilliant Sultan, marsh-fowl, crimson
llamingocs, soft blue-grey deinoiselle cranes, and crested heron, all associating
in harmony, and with no {car of us, their masters.

The giant frogs, Grace and Beauty, delighted Jack by actually attaining
in time to the size of" small rabbits ; 'and perfectly knowing their very appro-
priate names, would waddle out ofthc marsh at his call, to eat a grasshopper
or dainty fly.

Beneath the spreading trees, and through the aromatic shrubhcrics, old
Hurry, the ostrich, was usually to be seen marching about, with grave and
dignified pace, as though monarch of all he surveyed. Every variety of beau-
til'ul pigeon nested in the rocks and dovceots, their soft cooing and glossy
plumage making them favourite household pets.

By the hridge alone could Rocliburg he approached; for higher up the
river, where, near the cascade, it was fordable, a dense and impenetrable
thicket of orange and lemon trees, Indian figs, prickly pears, and all manner
of thorn-bearing shrubs, planted by us, now formed a complete barrier.

The rabbit~warrmr on Shark Island kept us well supplied with food, as
Well as soft and useful fin; and, as the antelopes did not thrive on Whale
Isle, they also were placed among the shady groves with the rabbits, and
their own island devoted to such work as candlemaking, tanning, wool--clean--
ing, and any other necdlhl but offensive operations.

The farm at Woodlands flourished, and our flocks and herds supplied us
with mutton, beef, and veal, while my wife's dairy was almost more than
she could manage.

My boys retained their old love for giving names to "the animals. They
had a beautiful Crean'iy-whitc cow, called Blanche, and a hull with such a
tremendous voice that he received the name of Stcntor. 'l'wo fleet young
onagcrs were named Arrow and Dart; and Jack had a descendant of his old
favourite Fangs, the jackal, which he chose to call Coco, asserting that no
word could be distinguished at a distance without "0" in it, givingr illustrations
of his theory till our ears were almost deafened.

though my wife oer: {oually suffered from 5'
boys sometimes met with little accidents.

They were all fine handsome fellows: Fritz, now twenty--tour, was of
moderate height, uncommonly strong, active, nnscular, and high-spirited.

Ernest, two years younger, was tall and slight; in disposition, mild.
calm, and studious; his early faults of indolcnee and selfishness were almost
entirely overcome. He possessed refined tastes. and great intellectual power.

jack, at twenty, strongly resembled Fritz, being about his height, though
more lightly built, and remarkable rather for active grace and agility than
for muscular strength.

Franz, a Zively youth of seventeen, had some of the qualities of each
of his brothers; he possessed wit and shrewdness, but not the arch drullet'y
of Jack.

All were honourable, God-fearing young men, dutiful and affectionate
to their mother and myse ' and warmly tttached to each other.

Although so many )L s had elapsed in total seclusion, it continued to
be my strong impr ...i0n that we should one day be restored to the society
of our fellow men.

But Time, which was bringingr our sons to manhood, was also (:2 "ing
thoh' parents onwards to old age; and anxious, gloomy thoughts relating
to their future, should they be left indeed alone, sometimes oppressed
my heart.

On such occasions I would not communicate the sense of depression to
my family, but, turning in prayer to the AlmightyFathcr, laid my trouble
before Him, with novel .hng' renewal of strength and hope.

My elder sons often made expeditions of which we knew nothing until
their return after many hours, when any uneas .e_,. I might have felt was
dissipated by their joyous appearance, and reproof always (lied away on
my lips.

Fritz had been absent one whole day from Roekburg, and not until
evening did we remark that his cajaek was gone, and that he must be out
at so: .

Anxious to see him return before nightlall, I vent off to Shark Island
with l'lrnest and Jack, in order to look out for him from the watch--tower
there, at the same time hoisting our signal llag and loading the gun.

Long we gazed across the expanse of" ocean glittering in the level beams
of the setting sun, and finally dis ,crned a small black speck in the distance
which, by the telescope, was proved to be the returning wanderer.

l remarked that his skill sailed at a slower rate than usual towards the
shore, 'I'he cannon was fired to let him know that his approach was observed,
and their we joyfully hurried back to receive him at the. harbour.

It was easy to see, as he drew near, what had delayed his progress.
The eajaek towed a large sack, besides being heavily laden.

"Welcome, Fritz!" I cried. "\Veloome back, wherever you come
from, and whatever you bring. You seem to have quite a cargo there!"

"Yes, and my trip has led to discoveries as well as booty," answered
he; "interesting discoveries which will tempt us again in the same direction.
Come, boys, let's carry up the things, and while I rest I will. relate my
adventures."

As soon as possible all assembled round him.

" I think my absence without leave deserves reproach instead of this
warm reception, father, and I must apologise for it," he began. "But ever
since I possessed the cajack it has been 111\-' ambition to make :1 Voyage of
(liscmmeiy along the coast, which "e have never crplored hey end the point
at uhich I killed the walrus.

"In o1der to be ready to start without delay when a convenient op-
portunity olfered, I made preparations beforehand, such as provisioning my
skiff, fixing the compass in front of my seat, arranging conveniently rifle,
harpoon, axe, boat-hook, and fishing-net. I also resolved to take with me
Pounce, my eagle, and this I always will do in future.

"This morning dawned magnificently; the calm sea, the gentle breeze,
all drew me irresistibly to the fulfilment of my purpose.

"I left the harbour unpcrccived, the current quickly bore me out to
sea, and I rounded the point to the left, passing just over the spot where,
beneath the waves, lie the guns, cannon balls, ironwork, and all that was
indestructible about our good old wreck. And would yOu believe it?
Through the glassy clear water, undisturbed by a ripple, I actually saw
many such things strewn on the flat rocky bottom.

"Pursuing my way, I passed among cliiis and rocks which jutted
out from the shore, or rose in rugged masses from the water. Myriads of
sea-fowl inhabited the most inaccessible of these, while on the lower ridges
seals, sea-bears, and walruscs were to be seen, some basking lazily in the
sun, some plunging into the water, or emerging awkwardly from it, hoisting
their unwieldy bodies up the rocks by means of their tusks

"I must confess to feeling anything but comfortable while going tlnounh
the places held in possession by these monste1s oi the deep, and used eveiy
effort to pass quickly and unnoticed. Yet it was more than an hour and a
half before I got clear of the rocks, "cliffs, and shoals to which they resorted,
and neared a high and precipitous cape, running far out to sea. Right
opposite to me, in the side of this rocky wall, was a magnificent archway,
forming, as it first appeared to me, a lofty entrance to an immense vaulted
cavern. I passed beneath this noble portal and examined the interior. It
was tenanted by numbers of a small species of swallow, scarcely larger than
a wren, and the walls were coxered by thousands of their nests. They were
rudely built, and their peculiarity was that each rested on a kind 01" platform,
something like a spoon without the handle. I detached a number, and
found that they had a curious appearance, seemingly made of something
fibrous and gelatinous, and more like a set 01 sponges, corals, or fungi than
nests of birds. I have brought them home in my fishing net."

"If we had commercial dealings with the Chinese," said I, "your dis--77433 7 Y/e/l NS L/l KER. 255

cox-'ery would be of value; these are doubtless edible birds'-nests. The bird
is called the esculent swallow, and the trade in this strange article of diet
is a very large one. The nests are of dillerent value, but those which are
quite new and nearly white are held in such esteem that they are worth
their weight in silver.

" There are tremendous caverns in Java and other places where, at
great risk, these nests are procured, the annual weight obtained being up-
wards of fifty thousand pounds, and the value more than PS200,000.

"When placed in water and well soaked, they soften and swell, and
are made into soup of very strengthening and restorative quality.

"I think you might try your hand on these, mother, just for curiosity's
sake."

"I' can't say I fancy the look of the queer things," said she, "but I'
don't mind trying if they will turn to jelly, though boiling birds'~ncsts is
cookery quite out of my line."

"Oh do, mother, let us taste birds'-nests as soon as you can, though
the idea makes me fancy my mouth full of feathers!" laughed Jack.

"it is really a most curious formation," said Fritz. "Whenee are the
Swallows supposed to get this kind of gelatine?"

"It has never been exactly ascertained," l replied, "whether the birds
discover or produce'this curious substance. But whatever may be its basis,
it is clear that a very large portion of it is furnished by certain glands, which
pour out a viscid secretion."

"After laying in my store of nests," continued Fritz, "I pursued my
way through this vaulted cave or corridor; which, presently turning, opened
into a very lonely bay, so calm and lake-like that, although of considerable
size, 1 concluded at once it must be nearly land-locked. Its shores, beyond
the rocky boundary through which I penetrated, extended in a fertile plain
towards what seemed the mouth of a river, beyond which lay rough and
probably marshy ground, and a dense forest of cedars, which closed the
VKHY.

" The water beneath me was clear as crystal; and, gazing into its depths
and shallows, I perceived beds of shell-fish, like large oysters, attached to
the rocks and to each other by tufts of hairy filaments.

"'If these are oysters,' thought 1, 'they must be better worth eating,
as far as size goes, than our little friends in Safety Bay.' And thereupon I
hooked up several clusters with my boat-hook, and landing soon after on
the beach, I flung them on the sand, resolving to fetch another load, and
then tow tliennafLer-mc in the fishing-net.

"The hot sun disagreed with their constitution, I suppose; for when I
came back the shells were all gaping wide open; so I began to examine
them, thinking that after all they were probably much less delicate than
the small oysters we have learnt to like so much.

" Somehow, when a. thing is to be 'cxamined,' one generally needs a
knife. The blade met with resistance here and there in the creature's body;255 77/}? S I-V/SS FA MIL Y ROBIIVS 01V.

and still closer 'cxamination' produced from it several pearly balls, like peas,
ofdifierent sizes. Do you think they can be pearls? I have a number
here in a box."

"0h, show them to us, Fritz!" cried the boys. " What pretty shining
things! and how delicately rounded! and how softly they gleam 1"

"You have discovered treasure, indeed!" I exclaimed: "why, these
are most beautiful pearls! Valueless, certainly, under present circumstances;
but they may prove a source of wealth should we ever again come into
contact with the civilised world. We must visit your pearl-oyster beds at
the earliest opportunity."

"After resting for some time, and refreshianr myself with food," pursued
Fritz, l'I resumed my survey of the coast, my progress somewhat impeded
by the bag of shell-fish, which I drew after me; but I proceeded without
accident past the mouth of the stream to the farther side of the bay, which
was there enclosed by a point corresponding to that through which I had
entered; and between these headlands I found a. line of reefs and sand-banks,
with but a single channel leading out to the open sea; from which, there-
fore, Pearl Bay, as I named it, lies completely sheltered.

"The tide was setting strongly in shore, so that I could not then attempt
a passage through it, but examined the crags of the headland, thinking 1
might pei'chance discover a second vaulted archway. I saw nothing remark-
able, however, but thousands of sea-fowl of every sort and kind, from the
gull and sea-swallow to the mighty albatross. _

"My approach was evidently regarded as an invasion and trespass; for
they regularly beset me, screaming and wheeling over my head, till, out oi"
all patience, I stood up and hit furiously about me with the boat-hook;
when, rather to my surprise, one blow struck an albatross with such force
that he fell stunned into the water. ,

"I now once more attempted to cross the reef by the narrow channel,
and, happily succeeding, found myself in the open sea, and, speeding home-
wards. joyfully saw our flag flying, and heard the welcome salute you fired."

Ilcre ended the narrative; but next morning Fritz drew me aside, and
confided to me a most remarkable sequel, in these words:

"There was something very extraordinary about that albatross, father.
I allowed you to suppose that I left it as it fell, but in reality I raised it
to the deck of the canoe, and then perceived a piece or" rag wound round
one of its legs. This Iremovcd, and, to my utter astonishment, saw English
words written on it, which I plainly made out to be: 'Savc an unfortunate
Englishwoman from the smoking rock !' -

"This little sentence sent a thrill through every nerve; my brain seemed
to whirl; I doubted the evidence of my senses. '

"'Is this reality or delusion?' thought I. 'Can it be true that a
fellowcreature breathes with us the air of this lonely region?" '

"I felt stupefied for some minutes; the bird began to show signs of life,
which recalled me to myself; and, quickly deciding what must be done, IZ'IEN YEARS 12/! 775k. 2;;

tore a strip from my handkerchief, on which I traced the words: 'Do not
despair! Help is nearl'

"This I carefully hound round one leg, replacing the rag on the other,
and then applied myself to the complete restoration of the bird. lt gradually
revived, and, after drinking a little, surprised me by suddenly rising on the
wing, fzdtering a moment in its flight, and then rapidly disappearing from
my view in a westerly direction.

"Now, father, one thought occupies inc' continually: will my note
ever reach this Englislmonran? Shall I be able to [ind and to save
her?"

I listened to this account with feelings of the liveliest interest and
astonishment. -

"My dear son," said I, "you have done wisely in confiding to me alone
your most exciting discovery. Until we knour more, we must not unsettle
the others by speaking of it; for it appears to me quite possible that these
words were penned long ago on some distant shore, where, by this time,
the unhappy stmrger may have perished miserably. By the 'smoking rock'
must he meant a volcano. There are none here."

Fritz was not disposed to look at the arse from this gloomy point of
View; did not think the rag so very old; believed smoke might rise from
a rock which was not volcanic; and evidently cherished the hope that he
might be able to respond effectually to this touchingappeal.

I was in reality as anxious as he was on the subject, but judged it
prudent to abate rather than excite hopes of success which might be doomed
to bitter disappointment.

After earnest consultation on the subject, we decided that Fritz should
go in search of the writer of the message, but not until he had so altered
the canoe as to fit it for carrying two persons, as well as provisions sufficient
to admit of his absence for a considerable time. lmpaticnt as he was, he
could not but see the wisdom of this delay.

We returned to the house, and saw the boys busily opening the oysters,
which they had had no time to do the previous night, and greatly excited
as ever and anon a pearl was found.

"May we not establish a pearl fishery at once, father?" shouted they.
"We might build a but on the shore of the hay, and set about it regularly."

An exclusion to Pearl Bay was now the event to which all thoughts
tnmed, and for which prepamtions on a grand scale were made. it was
to form, as it were, the basis of the more important voyage Fritz had in
view, and. to which, unsuspected by the rest, he oculd devote all his
attention.

1 took an opportunity, one day, when all were present, to remark in
a serious tone:

"I have been considering, dear wife, that our oldest son is now of an
age to be dependent on himself. I shall, therefore, henceforth leave him
at liberty to act in all respects according to his own judgment ; and, especially
in the matter of voyages or excursions, he must not be hampered by the
fear of alarming,r us should he choose to remain absent longer than we expect.
l have such entire confidence in his prudence, and at the same time in his
allection for us, that I am certain he will never needlessly cause us
anxiety."

Fritz looked gratefully towards me as I spoke; and his mother ratified
my words, embracing him affectionately, and saying, with emotion, " God
bless and preserve thee, my' boy!"

1t tool; some time to make several raking or scraping machines,'which
l invented for the purpose of detaching and lifting the oysters from their
native rocks; but that gave Fritz leisure to change the fittings of his canoe,
so as to have a spare seat in it.

His brothers naturally concluded he meant to take oneof them as
shipmate on board, and he allowed the mistake to continue. They occupied
themselves in making, various articles they expected to be of use, and bore
the delay with tolerable patience.

At last came the day when, taking leave of the mother and Franz,
we went on board the yacht, accompanied by some of the dogs; while
Jack, proudly occupying the new seat beside Fritz in the canoe, shared with
him the honour of leading the way in the character of pilots.mv YEARS L4 wave. 259

We passed safely through the rocks and shoals near Walrus Island into
an expanse of calm water, sheltered by jutting cliffs, where the sea glanced
like a mirror, and for the first time we observed the fairy-like shells of the
paper-nautilus sailing lightly over the dazzling surface.

It was impossible to see these lovely seafarers without wishing to
obtain specimens; and the canoe accordingly gave chase, presently securing
half-a-dozen, which were handed to us in the yacht to be carefully preserved
for the museum, and the place was ever after called Nautilus Creek.

Farther on we rounded a short promontory, flat, with an abrupt rock
at the extremity, to which we gave the name of Cape Pug-Nose; and then,
at some distance, appeared the grand clills of a headland running far out
to sea.

This I supposed we should have to weather, but our pilots made no
change in the course, and, following the canoe, we soon came in sight of
the majestic archway which offered us a short passage to Pearl Bay.

The wonderful architectural appearance of the pillars. arches, and
pinnacles surrounding and surmounting this noble entrance struck Inc with
admiration, resembling parts of a fine Gothic cathedral, and inducing me to
propose for it the name Cape Minster.

A perfect cloud of little swallows darted from the cavernous entrance
on our approach, divided into flocks, soared, wheeled, llew right and left,
and finally returned in a body, as swiftly as they came, to the sides of the
long dark tunnel, which were festooncd with their nests.

We detached a number of these as we passed, taking care to leave
those containing eggs or young. The best were at a considerable height, but.
the broken and shelving rocks arm-(lea, in some places, footing for such daringy
and active climbers as Fritz and Jack, and they quickly obtained as many
as we could possibly require.

Our progress was much assisted by the tide, which, like a current, bore
us onward along the nave of this natural cathedral, aisles, transepts, screens,
and side-chapels appearing between the columns and arches which in the
"dim religious light" were revealed to our wondering eyes.

0n emerging into the dazzling sunshine, we found ourselves floating in
the calm expanse of Pearl Bay; but it was some minutes before we could
look around on the bright and lovely scene.

Fritz had not over-rated its beauty, and the romantic islets which
studded its waters seemed to give the effect of a pleasant smile to features
already perfect.

We cruiSed about for some time, surveying the coast with its fertile
meadows, shady groves, gently swelling hills, and murmuring brooks, seeking
a convenient landing-place in the vicinity of the shallows where lay the
oyster-beds. -

This we found close to a sparkling streamlet; and, as the day was fast
declining, we made speedy arrangements for burning awatch--fire ; after which
we partook of a hasty supper, and leaving the dogs, with Coco, the jackal,260 7'I-IE SWISS [TAMI/[Y ROBIJVS'OJV.

to sleep on shore, we retumed on board the yacht for the night, anchoring
within gun-shot of the land.

The coast being quite strange to us, I knew not what wild beasts might
frequent it"; but, though I did not fear that any would approach us by
swimming, yet I was glad to have with us our lively little ape, Mercury
(the successor of our old favourite, Knips, long since gathered to his fathers),
for be occupied at night a cosy berth on deck, and was certain to give
vociferous notice should anything alarming occur. I

Fritz moored the cajack alongside, and came on board. The night
passed in peace, although for atime we were disturbed by the yelping of
jackals, with whom Coco persisted in keeping up a noisy conversation.

We awoke at daybreak, and alter breakfasting ("r [a [euro/mile, we repaired
in haste with nets, scrapers, and all other requisites to the oyster--beds,
where we worked with such diligence and success that in the course of two
days we had an immense pile of shells built up like a stack on the beach,
and left to decay.

I collected a quantity of sea-weed to spread over them, which was
afterwards burnt to make alkali, when we returned to secure our harvest of
pearls.

Every evening we went out shooting in the neighbourhood, and kept
ourselves supplied with game of one sort or another. The last day of our
fishery 'we started earlier, intending to make a longer excursion into the
woods.

Ernest set oil" first with 1" loss; Jack and Coco strolling after them. Fritz
and I were still employed in taking on board the last load of our tools,
when we suddenly heard a shot, a loud cry of pain or fear, and then
another shot.

At the fiTSt alarm, the other two dogs rushed away from us towards
the spot, and Fritz, who had just called Pounce from his perch to
accompany us in the ramble, let him fly, and seizing his rifle darted OH
in the same direction. >>

Before I could reach the scene "of action, more shots were heard,
and then a shout of victory; after which appeared through the stems of
the trees the disconsolate figure of Jack, hobbling along like a cripple,
supported on each side by his brothers.

When they came near me they stopped; and poor Jack, moaning
and groaning, began to feel himself all over, as if to search for broken
bones, crying out:

"I'm pounded like a half-crushed peppercornl"

On examination I found some severe bruises.

"Who or what has been pummelling the boy?" I exclaimed; "one
would think he had been beaten."

"It was a huge wild boar," said Ernest, " with fierce eyes, monstrous
tusks, and a snout as bread as my hand."

We took Jack down to the yacht, bathed his bruises, gave him a. cooling"61' "101' Illfl?!."('d am! {ram fad u an drma' 2111' r). 201'.

drink, and he soon fell fast asleep in his be1th, Where I left him and returned
to the slime.

"New, Eincst," said I, "enlighten me on the subject of this adventure!
What you and the boar did is quite a mystery to me."

" Floss and I were going quietly along," replied he, "when suddenly
there was a rustling and snorting close by, and a great boar broke through
the bushes, making for the outskirts of the wood. Floss gave chase directly,
and the boar turned to bay. Then up came Jack with Coco, and the gallant
little jackal attacked the monster in the rear. In another moment, however,
he was sent sprawling upon his back, and this so provoked his master that
he fired a hasty, ill-directed shot. The brutc's notice and fury at once turned
upon Jack, who prudently took to his heels, while I attempted to check
the career of the boat by a shot, which, however, only slightly wounded it.
Jack stumbled and fell over the root of a tree, just as the animal came up
with him. 'Helpl ninrder,' shouted he; and if the other dogs had not then
arrived, and all together tackled the boar, I fear it would have been a case
of murder indeed! As it was, the poor fellow got mauled and trampled upon
dreadfully.

"As I was waiting for an opportunity to fire without any risk of hitting
Jack, Pounce rushed through the air and darted upon the beast, and Fritz
came quickly up and shot it dead with a pistol.

"While we were helping Jack along, and passing a place where the boar
had been grubbiug, I noticed some such curious knotty roots or tubercles
that I brought away specimens. Are they worth anything, do you think?
'1' hey have a strong smell." '

"If I may trust my nose," said I, " you have brought something by no
means to be despised. Yes!" I continued, putting them to my lips, "these
are very fine trullles! Taste them, Fritz."

"Indeed they are excellent," said he; " very different from the tough,
leathery things I remember in Europe : these are tender and well-flavoured."

"Because they are fresh," said I. "You have before tasted those only
u h1ch have been brought from a distance. They are found in different parts
of Europe, buried ata depth of ten or twelve inches in the soil of oak or
beech woods. A small dog is employed to hunt for them, who perceives
their mushy odour in a singularly acute way, and at once scratches at the
spot where they lie."

" Have the truffles no leaves or stalks," enquired Fritz, "by which they
might be found without the help of the dog?"

"They have nothing ofthc sort," Ireplied; "they are discovered simply
by scent, and are considered to belong to the tribe of 1" ungi."

By this time it was late; we took supper, made 11p the watch-fire, and
withdrew to our yacht, where we slept peacefully. Early next morning we
proceeded to visit the field of battle. The wild boar, which I had not before
seen, proved to be much larger and more formidable in appearance than I
had imagined, and Jack's escape seemed to me perfectly marvellous.262 27/15 5 PVISS ['Z'.' ill/L Y R 081N301"

The boys took it as a matter of course that we were to cut out hams
and ditches ; and we therefore did so, though I warned them that they need
not expect much pleasure in eating bacon from a tough old African boar
like this. We conveyed the mighty hams to the beach, each on a sledge
of plaited boughs and twigs, and drawn by one of the dogs. The monstrous
head travelled in the same way, and we collected a large number of trullles
before quitting the forest.

As soon as the (logs were released, they rushed back to the scene of
operations in the wood, comprehending that they were now free to feast on
what remained there.

There was so much to be done in consequence of this affair that Fritz,
who had hoped to set out on his solitary expedition that day, deferred it
until the next; and was, therefore, fortunately with us when late in the
evening we desisted from our labours, and, having supped, were preparing
to retire to rest.

All at once a deep, fearful sound echoed through the neighbouring
woods. It made our blood curdle in our veins. We listened with
straining cars, hoping it would not be repeated. With a shudder we heard
the dread voice roar again, yet nearer to us, and an answer peal from
the distance.

"We must find out who are the performers in this concert !" exclaimed
Fritz, springing to his feet, and snatching up his rifle. " Make the fire blaze,
get on board the yacht, and have all the gums in readiness. I am off to
reconnoitre in the canoe."

We mechanically obeyed his rapid orders, while the bold youth dis-
appeared in the darkness; and. after heaping fuel on the fire, we went on
board and armed ourselves with cutlasses, besides loading all the guns,
waiting in readiness either to land again or to quit the coast.

We presently saw the whole pack of Our dogs, as well as Coco, the
jackal, and the little ape, Mercury (who had been tempted by the truilles to
stay with them in the woods), come galloping at full speed up to the fire.

Mercury was evidently excessively discomposed at finding us gone; he
gnashed his teeth, and chattered, as though in fear, looking hopelessly at
the water, through which he could not venture.

The dogs planted themselves by the fire, gazing fixedly landward, with
ears erect, and occasionally uttering a barking challenge or a suppressed howl.

Meantime, the horrid 'roarings sounded nearer, and Iconcluded that
a couple of leopards or panthers had been attracted by the scent of the
boar's carcase.

But not long after I had expressed this opinion we beheld a large
powerful animal spring from the nnderwood, and, with a bound and muttered
roar, approach the fire. In a moment I recognized the unmistakeable out-
lines of the form of a lion, though in size he far surpassed any I had ever
seen exhibited in Europe.

The dogs sluuk ,behind, the fire, and the lion seated himself almost like1743A" YEARS [A TIL]? 263

a cat on his hind legs, glaring alternately at them and at the great boar
hams which hung near, with doubtless a mixed feeling of irritation and appetite,
which was testified by the restless movement of his tail.

He then arose, and commenced walking up and down with slow and
measured paee, occasionally uttering short, angry roars, quite unlike the pro-
longed full tones we had heard at first.

At times he went to drink at the brook, always returning with such
haste that I fully expected to see him spring.

Gradually his manner became more and more threatening; he turned
towards us, crouched, and, with his body at full stretch, waved his tail and
glared so furiously that l was in doubt whether to fire or retreat, when
through the darkness rang the sharp crack 01" a rifle.

. "That is Fritz!" exclaimed ever)r one; while, with a fearful roar, the
lion sprang to his feet, stood stock still, tottcred, sank on his knees, rolled
over, and lay motionless on the sand.

"We are saved!" I cried; " that was a masterly shot. The lion is76.1 7' PS111" Sill/.315 ['24 311/. Y ROBIA'A'OA-T

struck to the heart: he "fill never stir again. Stay on board, boys. Imust
join my bravo Fritz."

In a few moments I landed: the dogs met me. with evident tokens of"
pleasure, but kept whining uneasin and looking towards the deep darkness
of the woods whence the lion had cmnc.

This behaviour made me cautious ; and, seeing nothing of Fritz, I lingered
._l)y the boat, when suddenly a lioness. bounded from the shadow of the trees
into the light diffused by the tire.

.-'\t s' in of the blazing llrggots she paused as though startled; passed
\1" uncertain step round 11160111 s of the illuminated t 'cle; and uttered
roarings which were evidently calls to her mate, whose dead body she
presently discovered.

Finding him motionless, her manner betoheued the greatest concern ; she
touched him with her tore-paws, smelt round him, and licked his bleeding
wounds. 'l'hen, raising her head, she gnaslied her teeth, out gave forth the
most. lamentable and dreadful sound I ever heard: u mingled roar and howl,
which vas like the expression of grief, rage, and a vow to be revenged all

Crack !".\.n1>ther shot: the creature's right fore-paw was lmned; and the
dogs, seeingume raise my gun, suddenly gathered courage, and ran forward
just. as I fired. My shot also wounded the lioness, but not mortally, and'
the 111051, Lerrific combat ensued.

it was impossible to lire again, for fear of wounding the dogs. The
scene was fearful beyond description. Black night surrounded 115; the fitf'il
blaze of the tire shed a strange, unnatural light on the prostrate body or"
the huge dead lion, and on the wounded lioness, who fought dcs pcratcly

ag'bzzinst the attack ol the tolll gallant dogs; while inc eilcs. roars, andgioans
111' anguish and oily uttered by all the animals "010 enough to t1y thc

Old Juno, staunch to the last, was foremost in the fray. After a time,
I saw her change her plan of attack, and spring at the throat of the lioness;
who, in an instant, raised hcrlci't paw, and at one blow the cruel Claws had
laid open the body of the dog and destroyed the life of the true and faithful
companion of so many years.

Just then Fritz appeared. The lioness was 111111511 weakened, and we
ventured to go near enough to lire with safety to ourselves; and iiually l.
despatehod her by plunging a hunting-kink deep in her breast.

body, wrapping it carefully in canvas, and carrying it with us on board the
yacht, that it might be buried at Roeltburg, whither, on the lollowin;r day.
it was our purpose to return.

\Veat'ied and sorrowful, but full of lhaukl'ulness for our personal safety,
we at length lay down to sleep, having brought all the dogs on board.

Next morning, before quitting Pearl Bay, we once more landed, that
we might possess ourselves of the magnificent skins of the lion and lioness,
whose visit, fatal to themselves, had caused such .1 commotion during the night.

In about a couple of hours We returned to the yacht, leaving the flayed
carcases to the. tender mercies of the birds of prey sure to be attracted
to them.

The boat was stored, and on a bright morning, with a favourable breeze,
we five, with the dogs, stepped aboard, and ran for Cape Minster.

Our beautiful little yacht bounded over the water gaily, and the bright
sunshine and delicious sea-breeze put us all in the highest spirits. The en-
trance of the archway was in sight, and thither I was directing the boat's
CUIH'SG. Suddenly, right ahead, I saw a dark and shadowy mass just below
the surface of the water. "A sunken rock!" I thought to myself, " and yet
it is strange thatl never before noticed it." l put down the helm in a
moment, but a catastrophe seemed inevitable.

\Ve surged ahead! A slight shock, and all was over! The danger was
passed ! .

I glanced astern, to look again at the dangerous spot; but the rock was
gone, and, where but a moment before I had distinctly seen its great green
shadow, I could now see nothing. Before we had recovered from our amaze-
ment. a shout from Jack surprised me.

"There is another," he exclaimed, "to starboard, father!"

Sure enough, there lay, apparentiy, another sunken rock.

"T he rock is moving l" shouted Franz; and a great black Body emerged
from the sea, while from the upper extremity rushed a column of water,
which, with a mighty noise, rose upwards, and then fell like rain all around.
The mystery was explained; for, as the great beast emerged yet farther
from the water, I recognized, from its enormous size and great length of
head, the cachalot whale.

The monster was apparently enraged at the way we had scratched his
back; for, retreating to a short distance, he evidently meditated a rush
upon us.

Fearful stories occurred to me of the savage temper of this whale: how
he has been known to destroy boat after boat, and even to sink great ships,
and with a feeling of desperation I sprang to one of the guns. Jack leaped
to the other, and almost simultaneously we fired. Both shots apparently took
effect; for the whale, after lashing the water violently for a few seconds,
plunged beneath its surface and disappeared. \V'e kept a sharp looleout for
him, for l was unwilling to lose "such a valuable prize, and, reloading, stood
towards the shore, in which direction he was apparently making. Presently
we again sighted him in shallow water, lashing fearfnlly with his tail, and
dyeing the wares around him with blood. Approaching the infuriate animal
as nearly as l dared, we again fired.

The struggles of the whale seemed for a few moments to become even
yet more frantic, and then, with a quiver from head to tail, he lay motion-
less--<<lead l

T he boys were about to raise a cry of victory, but checked the shout
upon their very lips; for darting behind a rock they cspicd a canoe paddled
by a tall and muscular savage, who now stood up in his skiff and appeared
to be examining us attentively. Seeing that we were standing towards him,
the swarthy native seized his paddle and again darted behind a rock. An:1 lid/'1? STRAAYG'ER. 269

awful thought now took possession of me. There must be a tribe of blacks
lurking on these shores, and Fritz must have fallen into their hands. We,
however, 1 determined, should not be easily taken ; and our guns were loaded
and run out.

Presently a dusky face appeared, peeping at us from a lofty rock: it
vanished, and we saw another peeping at us from lower down. Then again
the skiff put out as though to make a further reconnaissance. All, even Jack,
looked anxious, and glanced at me for orders.

"Moist :1 white flag," said I, "and hand me the speaking-trumpet."

1 seized the instrument and uttered such peaceable words in the Malay
language as I could recall: neither the flag nor my words seemed to pro-
duce any effect, and the savage was about to return to the shore.

Jack hereupon lost patience, and in his turn took up the trumpet.

"Come here, you black son of a gun," he exclaimed. "(Junie on board
and make friends, or we'll blow you and your-----"

"Stop! stop! you foolish boy!" l said; " you will but alarm the man
with your wild words and gestures."

"No! but see," he cried, "he is paddling towards us 1"

And sure enough the canoe was rapidly approaching.

Presently a cry from Franz alarmed me. "Look! look!" he shrieked;
"the villain is in Fritz's cajack. 1 can see the walrns's hem."

Ernest alone remained unmoved. He took the speaking--trumpet:

" Fritz, ahoy !" he shouted; "welcome, old fellow!"

The Words were scarcely out of his mouth when I, too, recognized the
well-known face beneath its dusky disguise.

In another minute the brave boy was on board, and in spite of his
blackened face was kissed and welcomed heartily. He was now assailed
with a storm of questions from all sides: "Where had he been; what had
kept him so long; and why had he turned blackamoor?"

"The last question," replied he, with a smile, "is the only one I will now
answer; the others shall be explained when I give a full account of my
adventures. Hearing guns tired, my mind was instantly filled with ideas of
Malay pirates, for 1 never dreamed that you could be here in the yacht,
so I disguised myself as you now see me, and mime forth to reconnoitre.
When you addressed me in Malay you only added to my terror, for it left
not a doubt in my mind that you were pirates."

Having in our turn described to him our adventure with the cachalot
whale, I asked him if he knew of a suitable spot for the anchorage of
the yacht. '

"Certainly," he replied, casting towards me a glance full of meaning;
"I can lead you to an island where there is splendid anchorage, and which
is itself well worth seeing, for it contains all sorts of strange things." And
after removing the stains from his skin, and turning himself once more into
a civilized being, he again sprang into his canoe and piloted us to a pic--
turesque little island in the bay.

Now that there could be no doubt as to the success of Fritz's expedi-
tion, I no longer hesitated to give to my wife an account of his project, and
to prepare her mind {or the surprise which awaited her. She was greatly
startled, as I expected, and seemed almost overcome with emotion at the
idea of seeing a human being, and that being one of her own sex.

"But why," she asked, "did you not tell me of this at first? Why
wait until the last moment with such joyful news?"

"I was unwilling," I replied, "to raise hopes which might never be
realized; but now, thank Heaven, he has succeeded, and there is no need
for concealment."

The boys could not at all understand the evident air of mystery and
suppressed excitement which neither their mother, Fritz, nor I could entirely
conceal. They cast glances of the greatest curiosity towards the island, and
as soon as the sails were l'urled and the anchor dropped they sprang eagerly
ashore. In a body we followed Fritz, maintaining perfect silence. Presently
we emerged from the thicket through which we were passing, and saw
list-ore us a hut of sheltering boughs,. at the entrance of which burned a
cheerful fire.

lnto this leafy hower lirilz dived, leaving his brothers without, mute
with astonishment. In another moment he emerged, leading by the hand
a slight, handsome youth, by his dross apparently a young English naval
ollicer. The pair advanced to meet us; and Fritz, with a countenance radiant
with joy, briefly introduced his companion as Edward Moutrosc.

"And," he continued, looking at his mother and me, "will you not
welcome him as a friend and a brother to our family circle 2""

"That will we, indeed!" I exclaimed, advancing and holding out my
hands to the fair young stranger. "Our wild life may have roughened our
looks and manners, but it has not hardened our hearts, l trust."

The mother, too, embraced the seeming youth most heartily. The lads,
and even the dogs, were not behind-hand in testifyingr their gratification at
the appearance of their new friend---thc former delighted at the idea of a
fresh companion, and the latter won by her sweet voice and appearance.

From the expressions made use of by Fritz l perceived that the gir
wished her sex to remain unrevealed to the rest of the party until the
mother could obtain for her a costume more suited to her real character.

The young men their run down to the yacht to bring up what was
necesary for supper, as well as to make preparations for a camp in which
we might spend the night. This done, the mother hastened to set before
us a substantial meal, while the boys, anxious to make their new acquainv
Lance feel at home amongst them, were doing their best to amuse her. She
herself, aitcr the first feeling of strangeness had worn oll', entered fully into
all their fin ; and by the time they sat down to supper was laughing and
chatting as gaiiy as any one of the rest. She admired the various dishes,
tasted our mead, and, without alluding once to her previous life, kept up a
lively conversation.:'l'if, balm/Mme 3'01sz (p. 2:0}

 

The mere fact. of meeting with any human lacing after so many years
of isolation was in itself" sullicient to raise the hoys to the greatest state 01'
excitement; but that this being: should he one so handsome, so gay, so
perfectly charming, seemed completely to have tumed their heads; and when
I gave the Sign fur the breaking up of the feast, and their new friend was
about to be kid to the night quarters which had been prepared for her on
board the yacht, the health of Edward Montrose was proposed, and drunk
in fragrant mend, amidst the Cheers and acclamations of all hands.

When she was gone, and silence had been restored, Jack exclaimed:

"New, than, Fritz, il' you please, just tell me where you came across
this jolly fellow. Did you take yuur mysterious Voyage in search of him,
or did run meet him by chance? Out with your adventures, while we sit
(:mnliu'talfly round the fire."

50 saving! Jack cast more wood upon the blazing pile, and, throwing
himself down in his usual careless fashion. prepared to listen attcntirely.

Fritz, after a few moments' hesitation, began:

"Perhaps you remember," said he, "how, whenl returned from mycx-2;- 2 71/]? .S'I'VfSe' [L4 Jl/ll. Y 1? 0131A; SON.

pedition in the eajack the other day, I struck down an albatross. None but
my father at the time know, however, what became of the wounded bird,
or men thought more about it. Yet it was that albatross who brought me
notice of tlie'shipwrcoked stranger; and he, too, 1 determined should carry
back a mewage to cheer and encourage the sender.

"I first, as you know, prepared my eajack to carry two persons; and
then, with a heart full of hope and trust, left you and the ,racht, and, with
l'ounce seated before me, made for the open sea. For several hoursl
paddled steadily on, till, the wind fi'eShening, I thought it advisable to keep
in nearer shore, that, should a regular storm arise, I might find some sheltered
hay in which to weather it.

"It was well I did so; for, scarcely had I reached a quiet cow. which
promised to afford me the protection I desired than the sea appeared one
mass of foam: great surging waves arose; and even in the comparative calm
01' the bay I felt that l was in some danger.

"I passed the night in my cajack; and next morning, alter a frugal
meal of pemmicau, and a draught of water from my llask, once more yen-
turcd forth. The. wind had subsided, the sea was tolerably smooth; and,
keeping my eyes busily employed in seeking in every direction to detect, it"
possible, the slightest trace of smoke or other sign of human life, I paddled
on till noon.

"'l'hc aspect of the coast now began to change: the shores were sandy,
while farther inland lay dense forests, from whose gloomy depths I could
ever and anon hear the fierce roar of beasts of prey, the yell of apes, the
fiendish laugh of the hyzena, or the despairing death cry of a hapless deer.
Seldom have I experienced a greater feeling of solitude than whilst listening
to these strange sounds, and knowing that l in this frail canoe was the only
human being near. Giving myself up to contemplation, l rested my paddle,
and allowed my cajack to drift slowly on.

"As I neared the shore, I noticed a large number of strange-looking birds,
who would sometimes liutter round me, and then dart back again to the
border of the forest, where they were leading on what appeared to be the
pepper plant; they seized the berries in their great ponderous beaks, threw
them up into the air, and then dexterouslv caught them in their fall. Their
beaks were really something extraordinan they looked as though they
must give their owners a perpetual headache, from their immense weighl.
The only thing that relieved the extreme ugliness of these great appendages
was their gorgeous colour, which was only rivalled by the gay line of the
plumage. I wish now that Iliad brought home a Specimen; but, at the
time, I was so much amused by watching .thc groteSque antics of the birds
that. I did not think of obtaining one. When I lell the spot, I settled in
my own mind that they were toucans: was I right, 'lirnest ?"

The Professor, unwilling to interrupt the narrative, merely gave an ora-
cnlar nod, and Fritz continued:

" For some hours after this I paddled quickly on, sometimes passing(l 1'?! If? .S'YYPA:\I'(,F/'.'/\". 2.75

sometimes that of u

merely on an exploring
expedition, I should
have been tempted,
doubtless, to cruise a
little way up one of
these pathways into
the forest; but now
such an idea did not
enter my head. ()n,
on, on, I felt I must
go, until I should
reach the goal of my
voyage.

"The shades of
night at length drew
on, and, finding a shel-
tered cove, I moored
my cajack, and stepped
on shore. You may

it was to stretch my

to sleep on shore; so
after preparing and enjoying my supper, I returned on board, and there
spent the night.

"Next morning Pounce and I. again lauded for breakfast. I lit my fire,
and hung before it a plump young parrot to roast. As I was so doing, I
heard a slight rustle amongst the long grass behind me. I glanced round,
and there, with glaring eyes, and his great tail swaying to and fro, 1 saw an
immense tiger.

"In another moment his Spring w0uld have been made. Ishmrld have
been no more, and our young guest would have been doomed to God only
knows how many more years of frightful solitude!

"My gun was lying by my side. Before I could have stooped to pick
it up, the monster would have seized inc.

" Pounce saw and con'iprehendod my danger: the heroic bird darted upon
my enemy, and so blinded him with his flapping wings and the fierce blows
of his beak that his spring was checked, and I had time to recover my1:14 771/? SH 7518' 17.411171 1' R()/$'].-\'.\'().-\'.

brunt, gave one spring, and then rolied 011.. at my feet.

"My enemy was dead ; but beside him, alas! lay poor Pounce, crushed
and lifeless. One. blow of the great boast's paw had struck him down,neve1'
to rise again 1"

Fritz's voice shook as he came to this point ; and, after remaining silent
for a 1110111cnt or two, he continued, hurriedly:

" With a sad and desolate feeling a: my heart, 1 buried the faithful bird
where he had met his death; and then, 1111111111: longer to continue near the
spot, I returned to my (:ajack, and. leaving the great tiger lying where he
fell, paddled hastily away.

"My thoughts were gloomy. I felt :15 though, now that my cmnpanion

"' This feeling 01' discouragement was not, however, to be of long duration;
for in a moment more a sight presented itself which banished all my doubts
and fears and raised me to the highest pitch of excitement.

"A high point 01' land lay before me. .1 rounded it. and beyond found
a calm and nleasalit bav, 1'1011'1 whose curved and thickly 11 our L(l shores 11111

securing my canoe, I leaped upon the rock on which the beacon was blazing,
and saw a slight figure dressed in sailor costume seated by the fire. You
may all imagine my sensations.

"Miss Montrose grasped my hands wannly, and guessing from my
pronunciation, I am afraid, that I was not in the habit. of speaking English
every day of my life, said in French:

"Long, long have I waited since the bird returned with your message".
't'hank God, you have come at last!'

"Then, with tears of jOy and gratitude, she led me to the shore, where
she had built a hut and a safe sleepi g-place, like Falconhurst on a small
scale, among the branches of a tree. I was delighted with all she showed
me, for indeed her hut and its fittings evinced no ordinary skill and in.
nuity. Round the walls hung bows. arrows, latices, and bird-snares; while
on her work-table, in boxes and cases, carved skilfully with a knife, were
fish-hooks ot'mother-ollpearl, needles made from fishboncs, and bodkins from
the beaks of birds, fishing--lines of all sorts, and knives and other tools.
These latter she told me were, with a chest of wearing apparel, almost the
only things washed ashore after the wreck, when three years ago she was
cast alone upon this desolate coast. l mar-veiled more and more at the
wonderful way in which this girl had surmounted obstacles, the quarter of
which would completely have appalled the generality of her sex. The hut
itself was a marvel of skill; Stout posts had been driven into the. ground
with cross pieces of bamboo to form a framework; the walls had been
woven with reads, the roof thatched with palm-leaves, and the whole
plastered smoothly with clav, an open space being left in the centru ol' the
roof {or a chimney to ca 'y' of the smoke of the. fire.

"As we entered, a cormorant, with a cry of anger, flew from under the
table towards me, and was about to attack me fiercely. Miss Montrose Called
it off, and she then told me she had captured and tamed the bird soon
after first landing, and since that time had contrived to train it to assist her
in every conceivable way: it now not only was a pleasant companion, hut
brought her food 01' every description, lish, flesh, and fowl, for whether it
dived into the waters, according to its natural habit, struck down birds upon
the wing, or seized rabbits and other small animals upon the land, it laid
all its booty at her feet.

"Miss Montrose asked for permission to go out in my arms to catch
some fish for slipper, which l at once granted. She was accompanied by
her tame Cormorant, and with its assistance soon had an ample supply oi
various kinds of fish. I was astonished at her dexterity in the management
of the canoe, and when she returned I congratulated her on her success.

"Before darkness closed in, all the curio..ties and ingenious contrivanccs
of the place had been displayed--the kitchen-stove, cooking- utensils. skin
bottles, shell plates and spoons, the fishing rail, and numhcrless other things

and then, sitting down with my [air has ..s to :1 most appetizing meal,
she gave me a short: account of her life.

"Jenny Montrosc was the daughter of a British officer who had served
for many years in India, where she herself was born. At the early age of
three years she lost. her mother.276 771E 5 H7155 FAfiIILY A'OIJ'IA'SOAK

"After the death of his wife, ail the Colonel's love and care were centred
upon his only child; under his eye she was instructed in all the accomplish-
ments suited to her sex ; and from him she imbibed an ardent: love of field
sports. By the time she was seventeen she was as much at home upon her
horse in the field as in her father's drawing-room. Colonel Montrose now
received orders to return home with his regiment, and, as for certain reasons
he did not wish her to accompany him in the ship with the troops, he
obtained a passage for her on hoard a vessel which was about to sail at the
same time.

" The separation was extremely painful to both the old soldier and his
daughter, but there was no alternative. They parted, and Miss Montrose
sailed in the 'Doreas' for England. A week after she had left Calcutta, a
storm arose and drove the vessel far out of her course; more bad weather
ensued; and at length, leaks having been sprung in all directions, the crew
were obliged to take to the boats. Jenny obtained a place in one of the
largest of these. Alter enduring the perils of the sea for many days, land
was sighted; and the other boats having disappeared, an attempt was made
to land. The boat was capsized, and Miss Montrose. alone reached the shore.
lior a long time she lay upon the sand almost inanimate; but, reviving
snfiicicntly to move, she at length obtained some shell-fish, and by degrees
recovered her strength. From that time forth until I appeared she never set
eyes upon a human being. 'l'o attract any passing vessel, and obtain
assistance, however, she kept a beacon continually blazina at the end of the
reef; and, with the same purpose in view, attached missives to the feet of
any birds she could take alive in her snares. The albatross, she told me,
she had kept for some time, and partially tamed; but, as it was in the habit
of limiting long excursions on its own account, she conceived the idea of
sending it also with a message, that, shouid it by chance be seen and
taken alive, it might return with an answer.

"Our supper was over; and, at length, both wearied out with the an-
xieties and excitement of the day, we retired to rest, she to her leafy bowcr
and I to sleep in the hut below.

"Next morning, having packed her belongings in the cajack, we both
went on board; and bidding adieu to her well-known bay she took her seat
before me, and I made for home.

"We should have reached Rockburg this evening had not an accident
occurred to our skiff and compelled us to put in at this island. The boat
was scarcely repaired when I heard your first shots. I instantly disguised
myself; and never doubting that Malay pirates were near, came forth to
reeonnoitre. Glad, indeed, I was to find my fears ungroundcd."

All had listened attentively to Fritz's story, but now a dreadful yawn
from Franz, followed by others from Jack, Ernest, and Fritz, and a great
desire on my own part to follow their example, warned me that it was time
to dismiss the party for the night. Fritz retired to his eajaek, the boys and
I to the deck of the yacht, and the remainder of the night passed quietly away.. I fix! l/i' SI'Rl-l ;\'(r'/:'/\'.

Next morning,r as we assembled for breakfast i took the opportunity of
begging Miss Moutrose no longer to attempt to continue her disguise, but to
allow us to address her in her real character.

Jenny smiled; (or she had noticed, as the young men met her when she
came from the cabin, a great alteration in their manner, and had at once
seen that her secret was guessed.

"After all," she said, "I need not be ashamed of this attire; it has been
my only costume for the last three years, and in any other I should have
been unable to manage all the work which during that time has been newssary."

Our pleasant meal over, I prepared to start for home, but Fritz reminded
me of the cachalot, and, although he confessed he should not care to repeat
the operation of cutting up a whale, he thought it would be a pity to lose
such a chance of obtaining a supply of spermzuteti.

I fully agreed with him; and, embarking, we quickly reached the sand--
bank on which the monster lay. No sooner did we come near than the
dogs leaped ashore, and before we could follow, rushed round to the other
side of the great beast ; snarling, growling, and howling ensued, and when
we reached the Spot we found a terrific combat going on. A troop ol'wolves
were disputing fiercely with the dogs their right to the prey. Our appear-
ance, however, quickly settled the matter; two of the brutes already lay

lions, than, suddenly attracted by his instinct, he left his master's side, and, in
spite of our shouts and cries, joined them, and disappeared into the forest.

As it would have been useless and dangerous to attempt to follow the
dcscrtcr into the woods, we left him alone, trusting that he would return
before we again embarked. Fritz then climbed up the mountain of flesh, and
with his hatchet quickly laid open the huge skull; Jack and Franz joined
him--Ernest having remained on the island, where we had left the mother
and Jenny and with buckets assisted him to halt: out the spermaceti. T he
lcw vessels we possessed \\"rc soon full, and having: stored the yacht, we
once more embarked and arrived at the little island shortly before the dinner
hour. .

A capital meal had been prepared for us, and, when we had made our>>
scivcs presentable, we sat down to it, and related our adventures. The
account of Coco's desertion was received with exclamations ol' surprise and
sorrow. "Yet," Said Jenny, alter a time, "I do not think you should despair
of his recovery, for animals in their native state seldom care to allow those
that have been onCe domesticated to consort with them. My poor albatross
even, though hr: was ncvcr thoroughly tamed, and certainly did finally desert
me, yet used to return at inter ads; and I am pretty sure that were you,
Jack, to search thr: wood early to--morrow morning, you would lind your pct
only too willing to come back to civilized lite; or. it you like, I will go
myself and lind him, for I should immensely like to have a paddle in the
cajack all by myself."

Jack was delighted at the former stirrgestion, and though he would not
listen for a moment to Jenn request to be allowed to go alone, he agrccd,
it she cared for the fun or" an early cruise, to accompany her in the Canoe
next morning, and to return to the yacht in time to start for liockbnrg.

At sunrise they were off, armed with "bait" in the shape oi'mcat and
biscuit, and a muzzle and chain which Jack had manufactured in the evening
to punish the rum grate for his offences, should they catch him. Arrived at
the sandhank, they landed; and, after entering the forest and shouting,r
' loco, Coco!" Lill the woods rang again, they presently espied Llic truant,
slouching disconsolatcly towards them, looking very miserable and heartily
ashamed ol" himself. ,

With torn cars, and coat ruli'led and dirty, he sneaked up. There was

unhappy and begging fingix'cness, Jack had not the heart to degrade him
further with the muzzle and chain. He had evidently attempted to join his
wild brethren, and by them had been scouted, \roziicd, and hustled, as no
true jackal ; and, as Jenny had foretold, was now only too glad to return
to bondage and to comfort.

l'oor Coco had recovered his spirits slightly by the time the yacht
was reached; and, after a hearty meal, again took his place amongst the
dogs, whom I had little doubt he would never again desert.

All was now bustle and activity; and, breakfast over, we went aboard:1 1";1' 111' 15771711 A'G'EIC. *1 '9

pleased with the even number, however, Ernest insisted upon replying
with thirteen guns, an odd number being, he declared, absoluteiy necessary

As we neared the quay, Fritz and Jack stood ready to receive us,
and uith trite politeness handed their mother and lenny ashore. They
turned and led the "av to the house through the cantons, ortha' 'ds, and
shrubberies "hich lav on the rising 5510111111 that sloped Uentlv upwards

Jenny's surprise was changed to wonder as she neared the villa

round the columns delighted her. She could scarcely believe that she

beneath the shade of the verandah I saw a table laid out \\ith a delicious
luncheon. All our china, silver, and glass had been called into requisition,
and was arranged upon the spotless damask cloth.

Wine sparkled in the decanters; splendid pine-apples, oranges, guru-as,
apples, and pears, resting 0:1 cool green leaves, lay heaped in pyramids upon
the porcelain dishes. A haunch of venison, cold fowl, ham, and tongues
occupied the ends and sides of the table, while in the centre rose a vase of
gay flowers, surrounded by bowls of milk and great jugs of mead. It was,
indeed, a perfect feast, and the heartiness of the welcome brought tears of
joy into the lovely eyes of the fair g' tin whose honour it had been devised.

All were soon ready to sit down; and Jenny, looking prettier than ever

of honour between the mother and me. Ernest and Franz also seated
themselves ; but nothing would induce Fritz and Jack to follow their example.
They considered themselves our entertainers, and waited upon us most atten-
tively, carving the joints, filling our glasses, and changing the plates: for, as
Jack declared to Miss Montrose, the servants had all run away in our ab-
sence, and for the next day or two, perhaps, we should be obliged to wait
upon ourselves. '

, When the banquet was over, and the waiters had satisfied their appe-
tites, they joined their brothers, and with them displayed all the wonders
ol' Rookburg to their new sister. To the house, cave, Stables, gardens, fields,
and boat-honses----to one after the other did they lead her.

Not a corner would they have left unnoticed, had not the mother,
fearing they would tire the poor girl out, come to the rescue, and led her
back to the house.

On the following day, after an early breakfast, we started, while it was
yet cool, for Falconhurst ; and, as I knew that repairs and arrangements for
the coming winter would be necessary, and would detain us for several days,
we took with us a supply of tools, as well as baskets of provisions and
other things essential to our comfort.

The whole of our stud, excepting the ostrich, were in their paddocks,
near the tree; but Jack, saying that his mother and Jenny really must not
walk the whole way, to the great amusement of the latter, leaped on Harry,
and lled away in front of us. Before we had accomplished one quarter of
the distance, we heard the thundering tread of many feet galloping down
the avenue, and presently cspied our motley troop of steeds being driven
furiously towards as Storm, Lightfoot, Switt, Grurnblc, Stcntor, Arrow, and
Dart were there, with Jack, on his fleet two-legged conrscr, at their heels.
At his saddle-bow hung a cluster of saddles and bridles, the bits all jangling
and clanking, adding to the din and confusion, and urging on the excited
animals, who thoroughly entered into the fun, and with tails in the air, ears
back, and heels ever and anon thrown playfully out, seemed about to over-
whelm us.

We stepped aside to shelter ourselves behind the trees from the furious
onset; but a about from Fritz brought the whole herd to a sudden halt and
Jack spurted towards us.

"Which of the cattle shall we saddle for you, jenny?" he shouted;
"they're all as gentle as lambs, and as active as cats. Every one has been
ridden by mother, and knows what a side--saddle means, so you can't go
wrong.

To his great delight, Jenny quickly showed her appreciation of the
merits of the steeds by picking out Dart, the fleetest and most spirited in
the whole stud. 'l' he ostrich was then relieved of his unusual burden, the
animals were speedily equipped, and Lightfoot bearing the baskets and
hampers, the whole party mounted and trotted forwards. Jenny was delighted
with her palfrey, and henceforward he was reserved for her Special use.A 1'14 1/6 S'I'RAA'GEA'. 281

The work at Falconhurst, as I had expected, occupied us for some time,
and it was a week before we could again return to Rockburg. Yet the time
passed pleasantly; for though the youngr men were busy from morning to
night, the presence of their new companion, hcr lively spirits and gay con-
versation, kept them in constant good humour.

When the repairs were all finished we remained yet a day or two
longer, that we might make excursions in various directions to bring in
poultry from Woodlands, stores of acorns for the pigs, and grass, willows,
and canes, to be manufactured during the winter into mats, baskets, hurdles,
and hcncoops.

Many a shower wetted us through during these days, and we had scarcely
time to hurry back to Rockburg and house our cattle and possessions before
the annual deluge began.

Never before had this dreary season seemed so short and pleasant;
with Jenny amongst us the usual feeling of wearincss and discontent never
appeared; the English language was quickly acquired by all hands, Fritz,
in particular, speaking it so well that Jenny declared she could scarcely
believe he was not an Englishman. She herself already spoke French, and
therefore learned our native language and spoke it fluently before we were
released from our captivity.

\IANY wondrous tales wort: told or read in turn by the boys and Jennr
ll during the longr evenings as we sat drawing, weaving, and planting
in our easy study. In fact this winter was a truly happy lime, and when

within our rocky walls.

All was once more activity and lite; the duties in field, garden, and
orchard (hailed forth the energy of the lads, whilst their mother and sister
found abundant occupation in the poultr\_ 'll'd and house.

Our various settlements and stations required attention. Falconiiursi,
\-\-'oodlan(ls, Prospect Hill, Shark and Whale Islands were in turn visited
and set in order. The duty of attending to the island battery fell to Jack
and Franz. '

They had been busy all day repairing the ilagstall', rehoisting' the flag,
and cleaning and putting into working order the two guns.

Evening was drawing on and our day's work over; the rest of us were
strolling up and down upon the beach enjoying the cool sea ln'ouZu. We
watched the lads as they completed their work. They loaded and ran out their
guns, and, paddling off with an empty tub in the cajack, placed it out to sea
as a mark for practice. 'l'hey returned and fired, and the barrel flew in pieces,
and then, with a shout. of triumph, they cleaned the guns and ran thorn in.

Scarcely had they done so when, as though in answer to their shots,
came the sound of three guns booming across the water from the westward.

We stopped, speechless. Was it fancy? Had we really heard guns from
a strange ship? 0r had the boys again fired? No! there were the lads
leaping into their canoe and paddling in hot haste towards us. They, too, had
heard the sound.

A tumult of feelings rushed over its--anxiety, joy, hope, doubt, each in
turn took possession of our minds. Was it a European vessel close upon
our shores, and were we about to he linked once more to civilized life? Or

an hour we advanced in the direction from which the reports of the guns
seemed to proceed. Nothing could we see, however, but the frowning rocks
and cliffs, and the waves heating restlexly at their base. Cape Pug-Nose
was reached, and we began to round the hlutl' old point. In a moment all
our doubts were dispelled, and gratitude to the Great Giver 01' all good filled
our hearts. There, in the little sheltered cove beyond the cape, her saiis
furled and anchor dropped, lay a brig of war with the English colours at
her inaSt-heud.

\'\"itlt the glass l could discern figures upon the deck, and upon the.
shore beyond several tents pitched under the shelter of the. trees, and the
smoke of tires rising mnongst them. As I handed the glass to Fritz, I felt
2t sudden misgiving. "What," said I to myself, "can this English vessel be
doing thus far from the usual track of ship. ' And I called to mind tales
of mutinous crews who have risen against their officers; have chosen some
such sheltered retreat as this; have disguised the Vessel; and their sailed
forth to rob and plunder upon the high seas.

Fritz then exclaimed: "I can see the captain. father, he is speaking to
one of the olliecrs, and 1 can see his face quite well ; he is English, laince ain
he is English, and the ting speaks the truth!" And he put the glass again
in my hand that I might see for myself.

Still keeping under the shelter of" the cliff, I carefully surveyed the
vessel. There was no doubt that Fritz was right, and my tears were once
more dispelled; all was neatness and regularity on hoard; the spotless decks,
the burnished steel and brass, and the air of perfect order which pervaded
both ship and camp betokened that authority and discipline there reigned.
For Some minutes longer we continued our examination of the scene and
than, satisfied by the appearance 01' the camp on shore that there was no
chance of tho brig quitting the coast for several days, we resolved to return
without betraying" our presence, for I was unwilling to appear before these
strangers untzl we could do so in better form, and in a manner: more in ace-or-
dam:e with our actual resources.

We again landed at Rockburg, where our family awaited our arrival in
eager expectation, and as fully as possible we told them of all we had seen.
They thoroughly approved of our caution, and even Jenny, whose liopes
had been excited to the highest pitch by our description of the English vessel.
and who longed to meet her countrymen once more, agreed to postpone the
visit until the followi g day, when, having put our yacht into good order,
we might pay our respects to the captain, not as poor shipwrecked creatures
begging assistance, but as lords and masters ol' the land, seeking to know for
what purpose strangers were visiting the coast.

The rest of the day was occupied in making our preparations. Our
dainty little craft was made to look her very best; her docks were scrubbed,
her brass guns burnished, all lumber removed and put ashore, and the {lag
of England hoisted to her peak. The mother overhauled our wardrobes, and
the neatest uniforms were put ready for the boys and me, for though neitherI'le/t'FV/c'lJu 285

yet we, accustomed daily to rough and often even dirty \vork, had adepted
just that costume which best suited our comfort and inclination. We should
indeed have surprised the smart man-(farm's men had we appeared in
our great shapeless wide-brimmed hats, our linen coats and trousers, our
broad leathcrn belts and hairy busliins; so we next day readily donned the
more becoming costumes.

At the break of that eventful morn, when we were destined once more

to set our eves upon our fellow men, and to hear news of the outer world
from which for so many years we had been exiled, we assembled in our
little breakfast--room. The meal was. eaten hurriedly and almost in silence,
for our hearts were too full, and our minds too busily occupied, to allow
of any outward display of excitement. Fritz and Jack then slipped quietly
out, and presently returned from the garden with baskets of the choicest
fi'nits in fresh and fragrant profusion, and with these, :15 presents for the
strangers, We went on board our yacht.

little vessel. as though partaking of our hopes and joyous expectation,
bounded merrily over the waters of Safety Bay, gave a wide berth to the-
reef, against whose frowning rocks the sea still lashed itself to team, and
kept away for the cove where the English ship unconsciously awaited us.

The Pugnosod Cape was reached, and to the surprise and utter amaze--
ment of the strangers, we rounded the point, and brought up within hail.
livery eye on board and on shore was turned towards us, every glam was
produced and fixed upon our motions; for of all the strange sights which
the gallant crew may have looked for, such an anomaly as a pleasure yacht,
manned by such a part; as ours, and cruising upon this strange and inhospit-
able shore, was the farthest from their thoughts.

1' zand I stepped into our boat, and pulled for the brig. In another
minute we were upon her deck. The captain, with the simple frankness
of a B sh seaman, welcomed us cordially, and having led us into his cabin,
begged us to explain to what good fortune he owed a visit from residents
upon a coast genemlly deemed uninhabited or the abode of the lierecst
savages.

I gave him an outline of the history of the wreck, and oi" our sojourn
upon these shores, and spoke to him, too, of Miss Montrose, and of the
providential way in which we had been the means of rescuing her from
her lonely position.

"'l'hen," said the gallant officer, rising and grasping Fritz by the hand,
"let me heartily thank you in my own name, and in that of Colonel
Montrose; for it was the hope of finding some trace of that brave girl that
led me to these shores. The disappearance of the 'Dorcas' has been a
terrible blow to the Colonel, and yet, though for three years no word of
her or of any of those who sailed in her has reached England, he has never
entirely abandoned all hope of again hearing of his daughter. I knew this,
and a few weeks ago, when I was about to leave Sydney for the Cape,
I found three men who declared themselves survivors of the 'l)oreas' and
said that their boat, of tour which left the wreck, was the only one which,
to their knowledge, reached land in safety. From them l learned all
particulars, and, applying for permission to cruise in these latitudes, l sailed
in the hope of finding further traces of the unfortunate crew. My efforts
have been awarded by unloolted-t'or success." 1

Fritz replied most modestly to the praises which he received, and their
the captain begged to be introduced to my wife and Miss MontrOse.

"And," he continued, "if it be not contrary to your rules of discipline
for the whole ship's company to be absent at once, I will now send a boat
for the remainder of your parts-x"

One of the ollieers was accordingly despatched to the yacht with a
polite mes-rage, and the mother, Jenny, and the three boys were presently
on board.

Our kind host greeted them most warmly, and he and his officers
vied with one another in doing us honour. They proved, indeed, most[A RE "7.5L L. 2s;

pleasant entertainers, and the time passed rapidly away. At luncheon the
captain told us that there had sailed with him from Sydney an invalid
gentleman, Mr. Wolston, his wife, and two daughters; but that, though the
son voyage had been recommended on account of his health, yet it had not
done Mr. Wolston so much good as had been anticipated, and he had suffered
so greatly from the effects of the storm which had driven the "Ljuicorn"
into the bay for repairs that he had been eager to rest for a short time
on land.

we were anxious to meet the family, and in the afternoon it was decided
that we should pay them a visit. Te'lls had been pitched for their ac-
commodation under the shady trees, and when we landed we found Mr.
\Volston seated by one of them, enjoying the cool sea breeze. He and his
family were delighted to see us, and so much did we enjoy their society
that evening found us still upon the shore. It was too late then to return
to Rockburg, and the captain kindly offered tents for the accommodation
of those who could not find room in the yacht. The boys spent the night
on land.

That night I had a long and serious consultation with my wife as to
whether or not we really had any well-grounded reason for wishing to
return to Europe. It would be childish to undertake a voyage thither simply
because an opportunity onercd for doing so.

Neither knew to what decision the feelings of the other inclined;
each was afraid of expressing what might run counter to thOSe feelings;
but gradually it began to appear that neither entertained any strong wish to
leave the peaceful island; and finally we discovered that the real wish
which lay at the bottom of both our hearts was to adopt New Switzerland
as thenceforward our borne.

What can be more delightful than to find harmony of opinion in Lhosu
we love when a grcar. and momentous decision has to be taken?

My dear wife assured me that she desired nothing more earnestly
than to spend the rest of her days in a place to which she had become
so much attached, provided I, and at least two of her sons, also wished
to remain.

From the other two she would willingly part, if'thc)' chose to return
to Europe, with the understanding that they must endeavour to send
out emigrants of a good class to join us. and form a prosperous colony,
adding that she thought the island ought to continue to bear the name
of our native country, even if inhabited in future time by colonists from
England as well as from Switzerlaml.

l heartily approved of this excellent idea, and we agreed to mention
it while consulting with Captain Littlestonc on the subject of placing the
island under the protection of Great Britain.

Then came the question as to which oi~ our sons were best suited
to remain with us, and which to go away.

This point we left undecided, thinking that in the course or a l'cw288 1711.": Sill/155 innit/LY ROBJAVSON.
days they would probably make a choice of
they did, even sooner than we anticipated.

After breakfast, it was proposed that Captain Littlestone should bring
his ship round to Safety Bay, that we might receive a visit= from him and
his party at Rockburg--where we invited the invalid, Mr. Wolston, and
his family, in hopes that his health might benefit by a connortablc residence
on shore.

No sooner was this plan adopted than Fritz and Jack hurried off in
the canoe to prepare for their reception, being followed in more leisurely
style by the brig and our yacht.

But what words can express the amazement of our guests when,
rounding the rocky cape at the entrance, Safety Bay and the beautiful
domain of Rockburg lay before them.

Still greater was their astonishment, as a salute of eleven guns boomed
from the battery on Shark Island, where the royal standard of England
was displayed and floated majestically on the morning breeze.

A glow of surprise and pleasure beamed on every countenance, and
poor Wolston's spirits appeared to revive with the very idea of the peace
and happiness to be enjoyed in such a home.

lie was carried on shore with the utmost care and tenderness, and
comfortably established in my room, a camp-bed for Mrs. Wolston being
added to the furniture there, that she might be able conveniently to attend
on her husband.

Meantime the scene at the harbour and all round Rockburg was of
the liveliest description ; merrirnent and excitement prevailed in all directions
as the beauties and wonders of our residence were explored, so that a
summons to dinner scarcely attracted notice.

l-lowever, as a visit to Falconhurst was projected, the company was
at length induced to be seated, and to partake of our good cheer, but the
spirit of restlessness soon returned, and the young people kept roaming about
through our hitherto quiet lawns, avenues, and shrubberies, until I was
ready to believe their number three times what it actually was.

Towards evening the excitement began to abate, and the party assembled
for supper with tolerable composure.

Mr. Wolston was able to join us, as the rest he had enjoyed, and the
pleasure inspired by the .hope of a residence among us, seemed to have
given him new life. This wish he now distinctly expressed in his own
name and in that of his wife; inquiring what our intentions were, and
proposing, if agreeable to us, that they, with their eldest daughter, whose
health, like his own, was delicate, should make a long stay on the island,
while the younger (laughter went for the present to her brother at the
Cape of Good Hope.

In the event of his ultimately deciding to settle altogether among us,
Mr. Wolston would propose that his son should leave the Cape and join

With sincere satisfaction I welcomed this proposal, saying that it was
my wish and that of my wife to remain for the rest of our days in New
Switzerland.

" Hurrah for New Switzerland 5"

"New Switzerland for ever!" shouted the whole company enthusiasti-
cally as they raised their glasses, and made them touch with a musical ring,
which so expressively denotes a joyful unanimity of sentiment.

" Prosperity to New Switzerland: long may she flourish !" echoed on
all sides.

"Long life and happiness to those who make New Switzerland their
home!" added Ernest, to my great surprise, leaning forward as he spoke,
to ring his glass with mine, his mother's, and Mr. Wolston's.

" Won't somebody wish long life and prosperity to those who go away ? "
inquired Jenny with a pretty arch look. "Much as I long to return to
England and my father, my inclination will waver if all the cheers are for
New Switzerland !"

" Three cheers for England and Colonel Montrose," cried Fritz; " success
and happiness to us who return to Europe!" And while the vaulted roofs
rang with the meeting elicited by this toast, a glance from Jenny showed
hm how much she thanked him for appreciating hei wish to return to
1121 fathei, notwuhstauding her attachment to our family.

"Well," said I, when silence was restored. "since l11tz resolves to go
to England, he must undertake for me the duty of bringingy happiness to a
mourning father by restoring"' to him his dear daughter, whom l have been
ready to regard as my own, by right of finding her cast on the shores of
my island.

"Ernest chooses to remain with me. His mother and I rejoice heartily
in this decision, and promise him all the highest scientific appointments in
our power to bestow.

"And now what is Jack's choice? The only talent I can say he
possesses is that of comic actor, and to shine 011 the stage he must needs go
to Europe."

"Jack is not going to Europe, however," was his reply. " I-le means
to stay here, and when Fritz is gone he will be the best rider and the
best shot in New Switzerland, which is the summit of his ambition.

"The fact is," he continued, laughing, "I rather stand in awe of their
European schools, and should expect to find myself caught and clapped
into one if I ventured too near them."

"A good school is-exactly what I want," said Franz. " Among a number
of students there is some emulation and enthusiasm, and I shall have a
chance of rising in the world.

"Fritz will probably return here some day; but it might be well for
one membei of the family to go home with the intention of remaining

. "You may go, my dear son," I. replied; " and God bless all our plans
and resolutions. The whole earth is the Lord's, and where, as in His sight;
you lead good and useful lives, there is your home.

"And now that] know your wishes, the only question is whether
Captain Littlestone will kindly enable you to carry them out."

All eyes were fixed eagerly upon him, and after a moment's pause
the gallant officer spoke as. follows: '

"I think my way in this matter is perfectly clear, and I consider that
I have been providentially guided to he the means of once more placing
this family in communication with their friends, and with the civilized

" Survivors from two wrecks have been discovered.

"Three passengers express a wish to leave my ship here, instead of
at the Cape, while, at the same time, I am requested to give to three
persons a passage to England.

"Could anything suit better? I am most willing to undertake the
charge of those who may he committed to my care.

"Every circumstance has been wonderfully ordered and linked together
by Divine Proddence, and if England gains a prosperous and happy colony,
it will prove a fitting clasp to this fortunate chain 01' events. Three cheers
for New Switzerland."

Dccp emotion stirred every heart as the party separated for the night.
Many felt that they were suddenly standing on the threshold of a new
life, while for myself a weight was rolled from my heart, and I thanked
God that a difficulty was solved which, for years, had oppressed me with
anxiety. _

After this nothing was thought of but making preparations for the
departure or" the dear ones bound for England. Captain Littlestone allowed
as much time as he could spare ; but it was necessarily short, so that in-
cessant movement and industry pervaded the settlement for several days.

Everything was provided and packed up that could in any way add to
our children's Comfort" on the voyage, or benefit them after their arrival in
England, and a large share of my possessions in pearls, corals, furs, spices,
and other valuables would enable them to take agood position in the world
of commerce.

I committed to their'care private papers, money, and jewels which i
knew to have been the personal property of the captain of our ill-fated
ship, desiring them to hand them over, if possible, to his heirs. A short ao-
eount of the wreck, with the names of the crew, a list of which I had found,
was given to Captain Littlestmre. His ship, the "Unicorn," was amply
stored by us with fresh provisions, fish, vegetables, and fruit, for in our
gratitude to him for his kindness and sympathy we felt ready to offer
every possible assistance.

in a long conversation with my sonsl solemnly charged them withFA REE/ELL. 291

the future responsibitities of' their life, in all its varied aspects, of duty
towards (Sod, their fellow men, and themselves, pointing out the tempta--
tions to which their different characters were likely to expose them, and
exhorting them afiectiouately to hold fast to the faith in which they had
been brought up.

Fritz, having previously made known Lo me, what indeed was very
evident, the attachment between himself and Jenny, I advised him to
mention it to Colonel Montrose as soon as possible alter being introduced
to him, and ask for his sanction to their engagmnent, l, on my part, gladly
bestowing mine, as did his mother, who loved the sweet girl dearly, and
heartily grieved to part with her.

On the evening before our separation, i gave to Fritz the journal in
which, ever since the shipwreck, I had chronicled the events of our life,
desiring that the story might be printed and published.

"It was written, as you well know," said I, "for the instruction and
amusement ol' my children, but it is very possible that it may be useful to
other young people, more especially to boys.

"Children are, on the whole, very much alike everywhere, and you four
lads fairly represent multitudes, who are growing up in all directions. It will
make me happy to think that my simple narrative may lead some of these
to observe how blessed are the results 01' patient continuance in well-doing,
what benefits arise from the thoughtful application or" knowledge and science,
and how good and pleasant a thing it is when brethren dwell together in
unity under the eye of parental love."

Night has closed around me.

For the last time my united family siumbers beneath my care.

T o-m arrow [his closing chapter 01' my journal will pass into the hand
of my eldest son.

From afar l greet thee, Europel

l greet thee, dear old Switzerland!

Like thee, may New Switzerland flourish and prosper--good, happy
and free!
