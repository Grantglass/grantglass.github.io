^HE LIFE OF DE FOE.
DANIEL DE FOE was descended trom a respect-
•Me family in the county of Northampton, and bom
in London, about the year 1663. His father, James
Foe, was a butcher, in the parish of St. Giles**, Crip-
plegate, ani a protestaut dijsenter. Why the subject
of this memoir prefixed the De to his family name
cannot now be ascertained, nor did he at any period
of his life think it necessary to give his reasons to the
public. The political scribblers of the day, however,
thoirght proper to remedy this lack of information,
and accused him of poiessing so little of the amor
yatria, as to make the addition m order that he
might not be taken for an Englishman; though this
idea could have had no other foundation than the
circumstance of his having, in consoqueuce of his
zeal for king William, attacked the prejudices of hi*
countrymen in his ** True-born Englishman."
After receiving a goou euucation at an academy at
Newington, young De Foe, before he had attained his
twenty-first year, commenced his career as an author,
by writing a pamplet against a very prevailing senti-
ment in favour of the Turks, who were at 'hat time
laying siege to Vienna. This production, being very
inferior to those of his maturer years, was very little
read, and the indignant author, despairing of success
with his pen, had recourse to the sword; or, as he
termed it, when boasting of the exploit his latter
years, " displayed his attachment to liberty and pro
tcstantism," by joining the ill-advised insurrection
under the duke of Monmouth, in the west. On the
failure of that unfortunate enterprise, he returnc
•gain to the metropolis: and it is not improbable
but that the circumstance of his being a native o
London, and his person not much known in that part
of the kingdom where the rebellion took place, might
facilitate his escape, and be the means of preventing
his being brought to trial for his share in the transac
tion. With the professions of a writer and a soldier
Mr. De Foe, in the year 1685, joined that of a trader
he was first engaged as a hosier, in Cornhill, and af
terwards as a maker of bricks and pantiles, near Til
bury Fort, in Essex; but in consequence of spending
»hose hours in the hilarity of the tavern which he
ought to have employed in the calculations of the
counting-house, his commercial schemes proved un-
successful; and in 1694 he was obliged to abscond
from his creditors, not failing to attribute those mis-
fortunes to the war and the severity of the times,
which were doubtless owing to his own misconduct.
It is much to his credit however, that after having
been freed from his debts by composition, and being
in prosperous circumstances from King William's fa-
vour, he voluntarily paid most of his creditors both
the principal and interest of their claims. This is
such an example of honesty as it would be unjust to
De Foe and to the world to conceal. The amount
of the sums thus paid must have been very consider-
able, as he afterwards feelingly mentions to Lord
Haversham, who had reproached him with covetous-
ness; "With a numerous family, and no helps but
my own industry, I have forced my way through 8
sea of misfortunes, and reduced my debts exclusive
of composition, from seventeen thousand to less than
five thousand pounds."
At the beginning of the year 1700, Mr. De Foe
published a satire in verse, which excited very con
siderable attention, called the " True-born English-
man." Its purpose was to furnish a reply to those
who were continually abusing King William and some
of his friends as foreigners, by shewing that the pre-
sent race of Englishmen was a mixed and heteroge-
iteous brood, scarcelv anv of which could lay claim to
native purity of blood. The satire was in many parti
very severe; and though it gave high offenc«, it
claimed a considerable share of the public attention.
The reader will perhaps be gratified by a specimen ol
this production, wherein he endeavours to account
for—
««What makes this discontented land appear
Less happy now in times of peace, than war;
Why civil feuds disturb the nation more,
Than all our bloody wars had done before:
Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place.
And men are alway* honest in disgrace;
The court preferments make men knaves in course,
I}ut they, who would be in them, would be worse.
'Tis not at foreigners that we repine,
Would foreigners their perquisites resign:
The grand contention's plainly to be seen,
To get some men put out and some put in."
It will be immediately perceived that De Foe could
have no pretensions to the character of a poet; but
he has, notwithstanding, some nervous and well-ver-
sified lines, and in choice of subject and moral he if
in general excellent. The True-born Englishman
concludes thus:
Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,
And see their offspring thus degenerate;
How we contend for birth and names unknown.
And build on their past actions, not our own;
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,
And openly disown the vile degenerate race.
For fame of families is all a cheat;
'TlS PERSONAL VIRTUE ONLY MAKES US GHKAT.
For this defence of foreigners De Foe was amply
rewarded by King William, who not only ordered him
a pension, but as his opponents denominated it, ap-
pointed him pampJiItt-writer general to the court;
•n office for which he was peculiarly well calculated,
possessing, with a strong mind and a ready wit, that
kind of yielding conscience which allowed him to sup*
port tne measures of nis nenelactors tnough convinced
they were injurious to his country. De Foe now re-
tired to Newington with his family, and for a short
lime lived al ease; but the death of his royal patron
deprived him of a generous protector, and opened a
tcene of sorrow which probably embittered his future
life.
He had always discovered a great inclination to en*
gage in religious controversy, and the furious contest,
civil and ecclesiastical, which ensued on the accession
of Queen Anne, gave him an opportunity of gratify-
ing his favourite passion. He therefore published a
tract entitled "The shortest Way with the Dissenters,
or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church,"
which contained an ironical recommendation of per-
secution, but written in so serious a strain, that many
persons, particular Dissenters, at first mistook its
real intention. The high church party however saw,
and felt the ridicule, and by their influence, a prose-
cution was commenced against him, and a proclama-
tion published in the Gazette, offering a reward for
his apprehension.* When De Foe found with how
"St. James's, January 10,1702-3.
* "Whereas Daniel De Foe, alias De Fooe, is
charged with writing a scandalous and seditious pam-
phlet, entitled " The shortest Way with the Dissent
ers:" he is a middle-sized spare man, about 40 years
old, of a brown complexion, amd dark brown colourd
hair, but wears a wig, a hooked nose a sharp chin,
grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth, was born
in London, and for many years was a hose-factor, in
Freeman's Yard, in Cornhill, and now is owner of
the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort, in
Essex; whoever shall discover the said Daniel De
Foe, to one of her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of
State, or any of her Majesty's Justices of Peace, bo
•s he may be apprehended, shall have a reward of
HM. which her Majesty has ordered immediately t»
be paid upon such discovery."
London Gaz. No. 3879.
KtHcn rigour Muself and his pamphlet were about to
bo treated, he at first secreted himself; but his printei
and bookseller being taken into custodody, he surren-
dered, being resolved, as he expressed it, "to throw
himself upon the favour of government, rather than
that others should be ruined for his mistakes." In
July, 1703, he was brought to trial, found guilty, and
sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory, and
to pay a fine of two hundred marks. He underwen
the infamous part of the punishment with great for-
titude, and it seems to have been generally thought
that he was treated with unreasonable severity. So
far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself,
that he wrote a hymn to the pillory, which thus ends,
alluding to his accusers:
Tell them, the men that plac'd him here
Are scandals to the times;
Are at a loss to find his guilt,
And can't commit his crimes.
Pope, who has thought fit to introduce him in rm
Dunciad (probably from no other reason than party
difference) characterises him in the following line:
Earless on high stood unabash'd De Foe.
This is one of those instances of injustice and malig
nity which so frequently occur in the Dunciad, and
which reflect more dishonour on the author than on
the parties traduced. De Foe lay friendless and dis-
tressed in Newgate, his Family ruined, and himself
without hopes of deliverance, till Sir Robert Harle)',
who approved of his principles, and foresaw that dur-
ing a factious age such a genius could be converted
to many uses, represented his unmerited sufferings
to the Queen, and at length procured his release. Thu
treasurer, Lord, Godolphin, also sent a considerable
sum to his wife and family, and to him money to pay
his fine and the expense of his discharge. Gratitude
and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man; and
it was this benevolent act that prompted De Foe to
support Harloy. with his able anri ingenious pen, whew
Anne lay lifeless, and his benefactor in the vicissitude
of party was persecuted by faction, and overpowered
though not conquered, by violence.
The talents and perseverence of De Foe began
now to be properly estimated, and as a firm supporter
of the administration, he was sent by Lord Godol-
phin to Scotland, on an errand which, as he says, was
far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an
honest man to perform. His knowledge of commerce
and revenue, his powers of insinuation, and above
nil his readiness of pen, were deemed of no small
utility, in promoting the union of the two kingdoms;
of which he wrote an able history, in 1709 with two
dedications, one to the Queen, and another to the
Duke of Queensbury. Soon afterwards he unhappily,
oy some equivocal writings, rendered himself suspect-
ed by both parties, so that he once more retired to
Nevvington in hopes of spending the remaider of his
days in peace, His pension being withdrawn, and
wearied with politics, he began to compose works of
a different kind.—The year 1715 may therefore be re-
garded as the period of De Foe's political life. Fac-
tion henceforth found other advocates, and parties
procured other writers to disseminate their sugges-
tions, and to propagate their falsehoods.
In 1715 Do Foe published the "Family Instruc-
tor;" a work inculcating the domestic duties in a
lively manner, by narration and dialogue, and dis-
playing much knowledge of life in the middle ranks
of society. "Religious Courtship" also appeared
soon after, which, like the "Family Instructor," is
eminently religious and moral in its tendency, and
strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety
and private.devotion for which the dissenters hav«
generally been distingu;shcd. The most celebrated
of all his works, "The Life and Adveutures of Ro-
binson Crusoe"," appeared in 1719. This wojk has
{>assed through numerous editions, and been trans-
ated into almost all modern languages. The great
invention which is displayed in it, the variety of In
cidents and circumstances which it contains, related
m the mos't easy and natural manner, together with
the excellency of the moral and religious reflections,
render it a performance of very superior and uncom-
mon merit, and one of the most interesting worki
that ever appeared. It is strongly recommended by
Rosseau as a book admirably calculated to promote
the purposes of natural education; and Dr. Blair
says, "No fiction in any language, was ever better
supported than the adventures of Robinson Crusoe.
While it is carried on with that appearance of truth
and simplicity, which takes a stronghold on the ima-
gination of all readers, it suggests, at the same time,
very useful instruction; by shewing how much the
native powers of men may be exerted for surmount-
ing the difficulties of any external situation." It has
been pretended, that De Foe surreptitiously appro-
priated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
mi riner, who lived four years alone on the island of
Juan Fernandez, and a sketch of whose story had
ne fore appeared in the voyage of Captain Woodes
\l ogers. But this charge, though repeatedly and con-
fccvently brought, appears to be totally destitute of
4ty foundation. De Foe probably took some gene-
.al hints for his work from the story of Selkirk, but
here exists no proof whatever, nor is it reasonable
o suppose that he possessed any of his papers or
nemoirs, which had been published seven years be-
ore the appearance of Robinson Crusoe. As a far-
her proof of De Foe's innocence, Captain Rogers't
iccount of Selkirk may be produced, in which it it
aid that the latter had neither preserved pen, ink,
tr paper, and had in a great measure lost his lan-
guage; consequently De Foe could not have received
my written assistance, and we have only the asser-
tion of his enemies to prove that he had any verbal.
The great success of Rdbinson Crusoe induced its
author to write a number of other lives and adven-
tures some of which were popular in their times,
though at present nearly forgetten. One of his latest
Dublications wis " A Tour through the Island oi
Great Britain," a performance of very inferior merit;
but De Foe was now the garralous old man, and nil
spirit (to use the words of an ingenious biographei)
"like a candle struggling in the socket, biased ant!
sunk, blazed and sunk, till it disappeared at length in
total dajkness." His laborious and unfortunate life
was finished on the 26th of April, 1731, in the parish
of St. Giles's, Cripplegate.
Daniel De Foe possessed very extraordinary ta-
lents; as a commercial writer, he is fairly entitled to
stand in the foremost rank among his cotempora-
ries, whatever may be their performances or their
fame. His distinguished characteristics are origina-
lity, spirit, and a profound knowledge of his subject,
and in these particulars he has seldom been surpassed.
As the author of Robinson Crusoe he has a claim
not only to the admiration, but to the gratitude of
his countrymen; and so long as we have a regard
for supereminent merit and take an interest in the
welfare of the rising generation, that gratitude will
not cease to exist. But the opinion of the learned
and ingenious Dr. Beattie will be the best eulogiuni
that can be produced on that celebrated romance •
u Robinson Crusoe," says the Doctor, " must be al
lowed by the most rigid moralist, to be one of thosu
novels which one may read, not only with pleasure
but also with profit. It breathes throughout a spirit
of piety and benevolence; it sets in a very striking
light the importance of the mechanic arts, which they,
who know not what it is to be without them, are so
apt to undervalue; it fixes on the mind a lively idea
if the horrors of solitude, and, consequently of the
sweets of social life, and of the blessings we derivo
from conversation and mutual aid; and it shews
how, by labouring with one's own hands, one may
secure independence, and open for one's self many
sources of health and amusement. I agree, there-
fore, with Rosseau, that it is one of the best booki
tfiat can be put into the hands of children."
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of Yoik
of a good family, though not of that country, mj
farther being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull; he got a good estate by merchandise, and
leaving off his trade* lived afterwards at York, fron
whence he had married my mother, whose relation'
were named Robinson, a very good family m thai
country, and from whom I was called Robinsoi
Krutznaer; by ihe usual corruption of words h
England, we are now called, nay we call ourselves,
and write our name Crusoe, and so my companion*
always cabled me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flan-
ders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father 01
mother did know what was become of me.
Bern* the third son of the familv, and not bred tc
any trade, my nead Degan to De filled very early witk
rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as feu
as house education and a country free-school gene
rally go, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my in
clination to this led me strongly against the will
nay the commands of my father, and against all th
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that
propension of nature tending directly, to the life oJ
misery which was to be fatal to me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what heforesaw was my
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me upon this subject: he asked
me what reason mpre than a mere wandering incli-
nation I had for leaving my father's house and my
native country, where I might he well introduced, and
had a prospect of raising my fortune by application
and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He
told me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one
hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on the other,
who went abroad upon adventures, to raise by enter-
prise, and make themselves famous in undertakings oi
a nature out.of the common road; that these things
were all either too far above me, or too far below
me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be
called the upper station of low life, which he had
found by long experience was the best state in the
world, the most suited to human happiness, not ex-
posed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and
sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not
embarrased with the pricte, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, 1
might judge of the happmcss%f this state by this one
think, viz. that this was the state of life which all other
people envied; that kings have frequently tementec'
tne miserable consequences oi being born to great
things, and wish they nad oeen placed in the middle
of the two extremes, between the mean and the great;
lhat the wise man gave his testimony to this as the
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the up-
per and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
mankind $ nay, tney were not subjected to so many
distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
as those were, who by vicious living, luxury, and ex-
travagances, on one hand, or by hard labour, want oi
necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet, on the other
hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the na-
tural consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of
virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, wer«!
the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that
this way men went silently and smoothly through the
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed
with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace,
and the body of rest; not enraged with the passion
of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for great
tilings; but in easy circumstances slidinggently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, not
to precipitate myself into miseries which nature and
the station of life I was born in seemed to have pro.
r ided against; that I was under no necessity of seek*
oig my bread; that he would do well for me, ano
endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of lift
which he had been just recommending to me; and
that if I was not very easy and happy in the world
it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it
and that he should have nothing to'answer for, having
thus discharged his duty in warning me against mea-
sures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word,
hat as he would do very kind things for me if I would
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give
me any encouragement to go away: and to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an example,
to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions tc
keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to
run into the army, where he was killed; and though
he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he
would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglect-
ed his counsel when there might be none to assist in
my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, and espe-
cially when he spoke of my brother who was killed;
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to re-
pent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, thaa
he broke off the discourse, and told me, bis heart waa
so full that he could do no more.
I was ^sincerely affected with this discourse, as in-
deed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to
think of going abroad any more, buttp settle at home
according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days
wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my fa-
ther's farther importunities, in a few week after I re-
solved to run quite away from him. However, I did
tot act s^hastily neither as rr$ first heat of resoiutk*
prompted, but 1 took my mother, at a time wnen 1
thought hera little pleasanter than ordinary, and told
her, tndt my thoughts were so entirely bent upon see*
ing the world, that I should never settle to any thing
with resolution enough to go thrown with it, and my
father had better give me his consent than force m*
to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I should
never serve out my time, and I should certainly run
away from my master before my time was out, and
go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let
me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and
did not like it, I would go no more, and I would pro
mise by a double diligence to recover that time I had
lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she told
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest to give his consent to any
such thing so much for my hurt; and that she won-
dered how I could think of any such thing after such
a discourse as I had had with my father,and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had
used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin my-
self, there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it: that for her part
she would not have so much hand in my destruction;
and I should never have it to say, that my mother
was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the
discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a
great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, " That
boy might be happy if he would slay at home; but H
he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch
that was ever born; I can give no consent to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
Joose, though, in the meantime, I continued obsti
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business. aiw*
frequently expostulating with my father arid mothe»
about their being so positively determined against
what they knew my incarnation prompted me to. But
being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and with-
out any purpose of making an elopement that time;
but I say, being there, and one of my companions
being going by sea to London, in his father's ship, ana
prompting me to go with them, with the common al-
lurement of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me
nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father or
mother any more, not so much as sent them word oi
it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any
consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, God knows, on the first of September,
1651, f went on board a ship bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The
ship was no sooner gotten out of the Humber, but the
wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most
frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea be-
fore, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and ter-
rified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by
the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my
father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mo-
ther's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch
of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me
with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my
duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea,
which 1 had never been upon be-fore, went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor like what I saw a few days after: but
it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
tailor, and had never known any thing of the matter.
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,
and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought,
m the trough or hollow of the iea, we ihould nevti
rise more; and in this agony of mind I made many
vows arid resolutions, that if it would pl^su^ God here
to spare my life this one voyage, if ever 1 got once
my foot upon dry land again I would go dirertly home
to my father, and never set it into a ship again white
{lived; that I would take his advice, and never run
myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I
saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the
middle station of life, h^w easy, how comfortably he
had lived all his days, and never had been exposed tc
tempests at sea, or troubles on shore; and 1 resolved
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home
to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all he
while the storm continued, and indeed some time af-
ter; but the next day the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it
however, I was very grave for all that day, being alsc
a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weathei
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little
or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon
it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that
ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon
the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before,
and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time
after. And now, lest my good resolutions should
continue, my companion, who had indeed enticed mo
fcwa^y, comes to me: "Well, Bob," says he, (clapping
me upon the shoulder) "how do you do after it? I
warrant you were frighted, wa'n't you, last night, whet.
it blew but a capful of wind in—*' A capful do you call
it?" said I; "it was a terrible storm."—"A storm,
you fool you," replied he, " do you call that a storm?
why it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship
end sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall
af wind as that; but you're but a fresh-watei saikx
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we1>
forget all that; do you see what charming weather
is now?" To make short this sad part of my story, w|
went the old way of all sailors; the punch was madia,
and I was made drunk with it; and in that one night'i
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolution!
for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to
its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current
of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the
vows and promises that I made in my distress. F
found, indeed, some intervals of reflection, and the
serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return
again sometimes; but 1 snook them off, and roused
myself from them as it »»ore from a distemper, and
applying myself to drinkii- and company, soon mas-
tered the return of those fiws, for so I called them; and
I had in five or six days eoi as complete a victory
over conscience, as any your g fellow that resolved not
to be troubled with it could desire: but I was to have
another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
«tases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse: for if I would not take this for a de-
liverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst
and most hardened wretch among us would confesa
both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary, and
the weather calm, we had made but little way since
the storm. Here we were obliged to come to anchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz.
at south-west, for seven or eight days, during which
jime a great many ships from Newcastle came intc
die same roads, as the common harbour where tr>e
ships might wait for a wind for the river.
We nad not. however, rid here so long, hut should
1
tiave tided it up the river, but that the wind b/ew too
fresh; *»«id after we had lain four or five days, blew
very hard. However, the roads being reckoned a?
good as aharbour, the anchorage good, and our ground
tackle very strong, our men were unconoerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the
time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea;
but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased,
and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts
and make every thing snug and close, that the ship
migh ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went
very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in,
shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice
our anchor had come home; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with
two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the
better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the face?
even of the seamen themselves. Trie-master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear
him softly to himself say several times, "Lord be
merciful to us! we shall be all lost, we shall be all un-
done !" and the like. During these first hurries 1 was
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steer-
age, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill re-
assume the first penitence which I had so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against: I thought
the bitterness of death had been past, and that this
would be nothing like the first: but when the master
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened: I got up
out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal
sight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes: when 1
could lookabout, I could see nothing but distress round
us, two ships that rid near us, we found had cut theqr
masts by :he board, being deep loaden: and our men
cried out, that a ship which rid about a mile ahead
of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea,
at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labour-
ing in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and
came close by us, running away with only their sprite
sail out before the wind.
Towards evening themate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast,
which he was very unwilling to do: but the boatswin
protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would
founder, he consented; and when they had cut awtay
the fore-tfnast, the main-mast stood so loose, ana
- shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her
away also, and make.a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been in such a fright before at but a little. But if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind
upon account of my former convictions, and the having
returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put mein such a con-
dition, that I can by no words describe it. But the
worst was not come yet; the storm continued with
such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never known a worse. We had a good ship,
but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea,
that the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder. It was my advantage in one respect,
that I did not know what they meant by founder till
] inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that
I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswan,
and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship
would go to the bottom. ,In the middle of the night,
and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men
%at had been down on purpose to see, cried outywv
had sprung a leak; another said, there was four foot
water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
»»ump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, died
withm me, and I fell backwards upon the srde of my
bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men
roused me, and told me, that I that was able to do
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the
master seeing some light colliers, who not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to
sea, and would come near us ordered to fire a gun as
a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word,
[< was so surprised, that 1 fell down in a swoon. As
this was a time when every body had his own life to
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become
of me; but another man stept up to tfce pump, and
thursting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking
I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.
We worked on; but the water increasing in the
bold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it
was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a port, so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it,
and then veered it out a great length, which they after
great labour and hazard took hold of, and we hauled
them close under our stern, and got all into their
boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after wa
were in the boat, to think of reaching to their ow«
ihip -, so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore he would make it good to their master:
so partly rowing ann partly driving, our boat went
away to the nothward, sloping towards the shore
almost as far as Winterton-Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship but we saw her sink, and then 1 un-
derstood for the first time what was meant by a ship
foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she
was sinking; for from that moment they rather put
me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in;
my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly
with frighth, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see, when our boat mounting the waves we
were able to see the shore, a great many people run-
ning along the shore to assist us when we should come
i ear; but we made but slow way towards the shore,
nor were we able to reach the snore, till being past
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the
westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in,
and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yar-
mouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and had
money given us sufficient to carry us either to Lon-
don or back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull,
and have gone home, I had been happy, and my
father, an emblem of our bussed Saviour's parable, had
tven killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the shia

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
r went away m was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it
was a great while before ho had any assurance that J
was not drowned.
But my iil fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had se-
veral times loud calls from my reason and my more
composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will J
, urge that it is a secret overruling decree thathurriei
us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
erven though it be before us, and that we push upon it
with our eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such
oucreed unavoidable misery atttending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed
me forward against the calm reasonings and persua-
sions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met with in my first
attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quarters;
1 say, the first time he saw me, it appeared nis tone
was altered, and looking very melancholy, and shak-
ing his head, asked me how I did, and telling his fa-
ther who I was, and how I had come this voyage only
for a trial, in order to go farther abroad; his father
turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone,
u Young man," says he, «* you ought never to go uf
«ea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and
visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man."
—" Why, Sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more?"
•* That is another case," said he; "it is my calling,
Mid therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage
for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
>f what you are to expect if you persist: perhaps thU
is ,all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the
abip of Tarshish. Pray, ** continues he, ** what ar
vou? and on what account did you go to soa?" Upo
that I told him some rfmy story; at the end of whtet,
he burst out with a strange kind of passion; " Whai
had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my ship? 1 would not set my foot
m the same ship with thee again for a thousand
pounds." This indeed was, as 1 said, an excursion o/
his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of hit
loss, and was farther than he could have authority tc
go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely tr
me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin-; told me I might see a
visible hand of Heaven against me. "And young
man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing
but disasters and disappointments, till your farther'?
words are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; fori made him little answer,
and (saw him no more: which way he went, I know
not. As for me, having some money in my pocket,
I travelled to London by land: and there, as well a*
on the road, had many struggles with myseltf, what
oourse of life I should take, and whether I should
go home, or get to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else;
from whence I have since often observed, how incon-
gruous and irrational the common temper of mankind
16, especially of youjh, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, viz. that they are not asham-
ed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed
of the action for which they ought justly t6 be esteem-
ed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.
In this state of life however I remained some time,
uncertain what measure to take, and what course of
life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to
0piu& tome i and as I stayed a while, the remem
nranceof the distress I had been in wore off; and ai
that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to d
return wore off with it, till at last f quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, that hurried me into the wild
and indigested notion of raising my fortune; and thai
impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to
make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties
and even the command of my father: I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfor-
tunate of all enterprises to my view ; and I went on
board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as
our sailors vulgarly call it a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune that in all these adven-
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learnt the
duty and office of a foremastman; and in time might
have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not
for a master. But as it was always my fate to
choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money
in my pocketj and good clothes upon my back, 1
would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man; and so I neither had any business in the ship,
o>- learnt to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fan into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: hut it was not so with me.
1 first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who
had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having had
very good success there, was resolved to go again;
and who taking a fancy to my conversation, which
was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me
say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would
go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; 1
should be his messmate and his companion ; and if I
could carry any tiling with me, 1 should have ah* the
advantage of it that the trade would admit; and per-
haps I might meet with some encouragement.
i embraced the offer; and entering into a strict
friendship with the captain, who was an honest and
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and
oarried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis-
interested honesty of my friend the captain, I increas-
ed very considerably ; for I carried about 401. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This 407, 1 had mustered together by the assistance oi
some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother,
to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful' in all my adventuves, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics and the rules ot navigation, learnt how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an obser-
vation, and, in short, to understand some things that
were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, as
he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn,
and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor
and a merchant: for I brought home five pounds nine
ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded
me in London at my return almost 300/. and this fil-
led me with those aspiring thoughts which have so
completed my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too j
particularly, that I was continually sick,heing thrown
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate; our principal trading being upon the coast,
from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the lir;a
Kself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and
1 embarked in the same vessel with one who was his
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the com-
of iiie»ni|». Thii was «>e »nhappieat voyapi
mat ever man mane; for though I did not carry quit*
100/. of my new-gained wealth, so that I had 200J. leftt
and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was
very just tl_ me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in
this voyage; arid the first was this, viz. our ship mak-
ing her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather
between those islands and the African shore, was sur-
prized in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover
of Sallce, who gave chase to us with all the sail she
could make. We crowded also as much canvass as
our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have
got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and
fcie rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and bringing to by mistake just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also hie small-shot from nearly 200 men
which he had on board. However, we had not a man
touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to
attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but lay-
ing us on board the next time upon our other quar-
ter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who imme-
diately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rig-
ging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes,
powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck
of them twice. However, to cut short this melan-
choly part of our story, our ship being disabled, and
three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first
I apprehended; nor was 1 carried up the country to
the emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but
was kept by the captain of the rover as his propei
prize, and made his sla-c, beitis* young and nimble,
and fit for his business At this surprising change of
my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I look-
ed back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me,
that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve
me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to
pass, that I could not be worse; that now the hand oJ
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone with
out redemption: but alas ! this was but a taste of tlie
misery I was to go through, as will appear in the
sequel of this story.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me home
to his house so I was in hopes that he would lake me
with him when he went to sea again, believing that ii
would some time or other be hisYate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portugal man of war; and that then I
should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me
on shore to look after his little garden, and to do the
common drudgery of slaves alxmt his house; and
when he came home again from his cruise, he order-
ed me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.
Here 1 meditated nothing but mv escape, and what
method I would take to effect it,"but found no way
that had the least probability in it: nothing presented
to make the supposition of it rational; for 1 had no-
body to communicate it to that would embark with me,
no tellow slave, no Englishman, Irishman, orScotsman
there but myself; so that for two years, though I often
pleased my self with the imagination, yet I never had
the leastencouraging prospect of putting it in practice,
After about two years an odd circumstance present-
ed itself, which put the old thought of making some
attempt for my liberty again in my head: my patron
lymg at home longer than tisul without fitting out his
ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he
nsed constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes
Oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he
always .took me and a young Maresco with him to
iftw U*e hoat, we made him vary merry, and I proved
rery dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that some
times he would send me with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish offish for him.
It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark
*a.m morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we
were not half a league from the shore we lost sight ol
it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way,
we laboured all day, and all the next night, and when
the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea
instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were
at least two leagues from the shore : however, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labour and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh
in the morning; but particularly we were all very
hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to
take more care of himself for the future; and having
lying by him the long-boat of our English ship he had
taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more
without a compass and some provision; so he ordered
the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English
slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a
pface to stand behind it to steer and hale home the
main-sheet: and room before for a hand or two to
stand and work the sails: she sailed with what we call
a shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom gibed over
the top of the cabin, which lav very snug and low,
and had in it room for him to lie,.\\ itli a slave or two,
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put
in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to
drink; particular^' his bread, rice and coffee.
We went frequency out with this boat a-fishing, and
161 was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never
went without me. Jt happened that he had appointed
to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or tor fish,
with two or three Moores of some distinction in that
place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily,
and had therefore sent on board the boat over-night a
«ar»er store of provisions than ordinary; and had or
dered me to get ready three fusees with, powder and
shot, which were on board his ship; for that they de-
signed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited
the next morning with the boat washed clean, hei
ancient and pendants out, and every thing to accom-
modate his guests; when by and bye my patron came
on board alone, and told me hit guests had \ ut ofl
going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered
me with the man and bw ns usual, to go out with
the boat and catch then, *ome fish, for that his friends
were to sup at his house; and commanded that as
soon as 1 got some fish I should bring it home to his
house; all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I fouud I was like
to have a little ship at my command ; and my master
being gone, I prepated to furnish myself, not for fish-
ing business, but for a voyage; though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer; for any way to get out of that place was my
way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we mti6t not presume
to eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was truet
so he brought a large basket of rusk or hisket of their
kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat.
I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,
which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of
some English prize, and I conveyed them into the
boat while the Moor was on show" as if they had been
there before for our master: I conveyed also a great
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above
half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which
were of great use to us afterwards, esnemUy the
wax to make candles. Another trick f txjeq upon

was tsttiaeli fcrhorh their call Muly* or Moley; m> I
called tti birii: u Moley," skid I» u our patron's gun*
are bh bbdrd the bbat; bait ybU not get a little powder
and shot? it may bti we may kill some alcamies (a
fowl like buv curlbWs) for ourselves, for 1 know he
kee|)s the gunner's stores in the ship."—** Yes," says
he, ** I'll bring some;" and accordingly he brought a
treat leather pouch which held about a pound and a
half of powder, or rather more; and another with
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets,
and put all into the boat: at the same time 1 had
found some powder of my master's in the great cabin,
with which 1 fdled one of the large bottles in the case,
which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into
another; and thus furnished with every thing needful,
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which
is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were,
and took no notice of us: and we were not above a
mile out of the port before we haled in our sail, and
set us down to nsh. The wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast o<
Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but
my resolutions were, blow which way it would,* I
would be gone from that horrid place where 1 was,
and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time andcatched nothing,
for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them, 1 said to the
Moor, ** This will not do; our master will not be thus-
served; we must stand farther off" He, thinking no
harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat sei
the sails; and as T had the helm I run the boat oui
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I
would fish; when giving the hoy the helm, I stepped
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if 1
stooped for something behind him, I took him by sur-
prise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea; he rose immediately,
for he swam like a cork, and called to me, beeped to
be taken in, told me he would go all over the world
with me. He swam so strong after the boat, thai h«
would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching out one of'the fowling-pieces, I presented it
at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, and il
he would be quiet I would do him none : u Hut," said
I, "you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and
the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore,
and I will do you no harm ; but if you come near the
boat I'll shoot you through the head, for 1 am resolved
to have my liberty;" so he turned himself about,
and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt bul
he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.
I could have been content to Uave taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there vva?
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Maho-
met and his father's beard, I must throw you into
the sea too." .The boy smiled in my face, and spoke
so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over ihe world
with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, ratheT
stretching to windward", that they might think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth ; (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do) for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to sui
round us with their canoes, and destroy us; where
we could never once go on shore but we should be
devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
if human kind?
'But as soon as it grew dusk in ^ the evening, I
•bunged my course, and steered directly wuth ancTDj
tast, bending my course a little toward the east, that 1
might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh
gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such
sail that I believe by the next clay at three o'clock in
the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not
be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of
ny other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not s.op, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till 1
had sailed in that manner five days; and then th*
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also
would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast and come*to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river, I knew not what, or where; neither what lati-
tude, what country, what nation, or what river; I
neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the princi-
pal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not of what kinds, that the poor
boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not
to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said I,
"then I won't; but it may be we may see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions."—-
w Then we give them the shoot gun," says Xury,
laughing, "make them run wey." Such English
Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. How-
ever, 1 was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave
him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to
cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good,
and I took it; we dropped out little anchor, and lay
itill all night; 1 say still, for we slept none; for in
tw<r» or three hours we saw vast great creatures »*r«
Knew not wrtat to call them) of many sorts, com*
down to the sea-shore and run into the watei wallow-
'ng and washing themselves for the pleasure of cool-
ing themselves; and they made such hideous howlingt
and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so wai
I too; but we were both more frighted when we heard
one of these mighty creatures come swimming to-
wards our boat; we could not see him, but we might
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and
furious beasi; Xury said it was a lion, and it might
be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me
to weigh the anchor and row away: ** No," says I,
"Xury; we can slip our cable with the buoy to it,
and go off to sea; they cannot follow us far."j I had
no sooner said so than I perceived the creature (what-
ever it was) within two oars' length, which some^
thing surprised me; however, I immediately stepped
to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun fired at him;
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam
towa/ds the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises,
and hideous cries and bowlings, that were raised, as
well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the
country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing
1 have some reason to believe those creatures had
never heard before: this convinced me there was no
eoing on shore for us in the night upon that coast,
and how to venture on shore in the day was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any
of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into
the hands of lions and tigers; at least we are equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.
Re that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
tomewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
left in the boat ; when or where to get it, was the
point- Xurv said, if 1 would let him go on shore with
j nne of the jars, he would find if there was any water,
and bring some to me. I asked him why he woul£
lo> why J should net go, and he stay in the boat 1
11
The boy answered with so much affection, that mads
me love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mana
come, they eat me, you go wey."—" Well, Xury,"
said I, " we will froth go, and if the wild mans come,
we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us." So I
gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of our patron's case of bottles which I mentioned
before; and we haled the boat in as near the shore as
we thought was proper, and waded on shore; carry
ing nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sign t of the boat, fearing
the coming of canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the
country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him
come running towards me. I thought he was pursued
by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and
I run forward towards him to help him; but when I
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot,
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very
good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came
with, was to tell me that he had found good water,
and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up : so we
filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature in that part of the coun-
try.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, am
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off froir
the coast. But as 1 had no instruments to take ai
observation to know what latitude we were in, an<
not exactly knowing, or at least remembering wha
latitude they were in, and knew not where to look foi
them, or when to stand off to sea towards tnem ,
otherwise I might now easily have found some oi
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood ah tig
this coast till I came to that pare where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels upon thei)
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take u*
in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where 1
now was, must be that country, which, lying between
the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes*
lies waste, arid uninhabited, except by wild beasts;
the negroes ha. ing abandoned it, and gone farther
south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not think-
ing it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness;
and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigi-
ous number of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furi
ous creatures which harbour there; so that the Moor*
use if for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time ; and in-
deed for near an hundred miles together upon this
coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited coun-
try by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the
Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the Mountain
Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a great mind t<»
venture out in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep aloi^
the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh watei^
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, wc came to an anchoi
under a little point of land which was pretty high •
and the tide beginning to flow, wc lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore: "for,"
•ays he, " look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
tide of that hillock fast asleep." I looked where'he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung
as it were a ittle over him. "Xury," says I, "you
shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked fright-
ed, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one mouth;"
one mouthful he meant: however, I said no more to
the boy, but bad him lie still, and I took our biggest
%un, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim
I could with the first piece to have shot him into the
head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above
his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and
broke the bone. He started up growling at first, but
finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got up
upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that
ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not
hit him on the head; however, I took up the second
piece immediately, and though he began to move off,
fired again, and shot him into the head, and had the
pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise,
but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took heart,
and would have me let him go on shore: " Well, go,"
said I; so the boy jumped into the water and taking
a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
-nuzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the
head again, which dispatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
tnd 1 was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
wul shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. "For what, Xury ?" said I, "Me
tut cflf his head," said he. However, Xury could
not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought
it with him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take off his skin if I cou'.i
So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xurj
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very
ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day, but at last we get off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top o/ our cabin, the sun effectu-
ally dried it in two days time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing
on our provisions, which began to abate very much"
and going no oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water: my design in this was, to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any
where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship; and if I did not,
I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands; and
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship,
or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten dava
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the Ian •
was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look
at us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
%nd stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
•ui shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor
and said tome, ««No go, no go," However, I
hauled in nearer the shore that T might talk to them,
and [ found they run along the shore by me a good
vay . 1 observed they had no weapons in their hands,
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
except one, who had a long slender stick, which
Xury said was a lance, and that they would throw
them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a dis-
tance, but talked with them by signs as well as 1
could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat; they beckoned to me to stop, my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the
top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some com, such as is the produce of their coun-
try ; but we neither knew what the one nor the othei
was : however, we were willing to accept it, but how
r<> come at it was our next dispute, for I was not foi
venturing on shore to them, and thev were as much
afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore and laid it ({own, and
went and stood #a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, foi we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully";
for while we were lying by the shore came two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female
or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not
tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual
or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because, in
the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear
but in the night; and in the second place, we found the
people terribly frighted, especially the women* The
man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the wafer they did not seem to offer to
fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
into the sea and swam about as if they had come for
their diversion. At last one of them began to come
nearer our "boat than at first I expected; but I lay
ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all pos
«ible expedition, and bad Xury load both th"e others,
as soon as he came fairly within my reach I fired, and
shot him directly into the head; immediately he
sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and
plunged up and down as if he was struggling for life;
and' so indeed he was; he immediately made to the
shore; but between the wound, which was his mor
fcil hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun;
some of them were even ready to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror. But when
they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water,
and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood
staining the water, and by the help of a rope, which I
slung round him, and gave the Negroes to hale, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most
curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable de-
gree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admi-
ration to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran ujo
directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. 1
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh o1
this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as
a favour from me, which, when I made signs to them
that they might take him, they were very thankful
for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece
of wood trjey took off his skin as readily, and much
more readily, than we could have done with a knife.
They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them, but made signs for
the skin! which they gave me very freely, and brought
uio a great deal more of their provision, which,
Aotigh I did not understand, yet I accepted; then i
made signs to them for some water, and hold out on«
of my jars to them, turning it bottom upwards, to
show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They called immediately to some of theii
friends, and there came two women, and brought a
great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose,
in the sun; this they set down for me, as before, ana
I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all tiiree. The women were as stark naked as the
men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more, without
offering to go near the shore, till 1 saw the land run
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and, the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point,'
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to
seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands
However, they they were at a great distance, and 1
could not well tell what I had best to do, for if I should
be taken with a fresh of wind I might neither reach
one nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I wasverypensive,l stepped into
the cabin and sat me down, Xury having the helm,
when on a sudden the boy cried out, "Master,
Master, a ship with a sail!" and the foolish boy waj
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
anly the ship, but what she was, viz. that it was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to tlra
coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I observed
the course she steered, I was soon convinced they
were bound some other way, and did not design to
come any nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched
"*<t to sea as much as I could, resolving to speuk wim
(hem if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any signal to them;
Cut after I had crowded to the utmost, aud began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
perspective-glasses, and that it was some European
oat, which as they supposed, must belong to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me
come up. I was encouragedkwith this; and as I had
my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both
which they saw, for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun : upon these signals
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me, and
in about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him 1
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Salee. Then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
would believe that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless con-
dition as I was in, and immediately offered all I had. to
the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliver-
ance; but he generously told me, he would take no-
thing from me, but that all I bad should be delivered
safe to me when I came to the Brasils; " For," say
he, •* I have saved your life on no other terms than
I would be glad to be saved mysejf; and it may one
time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same
eondition. "Besides, said he, "when I carry you to
the Brasils, so great a way from your own country,
»f I should take from you what you have, you will b#
•tarved there, and then I only take away that lift I
13
have given. No, no, Seignor Inglese," says he, " Mr.
Englishman, I will carry you thither in charity, and
those things will help you to buy your subsistence
there, and your passage home again."
Ashe was charitable in his proposal, so he was just
In the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the sea-
men, that none should offer to touch any thing I had:
;hen he took every thing into his own possession, and
gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might
have them; even so much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what 1 would have for it? I told
him, he had been so generous to me in every thing,
lhat I co*uld not offer to make any price of the boat
but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me ne
would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at Brasil; and when it came
there, if any one offered to give more, he would make
ir up: he offered me also sixty pieces of eight more
for my boy Xury, which I was loath to take; not
that I was not willing to let the captain have him,
but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty,
who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I^et him know my reason, he
owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that
ae would give the boy an obligation to set him free in
len years, if he turned Christian. Upon this, and
Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the
captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and ar-
rived inf the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints'
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now 1
was once more delivered from the most miserable of
All conditions of life; and what to do next with my-
celf 1 was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing ol
me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
•eopard's skid, and forty for the lion's skin, which X
had in my boat, and caused every thing I had in th«
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-
wax, for I had made candles of the rest: in a word,
i made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight
of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore
in the Brasils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an inqeino as they call it; that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house; I lived'with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich sud-
denly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
I would turn planter among them, resolving, in the
<nean time, to find out some way to get my mone}',
which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, 1
f irchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my plan-
tation and settlement, and such a one as might be
oiiitabie to the stock which I proposed to myseJfto
receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
bom of English parents, whose name was Wells, and
m much such circumstances as f was. I call hitn
neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine,
and we went on very sociable together. My stock
was but low, as well as his: and we rather "planted
for food than any thing else, for about two years,
However, we began to increase, and our land began
fo come into order; so that the third year we planted
eome tobacco, and made each of us a large piece d
ground ready for planting cane in the year to come;
but we both wanted help: and now 1 found, more
tqan before, I had done wrong in parting with mv
boy Xury.
But, alas I for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonder: I had no remedy but to go on;
I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
genius, and dire? ly contrary to the life I delighted in,
and for which I htsook my father's house, and broke
through all his gcod advice; nay, I was coming into
the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which ]*
[ resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at
home, and never have fatigued myself in the world a9
I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England amongst my
friends, as have gone live thousand miles off to do it,
among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at
such distanae, as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret, I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to
be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon same
desolate island, that had nobody tnere bu/ * 'mself.
But how just has it been, and how shouL il men
reflect, that, when they compare their prese,.- condi-
tions with others that are worse, If aven may oblige
them to make the exchange, and be nvinced of their
former felicity, by their experience; I say, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who
had fo often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which had I continued, I had in all
probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.
I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend the
captain of the ship, that took me up at sea, went
back: for the ship remained there, in providing his
loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when, telling him what little stock I had left
oehind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
sincere advice: ** Seignor Inglese," savs he for so he
always called me, ** if you will give me letters, and a
procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has your money in London, to send your
effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and
in such goods as are proper for this country, I will
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my
return; but since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orderg
but for one hundred pounds sterling, which you say
is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
first; so that if it comes safe, you may order the
rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may have
me other half to have recourse to for your supply."
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course 1 could take; ro I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desirer1.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the huma-
nity of his behaviour, and what condition 1 was now
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply:
and when this honest captain came toLisbon, he found
means, by some of the English merchants there, to
send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant at London, who represented
\t effectually to her; whereupon, she not only deliver.
eJ the money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his hu-
man ity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had writ
lor, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them a!3 safe to me to the Brasils; among
which, without my direction (for I was too young in
my business to think of them) he had taken care to
havp all sortsof tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary
faw my plantation, and wniotk were of great use to me.
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for 1 was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the five pounds
which my friend had sent him for a present for him-
self, to purchase, and bring me over a servant undei
bond for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would
have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all Eng
ish manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the coun
fry, I found means to sell them to a very great advan-
tage; so that I may say, I had more than four times
the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely
beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did, 1
bought me a Negro slave, and an European servant
also; I mean another besides that which the captain
brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on
my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty
rolls, being each of above one hundred weight, were
well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet
from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and
in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed
often the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have befallen me,
for which my father so earnestly recommended a
quiet retired life, and of which he had so sensibly do
scribed the middle station of life to be full: but other
things attended me, and f was still to be the wilful
agent of all my own miseries; and particularly to in-
crease rny, fault, and double the reflections upon my-
self, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure
to make; all these miscarriages were procured by my
apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination
of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination,
in contradiction to the clearest views of doing mysell
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
at. J those measures of life,, which nature and Provi
dence concurred to present me with, and to make my
duty.
As I had done this in my breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of raising faster than the
nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast mysel
down again into the deepest gulph of human misery
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consist-
ent with life and a state of health in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may suppose, that having
now lived almost four years in the Brasils, and begin-
ning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plan-
tation, I had not only learnt the language, but had
contracted acquaintance and friendship among my
fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St
Salvadore, which was our port; and that in my dis-
course among them, I had frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea,
the manner of trading with the Negroes there, and
how easy it was to purchase upon the coast, for tri-
fles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets
bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-dust, Guj.
nea grains, elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for the
service of the Brasils in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that pari
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only far entered into, but,
as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientoj
or permission ol tne Kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, three of them came to
me the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with
them of, the last nighi, and they came to make
secret proposal to me ; and after enjoining me secrecy,
they told me, that they had a mind to fit out a ship to
go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as
I, and were straitened for nothing so much as ser-
vants; that as it was a trade could not be canied on,
because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make fcfut one
voyage, to bnng-the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and in a
word, the question was, whether I would go their su-
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea? and they offered me that I
should have my equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his 6Vn to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds
from England, and who in that time, and with that
little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth
three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was
the most preposterous thing that ever man in such
circumstances could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was .ost upon me. In a word, I told them 1
would go with all my heart, if they would undertake
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings
or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will,
disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death, making the captain of the ship that had save
my life as before, my universal heir, but obliging him
co dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will
one half of the produce being to himself, and the
other to be shipped to England,
In short I took all possible caution to preserve my
effects, and keep up my plantation: had I used hall
as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of what I ought to
have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with
all its common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons
I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic-
tates of my fancy rather than my reason : and accord,
mgly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnish-
ed, and all things done as by agreement by my part-
ners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil nour,
the 1st of September, 1659, being the same day eight
years that I went from my father and mother at Hull,
in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the
fool to my own interest.
, Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tone
ourden, carrying six guns, and fourteen men, besidet
he master, his boy, and myself; we had on board no
arge cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit
for our trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits oi
glass, shells, and odd trines, especially little looking.
5lasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, stand
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
15
tfeslgn to stretch over for the African coast; when
they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northern latitude,
which it seems was the manner of their course in
those days. We had very good weather, only exces-
sive hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we made
the height of Cape St. Augustino, from whence keep-
ing farther off at sea we lost sight of land, and steere
as if we were bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha
holding our course N. E. by N. and leaving thos
isles on the east. In this course we passed tlie iine in
about twelve days time, and were by our last obser
vation in 7 degrees 22 rain, northern latitude, when a
violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of our
knowledge; it began from the south-east, came about
to the north-west, and then settled into the north-east,
from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that
for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive; and scudding away before it, let it carry us
whither ever fate and the fury of the winds directed ,•
and during these twelve days, I need not say that 1
expected «very day to be swallowed up, nor indeed
did any inthe ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men die of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard; about the 12th
day the weather abating a little, the master made an
observation as well as he could, and found that he was
in about 11 degrees north latitude, but that he was 22
degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St.
Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the
coast of Guinea, or the north part of Brasil, beyond
the river Amazones, toward that of the river Oro-
noque, commonly called the Great River, and be-
gan to consult with me what course he should take,
tor the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and
he was going directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that, and looking over the
charts of the sea-coast of America with him we con-
cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have
i*/>uree-to, till we came within the circle of the
Carribbee islands, and therefore resolvea t« stand
away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assist-
ance, both to our ship and ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and stcei
ed away N. W. by W. in order to reach some of our
English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the
latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a second storm came upon
us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity
westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved,
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being de-
voured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out, Land!
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a mo-
ment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over
her in such a manner, that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close quarters to shelter us
from the very foam and spray of the sea.
t It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-
tion of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing
Where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inha
bited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wini
was still great, though rather less than at first, wa
could not» much as hope to have the ship hold manv
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind*
by a kind of miracle should turn immediately about
fn a word, we sat looking one upon another, and ex
pecting death.every, moment, and every man acting
accordingly, as preparing for another world, for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this; tnat
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
vv? had, was, that contrary to our expectation, the
snip did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate.
Now though we thought that the wind did a littift
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand
and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had no-
thing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as
we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before the
storm ; but she was first staved by dashing against the
ship's rudder, and in the next place the broke away,
and either sunk or was driven off to sea , so there was
no hope from her. We had another boat on board,
but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful
thing; however, there was no room to debate, for we
fancied the ship would jjreak in pieces every minute,
and some told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat and with the help of the rest of the men they
got her slung over the ship's side, and pelting all into
her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy and the wild sea; for though
the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went
dreadful high upon the shore, and might well be cal-
led den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we
all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if
we had, could we nave done any thing with it; so wo
worked at *he oar towards the land, though with
heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; for we all
knew, that when the boat came nearer the shore, she
ivould be dashed into a thousand pieces by the breach
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God
in, the most earnest manner; and the wind driving
us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with
ourownhands,pulling as well aswe could towards lancL
What the shore was, whether /ock or sand, whe-
her steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that
oould rationally give us the least shadow of expecta-
tion, was, if we might happen into some bay or gul£
or the mouth of some river, where, by great chance
we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed or rather driven about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, moun-
tain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bad
us expect the coup-de-grace. In a word, it took us
with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once ,
and separating us as well from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to say O God! for
we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which
I felt when I sunk into the water; for though I swam
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the wave9
so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me
or rather carried me a vast way on towards the shore,
and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon
the land almost dry, but half dead with the water i
took in. I had so much presence of mind as well as
breath left, that, seeing myself nearer the main Ian**
than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured
to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before
another wave should return, and take me up again.
But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I
saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and
as furious as an enemy which I had no means o\
strength to contend with; my business was to hold my
breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could;
and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and
nitot myself towards the shore, if possible; my greatest
concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry ra#
a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave
back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at
once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body; and
* could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
twiftness towards the shore a very great way; but 1
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still for-
ward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
nolding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up,
so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though
it was not two seconds of time that I could keep my-
self so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and
new courage. I was covered again with water a good
while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding
the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo-
ments to recover breath, and till the water went from
me, and then took to my heels, and run with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of tne sea, which
came pouring in after me again; and twice more 1
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as
before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or lather dashed me against a piece of a
rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath
as t were quite out of my body; and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water; but I recovered a little before the return oi
the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock,
and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave
went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at
first, being near land, I held my hold till the wav«
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought
me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it
went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to
carry me away: and the next run I took I got to the
main land, where to my great comfort I clambered
up the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of
the w«*Lar.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look up and thank God that my life was saved in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the life what the ectasies and transports of
the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out
of the very grave; and I do not wonder now at that
custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the hal-
ter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be
turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him: I say,
I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, tp
let hmi blood that very moment they tell him of it,
that the surprise may notodrive the animal spirits from
the heart, and overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe; reflect-
ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
• for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, an
two ihoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I coulc
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had «olaced my mmd * ith the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kino of place I was in, and what was next
to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful deliverance; for
[was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing
either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I
see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me, was, that T
had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs-
in a word, 1 had nothing about me but a knife, o
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my provision, and this threw me into terrible ago-
nies of mind, that for a while I run about like a mad-
man. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
heart to consider what would be my lot if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night
they always come abroad for their prey.
^ All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir,
out thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolv-
ed to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death I should die, for as jet I saw no prospect o/
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did,
to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so, as that if .1 should sleep, I might not fall,
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for
my defence, I took up my lodging, and having been
excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my
condition, and found myself the most refreshed with
it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather clean
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage ana
•well is before; but that which surprised me
was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from tm
sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, ana
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dash-
ing me against it; this being within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, T wished myself on board, that, at least
1 might save some necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree
I looked about me again, and the first thing I found
was the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had
tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore
to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of water
between me and the boat which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more
:ntent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a fresh
renewing of my grief: for 1 saw evidently, that if we
had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is t>
say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not hoc.
so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all com
fort and company, as I now was. This forced tear.*
from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in
tlrat, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I
pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to ex-
tremity, and took the water; but wh^n I came to the
ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to
get on board; for as she lay aground, and high out oi
the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay
fc>ld of. I swam round her twice, and the second
$me I espied a small piece of a rope, which I wonder
jd I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains
<o low as that with great difficulty I got hold of it,
and by the help of that rope got up into the fore-castl«r
tf the ship. Here I found tha> the snip was bulged,
and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she
It
lay soon the side of a bank of hard sand, or rathe/
sarth, and her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, am!
her head low almost to the water: by this means ah
her quarter was free, and aii that was in that part wa*
dry ; for you may be sure my first work was to search
and to sec what was spoileo and what was free ; and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were dr)
and untouched by the water; and being very well dis-
posed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled inv
pockets with bisket, and ate it as I went about othei
things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some
rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram,
and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now 1 wanted nothing bin
a boat to furnish myself with many tilings which 1
foresaw would be very necessary to me-
lt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was noi
to be had ; and this extremity roused my application
We had several spare yards, and two or three large
spars o( wood, and & spare topmast or two in the
ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung
as many of them overboard as 1 could manage ol
their weight, tying every one with a rope, that the>
might not drive away. When this was done 1 wem
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me 1 tied
four of them fest together at botli ends as well as 1
could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three
short pieces of plank upon them crossways, 1 found I
could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able
to bear any great weight, the pieces f)eing too light;
go I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut
a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to
my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains: but
hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encourag-
ed me to go beyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reason-
able'wcight; my next care was what to load it with,
and hnw to preserve what I laid upon it from the sm <
ot tne sea; but 1 was not long considering this: I firs
laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get,
and having considered well what I most wanted, 1
first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had
broken open and emptied, and lowered them down
upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provi-
sions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces
of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and
a little remainder of European com which had been
laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with
us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some
barley and wheat together, but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all above five or six gal-
lons of rack: these I stowed by themselves, there being
no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for
themP While I was doing this, 1 found the tide began
to flow, though very calm, and I had the mortification
t> see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had
left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my
hreeches, which were only linen, and open-knee'd, 1
swam on board in them and my stockings: however,
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I
found enough, but took no more than I wanted foi
present use, for I had other things which my eye was
more upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore;
and it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful
price to me, and much more valuable thai\ a ship-
Wding of gold would have been at that time: I goi
i» down to my raft, even whole as it was, without
fosing time to look into it, for I knew in general what
it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols: these I secured first, with some
powder homs, and a small bag of shot* and two old
rusty swards. I knew there were three barrels of
2
powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner
had stowed them; but with much search I found them,
two of them dry and good, the third had taken water,
those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to
think how I should get to shore with them, having
neither, sail, oar, or rudder, and the least capful of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea; 2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore; 3.
What little wind there was blew me towards the land:
and thus, having found two or three broken oars be-
longing to the boat, and besides the tools which were
in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer;
and with this cargo I put to sea : for a mile, or there-
abouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed
before, by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find
some creek or river there, which I might make use
of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
w^ll as I could to keep into the middle of the stream;
but here I had like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, 1 think verily would nave
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and
not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards thaf
end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests,
to keep them in their places, but could not thrust off
the raft with all my strength ; neither durst I stir from
the posture I was in, but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner near half an hour,
in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little more upon a level; and a little after, the water
still rising, my raft floated apain, and I thrust her oH
witn tne oar I had into the cnannel; and men driving
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong cur
rent or tide running up. 1 looked on both sides for
a pro|>er place to get to shore; for I was not willing
to lie driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to placo
myself as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore o
the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty,
guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that, reach-
ing ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly
in; hut here I had liked to have dipped all my cargo
in the sea again: for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to say sloping, there was no place to land, but
where one end of the float, if it run on shore, would
lie so high, and the oiher sink lower as before, that it
would endanger my cargo again : all that I could do,
was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping
the vaft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side
of it fast to the shore, near a flat |,icce of ground,
which I expected the water would flow over; and so
it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft
drew about a foot of water, I thurst her on upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her by sticking my two broken oars into the ground;
one on one side near one end, and one on the other
side near the other end ; and thus I lay till the water
ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe
on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek a
proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might hap
pen. Where I was I yet knew not; whether on thf
continent or on an island, whether inhabited or nd
inhabited, whether inidanger of wild beasts or not
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge from
it northward 1 took out cne of the fowling piecet^

and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top ol
that hill, where, after I had with great labour and
difficulty got to the top, I saw my fates to my great
affliction, viz. that I was in an island environed every
way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some
rocks which lay a great way off, and two small islands
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the
west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren;
and as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, ex-
cept by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none:
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their
kinds; neither when I killed them could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree
on the side of a great wood—1 believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there since the creation of the
world. 1 had no sooner fired, but from all parts ol
the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls
of many sorts, making a confused screaming, and cry-
ing every one according to his usual note; but not
one of them oi any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, f took it to be a kind of a hawk, its
colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons or
claws more than common; its flesh was carrion, and
fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, J came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore,
which took me up the rest of thnt day; and what to
do with myself at night I know not, nor indeed wheic
to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground,
not knowing but some wild beast might devour me;
though, as I afterwards found there was really no need
for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myselJ
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night1/*
lodging As for food, I yet saw not w.hieh way to
«upply myself, except that I had seen two or truer
creatures like nares run out of tne wood where 1 sho
the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would be use
ful to me, and particularly some of the rigging ant
sails, and such other things as might come to land
and I resolved to make another voyage-on board th<
vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the first storn
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart,, till I got even
thing out of the ship that I could get. Then I callcw
a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether i
should take back the raft; but this appeared imprac
ticable: so I resoived to go as before, when the tidi
was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my hut, having nothing on but a checker
shirt and a pair of linen trowsers, and a pair of pump4
•in my feet.
f got on board the ship, as before, and prepared r
second raft; and having had experience of the first,
neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so barf'
but yet I brought away several thing? very useful t<
me; as first, in the carpenter's stored 1 found two o
three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-iacl
a dozen or two of hatchets,' and above all, that mo:*
useful thing called a grindstone; all the.se I secured
together with several things belonging to the gunner
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrel-
of musket-bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-
piece, with some small quantity of powder more: a
large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
load; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist i-
up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, 1 took all the men's clothc»
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock
and some bedding; and with this I looted my sccow
raft, and brought them all safe on snore to my vert
great comfort.
I wa* under some apprehensions during my absence
from the land, that at least my urovisions might b*
devoured on shore; but when I came back, X four/d
r»c sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood
still; she sat very composed and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to he ac-
quainted with me; I presented my gun at her, but as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it., nor did she offer to stir away; upon
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way
I was not very free of it, for my store was not great.
however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to
it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked as pleased, for
more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more ,
so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though 1
was fain to open the barrels of rowder and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being lar^e
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent with
the sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled aii
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from
man or beast.
When 1 had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest *e,t
up an end without, and spreading'one of the beds
upon the ground, layim* my two pistols just at my
headland my gun at length by me, I went to bed for
the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for 1
was very weary and heavy, as the night before I had
s'lepl little, and had laboured very ban' all day, as wclJ
to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them
on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up', I believe, for one man; but I wate
not satisfied still: for while the ship sat upright in
hat posture, I thought I ought to get every thihg ou?
her thnt I could: so every dav at low water I went
on ooard, and brougnt away sometmng or other; out
particularly the third time 1 went, 1 brought away as
much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare
janvass, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,
and the barrel of wet gunpowder: in a word 1 brought
away all the sails first and last, only that I was fain
to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time a
I could; for they were no more useful tube sails, bo
as mere canvass only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last oi all, after I had made five or six such voyages »
as these, and thought 1 had nothing m&re to expect
from the ship that was worth my meddling with; 1
say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread,
and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flower; this was surpris-
ing to me because I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the wa-
ter: 1 soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and
wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails,
which 1 cut out: and in a word, I got all this safe on
shore also
The next day I made another voyage: and now,
iraving plundered the ship of what was portable and
fit to hand out, I began with the cabbs; * and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I
^ot two cables and a hawser on share, with all the
iron work 1 could get; and having cut down the sprit
#ail yard, and the mizen yard, and every thing 1 could
.o make a large raft, I loaded it with all those neavy
»oods, and came away: but my good luck began now
to leave me; for tins raft was so unwieldy and so
overladen, that after I had entered the little cove wnere
I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and
threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for
myself, it was no great harm, foT 1 was near the shore,
but as to my cargo, it was great part, of it lost, espe-
cially the iron, which I expected would have been a,
19
great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I
got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some o/
the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fain
to dip for it ir^o the water, a work which fatigued me
very much. After this, I went every day on board,
and brought away what 1 could get.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship; in which time
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but pre-
paring the twelfth time to go on board, F found the
wind began to rise; however at low water I went on
board, and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin
so effectually, as that nothing more could be found,
yet I discovered, a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors, and one pair o/
large scissars, with some ten ora dozen of good kniv> s
and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brasil,
some piraces of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O
drug!" said I, aloud, *• what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no not the taking off of trw
ground; one of those knives is worth all this hea;>; I
Lave no manner of use for thee; even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
life ie not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvass, I began to think of making another
raft, but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast, and the/wind began to rise, and in a quarter
of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It
presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pre-
tend to make a raft with the wind offshore, and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore
at all: accordingly I let myself down into the u ater
and swam across the channel which lay between the
ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of things 1 had about
me, and parly the roughness of the water, for the wind
rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water
it blew a storm.
But I was gotten nome to my little tent, where 1
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew
verp hard all that night, and in the morning when I
looked out behold no more ship was to be seen, f
was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this
satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no time, nor
abated no diligence to get every thing out of her that
could be useful to me, and that indeed there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had
more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, oi
of any thing out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of hei
afterwards did; but those things were of small use to
me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about se
curing myself against either savages, if any should ap
pear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island*} and 1
had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and
what kind of dwelling to make; whether I shouio
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth:
and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to giv?
an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my set-
tlement, particularly because it was upon a low moor-
ish ground near the sea, and I believed would not be
wholesome, and more particularly because there was
no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more
healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation which 1
found would be proper for me; 1 st, Health, and fresh
water, I just now mentioned. 2ndly, Shelter from the
keat of the sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous crea
lures, whether man or beast. 4thly, A view to the
sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might net
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was
not willing to banish all my expectation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that no-
thing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side of this rock there was hollow place worn a
little way in a like the entrance or door "f a cave, but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock
at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above
an hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and
lay like a green before my door, and at the end of it
descended irregularly every way down into the low
grounds by the sea-side. It was on the N. N. W. side
of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the sitting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before
(he hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its
semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its
diameter, ftom its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five foot and a half, and sharppened on
the top; the two rows did not stand above six inches
from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in
the ship, and laid them in rows one above another,
within the circle between these two rows of slakes, up
to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning
against them, about two foot and a half high, like a
spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that nei-
tner man or beast couH get into it or over it: this cost
me a great-deal of time and labour, especially to r-rt
the piles in the woods, bring them to the j.lace, and
drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by a
door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top: which
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me: and so
I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in
the night, which otherwise I could not have done,
though, as it appeared afterward, there was no need
of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehend-
ed danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above; and
I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me from
the rains, that in one part of the year are very violent
there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent, within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the upper-
most with a lage tarpaulin which 1 had saved among
the sails.
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which
[ had brought on shore but in a hammock, which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate oi
the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus
enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which
till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,
as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way in-
to the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that
I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them up with-
in my fence in the nature of a terrace, that so it rais-
ed the ground within about a foot and a half, and
thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which
served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour and many davs, before aft
these things were brought to perfection, and therefore
I must go back to some other things which took up'
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain fall"
ing from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of light
ning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder,
as J8 naturally the effect of it. I was not so much
surprised with the lightning, as I was with a thought
which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning
itself: O my powder! my very heart sunk within me,
when I thought, that atone blast all my powder might
be destroyed: on which, not my defence only, but
the providing me of food, as I thought, entirely de-
pended: I was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger; though, had the powder took fire, I had
never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that, after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building, and fortifying^ and applied myself to make
bags and boxes to separate the powder, and to keep
k a little and a little in a parcel, in hope, that, what-
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part fire another. I finished this work
in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds
weight, was divided in not less than a hundred par-
cels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not
apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my
new cave, which in my fancy I called my kitchen;
and the rest 1 hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very
carefully where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out once at least every day with my gun, as well to
divert myself, as to see if I could kiL any thing fit fo.
food, and as near as I could to acquaint myself with
what the island produced. The first time I went out
T presently discovered that there were goats in the
island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then
"t was attended with this misfortue to me. viz. thai
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, thai
it was the most difficult thing in the world to come ai
them. But I was not discouraged at this, not doubt-
ing but I might now and 'then shoot one, as ii
soon happened; for after 1 ha<f found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I observed,
if they saw me in the vallics, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright:
but if they were feeding in the vallies, and 1 was
upon, the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position of theii
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that the)
did not readily see objects that were above them; so
afterward I took this method; I always climbed the
rocks first to get above them, and then had frequent
ly a fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid
by her which she gave suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when tne old one fell, the kid stood
stock still by her till I came and took her up); and not
only so; but when I carried the old one with me upon
my shoulders, the Kid follow A me quite to my en-
closure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, ii.
hopes to have bred it up tame ; but it would not eat;
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. Theso
tw9 supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread espe-
cially) as much as possibly I could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in,
and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place; but
I must first give some little account of myself, and of
my thoughts about living, which it may well be sup-
posed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I
was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of the
course of our intendea voyage, and a great way, viz.
some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course
of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consi
der it as a determination of Heaven, that in this de-
solate place, and in this desolate manner, I should
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face when I made these reflections; and some-
times I would expostulate with myself, why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin his creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, so without help
abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and parti-
cularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand by
the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject of
my present condition, when reason, as it were, ex- 
postulating with me t'other way, thus: ** Well, you
are in a desolate condition, His true, but pray remem-
ber, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten ? Why
were they not saved and you lost? Why were you
singled out? Is it better to be here or there ?" And
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be consi-
dered with the good that is in them, and with what
vorse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was fur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been
my case if it had not happened, which was a hun-
dred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the
place where she first struck, and was driven so near
the sh^re that I had time to get all these things out oi
her. What would have been my case, if I had been
to have lived in the condition in which I at first came
on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to
supply and procure them? "particularly," said J,
loud (though to myself), "what should I have done
w:thout a gun, without ammunition, without any tools
to make any thing, or to work with ; without clothes,
adding, a teiit, or any manner of covering ?" and
that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a man-
ner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition
was spent; so that I had a tolerable view of subsist-
ing, without any want, as long as I lived; for I con-
sidered from the beginning how I should provide for
the accidents that might happen, and for the time
hat was to come, even not only after myxrammuni
ion should be spent, but even after my^healtho
trcngth should decay.
I confess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my
powder being blown up by lightning, and this made
the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it light
ened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order, It
was, by my account, the 30th of September, when, in
the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun being, to r», in its autum-
nal equinox, was almost just over my head, for I |
reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude'
of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts, that I should lese my reckon-
ing ofltime for want of books, and pen and ink, and
should even forget the sabbath days from the working
days, but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon
a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a
great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first land-
ed, viz " I came on shore here on the 30th of Sep.
ternber 1659." Upon the sides of this square post, I
ait every day a notch with my knife, and every se-
venth notch was as long again as the rest, and every
first day of the month as long again as that long one;
and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among
21
tne many things which I brought out of the ship in the
•everal voyages, which, as above mentioned, I made
to it, f got several things of less value, but not all less
useful to me, which I omitted setting down before ,
as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcel*
iu the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenters keep
ing, three or four compasses, some mathematical in-
struments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of
navigation ; all which I huddled together, whether 1
•night want them or no. Also I found three very good
Bibles, which came 10 me in my cargo from England,
and which I had packed up among my things; some
Portuguese books also, and among them two or three
popish prayer-books, and several other books; all
which 1 carefully secured. And 1 must not forget,
that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose
eminent history I may have occasion to say something
.in its place: for I carried both the cats with me; and
as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himsell,
and swam on shore to me the day after i went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant tc
me many years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch
me, nor any company that he could make up to me;
I only wanted to have him talk toPme, but that he
could not do. As I observed before, I found pen,
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost:
and T shall show, that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone I could not,
for f could not make any ink by any means that I
could devise.
And this put me in mind that 1 wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and
of these, this of ink was one, as also spade, pickaxe,
»nd shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread. As for linen, I soon learnt to want that
without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habita
*inn; the piles or stakes, which were as heavy as*
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of those posts, and athird day
in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I
got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethoughi
myself of one of the iron crows, which however,
though f found it, yet it made driving those posts oi
piles very laborious and tedious work.
But what need 1 have been concerned at the tedi-
ousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time
enough to do it in? Nor had 1 any other employment
if that had been over, at least that 1 could foresee,
except the ranging the island to seek for iood, which
I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave thein to any that were/to come after me, for I
was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind ; and as my reason began now to master my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and to set the good against the evil that I might
have something to distinguish my case from worse;
and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and cre-
ditor the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I
suffered, thus

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
diat there was scarce any condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative or some
£hing positive to be thankful for in it; and let this
stand as a direction from the experience of the mo6t
miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from,
ind to set, in the description of good and evil, on tha
credit side of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given over looking out to sea, to see
iff could spy a ship; I say, giving over'lhese things,
T began to appdy myself to accommodate my way o/
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
x nave already described my naoitation, wnicn wa-s
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a
strong pale «f posts and cables : hut I might now ra-
ther call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against
it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside; and
after some time, I think it was a year and half, 1
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made
behind me: but I must observe too that at first this
was a confused heap of goods, which as they lav in no
order, so they took up all my place: I had no room
to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave,
and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose
sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 1 be-
stowed on it; and so when I found I was pretty safe
as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right
hand into the rock ; and then, turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door^to
come out, on the outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were
a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, bi.i
gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was not
<ble to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; 1
could not write or eat, or do several things with so
much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe,
hat as reason is the substance and original of the ma-
thematics, so by stating and squaring every thing by
reason, and by making the most rational judgment ol
tli mgs, every man may be in time master ofevery
mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life,
and yet in time, by labour, application, and contriv-
ance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could

have maf5e it, especially if I had had tools; however,
I made abundance of things, even without tools, and
some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and
that with infinite labour: for example, if I wanted a
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set
it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
piank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is
true, by this method I could make but one board out
of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any more than I had for the prodigious
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make
a plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place; and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft
from the ship: but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half one over another, all along one
aide of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
work, and in a word, to separate every thing at large
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I
knocked pieces in the wall of the lock to hang my
guns and all things that would hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such or-
der, and especially to find my stock of all necessa-
ries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in
too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to labour,
but in too much discomposure of mind, and my
journal would have been full of many dull things
For examp e I must have said thus: Sept. the 30th.
after I got to shore, and had escaped drowning, in
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of sail
water which was gotten into my stomach, and reco-
vering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing
my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming
at my misery, and crying out, 1 was undone, undone;
till tired and faint I was forced to lie down on the
ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of be-
ing devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on board
the ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet 1
could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes of seeing a
ship.; than fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail;
please myself with the hopes of it; and then after
looking steadily till I was almost Blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus in-
crease my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some mea-
sure, and having settled my household-stuff and ha-
bitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars ovei
again) as long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, 1
was forced to leave \i off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659.
- POOR miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship
I- wrecked, during a dreadful storm in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the Island of Despair; all the rest of
the ship's company being drowned, and myself al-
most dead. .
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting mvsell
•t the dismal circumstances 1 was Drought to w
had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, orplace to
fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but
death before rm?, either that I should be devcured by
wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.
October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and was
driven on shore again much nearer the island ; which
as it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing he*
sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the
wind abated, I might get on board, and get some
food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so on
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who I imagined, if we had all staid on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that they
would not have been all drowned, as they were; and
that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, 1
went upon the sand as near as I could, and then
swam on board. This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all
I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore,
every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in
these days, though with some intervals of fair wea-
ther: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got up upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things oeing chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some
gusts of wind; during which time the ship broke in
pieces, the wind blowing a hVtle harder than before,
w-id was no more to be seen, except the wreck of h«r,
ana tnat only at low water. I spent this day in
covering and scouring the goods which I had saved*
that rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from any attack in the night,
either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I
fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked
out a semicircle for my encampment, which I resolv-
ed to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification
made of double piles, lined within with cable, and
without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st in tbe morning I went out into the island
with my gun, to see for some food, and discover tho
country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid fol-
lowed me home, which I afterwards killed also, be-
cause it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as \
could with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them
formed a fence round me, a little within the place!
had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the
afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and
ime of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain,
then employed myself to work till about eleven
o'clock, then ate what I had to live on, and from
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessive hot, and then in the evening to work again
Uie working part of this day and of the next wert
23
Wholly employed in making my table, for I was yet
fcut a very sorry workman, though time and necessity
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as
* believe it would do any one else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad witb my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft,
b t her flesh good for nothing, every creature I killed
took off the skins and preserved them. Comity
ack by the sea-shore I saw many sorts of sea-fowls
which I did not understand; but was surprised ai,^
almost frighted with two or three seals, which, whilr
I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,
got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to my
liking; nor was it long before 1 learnt to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
llth was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable
«lia pe, but never to please me; and even in the making
I pulled it in pieces several times. Note, I soon neg-
l Jcted my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for
tiem on my post, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was accom-
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as
soon as it was over I resolved to separate my stock of
powder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger.
Nov, 14,15,16. These three days I spent in making
ttle square chests or boxes, which might hold about
pound, or two pound, at most, of powder; and so
utting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure
tid remote from one another as possible. On one
of these three days I killed a large bird that wa^
good to eat, hut I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day 1 began to dig behind my ten
mio the rock, to make room for my farther conveni.
ency. iVote, Three things I wanted exceedingly for
this work, viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheel-bar-
row or oasket; so I desisted from my work, and be-
gan to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools : as for a pickaxe, I made use of the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade
this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I couU
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind o
one to make I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods 1
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the
Brasils they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hard-
ness : of this, with great labour and almost spoiling
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home too with
difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for f worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly
shaped lHce ours in England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long; however, it served well enough for
the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never
was a shovel, I helieve, made after this fashion, or
so long a making.
I was still deficient, for T wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow; a basket 1 could not make by any
mean6, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could make
all but the wheel, but that 1 had no notion of neither
did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no pos-
sible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle
or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and
so for carrying away the earth which I dug ontofth*
cave, I made me a thing lik©>\ hod which the labour-
ers ^arry mortar in, when tbr eejrve the bricklayers
This was not so difficul; f* me as the making the
•hove!; and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took
me up no less than four days, I mean always except-
ing my morning \?alk with my gun, which I seldom
failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home
something to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood stili,
because of my making these tools, when they wer
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days en-
tirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note, During all this time, I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as
a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar: as for my lodging, I kept to the tent,
except that sometimes in the wet season of the year,
it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry,
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags
and large leaves of trees like a thatch.
Dec. 10. 1 began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made ii
too large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the
top and one side, so much that in short it frighted ine,
and not without reason too; for if 1 had been under
it I had never wanted a gravedigger. Upon this dis-
aster I had a great deal of work to do over again ; for
I had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was oi
more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that
1 might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to
the t^p, with two pieces of boarus across over each
post; this F finished the next day; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a weelcmore I had the
roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part off my house.
Dec. 17. From this dav to the twentieth T placed
sneives, ana Kiiocitea up nails on the posts to hang
every thing up that could be hung up: aid now J
began to be in some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me:
also 1 made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day ; no stir
ring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much colder than
before and pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I caught it, and led it home in a string ;*when
I had it home, I bound and splintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B. I took such care of it that
it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might
have food when my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; so that
there was n > stirring abroad, except in the evening
for food. This time I spent in putting all my things
hi order within doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle oi
the day. This evening, going farther into the vallies,
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found
there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy and
hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if I
could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day 1 went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mis-
taken, for they all faced about upon the dog; and he
knew his danger too well, for he would not come
near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
till jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I re-
solved to make very thick and strong.'
N. B. This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said, in the Journal; it
is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time
than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle from
one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hinder-
ing me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together;
but I thought I should never be perfectly secure until
this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible what
inexpressible labour every thing was done with, espe-
cially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving
them into the ground, for I made them much bigger
than 1 need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and *he outside double
fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it, 1 per-
suaded myself that if any people were to come on
shore there, they would not perceive any thing like a
habitation; and it was very well 1 did so< as may be
observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent discoveries in these walks of something
or other to mv advantage; particularly I found a kind
of wild pigeons, who built not as wood pigeons in a
tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the hole* of the
rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so \ but when they grew
older they flew away, which perhaps at first was for
want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them;
however, I frequently found their nests, and got theii
young ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affa.rs,!
found mvself wanting in manv things, which »
thought at first it was impossible 4br me to mane, ai
indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, I
could never make a cask to be hooped; I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but 1 could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it; I could neithei
put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one
another as to make them hold water: so I gave that
over also.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle
so that as soon as ever it. was dark, which was gene-
rally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed: 1
remembered the lump of bees-wax with which 1
made candles in my African adventure, but 1 had
none of that now; the only remedy I had, was, thai
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with
a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun.
to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me
a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear
steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my
labours it happened, that, rummaging my things, 1
found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been
filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this
voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship camo
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had been
in the,bag, was all devourded with the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use, 1 think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear o!
the lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks ol
com out of it on one side of my fortification under
the rock.
it was a little before the great rains, just now men
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of any thing, and not .so much as remembering that I
jiad thrown any thing there ; when about a month
after or thereabout, I saw some few stalks of some
thing green shooting out of the ground, which I fan
cied might be some plant I had not seen ; but I wa*
iurprised and perfectly astonished, wbeu after a lktk
longer time 1 saw about ten or twelve cars come out,
which were perfect green barley of the same kind as
our European, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
nead, or had entertained any sense of any thing that
nad befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as
we lightly say, what pleases God ; without so much a«
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,
ar his order in governing events in the world; hut
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which 1
knew was not proper for com, and especially that 1
knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely,
and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sus-
tenance on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and 1 began to bless myself, that
such a progidy of nature should happen upon my ac-
count; and this was the more strange to me, because
I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock,
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support, but not doubting but thai
there was more in the place, I went all over that part
of the island, where I had been before, preping in
every comer and under every rock to see for more of
it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred to my
thought, that I had sh< ok a bag of chicken's meat out
in that place, and then tn* wonder began to cease;
and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to
God's providence began to abate too upon discovering
iliat all this was nothing hut what was common;
though I ought tohav*. -ecu as thankful for so strange
ind i nforeseen a nrn» *wce as if it had been miracu-
lous: loi it was really the work of Piovidence us
me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve grain*
of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats had de-
coyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from
heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in thai
particular place, where, it being in the shade of a
high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas if I
had thrown it anj where else at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure
in theii season, which was about the end of June, and
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all
again, hoping in time to hajc some quantity sufficient
to supply me with bread; but it was not till the
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain
of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I
shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost, all that I
sowed the first season, by not observing, the propc*
time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, s^
that it never came up at all, at least not as it wouli
have done: of which in its place.
Besides this barley there were, as above, twenty c i
thirty stalks of rice which 1 preserved with the satin?
care, and whose use was of the same kind or to tlit
same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or radio
food: for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also after some time. But to retdro
to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closei
it up contriving to go into it, not by a door but ovet
the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign in
the outside of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went tip with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after mc,
and let it down on the inside: this was a complete
enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finuhed. J
25
bad almost had all my labour overthrown at once, aim] it continued raining all that night, and great part ot
myself killed ; the case was thus: As I was busy in| be next day, so that I could not stir abroad; out my
the inside of it behind my tent, just in the entrance mind being more composed, I began to think ot what
into my cave, I was terribly frightened with a moti J had best do, concluding that if the island was sub-
dreadful surprising thing indeed; for on a sudden 1
found the earth come crumbling down from the roo
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my
head and two of the posts 1 had set up in the cave
cracked in a frightful manner; I was heartily scared
but thought nothing of what was really the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave, was falling in
as some of it had done before; and for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran foiward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall
for fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected
might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stopt
down upon the firm ground, but 1 plainly saw it was
jcct to these earthquakes, there would be no living for

some little hut in an open place, which I might sur-
round with a wall as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men: but conclud-
ed, if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent
from the place wnere it stood, which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent. And I spent the two next days, being the 19th
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to

April 22. The next morning I begaH to consider of
means to put this resolve in execution, but I was at a
great loss about my tools. I had three large axes and
for some time, 1 began to take courage, and yet i nae . abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for
not heau enough to get over my wall again, for fear
of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground,
greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what
to do. All this while I had not the least serious reli-
gious thought, nothing but the common "Lord have
mercy upon me,!" and when it was over, that went
awav too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that the wind
rose by little and little, so that in less than half an
hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the sea was
all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth,
the shore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were jorn up by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was; and this held about three hours, and
then began to abate, and in two hours more it was
stark calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came into
my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the con-
sequence of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was
spent and over, and I might venture into my cave
again; with this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in
and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so violent,
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it;
and I was forced to go into my cave, though very
much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my
head.
The violent rain forced me into a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to
lot water go out, which would else have drowned my
cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow,
I began to be more composed; and now, to support
my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went
to my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which
however I did then and always very sparingly, Vnow
iflg I could lave no more when that was gone.
trafic with the Indians): but with much chopping
and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of
notches and dull; and though I had a grindstone, J
could not turn it and grind my tools too: this cost me
as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the
life and death of a man. At length I contrived a
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I
might havo both my hands at libeity. JVbre, I had
never seen any such thing in England, or at least not
to take notice how it was done, though since I have
observed it was very common there; besides that my
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it and re-
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking toward the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask;
when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or
three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I examin-
ed the barrel which was driven on shore, and soo&
found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present,
and went on upon the sand as near as I could to the
wreck of the snip, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed; the forecastle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six foot; and the stern,
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest

ing her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one
side, and the sand was thrown so high on that side
next her stem, that whereas there was a great place oi
water before, so that 1 could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake : and as by this vio-
lence the ship was more broken open than formerly
so many things came daily on shore, which the set
had loosened, and which tho winds and water rolled
by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; and I busied mysell
mightily, that day especially, in searching whether 1
could make any way into the ship; but I found no-
thing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the
inside of the ship was choked up with sand: however
as I learnt not to despair of any thing, I resolves
to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding, that every thing I could gel from her
would be of some use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, wnich I thought held some of the upper
part or quarter-deck together, and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as F could
from the side which lay highest; but the tide coining
in, I was obliged to give over for that time. |
May. 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat ol, cilJ I was weary of my sport";
when just going to leave off, 1 caught a young dolphin.
I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I
had no hooks, yet 1 frequently caught fish enough, as
much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun,
and ate them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and. made swim on
shore when the tide of flood came on.
Mav 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work,
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent
no;.- to work, but found the weight of the wreck had
broke itself down, the beams being cut, that several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside
of the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but
almost full of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand; 1 wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with tne tide •
1 lelf the iron crow in the wreck for next. day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could
not break them up: I felt also tjie roll of English
lead, ai.d could stir it, but it was too heavy tb remove.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went evury day to thr
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, and
boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight oil
iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing th«
edge of one hatchet and driving it with the other;
but as it lay about a foot arid a half in the water, I
could not make any blow to (hive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I staid so'long in the woods to get pigeon*
for food, that the tide prevented me going to the
wreck that day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a great distance, near two miles, off me, bu
resolved to see what they were, and found it was a
piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some tiling*
much with the crow, that the first flowing tick
several cases float*d out, and two of the seamen's
rhests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing
came to land that day but pieces of limber, and a
hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the
salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
oxcept the time necessary to get food, which 1 always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it
was ebbed out; and by this time I had gotten timber,
and plank, and iron-work enough to have built a good
boat, if if had known how; and also I got at several
times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight
of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise or turtle: this was the first I had seen,
which it seems was only my misfortune, not any de-
fect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to
be on the other side of the island, I might have had
hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards;
but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.
J une 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time
the most savory and pleasant that ever I lasted in my
life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since
I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was notusual.in that
latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold. ^
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in mv
feead, and feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with tho
Apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and
no help. Prayed to God for the first time since the
storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why;
\ny thoughts beinc all ;onfused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful appre
hensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent headach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it
June. 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however
[ killed a she goat, and with much difficulty got i
home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I would fain
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay abed
all day, and neither ate or drank. . I was ready to
perish for thirst, but so weak I had not strength to stanJ
up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to
God again, but was light-headed ; and when 1 was not
I was so ignorant, that 1 knew not what to say ; only
[ lay and cried, u Lord look upon me! Lord pity
me, Lord have mercy upon me!" I suppose I did
nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing
off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night;
when I wakd, I found myself much refreshed, but
weak, and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had no
water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second
sleep I had this terrible dream.
I thought that I was sitting on the ground on tho
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, an
light upon the ground. He was all over as b/igbt a
a flame, so that I could but just bear to look toward
him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dread-
ful, impossible for words to describe; when he step-
ped upon the ground with his feet I thought the earth
trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake,
and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it had
Decn filled with fl<whe» o' fire.
27
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but na
moved forwards towards me, with a long spear 01
weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible te-
express the terror of it; all that I can say I under-
stood was this, "Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at
which words I thought he lifted up the spear that wai
in his hand to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this account, will ex*
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors oi
my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even while
it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors;
nor is it any more possible to describe the impression
that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.
I had, alas .' no divine knowledge; what I had re
ceived by the good instruction of my father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years,
of seafaring wickedness, &nd a constant conversation
with nothing but such as were, like myself, wicked
and profane to the last degree. I do not remember
that I had in all that time one thought that so much
as tended either to looking upwards toward God, or
inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways.
But a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good,
or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me,
and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be
supposed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God
in deliverance.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when T shall add,
that through all the variety of miseries that had to
this day befallen me, I never had so much as one
thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a
iust punishment for my sin, my rebellious behavioui
aaains* my father, or my present sins, which weri
great; or so much as a punishment for the general
course of my wicked life. When I was on the despe-
rate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I nevei
had so much as one thought of what would become oj
of me; or one wish to God to direct me whither 1
should go, or to keep me from the danger which ap-
parently surrounded me, as well from voracious crea-
tures as cruel savages; but I was merely thoughtless
of a God, or a Providence, acted like a mere brute
from the principles of nature, and by the dictates oi
common sense only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by thi
Portugal captain, ^vell used, and dealt justly and ho-
nourably with,:as well as charitably, I had not the
least thankfulness on my thoughts. "When again 1
was shipwrecked ruined and in danger, ol drowning
on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking
on it as a judgment; I only said to myself often, that
I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always
miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ships crew drowned, and myself spared, I was
surprised with a kind of extasy, and some transports
of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might
have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where
it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I
may say, being glad I was alive, without the leas!
reflection upon thedistinguishinggoodnessof the Hand
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to
be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or an
nquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me; even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe on
jshore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is
over; and all the rest of my life was li.ke it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this
dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, outol
all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as sooi
«s I saw but a prospect of living and that I should
not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my
affliction wore off, and I began to be very easy, ap-
plied myself to the works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted
at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or ai
the hand of God against me: these were thought?
»vhich very seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
ournal, had at first some little influence upon me, and
oegan to affect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon
as ever that part of thought was removed, all the im-
pression which was raised from it wore off also, as I
nave noted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing can be more
terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing
to the invisible Power which alcnie directs such things;
yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the im-
pression it had made went off also. I had no more
sense of God or his judgments, much less of the pre-
sent affliction of my circumstances being from his
hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous con-
dition of life.
But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself be-
fore me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of strong distemper, and nature was exhaust-
ed with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach
myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently,
by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of
God xo lay me under uncommon strokes, and to dea
with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second of
third day of my distemper, and in the violence, a§
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience, extorted some words from me like pray-
ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires, or with hones: it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress, my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable
condition, raised vapours into my head with the mere
apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my soul, I
knew not what my tongue might express: but it was
rather exclamation, such as, " Lord ! what a misera
le creature am I ! If I should be sick, I shall cer-
ainly die for want of help, and what will become of
me •" Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could
say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind; and presently his prediction, which I
mentioned in the beginning of this story, viz. that if I
did take this foolish step, God would not bless me,
and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon hav-
ing neglected his counsel, when there might be none
to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I aloud,
"my dear father's words are come to pass: God's
justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
hear me: I rejeeted the voice of Providence, which
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of lifo
wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I
would neither see it myself, nor learn to know the
blessing of it from my parents; 1 left them to mourn
over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the
consequences of it; 1 refused their help and assist-
ance who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and now I
have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, "Lord be
my help, for I am in great distress. I"
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
Jhad made for many years. But I return to my
journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit oemg entirely off, 1
got up ; and though the fright and terror of my dream
was very great, yet I considered, that the fit of the
ADVENTTTRES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
ague would return again the next day, ana now wai
my time to get something to refresh and support my-
self when I should be ill; and the first thing I did,
I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set
it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take
off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very
little. I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my mi-
serable condition, dreading the return of my distem.
per the next day. At night I made my supper of
three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashe's,
and ate, as we call it, in the shell ; and this was the
first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to,
even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found my
self so weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for I
never went out without that): so 1 went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me:
What is the earth and sea of which I have seen so
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and
brutal? whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that.
Then it followed most naturally: it is God that
has made it all: well, but then it came on strangely;
if God has made all these things, he guides and gov-
erns them all, and all things that concern them; for
the Being that could make all things, must certainty
have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, cither without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful condi-
tion: and if nothing happens without his appointment,
he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me
with the greater force, that it must needs be, that God
had appointed this to befal me; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he
having the sole power, not of me only, but of every
thing that happened in the world. Immediately il
followed.
Why has God done this to me? What have I-done
to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that inqui-
ry, as if I had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to
me like a voice ; u Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou
hast done ? look back upon a dreadful mispent life,
and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? ask, why is
it. that thou wert not long ago destroyed? why wert
thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the
fight when the ship was taken by the Sallce man of
war? devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of
Africa ? or drowned here, when all the crew perished
Dut thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done?"
I was struck with these reflections as one astonish-
ed, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to
myself; but rose up pensive and sad, walked back
to'my retreat and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began
to be dark. Now as the apprehensions, of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thought that the Brasilians take no physic but
their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had a
piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which
*as quite cured, and some also that was green, and
not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this
©best I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened
Uhe cnesc, ana touna what I looked for, viz. the to-
bacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too,
I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned be-
fore, and which, to this time, I had not found leisure,
or so much as inclination, to look into; I say L took
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me
to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not is to
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no ;'
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
volved it should hit one way or other: I first took a
piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been much
used to it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour*
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose oi
it when I lay down ; and lastly, I burnt some upon a
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke
-jf it, as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat
'is the virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible,
Mnd began to read; but my head was too much dis-
turbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at
lhat time; only having opened the book casually, the
fisrt words that occurred to me were these: ** Call on
me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver, and thou
ihalt glorify me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards; for as for being delivered, the word had no
sound as I may say, to me, the thing was so remote,
so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I
began to say as the children of Israel did, when they
were promised flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table
in the wilderness ?" So I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from tins place? And as it was not
for many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed
very often upon my thoughts: but, however, tha
fiords .made a very great impression upon me, and J
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much,
that 1 inclined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burn-
ing in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night and went to bed; but before I lay down, I did
what I never had done in all my life: I kneeled down,
and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that
ifl called upon him in the day,or trouble, he would
deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer'
was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped
the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the to-
bacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down. Imme-
diately upon this I went to bed, and I found presently
it flew up into my head violently ; 'but I fell into a
sound sleep, and waked no more, till by the sun it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon
the next day; nay, to this hour I am partly of the
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and
till almost three the day after; forptherwise I knew
not bow I should lose a day out of my reckoning in
the days of the week, as it appeared some years after
t had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than a day;
but in my account it was lost, and I never knew
which way.
Be that however one way or other; ,when I awak-
ed, I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my
spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up, I wa9
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better; for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit
the next day, but continued much altered for the bet-
ter: this was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far: I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
flrand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them : so I ate some more of the
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I
renewed the medicine which I had supposed did ma
£Ood the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum j
29
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew
any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;
however, I was no so well the next day, which was
the 1st of July, as I hoped I should have been; for 1
had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.
Jnly 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for some weeks after.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran
exceedingly upon this scripture, " I will deliver thee;"
and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much
upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it: but as
I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it oc-
curred to my mind, that I pored so much upon my
deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregard-
ed the deliverance I had received ; and I was, as it
were, made to ask myself such questions as these;
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
from sickness? from the most distressed condition
that could be, and that was so frightful to me? and
what notice had I taken of it? had I done my part?
God had delivered me; but / had not glorified him:
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for
that as a deliverance; and how could 1 expect greater
deliverance?
This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and, be
ginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to
read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more/deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past
life; the impression of my dream revived, and the
words, " All these things have not brought thee- to re
pentance," ran seriously in my thoughts: I was ear-
hestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it
happened providentially the very day, that, reading
the Scripture, I came to these words, " He is exalted
a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to
give remission." I threw down the book, and with
**.y heart as well as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a
kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus,
thou Son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me repentance I"
This was the first time that I could say, in the true
sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; foi
now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with
a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the encou-
ragement of the word of God; and from this time, I
may say, I began to have hope thatGod would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, "Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before; for
then I had no notion of any thing being called deli
verance, but my being delivered from the captivity 1
was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that
in the worst sense in the world; but now I learnt to
take it in another sense. Now I looked back upon
my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
bo dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God, but
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all
ipy comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing;
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, oi
think of it; it was all of no consideration in com-
parison of this; and I added this part here, to hint to
whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a
true sense of things, theyj will find deliverance from
sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from
affliction.
But leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not lest
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier te
my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a con
stant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of com-
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of: also
as my health and strength returned, I bestirred my-
self to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted,
a«l make my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand a
little and a little at a time, as a man that was gather-
ing up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hard-
ly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weak-
nesi I was reduced. The application which I made
use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had
never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend
it to any one to practise by this experiment; and
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed
to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time.
1 learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rdiny season wast the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes
of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry season
was always most accompanied with such storms, so I
found this rain was much more dangerous than the
rain which fell in September and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from this con-
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habi-
tation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island,
and to see what other productions I might find, which
yet I knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the
Lreek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
ubore. I found, after I came about two miles up, thai
tne tide did not flow any higher, and that it was n«
more than a little brook of running water, and very
fresh and good: but this being the dry season,.there
was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not
enough to run into any stream, so as it could be
perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts of them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup-
posed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of to-
bacco,- green, and growing to a great and very strong
stalk; there were divers other plants which I had no
notion of, or understanding about; and might perhaps
have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not
then understand them : I saw several sugar-canes, but
wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I con-
tented myself with these discoveries for this time, and
came back, musing with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the
fruitsor plants which I should discover, but could bring
it to no conclusion ; for in short, I had made so little
observation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew
little of the plants of the field, at least very little that
might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
done the day before, I found the brook and the sa-
vannas began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground
in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the clus-
ters of grapes were' just now in their prime, very ripe
and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was
exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my ex-
perience to eat sparingly of them, remembering, that

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
frlien I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grape;
killed several of our Englishmen who were slaves
•here, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but 1
iound an excellent use for these grapes, and that was
to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried
grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be,
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agree^le
to eat when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to
my habitation, which by the way was the first night,
as I might say, I had lain from home. In the night 1
took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree,
where I slept well, and the next morning proceeded
upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, as 1
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still
due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north
side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west; and
a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the
side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due
east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, sc
flourishing, every thing being in a constant verdure oi
flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden.
X descended a little on the side of that delicious val-
ley, surveying itwith a secret kind of pleasure (though
mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to think that this
was all my own, that I was king and lord of all this
country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession;
and if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance^
as completely as any lord of a manor in England. 1
saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon,
and citron-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any
fruit; at least, not then: however the green limes that
I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and 1 mixed their juice afterwards with
water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool
and refreshing.
I found now T had business enough to gather and
earry home; and resolved to lav un a store, as wtfttflf
grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the
wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In-order to do this I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and
& great parcel of limes and lemons in another place;
and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home-
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag o
sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home
Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour
ney, I came home (so I must now call my tent, and
my cave 0 but before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest.
But I was surprised when coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and abun-
dance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there
were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had
done this; but what they were I knew not.
However; as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no canying them away in a sack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the other
way they would be crushed with their own weight, 1
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches-
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness of thai
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the secu-
rity from storms on that side of the water, and,the
wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part oi
the countrv. Upon the whole, I began to conside*
ot removing my habitation, ana to look out for a
plac« equally safe as where I now was situated, if
possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness o*
the place tempting me: but when I came to a neare*
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea
side, where it was at least possible that something
might happen to my advantage, and that the same ill
fate that brought me hither, might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it
was scarce probable that any such thing should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and
woods, in the centre of the island was to anticipate
my bondage, and to render such an affair not only
improbable, but impossible; and that therefore 1
ought not by any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place, that
T spent much of ,my time there for the whole remain-
ing part of the month of July; and though, upon se-
cond thoughts, I resolved as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surround-
ed it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled
between with brushwood ; and here I lay very secure,
sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before ; so that I fancied now
t had my country house, and my sea-coast house:
and this work took me up the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation : for though I had
made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail,
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of
an hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower and began to enjoy myself. The
3d of August I found the grapes I had hung up were
perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisint
of the sun; so I began to take them down from tne
trees, and it was very happy that I did so; for the
rains which followed would have spoiled them, and 1
nad lost the best part of my winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No soonex
had I taken them all down, and carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from
thence, which was the 14th of August, it rained mor
or less every day, till the middle of October; an
sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out o
my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family: I had been concerned for* the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
vas I thought, had been dead; and 1 heard no more
tale or tidings of her, till to my astonishment she came
home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because though 1
had killed a wild cat as I called it, with my gun, yet
I thought it was a quite different kind from our Euro-
pean cats; yet the young cats were the same kind of
house breed like the old one; and both my cats being
females, I thought it very strange: but from these
three cats I afterwards came to be so pestered with
cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, oi
wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much
aspossible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain,
so that 1 could not stir, and was now very careful not
co be much wet. In this confinement I began to be
straitened for food; hut venturing out twice, I one
day killed a goat: and the last day, which was tie
26th, found a very large tortise which was a treat to
me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate a bunch
of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my
great misforune, I had no vessel to boil or stew any
thing ;j and two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the ram,
1 worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
31
ci
cave, and, b/ degrees, worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence 0/
vr-dll; and so I came in and out this way: but I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had.
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure,
whereas now I thought I lay exposed; and yet 1
could not perceive that there was any living thing to
fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon th
island being a goat.
September the 30th. I was now come to the
unhappy anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious exer-
cise, prostrating myself to the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing myself to God ac-
knowledging his righteous judgment upon me, and
raying to him to have mercy on me, through Jesus
Shrist^ and having not tasted the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, 1
1 then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and
went to bed, finishing the day as 1 began it
I had all this time observed no sabbath-day; for as
*t first f had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had
after some time omitted to distinguish the weeks, by
tiaking a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-
jay, and so did not really know what any of the days
were; but now, having cast up the days as before, i
feund I had been there a year; so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath;
though I found at the end of my account I had lost
* day or two of my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me and so 1
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum oJ
other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now f
appear regular to me, and 1 learnt to divide tnem so
as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all
my experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate, was one of the most discouraging expe.riments
that I made at all. I have mentioned, that I had saved
the few ears of bailey and rice which I had so sur-
prisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves,
and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, aiu
about twenty of barley: and now I thought it a pro-
per time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its
southern position going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as
I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into
two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was sowing, it
casually occurred to my thought, that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was
the proper time for it; so I sowed about two thirds of
the seeds, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that T did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to any thing; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
at all, till the wet season had come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moistei
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I due
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to wfiter it, sprung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very good crop; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of
eacl. kind.
But by this experience T was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper seaww
was to sow; and that I might expect two seea-times,
and two harvests, every year.
While this corn was growing, T made a little disco-
very, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to set-
tle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where
though I had not been some months, yet I found all
hings just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that 1 had made, was not only firm and entire,
but the stakes which 1 had cut off of some trees that
«rew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches, as much as a willow tree usually
shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow: and I pruned them, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
it is scarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew
into in three years; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diaineter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
cinder all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round
my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling, which I
did; and placing ike trees or stakes in a double row,
at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my
habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also,
as I shall observe in its order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as
in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the ge* •
neral observation 1 made. After 1 had found, by
experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provision be-
fore-hand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and
I sal within doors as much as possible during the wet
months.
In this time I found much employment, (and very
suitable also to the time) for I found great occasion
of many things which I had no way to furnish myself
with, but by hard labour and constant application ,
particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when
1 was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at
a basket maker's in the town where my father lived,
to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, aa
boys usually are, very officious to help, and a grea
observer of the manner how they worked those things,
and sometimes lent an hand, I had by this means so
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
miiv.i, that the twigs of that tree from whence 1 cut
, ;nv stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
•wallows, and willows, and osiers, in England; ano
\ resolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my country-
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smallei
twigs, 1 found them to my purpose as much as I could
desire; whereupon 1 came the next time prepared
with an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 1 soon
found, for there was a great plenty of them: these 1
set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and when
they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave ; and
here during the next season I employed myself in
making (as well as I could) a great many baskets,
both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing.
as I had occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently service-
able for my purpose; and thus afterwards 1 took care
never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware
decayed I made more; especially I made strong deep
baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I.
should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered thfs difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, ii
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets,
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bot-
tles, some of the common size, and others which
.were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any
thing in, except a great kettle which I saved out of
the ship, and which was too big for such uses as 1
desired it for, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have'
had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for
ma to make one; however, I found a contrivance
for that too at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of
takes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum-
mer, or dry season; when another business took me
up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where I built my bower, ano
whera I had an opening quite to the sea, on the othei
side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite
across to the sea-shore on that side. So taking im
gun and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cake?
and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my
store, I began my journey. When 1 had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
view of the sea, to the west; and it being a very cleai
day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or con-
tinent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extend-
ing from the west to the W. S. W. at a very great
distance ; by my guess it could not be less than fifteen
• or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the woild this might
be, otherwise than that 1 knew it must be part of Ame-
rica; and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps-
was all inhabited by savages, where if I should have
landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was
now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions
of Providence, which ( began now to own, and to
believe ordered every thing for the best; I say, 1 qui-
eted my mind with this, and left afllicting mysell
w ith fruitless wishes of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I consi-
dered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should
certainly, one time or other, see some vessels pass or
repass one way or other ; but if not, then it was the
savage cost between the Spanish country and Brasil,
which were indeed the worst of savages; for they are
cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and
devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of tfae island where I now
was, much pleasanter than mine, the open.or savanna
fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full
et very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and
Jain would I have caught one, if possible, to have
kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I
did, after some pains-taking, catch a young parrot;
for I knocked it down with a stick, and having reco-
vered it, I brought it home, but it was some years
before I could make him speak. However, at last I
taugh't him to call me by my name very familiarly:
but the accident that followed, though it be a trifle
will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: 1
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them to
be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all the
other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy my-
self to eat them, though I killed several: but I had no
neec] to be venturous; for I had no want of food, and
of that which was very good too; especially these
three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise;
which added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market could
not have furnished a better table than I, in propor-
tion to the company: arid though my case was de-
plorable enough, yet I had a great cause for thankful-
ness, that I was not driven to any extremities for
food ; but rather plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; bjit I took so many
turns .and returns, to see what discoveries I could
make, that I came weary enough to the place where I
resolved to sit down for all night; and then either
reposed myself in a tree,, or surrounded myself with
a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could
come at me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side
of the island; for here indeed the shore was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side
f had found but three in a year and an half. Here
was also an infinite number of fowls of many kimls,
gome of which I had not seen before, and many of
mem very good meat; but such as I knew not lh«
name*of except those called pengiuns.
1 could have shot as many as 1 pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, ;f I could, which 1
could better feed on: and though there were many
^oats here more than on the other side of the island,
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them; the country being flat and even,
and they saw me much sooner than when I was on
the hills.
1 confess this side of the country^was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; for as 1 was fixed in my habitation,
ft became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I
was here to be, as it were upon a journey, and from
home: however, I travelled along the shore of the sea
towards the east, 1 suppose, about twelve miles; and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark,
1 concluded I would go home again; and the next jour,
ney J took should be on the oiher side of the island
east from my dwelling, and so round, till I came u
my post again : of which in its plac*3*.
I took another way to come back than that I went
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in
my view, that 1 could not miss finding my first dwell-
ing by viewing the country; but 1 found myself mis-
taken; for being come about two or three miles, 1
found myself descended into a very large valley; but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
woods, that I could not see which was my way by
any direction but that of the sun; nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at
hat time of the day.
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun,
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last wm
obliged to And out the sea-eidt, look for my post, and
enme nack the same way I went; and then by easy
journies I turned homeward, the weather f>ejng ex-
ceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, anr:
other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, am:
seized upon it ; and f running in to take hold of it
caugh «t and saved it alive from the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home, if 1 could; for I Jiad
often been musing whether it might not be possible 10
get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply mo when my powder and shot
should be spent.
I made a collar for this little creature, and with n
string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient U* be at home, from whence I had been
absent abov\ d month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: this little wandering journey, without a
settled place of ahode, had been so unpleasant to me,
that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that 1
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,
while it should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
mvself after my long journey; during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair o1
making a cage for my Pol, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with
me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, which l
had pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go
and fetch it home, and give it some food; accordingly
I went, and found it where I left it; for indeed it
could not get out, but was almost starved for want of
food; I went and cut boughs of trees and branches o\
.weh shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away,
but it was so tame with being hungry, that 1 had no
need to have tied it; for it followed me like a dog,
and as I continually fed it, the creature became so
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from
that time one of my domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and 1 kept the 30th of September in the same
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary o
my landing on the island, having now been there two
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than
the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in
humble and thankful acknowledgements of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks, that God had been pleased to discover to me
even that it was possible 1 might be more happy in
this solitary condition than I should have been in a
I i I ierty of society, and in all the pleasures of the world:
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies oi
my soiitry state, and the want of human society, by
his presence, and the communication of his grace to
my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope foi
his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all its miser-
able circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abomina-
ble life I led all the past part of my days; and now,
having changed both my sorrows and my joys, my
very desires altered, my affections changed their gust,
and my delights were perfectly new from what they
were at first coming, or indeed for two years past.
Before as 1 walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at
my condition would break out upon me on a sudden,
and my very heart would die within me, to think ol
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and
3
how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bar*
and Ixdts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon
me like a storm, anrl made me ring my hands, and
weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in
the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour
or two together, and this was still worse to me; for \l
I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words,
it would go off; and the grief, having exhausted
itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts: 1 daily read the word of God, and applied
all the comforts of it to my present state. One morn-
ing being very sad, 1 opened the Bilfte upon thcs«
words, "I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake
thee!" Immediately it occurred, that these word-
were to me, why else should they be directed in such
a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning
over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man?
1 Well then," said I, "if,God does not forsake me,
of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it,
though the world should all forsake me; seeing, on
the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose
the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was proba-
ble I should have ever been in any other particular
^kte in the world : and with this thought 1 was going
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this pla«;e.
I know not what it was, but something shocked my
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words,
u How canst thou be such an hypocrite," said I, even
audibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a condition,
which, however thou mayst endeavour to be contented
with, thou wouldest rather pray heartily to be deliver-
ed from?" So I stopped there; but though I could
not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by what-
ever afflicting providences, to see the former condition
of my life, and to mourn for my wickedne», and re-
pent. I never opened the Bible, or shut u, but my
very soul within me blessed God for di ecting my
friend in England, without any order of mi)«, to pack
it up among my goods; and for assisting me after
wards to save it out of the wreck of the si ip.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, J began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as at the first, yet in general it may be ob-
served, that I was very seldom idle; havi )g regularly
divided my time, according to the sevend daily em-
ployments that were before me; such ss, first, my
duty to God, and reading the scriptures, which 1 con-
stantly set apart some time for, thrice every ck»y:
secondly, the going abroad with my f uti for food,
which generally took me up three hours every mom
ing when it did not rain: thirdly, the ordering, cur-
ing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
catched for my supply; these took up great part of
the day : also it is to be considered, thai in the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the vio-
lence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that
about four hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work;
the many hours, which for want of tools, want of
help, and want of skill, every thing that I did, took
yp out of my time: for example, I was full two-and-
forly days making me a board for a long shelf, which
I wanted in* my cave; whereas two sawyers, with
their tools and saw-pit, would have cut six of them
nut of the same tree in a half a day.
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be u
broad one. The tree I was three days a cutting down,
unci two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing ii
to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible
hacking and hewing I reduced both the sides of i
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move:
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and
flat, as a board, from end to end : then turning tha
side down ward, cut the other side till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my
hands in such a piece of work; but labour and pa-
jLicnce carried me through that and many other things;
1 only observe this in particular, to show the reason
why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz. that what might be a little'.o be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-i
digious tjme to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour, I
I went through many things, and indeed every thing1
that my circumstances made necessary for me to do,'
as will appear by what follows. I
I was now in the months of November and De-1
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck: for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season: but now
my crop promised very well, when an a sudden I
found I was in danger of losing it all again by ene-
mies of several sorts, which it was scarce possiLc to
keep from it; as first the goats and wild creatures
which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of
the blade, lay in it night and day as soon as it camp
up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to
shoot up into stalks. \
This I saw no remedy fort but by making an enclo-
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great
deal of toil; and the more, because it required a great
.leal of speed; the creatures daily spoiling my corr.
However, as my arable land was but small, suited tt
my croy, 1 got it totally well fenced in about thre«,
weeks time, and shooting some of the creatures in the
day-time, 1 set my dog to guard it in the night, tying
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand
nnd bark all nightlong; so in ?k little time the ene
mies forsook the place and the <?om grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my con
uas in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for going along- b}
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls of I know not how many sorts,
which stood as it were watching till I «hotild begone.
1 immediately let fly among them (for I always had
v\y gun with me.) J had no sooner^ shot, but there
arose up a*Jittie cloud of fowls, which t had not seer
at all, from among the corn itself.
This toucVied me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in u
few day they would devour all my hopes; that V
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop a'
all: and what to do I could no-t te.i; however, i;
resolved not to loose my corn, if possible, though '«,
should watch it night and day. In the first place, \
went among it to see what damage was already done
and found they had spoiled a good deal' of it; bu:
that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss wai
not so great, but the remainder was like to be a gooiJ
crop, if it could be saved.'
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon aV
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I wa.»
gone away, and the event it proved to be so; for as I!
walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out ci
their sight, but they dropped down one by one intD
the corn, again. I was so provoked, that I could net
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing thai
every grain that they now ate was, as it might, be said,
ft pfek loaf to me in the consequence; but coming
ft> the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I looked for; so I took them up, anri
served them as we serve notorious thieves m Kng-
iand,viz. hanged them in chains for a terror to other*.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an effect as it had; for the fowls would
not only not come at the corn, but in short they for-
sook all that part of the island, and I coidd never see
a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung
there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, 1 reaped my com.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a' scickle to
cut it down, and :-!l 1 could do was to make one ;i?
well as I could out of one of the broad-swords, or
cutlasses .which I saved among the arms out of the
I ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
I great difficulty to cut it down: in short I reaped it
! m>' vva)'> mr * cul nothing off but the ears, and car-
ried it away in a great basket which I had made, and
so rubbed it out with my hands: and at the end of all
my harvesting I found, that out of my half-peck oi
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my
guess, for f rjad no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and ( foresaw, that in time it would please God to
supply me with bread •. and yei here I was perplexed
again; for 1 needier knew how to grind or make rneal
of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it;'
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it;
and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake
it. These things being added to my desire of having
a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but
to preserve it all for seed against the next season, and
in the mean time to employ all my study and hours
cf working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with com and bread.
It might be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what 1 believe
tew people have thought much upon; viz. the strange
multitude of little things necessary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing
this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
ibis to be my daily discouragement, and was made
nore and more sensible of it. every hour, even after
! got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I hav«
aid, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise:
First, f had no plough to turn the earth, no spado
«ir shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by mak-
mg a wooden spade, as I observed before; but this
did my work but in a wooden manner; and though
it cost me a great many days to make it, yet, for wan'
of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but mad*
my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badnesi
of the performance. When the corn'was sowed, I
nan no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself,
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to
scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than rak«
or harrow it.
When it was growing or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it. home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it." Then I wanted a
mill to grind, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in ; and all
these things I did without, as shall be observed ; and
vet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advan-
tage to me too; but all this, as 1 said, made every
thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there waa
no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me,
because I had divided it; a certain part of it was
every day appointed to these works; and as I resolved
<• U6C none of the corn for bread till I had a greatei
35
quantity Dy me, I had the next six months to apply
myself wholly by labour and invention, to furnish
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for the making the com, when 1
had it, fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now
peed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, was a very sorry one
indeed, ^nd very heavy, and required double labour
to work with it; however, I went through that, aiid
sowed my seeds in two larg-e flat pieces of ground, a*
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which
were all cut off that wood which I had set before,
which I knew would grow; so that in one year's time
I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that
would want but little repair. This work was not
so little as to take me up less than three months; be-
cause great part of that time was in the wet season,
when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following oc-
casion, always observing, that all the while I was
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching ».im to speak ; and I quickly leamt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak "it out pretty
loud, Pol; which was the first word T ever heard
spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my
work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment
upon my hands, as follows: viz. I had long studied,
by some means or other, to make nr^'self some earthen
vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew ,not
where to come at them: however, considering the
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find out any such clay, I might botch up some such
pot as might, being- dried by the sun, be hard enough
*md strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any
things that was dry, and required to be kept so; and
as this was necessary in preparing corn, meal, &c.
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make
some as large as 1 could, and fit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly things
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat
of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as
after they were dried; and, in a word, how, aftei
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, 1 could not
make above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot
call them jars in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two veiy dry and
haid, I lifted them very gently up and set them dowi
again in two great wicker-baskets, which I had made
on purpose for them that they might not break ; and,
as between the pot and the basket there was a littb
room to spare, 1'stuffed it full of the rice and barley
straw ; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
1 thought would hold my dry com, and perhaps the
meal when the corn ,vas bruised,
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned
to; and the neat of tne sun baked them strangely
hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was
x> get an earthen pot to hold what was liqu-id, and
Bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a pretty kuge fir* for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it «.u% afw I
had done with it, I found a broken nvur* v)f ana *4
nay earthenware vessels in the fire, burntjuj hu^a
'stone, and red as a tile. I was greatly surprised to
see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be
made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; but
1 placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
h\ a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great heap of embers under them:
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in jhat heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by
j the violence of the heat, and would have run into
i glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire grad"-
| aily, till the pets began to abate of the red colour;
j and watching them all night that I might not let the
i fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
good, I will not say handsome pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indiffer-
ent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of
mwking them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or
as a woman would make pies that never learni to
raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly pati-
ence to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon
the fire again with some water in it, to boil me some
meat, which I did admirably well; and with a piece
of a kid I made some verv good broth, though
•ranted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requi
site to make it so good as I would have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar t&
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was
at a great loss; for of all the trades in the world I way
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any.
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with,
i spent many a day to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and
could find none at all except what was in the solid
rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness suffi-
cient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither bear :he weight of an-heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it withsand ; so,
after a great deal of time lost in searching ror a stone,
i gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block
jf hard wood, which I found indeed much easier;
ind getting one as big as I had strength to stir, 1
founded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe
and hatchet; and then with the help of fire and infi-
nite labour, made an hollow place in it, as the Indi-
ans in Brasil make tfteir canoes. After this, I made
a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood called the
iron-wood, and this I prepared and laid by against I
nad my next crop of corn, when 1 propsed to myself
to grind or rather pound, my com or meal to make
my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce,
to dress my meal, and part it from,the bran and the
husk, without which I did not see it possible I could
have any-bread. This was a most difficult thing, so
much as but to think on ; for to be sure I had nothing
like the necessary things to make it with; I mean fine,
thm canvass, or stuff, to searce the meal through.
Arid here 1 was at a full stop for marly months; nor
did I really know what to do: linen I had none left
but what was mere rags; I had goat's hair, but neither

knew I how to weave or spin it; and had I known
how, here were no tools to work it with.. All the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did
remember I had among the seamen's clothes which
were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico
or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made
three small seives, but proper enough for the work;
and thus I made shift for some years; how I did
afterwards, I shall show in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I should make bread when I came to have
corn; for, first, I had no yeast: as to that part, there
was no supplying the want, so I did not concern my-
self much about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment ior
that also, which was this; I made some earthen ves-
sels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep;
these I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and
laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a
great fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with
some square tiles of my own making and burning
also; but I should not call them square.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping
away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves;
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew
the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep
In, and add to the heat; and thus, as well as in #ie
best ovens in the world, I baked my barley-loaves,
and became in a little time a mere pastry-cook into
he bargain; for 1 made myself several cakes of the
lice, and puddings; indeed I made no pies, neither
had 1 any thing to put into them, supposing J had,
except the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took
me up most part of the third year of my abode here;
for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of these
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma
nage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried
it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear„
in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; foi
I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh
it with.
And now indeed my stock of com increasing, I
really wanted to build my bams bigger • I wanted 1
p'.ace to lay it up in; for the increase of the corn now
yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about
twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more:
insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it freely
for my bread had been quite gone a great while ; also
I resolved to see what quantity would be sufiicieni
for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con
sume in a year: so I resolved to sow just the same
quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopee
that such a quantity would fully provide me with
bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospeci
of land which 1 had seen upon the other side of the
island; and I was not without secret wishes, that)
was on shore there, fancying that seeing the main
land, and an inhabited country, I might find some
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps
at last find some means of escape. K
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fal)
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as J
might have reason to think far worse than the bom
and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into thei
power, I should run an hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and pcrhaps.of being eaten-,
for I had heard that ihe people of the Caribean coasts
were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by thf
latitude that I could not be far off from that snore
that, suppose they were not cannibal, yet they mighi
kill me, as many Europeans who had faken into there
hands had been served, even when they had been ten
or twenty together: much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these things,
I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and
I did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took
none of my apprehensions at first; and my head ran
mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to that
shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder of mutton sail, with which 1 sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look on our ship's ooat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first but not quite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds almost bottom up-
wards, against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand,
k-ut no water about her as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
Brasils with her easy enough; but I might have easily
foreseen that I could no more turn her, and set her
i.pright upon her bottom, than I could remove the
bland. However, I went to the wood, and cut levers
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to
try what I could do; suggesting to myself, that if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the
damage she had received, and she would be a very
good boat, and 1 might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to un-
dermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move is
forwards towards tne water; so 1 was forced to giv»
it over; and, yet though I gave over ihe hopes of th«
boat, my desire to venture over for the main increase
ed, rather than decreased, as the means of it seemed
impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua, such
as tne natives of those climates make, even without
ools, or, as 1 might say, without hands, viz. of the
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possi
ble, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with my
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indi-
ans; but not at all considering the particular inconve-
nience which I lay under more than the Indians did,
viz. want of hands to move it into the water, when
it was made; a difficulty much harder for me to sur-
mount than all the consequences of want of tools
could be to them: for what was it to me that when 1
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with
great trouble cut it down, if after I might be able with
my tools to hew and dub the outside into a proper
shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it, if, after alj
this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and
was not able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of this circumstance,
while I was making this boat, but I should have im,
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea •
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage ovei
the sea in it, that I never once considered how f
should get it off the land ; and it was really in its own
nature more easy for me to guide it aver forty-five
miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land,
where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awake^
I pleased myself with the design, withont determin-
ing whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but
H
ttiat the difficulty of launching my boat came often
into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer, which I gave myself:
Let me first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way
or other to get it along, when it is done.
This was a most preposterous method; but the eager
ness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and
felled a cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon
ever had such an one for the building the temple at
Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the
lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which ii
lessened for a while, and then it parted into branches.
It was not without infinite labour that I felled this
tree: I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at
the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it, cut oft^
which I hacked and hewed through with my axe and
hatchet, with inexpressible labour: after this it cost
me a month to shape it, and dub it to a proportion,
and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it
might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near
three months more to clear the inside, and work it
out so as to make an exact boat of it: this I did in-
deed without fire, by mere mallet and chissel, and by
the dint of hard labour; till 1 had brought it to be a
very handsome periagua, and big enough to have car-
ried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it: the boat was really much
bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was
made of one tree, in my life ; many a weary stroke it
jhad cost, you may be sure, for there remained nothing
but to get it into the water; and had I gotten it into
the water, I make no question but I should have be-
gun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be
performed, that ever was undertaken.
But all ray devices to get it into the water (ailed
me, though they cost infinite labour too ; A lay abom
one hundred yards from the water, and not more,
but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards
the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement,
I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so
make a declivity; this I began, and it cost me a pro-
digious deal of pains: but who grudge pains, that
have their deliverance in view? but when this was
worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was
still much at one; for I could no more stir the canoe,
than I could the other boat.
Then 1 measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down
to the water; well, I began this work, and when I
began to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was
to be dug, hew broad, how the stuff to be thrown out,
I found, that by the n*iml>er of hands I had, l)eing
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before 1 should have gone through with it; fot
the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must
have been at least twenty feet deep: soat length, though
with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved rac heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a. work before we count
the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own
strength to go through wrth it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort, as evci
before ; for by a constant study, and serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and by the assistance of his
race, 1 gained a different knowledge from what 1
ad before; I entertained dhTerent notions of things;
1 looked now upon the world as a thing remote:
which I had nothing to do with, no expectation from,
and indeed no desires about: in a word, I had no-
thing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have:
eo I thought it looked as we may perhaps look upon
fit hereafter viz. as a place I had lived in, but wai
e
come out of it; and well I might say, as fatner Abra-
ham to Dives, "Between me and thee there is a
great gulph fixed."
In the first place, I was removed from all the wick-
edness of the world here: I had neither the lust of
the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life : I
had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now capable
of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor, or, if I
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which 1 had possession of: there werv
no rivals: I had no competitor, none to dispute sov -t
reignty or command with me; 1 might liave raisiii
ship-loads of corn, but J had no use for it; so 1 1 '1
as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion
I had tortoise or turtles enough; but now and then
one was as* much as I could put to any use: I had
iimber enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had
grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had
been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was valu-
able: I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants,
and what was all the rest to me? If I killed more
flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or the ver-
min: if I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must
be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to
rot on the ground, I could make no more use of them
than for fuel : and that I had no occasion for, but to
dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dic-
tated to me upon just reflection, that all the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than as
they are for our use : and that whatever we may heap
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much as we
can use, and no more. The most coveteous griping
miser in the world would have been cured of the vice
of coveteousness, if he had been in iny case; for I
possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do
with. I had no room for desire, except it was of
things which I had not, and they were but trifles,
though indeed of great use to me. 1 had, as I bmten
before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business
for it; and I often thought with myself, that I would
have given an handful of it for a gross of tobacco-
pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, f
would have given it all for six-penny-worth of turnip
and carrot seed out of England, or for an handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink : as it was, I had
not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but
there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the
damp of the cave, in the wet season; and if I had
had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same
case; and thevjiad been of no manner of value to
me because of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier to
my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat
down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired the
nand of God's providence, which had thus spread my
table in the wilderness: I learn to look more upon
the bright side of my condition, and less upon the
dark side; and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted ; and this gave me sometimessuch
secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and
which 1 took notice of here, to put those discontented
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably
what God hath given them, because they see and covet
something that he lias notgiven them : all our discon-
tents about what we want, appeared to me to spring
from the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into
Birch distress as mine was; and this was to com^ tt.re my
present con 'ition with what I at first expected it should
be ; nay, with what it would certainly have been, fthe
good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered
the ship to be cast up near to the shore, where I ,,ot
«aalv a^-xft tome at her, but -ould bring what I £jt
ADYENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
out of her to the shore for my relief and com Ion ,
without which I had wanted tools to work, weapon*
for defence, or gunpowder and shot for getting my
flood.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re-
presenting to myself in the most lively colours, how 1
must have acted, if I had got nothing out of the ship;
how I could not have so much as got any food, ex-
cept fish anil turtles; and that, as it was long before 1
found any of them, I must have perished first: that 1
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage  that if I had killed a goat or a fow' by any
contrivance, I had no wav to flay or open them, or
Jpart the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut
it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull il
with my claws, like a beast. »
These reflections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my
present condition, with all its hardships and misfor-
tunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend to
the reflection of those who are apt in their misery to
Bay, Is any affliction like mine? Let them consider,
how much worse the cases of some people are, and
what their case might have been, if Providence had
thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was compar-
ing my present condition with what I had deserved,
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand ot
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly des-
titute of the knowledge and<fear of God; 1 had been
wellinstmctsd by father and mother; neither had th^
been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse
a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my
duty, and of what the nature and end of my being re-
quired of me. But, alas! falling early into the sea-
faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of God, though his terrors are always be-
fore them -, ! say, falling early into the seafaring life,
<ind into seafaring rompanv. all that little sense of r«'
ligion which I had entertained, was laughed out of m»
by my messmates; by an hardened despising of dan-
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to
me; by my long absence from all manner of oppor-
tunities to converse with, any thing but what was like
myself, or to hear any thing of what was good, or
tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the
greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape from
.Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master
of the ship my being planted so well in Brasil, my
receiving the cargo from England, and the like I never
once had the words, Thank God, so much as on my
mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the greatest distress
had I so much thought as to pray'to him; nor so
- much as to'say Lord, have mercy upon me ! no, not
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear
by, and blaspheme it.
T had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account of
mv wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked
about me, and considered what particular providen-
ces had attended me, since my coming into this place,'
and how God had dealt bountifully with me; had
not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for me; this gave me
great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
that God had yet mercies in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only tc resignation to the will of God in the present
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thankfulness of my condition; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I lied
not the due punishment of my sins; that 1 enjoyed s<
xnany mercies, which F had no reason to have expected
in that place, that I ought never more to repine at im
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks.
for that dailv bread, which nothing hut a. cloud_ oJ
wonders could have brought • that T ought to consider
I had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens ;'nay, by a long series
of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a
place in the uninhabited part of the world, where (
could have been cast more to my advantage; a place,
where as 1 had no society, which was my affliction
an one hand, so I found no ravenous beast, no furious
wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous
creatures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to
my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted no-
thing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to
make my sense of God's goodnes to me, and car©
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation;
and after I made a just improvement of these things,,
I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which 1 brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with wates
a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any
appearance of black.upon the paper: as long as it
lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of
the month on which any remarkable thing happened
to me; and first, by casting up times past, I remem-
ber that there was a strange concurrence of days in
the various providences which befel me, and which,
if! had been supersticiously inclined to observe day3
as fatal or fortunate, I might, have had reason to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, ,that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same day af-
terwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
inade a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the
wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads. Mi? same day
ti\ tne year afterwards i made my escape from ballet*
in the boat.
'The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
20th of September, the same day I had my lite so mi-
raculously saved twenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked life,
and solitary life, both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that
of my bread, I mean the buiscuit which I brought out
f>( the ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day, for
above a year: and yet I was quite without bread for
a year before I got any corn of my own : and great
reason 1 had to he thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to
miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to liner*,
I had none a good while, except some chequred shirts
which 1 found in tne chests of the other seamen, and
which I carefully preserved, because many times I
could bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was
a very great help to me, that I had among all th.o
men's clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also several thick watch-coats of the sea-
men, which were left behind, but they were too hot
to wear; and though it is true, that the weather wag
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked; no, though 1 had been
inclined to it, which I was not; nor could I abide
fhe thought of it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked, was
I could not beaF the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whiss-
Img under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it; no more could 1 ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; ihe heal
of tne sun beating with such violence as it does in th*a
39
place, would give me the headach presently, oy aart
mg so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on,
60 that 4 could not bear it; whereas, if I put on m)
hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views i began to consider about putting
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some
order, f had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and
my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which J had \y
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set
to work a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for
f made most piteous work of it. However, 1 made
shift to make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped
would serve me a great while; as for breeches o>
di'awers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till af-
wards.
1 have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures'that I killed, I mean four footed ones; and
f had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
sun; by which means some of them were so dry and
f.ard, that they were fit for little; but others, it seems,
tfere very useful. The first thing I made of these
?ras a great cap for my head, with the hair on the out-
side to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so
well, that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches
open at the knees, and both loose; for they were ra-
ther wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me warm
[• must not omit to acknowledge, that they were
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was
a worse tailor: however, they were such as I made a
very good shift with: ?»nd when I was abroad, if it
happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap
Deing outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one,
and had a great mind to make one: I had seen them
made in the Brasils, where they are very useful in the
gieat heats which are there; and I felt the heats even'
jot as great here, and greater loo, being nearer ihf
eqmox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains
as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a
great while before 1 could make any thing likely to
hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled
two or three before I made one to my mind; but at
last I made one that answered indifferently well. The
main difficulty I found was to make it to let flown
I could make it to spread; but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it would not be portable for m<*
any way, but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer:
I covered it with skins; the hair upwards, so that it
cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept offthe sun
so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather, with greater advantage than I could be-
fore in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, 1
could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind b?mg
entirely composed by resigning to the will of Cod,
mid throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of \ii<
providence; this made my life better than sociable:
for when T began to regret the want of conversation,
f would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutu-
ally with my own thoughts, and as 1 hope I may say,
with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions,
was not better than the utmost enjoyment of humax)
society in the world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any ex
traordinary thing happened to me; but 1 lived on ir
the same course, in the same postuie and place, jus<
as before. The chief thing 1 was employed in, be
sides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice
and curing my raisins, of both which I always kep'
np just enough to have sufficient stock of the year's
provision beforehand; I say, besides this yearly )&
hour, and my daily labour of going out with my gun,
I had one labour to make me a canoe, which at last 1
finished: so that by digging a canal to it, six leet
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the croak,
almost half a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly
big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as
I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so
never being able to bring it to the water, or bring th«
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was,
as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time.
Indeed the next time, though I could not get a tree
proper for it, and was in a place where I could not
*et the water to it at any less distance than, as I haVa
said, of near half a mile; yet as I saw it was practi-
cable at last, I never gave it over; and though 1 was
near two years about it, yet i never grudged my la-
bour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at least.
However, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the de
sign which I had in view, when I made the first: I
mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma, where. It
was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the srnall-
nessof my boat assisted to put an end to that design,
and now I thought no more of it But as 1 had a
boat, my next design was to make a tour round the
island: for as I had been on the other side, in one
place, crossing, as I have already described it, over
the land, so the discoveries I made in that journey
made me very eager to see the other parts of the
coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of
the pieces of the ship's sail, which lay in store, and
of which I had a great store by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
f found she would sail very well. Then 1 made littfc
lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put pro
visions, necessaries and ammunition, &c. into, to
be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea;
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to
hang; down over it to keep it drv.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, lik
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat ot
the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I every now
and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek ; but at last,
being eager to view the circumference of my little-
kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly
I victualled my ship for the voyage; putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them)
of barely-bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice,
a food I ate a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, halt
a goat, and powder with shot for killing more, and
two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned
before, 1 had saved out of the seamen's chests; these
I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in
the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, ano1 1 found it much longer
than I expected; for though the island itself was not
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I
found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and
beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league
more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to
sea to doule that point.
When I first discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know-
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and
above all, doubting how 1 should go back again ; so \
came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an
anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which J
got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went
on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed to over
look that point, where I saw the full extent of it, ai.d
resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood,
I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious cur-
rent, which ran to the east, even came close to the
40
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
point and 1 took tne more Rotice of it, tecause 1
saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again. And
indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe
it would have been so; for there was the same current
on the other side of the island, only that it set off at
a farther distance ; and I saw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get
out of the first current, and T should presently be in
an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (at E. S, E. and that being just
contrary to the said current) made a great breach o/
the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me
to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to
go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured;
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and igno-
rant pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the point,
when 1 was not my boat's length from the shore, but
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all I could do coulj
not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but J found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy,
which was on the left hand. There was no wind stir-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my
paddles signified nothing; and now I began to give
myself over for lost; for, as the current was on both
sides the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone:
nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I
had no prospect before me but of perishing; not by
the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore,
as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into
the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that
n to say, one of my earthed pots; but what was all
this to bemjf; driven into the vast ocean, where to be
sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for
a thousand leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the ,most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked bacH
upon my desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heart
rtould wish for, was to be there again . 1 stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes; "O happy desert!'
said I, " I shall never see the more! O miserable
creature!" said I, "whither am I going!" Then 1
reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and
how I had repined at my solitary condition ; and now
what would I give to be on shore there again? Thu^
we never see the true state of our condition, till it is-
illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know how to
value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It i^
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I wa^
now in, being driven, from my beloved island (for so it
appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, {»!
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of evei
recovering it again: however, 1 worked hard, till in
deed my strength was almost exhausted; and kep
my boat as much to the northward, that is, toward-'
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as pos
sihly I could ; when about noon, as the sun passe/1 ih<
meridian, I thought I fell a little breeze of win'J ii
my face springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered
rny heart a little, and especially when in about hall
an hour more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By
this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the
island; and, had the least cloud or hazy weather in-
tervened, I had been undone another way too; for I
had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if 1
had but once lost sight of it; but the weatner contin-
uing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again,
and spread my sail standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of
the water, some alteration of the current was near;
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the cur-
rent abate, and presently 1 found to the east, at about
half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks i
these rocks I found caused the current to part again
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other re.
turned by the repulse of the rock, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a
veary sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves jtist going to murder them, or who have
been in such like extremeties, may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddv under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
oack again directly towards the island, but about two
leagues more towards the northward than the current
lay, which carried me away at first; so that when I
came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end cj
the island, opposite to that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However I
found, that being between the two great currents, viz.
that on the south side which had hurried me away
and that on the north which lay about two leagues
on the other side; I say, between these two,in the
west of the island, I found the water at least still,
and running no way ; and having still a breeze ot
wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
island, though not making such fresh way as before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being ihen within
about a league of the island. I found the point of the ,
rocks which occasioned the distance stretching out as
is described before, to the southward, and casting oft
the current more southwardly, had of course made
another eddy to the north; and this I found very
strong, but directly setting the way my course lay,
which Was due west, but almost full north. However,
having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy slant*
ing north-west, and in about an hour came within
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth wa-
ter, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and re-
freshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
espied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep,
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get _ horn-;
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knev
too much the case to think of attempting it by th<»
way I went out; and what might .be at the other sido
(I mean the west side) I knew not, v.dt haq1 I any
mind to run any more ventures; so I only resolved
in the morning to make my way westward along tho
shore, and to see if there was no creek where 1 might
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again h
I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts,
coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet, or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came
to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a con-
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as
if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for
hex; here I put in, and having stowed my boat very
safe I went on shore to look about me, and see whe»-«
I was. )
1 soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been nefore when I travelled on foo* to
hat shore; so taking nothing out of my boat but m\
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedir;g hot, I
Degan my march: the way was comfortable enough
after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every
tiling standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good
cider, being, asl said before, my country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep
but judge you if you can, that read my story, what a
surpries f must be in when I was awaked out of mv
sleep by a voice calling me by n\f name several times,
"Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe? Where are yow?
Where have you been?"
1 was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not
awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me : but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Cru-
soe, Robin Crusoe; at last I began to awake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and
startled up in the utmost consternation : but no sooner
were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting on the
top of the hedge, and immediately knew that this was
he that, spoke to me ; for Justin such bemoaning lan-
guage 1 had used to talk to him, and teach him ; and
he had learnt it so perfectly, that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, anJ cry,
"Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you? Where have
rou been? How came you here ?" and such things as
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body else, it was a good
;while before I could compose myself. First, I was
amazed how the creature got thithfer, and then how he
should just keep a />ut the place, and no where else.-
but as T was we"1 satisfied it out ill be rjobodv l>»t ho-
nest Pol, I got it over; and holding out my hand, ano
calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable creature
came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to
do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe
and, how did I come here? and where had I been,
just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and
so I carried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. 1 would
have been very glad to have had my boat again on
my side of the island, but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about: as to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart would
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of
it: and to the other side of the island, I did not know
how it might be there; but supposing the currant ran
with the same force against the shore at the east, as it
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk
of being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as I had been before of being carried away
from* it. So with these thoughts I contented myself
:o be without any boat, though it had been the pro-
duct of so many months labour to make it, and of so
many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you may
well suppose ; and my thoughts being very much com-
posed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in re-
signing myself to the disposition" of Providence, I
thought I lived really very happily in all things, ex-
cept that of society. ,
I improved myself in this time, in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how few tools I had.
Besides this, 1 arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthen^ ve. ar d cur»tr"ved well enough tc
make them with a wheel, which 1 found infinite! v
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, thaw for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe;
and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it
was done, and only burnt red like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; fori
had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards,
when I searched the ship again, I could not come a».
any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention shewed me, though not very handsome, yet
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat,
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress
t, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket:
and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out
the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
enough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and
leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rub
bed out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept
it in gieat baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated consi-
derably; and this was a want which it was impossi-
ble for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider
what I must do when I should have no more powder;
mat is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I
had, as 1 observed, in the third year of my being here,
kept a youg kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes
of getting an he kid, but I could not b,y any means
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I
could never find in my heart to kill her, till she died
at last of mere age.
But Demg now in the eleventh year of my resi*
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition growing
low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare
the goats, to see whether 1 could not x>atch some ol
them alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goai
great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them ,
and believe they were more than once taken in them;
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug se-
veral large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits I
placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several times I put ears ol
barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I
eould easily perceive, that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, that I could see the mark of their
feet: at length, I set three traps in one nighty and
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very dis-
couraging; however, I altered my trap; and, not to
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-
goat ; and m one of the other, three kids, a male and
two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him; he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit to
him; that is to say, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted; I could have killed
him, but that was not my business, nor would it an-
swer my end; so I e'en '.et him out, and he ran awa>
as if he had beeu frighted out of his wits; but I did
not then know what I afterwards learnt, that hunger
would tame a lion: if 1 had let him stav there three
or four days without food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame-as one of the kids; foi they are
mighty sagacious tractable creatures, where they are
well used.
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
bfetter at that time; then I want to the three kids ,
anJj taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together; and with some difficulty brought them all
home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but
throwing ihem some sweet corn it tempted them, and
they began to be tame: and now I found, that if I
expected to supply myself with goats fl.°sh, when I
had np powder or shot left, breeding some up tame
was my only way, when perhaps I might have then
about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would al-
ways run wild when they grew up ; and the only way
*br this was to have some enclosed piece of ground,
well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them
up so effectually, that those within might not break
out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing
it, my first piece of work was to find out a proper
piece of ground, viz. whore there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and
cover to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such enclosures, will think
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
place very proper for all these, being a plaiiaropen
piece of meadow-land or savana (as our people call
it in the western colonies) which had two or three
little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was
very woody; I say they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I began by enclosing of this
piece of ground in such a manner, that my hen"ge o
pale must have been at least two miles about; nor wa
the madness of it so great as to the compas -, tor, if it
was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough
zo do it in; but I did not consider, that my goats
*'ould be as wild in so much compas, as if they had
had the whole island ; and I should have so mucb
room to chase thein in, that I should nevercatch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me;
*o I presently stopped short, and for the first begin-
ning I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hun-
dred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards
in breadth, which as it would maintain as many as 1
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock
increased, I could add more ground to the enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to
work with courage. I was about three months hedg-
ing in the first piece ; and, till 1 had done it, I.tethered
the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to
feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar;
and very often I would go and carry them some ears
of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out o!
my hand ; so that after my enclosure was finished,
and I \pt them loose they would follow me up and
down bleating after me for a handful of corn.
'This answered my end, and in about a year and?
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all,
and in two years more I had three-and-forty, besides
several that I look and killed for my food; and aftet
that I enclosed fiw several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take
them as I wanted them.; and gates out of one piece of
ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat1:-
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a tiling
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much a;
think of, and which when it came into my thoughts
was really an agreeable surprise; for now I set up my
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in
day. And as nature who gives supplies of food
to every CFeature, dictates even naturally how to make
iwe of it, so J, that never milked a cow much less a
goat, or saw butter or cheese made, very readily and
handily, though after a great many essays and miscar
rmges, made me both butter and cheese at iast, an"
never wanteo it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat b *s crea-
tures, even in those conditions in which they s^emeq!
to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can h* sweet-
en the bitterest providences, and give us cause to
praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a table
was here spread for me in the wilderness, where I
saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!
It would liave made a stoic smile, to have «-een rrc
and my little family sit down to dinner: tbore wa&
my majesty, the prince and lord of the wholo island •
I had the livesof all my subjects at absolute command;
i could hang, draw,'give life and liberty, and take it
away, and no rebels among all my subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, a'd alone,
attended by my servants .' Pol, as if he had been my
favorite, as the only person permitted to talk to me;
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and foini J no species to multiply his kind upon, sal al-
ways at my right hand ; and two cats one ok one side
the table, and one on the other, expecting i»t*w and
then a bit fiom my hand as a mark of special favour
But these were not the two cats which I brought on
shore at first; for they were both of them dead, and
had been interred near my habitation b} my own
hands; but one of them having multiplied by 7 know
not what kind of creature, these were two which I pre-
served tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the woods,
and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for they
would often come into my house, and plunder me too,
till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a
great many; at length they left me. With this at-
tendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived ; nei-
ther could I be said to want any thing, but society and
wf that, in some time after this, I was like to have too
much. |
I was something impatient, as I had observed, t«
have the use of my boat, though very loath to run any
*wjjb hazard: and therefore sometinaes I satcontnv
.ng ways to get her about the island, and at other times*
f sat myself down contented enough without her. But
I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to
the point of the island, where, as I have said in my
last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I
had to do. This inclination increased upon me every
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land,
and following the edge of the shore, I did so; but had
any one in England been to meet sech a man as I was,
it must either have frighted them, or raised a great
deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of
my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equi-
page, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure as follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the s*un from me, as to shoot the rain off from run-
ning into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair or
open-kneed breeches of the same ; the breeches wem
made of a skin of an old he goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on either side, that, like panta-
loons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings
and shoes I had none; but I had made me a pair of
something, I scarce knew what to call them, like bus-
kins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like
spatterdashes: but of a most barberous shape, as in
deed were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw
and a hatchet; one on one side, one on the other: I
had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
Bame manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,
nVt made of goat'c »kinstoo; in one of which I hung
ly powder, in the other my shot: at my back I car-
ried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella; but
which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had
about me, next to my gun. As forvmy face, the co-
lour of it was really not so Mullatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard
I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quar-
ter of a yard long; but as I had both scissars and
razors sufficient, I had it cut pretty short, except what
grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a
large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had
?een worn by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee; foi
Hie Moors did not wearsuch, though the Turks did; of
these mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were
l<nig enough to hang my hat upon them; but they
were of length and shape monstrous enough, and such
as in England would have passed for frightful.
But all this is by the by ; for as to my figure, I had
bo few to observe me, that it was of no manner of
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In this
kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out
five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore,
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having nq
boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer
way, to the same height that I was upon before; when
looking forward to the point of the rock which lay
out, and which I was to double with my boat, as I
said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any
more there than in other places.
I was at a strange los.s to understand this, and re*
aolved to spend some time in the observing of it, to
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
: but I was presently convinced how it was; viz.
that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining
wilh the current of waters from some great nvei on
me shore, must be the occasion of this current, and
that according as the wind blew more forcible from
the west, or from the north, this current came near,
or went farther from the shore; for, waiting there-
abouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and
then the tide of the ebb being made, I plainly saw the
current again as before, only that it ran farther off,
being near half a league from the shore; whereas, m
my case, h set close upon the shore, and hurried me
in my canoe along with it, which at another time i(
would not have done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing
to do but observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spi-
rits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in,
that I could not think of it again with any patience;
but on the contrary, I took up another resolution-
which was more safe; though more laborious; and thh
uas, that I would build, or rather make me anoth©
periagua, or canoe; and so have one for one side &
the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one my little
forrification or tent, with the wall about it unoVr the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this ...me 1
had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the dries,
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall
pined to the rock, was all filled up with large earther,
pots, of which I have given an account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores ol
provision, especially my corn, some in the ear cut
>ff short from the straw, and the other rubbed out
with my hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, tnose piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view,
of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther with-
in the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of corn-ground ; which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest
in its season : and whenever I had occasion for mora
corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.
Besides this I had my country-seat, and I had now
a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had my
little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair;
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in con-
stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder stand-
ing always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at
first were no more than my stakes, but were now
grown very firm and tall: I kept them always so cut,
that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shad, which they did effec-
tually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread
over poles set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and
a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat
o cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to
be absent from my chief seat, I look up my county
habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle,
this is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an in-
conceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this
ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the
goats should break through, that I never left off, till
with infinite labour I had stuck the outside of the hedgo
so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there wai
*care room to put a hand through between them
which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as toe}
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong, like a wall, ii^leed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
thatl spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I
considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures
bus at my hand, would be a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and cheese, for me as long as I lived
in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them in my reach, depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that 1
might be sure of keeping them together; which by
this method indeed I so effectually secured, that when
these little stakes began to grow, 1 had planted them
so very thick, I was forced to pull some of them up
again.
In this place also T had my grapes growing, which
[ principally depended on for my winter store" ot
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re
freshing to the last degree.
As this was also about halfway between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally staid and iay here in my way thither; for
I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all
things about or belonging to her in very good order:
sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no
ore hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge
ugain bv the curren's, or winds, or any other acci
dent. But now I come to a new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprises with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand: I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparation ; I ljstenedt
44
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Hooked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any
thing; I went up to a rising ground to look fartner
I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was
all one, I could see no other impression but that one;
I went to it again to see if there were any more, and
to observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was
no room for that, for there was exactly the very prim
of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of foot; how ii
came thither I knew not, nor could in the least ima-
gine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like
a man perfectly confued, and out of myself, I came
hwne to my mortification, not feeling, as we say, the
ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and fancying eVery stump
at a distance to be a man; nor is it possible to de-
scribe how many various shapes an affrighted imagi-
nation represented things to me in; how many wild
ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and
what.strange unaccountable whimsies came into mv
thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
H ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued; whe-
ther I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, or
went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a door,
I cannot remember; for never frighted hare fled to
cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than
I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the nature
of such things, and especially to the usual practice of
all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I forme
nothing butdismal imaginations to myself, even though
I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied
it must be the devil; and reason joined in with me
upon this supposition. For how should any other
thing m human shape come into the place? Where was
the vessel thai brought them ? What marks were tluTe
of any other footsteps? And how was itpossiDie a man
should come there? But then to think thatSatan should
take human shape upon him in such a place where
there could be no manner of occasion for it, but tG
Jeave the print of his foot behind him, and that even
for no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it;) this was an amazement the other way; I con
sidered that the devil might have found out abundanc
of other ways to have terrified me, than this of th
single print of a foot; that as 1 lived quite on the oth
er side of the island, he would never have been so sim
pie to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
sand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon an
high wind would have defaced entirely. All this
seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with ali
notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil.
And I presently concluded that it must be some more
dangerous creature; viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the main land over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driv-
en by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have staid in
this desolate island, as 1 would have been to have
had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind,
J was very thankful in my thought, that I was so
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or thai
they did not see my boat, by which they would have
concluded, that some inhabitants had been in the
place, and perhaps have searched farther for me
Then terriole thoughts racked my imaginations about
fheir having found my boat, and that there were peo
pie here; and if so, I should certainly have thein
come again in groat numbers, and devour me; thai
S it should happen so that they should not find me.
/el they would find my enclosure, destroy all my com
carry away all my flock of tame goats and I slioule
perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; al*
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his powcrthe
Provision which he had made for me by his goodness,
reproached myself wiu my uneasiness, that I would
not sow any more corn one year, than would just
s.erve me till the next season, as if no accident could
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was
upon the ground. And this I thought so just a re-
proof, that 1 resolved for the future to have two or
three years corn beforehand, so that, whatever might
come, I might not perish for want of bread.
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! And by what secret differing springs are
the affections hurried about, asdifleringcircumstances 
present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate;
/o-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we
desire what to-morrow we fear; nay, even tremole at
the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me
fi.t this time in the most lively manner imaginable; foi
I, whose only affliction was, that I seemed banished
from human society, that 1 was alone, circumscribed
by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and
condemned to what I call a silent life; that 1 was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be number-
ed among the living, or to appear among the rest of
his creatures; that to have sesn one of my own spe-
cies, would have seemed to me a raising me from
ieath to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven it-
self, next to the supreme blessing of ^salvation, could
bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink
into the ground, at but the shadow, or silent appear-
ance of a man's having set his foot on the islsnd.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it af
forded me a great many curious speculations after
warns, when I had a little recovered my first sur
pris-:: I considered that this was the station of life
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had
determined for me: that as 1 could not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so J
was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his
creature had an undoubted right by creation to govern
and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and
who, as I was a creature who had offended him, had
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what pun-
ishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to
submit to bear his indignation, because I had sinned
against him.
I then reflected, that God who was not only right-
eous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to
punish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me;
that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my unques-
tioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely
to his will; and on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hobe in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates and directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay,
I may say, weeks and months; and one particulai
effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot
omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my bed, and
filled with tooughts about my danger from the appear-
ance of savages, I found it discomposed me very
much; upon which those words of the Scripture came
into my thought, "Call upon me in the day of trou-
ble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
me."
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first words that presented to
me were, u Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer
and he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait, 1 say, on
the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort
'.his gave me; and in return, I thankfully laid down
45
the book, and was no more sad, at least, not on that
occasion.
in the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, tha
all this might he a more chimera of my own, and that
this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I
came on shote from my boat. This cheered me up a
little too, and 1 began to persuade myself it was all a
delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might not I come that way from the boat, as
well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I
considered also, that I could by no means tell forcer-
tain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if at last this was only the print of my own foot, 1
had played the part of those fools, who strive to make
stories of spectres and apparations, and then are them
selves frighted^at them more than any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again ; for I had not stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provi-
sion; for I had little or nothing within doors, but
some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was
ray evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and in-
deed it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet
(and so I might be truly said to start at my own sha-
dow,) I began to go abroad again, and went to my
country-house to milk my flock: but to see with what
fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me,
how I was ready, every now and then, to .ay down
my basket, and run for my life; it would have made
any one have thought I was haunted with an evil
conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly
frighted; and so indeed I had.
However", as [ went down thus two or three days,
and haying seen nothing, f began to he a littlp bolder
And to think there was really nothing in it hut my
own imagination; but I could not persuade myself
fully of this, till I should go down to the shore again,
and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
jwn, and see if there was any similitude or fitness,
*hat I might be assured it«was my own foot. But
A'hen I came to the place first, it appeared evidently
.o me, that when 1 laid up my boat, i could not pos-
sibly be on shore any where thereabouts. Secondly,
when4 came to measure the mark with my own foot,
1 found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both
these things filled my head with new imaginations,
and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and I
went home again, filled with the belief, that some
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur-
prised before I was aware; and what course to take
for my security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when pos-
sessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of those)
means which reason oners for their relief. The first
thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my
enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the some, oi
the like booty; then to the simple thing of digging up
rny two corn-fields, that they might not find such a
grain there, and still to he prompted to frequent the
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of my habitation, and
be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tation, after I was come home again, while the appre
hfensions which had so over-run my mind were fresa
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrify
ing than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes
1 and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much
than the evil which we are anxious about; but, which
was worse than all this, 1 had not that relief in this
trouble from the resignation I used to practise, that f
hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who
complained not only that the Philistines were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for 1 did not
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to
God in my distress, and resting upon his providence,
as I had done before, for my defence and deliver-
ance; which if I had done, I had, at least, been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and
perhaps carried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and having
by the amusement of my mind been, as it were, tired,
and my spirits exhausted, f slept very soundly, and
awaked much better composed than I had ever been
before. And now I began to think sedately; and,
upon the utmost debate with myself, 1 concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful,
and no farther from the main land than as I had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine
that although there were no stated inhabitants who
lived on the spot; yet that there might sometimes
some boats off from the shore, who either with de-
sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven
by cross winds, might come to this place.
That 1 had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow or figure of any people be-
fore; and that if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.
That the most I could suggest any danger from
was from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills: so they made no stay here, but went off
again with all possible speed, seldom staving orw%
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of
the tides and day light back again; and that there-
fore I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case 1 should see any savages land upon
the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that 1 had dug my
cave so large, as to bring a door through again, which
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortifica-
tion joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering
this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti-
fication, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance
from my wall, just where I had planted a double row
of trees about twelve years before, of which 1 made
mention: these trees having been planted so thick
before, there wanted but a few piles to be driven be-
tween them, that they should be thicker and stronger,
and my wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about Jen feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it;" and through the seven
holes 1 contrived to plant the muskets, of which I
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship;
these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted
them into frames that held them like a carriage, that
so 1 could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time.
This wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of
them, leaving a pretty large space betweee them and

my wall, lhat T might have room to see ati eneun
and the}' might have no shelter from the young trees.
it they attempted to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove: and in
five or six years time I had a wood before my duel,
ling, grown so monstrous thick and strong that it was
indeed perfectly impassable: and no man of what
kind soever would, ever imagine that there was any
thing beyond it, much less an habitation : as for the
way I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left no
avenue), it was by setting two ladders ; one to a part
of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and
lett room to place another ladder upon that; so when
the two ladders were taken down, no man living could
come down to me without misehiefmg himself* and ii
they had come down, they were still on the outside
of my outer wall. *
Thus I look all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation'; and it will be seen
ftt length, that they were not altogether without just
leason ; though J foresaw nothing at lhat time more
than my mere fear suggested.
While this was doing, 1 was not altogether careless
tf my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon
ine for my little herd of goats; ihey were not only a
present supply to me upon every occasion, and began
to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder
and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting
after the wild ones; and 1 was loath to loose tbe a '-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse ur
over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them, one was to
find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where 1 m'mht keep about haif a
dozen young goats in each place, ; so that if anv dis-
aster happened to the flock in general, I might be abl<«
to raise them again with little trouble and time . and
this, though it would require a great deal of time and
labour, 1 thought wasthe most rational design.
Accordingly I spent some time, to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
xvish; for it was a little dam]) piece of ground in the*
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeav
ouring to come back that way from the eastern part
of the island • here I found a clear piece of land near
three acres, so si/rounded with woods, thai it was
almost an enclosure by nature: at least it did not
want near so much labour to make it so, as the other
pieces of ground 1 had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month's time 1 had so
fenced it round, that my (lock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
thev^feh'*' be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goals, and two he-goats to this piece;
and when there, I continued to perfect the fence, till
I had made it as secure as the other, which, however,
I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time
by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on account of the print ol
a man's foot which 1 had seen; for as yet, I never
saw any human creature come near the island, and
J had now lived two years under these uneasinesses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable
than it was before; as may well be imagined, by any
who know what it is to live in the consant snare ol
the fear of man; and this I must observe with griei
too, lhat the discomposure of my mind had too
great impressions also upon the religious part of my
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the
hand^of savages and cannihalslayso upon my spirits,
hac I seldom found myself in a due temper fo» ap
plication to m\ Maker , at least not with die sedate
calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to
do. I rather prayed to God as under great affliction
and pressure of mifid, surrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and de-
voured before the morning: and I must testify from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,
ove, and affection, is much more the proper frame
for prayer than that of tenor and discomposure < and
hat under the dread of mischief impending, a man is
io more fit for a comforting performance of the duty
of praying to God, then he is for repentance on a sick
bed; for these discomposures affeei the mind as the
others do the body; and the discomposure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that
of the body, and much greater; praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on : after I had thus secured one part oj
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and
looking out to sea, I thought ] saw a boat upon the
sea at a great distance; I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which 1
saved out of our ship-, but I had it not about me, and
this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able
to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I
do not know; but as I descended from the hill, I
eould see no more of it, so I gave it over; only 1
resolved to go n7> more without a perspective glass in
my pocket
When 1 was come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
prrsei tly convinced, that the seeing the print of a
mai 's foot, was not such a strange thing in the island
u.\ I imagined; and, but that it was a special provi-
:lence thai I was cast upon the side of the isfand where
the savages never came, T should easilv have known
that nothing was more froquent than for the canoe*
from the main, when they happened to be a little too
far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the isiaiuJ
for harbour; likewise, as they often met, and fough
in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prison
ers, would bring them over to this shore, where, ac-
cording to their dreadful customs, being all cannibal*
i hey would kill and eat them : of .which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I
said above, being the S. W. point of the island, J was
pefectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the
shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones
of human bodies; and particularly 1 observed a place
where there *had been a fire made, and a circle dug h.i
the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the
savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feast-
ings upon the bodies of their fellow-cre-atures.
I was so astonished with the sight, of these thmgsv
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it, for a long while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror < f the degeneracy ol
human nuture; which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; m^
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point ol
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach, and, having vomited with an uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on to
wards my own habitation.
When 1 came a little out of that part of the island
1 stood still a while as amazed; and then recovering
r.iyself, 1 looked up with the utmost affection ©f my
joul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave
God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where 1 was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these; and that though I had esteemed

n«y 4 resent condition very miserable, had yet given
r/-<, »n many comforts in it, that I had still more to
givv. thanks for than to complain of; and this above
oil, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before:
for I observed, that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could gel; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing
nere, and having often, no doubt been up in the co-
vered woody part of it, without finding any thing to
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost
eighteen years, and I never saw the least footsteps of
a human creature there before; and might be here
eighlegn more,as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if
I did "not discover myself to them, which I had no
manner of occasion to do, it being mv only business
to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
} found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
nake myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eat-
ing one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,
and kept close within my own circle fcr almost two
years after this: when I sa) my own circle, 1 mean
by it my three plantations, vix. my castle, my coun-
try-seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure
in the woods: nor did J look after this for any other
use than as an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing
the devil himself; nor did 1 so much as go to look
after my boat in all this lime, hut. he«an rather to
think of mafing me another; for I could not thii ,k oi
ever making any more attempts to bring the othei
boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with
some of those1 creatures at sea, in which, if I had
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people
began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and J
began to live just in the same composed manner as.
before; only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them,
and particularly, 1 was more cautious of firing my
gun lest any of them on the island should happen to
hear it; and it was therefore a very good provi
dence to me, that I had furnished myself with a tam*
breed of g3ats, that I had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any more of then after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before; so that for two years
after this, I believe 1 never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which was
more, as 1 had saved three pistols out of the ship, 1
always carried them out with me, or at least two ol
them, sticking them in my goatskin belt: I likewise
• furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
ion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a
great broadsword, hanging at my side in a belt, but
without a scabbard.
^ Things going on thus, as 1 have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re
duced to my former calm sedate way of living All
these things tended tc shew me mere and mole how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have made mv
j*ot. It pit me upon reflecting, how littlr repining
thei-e would be among mankind, at any condition id
life, if people would ratlier compare their condition
with those that are worse, in order to be thankjui,
than be always comparing them with those which Hie
better, to assist their murmuring* and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not realiy
many things which 1 wanted, so inneed I thought that
the frights I had been in about these savage wretches
'and tne concern 1 had been in for my own preserva
lion, had laken off the edge of my invention for my
own conveniences, and I had dropper) a good design,
which I had once bent my thoughts upon; and that
was, to try if I could not make some of my barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer:
this was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved
myself often for the simplicity of it, for I presently
saw there would be the want of several things neces-
sary to he making my beer, that it would be impos-
sible for me to supply: as. first, ca^ks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,
I could never compass: no, though 1 spent not many
days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to
no purpose. In the next place, i had no hops to
i^ake it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or
kettle to make it boil; -and yet, had not all these things
intervened, I mean the frights and terrors 1 v^asin
about the savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps
brought it to pass too; for J seldom gave any thing
over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in
my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another away; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their crue1
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up
a larger volume than this whde work is intended to
be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon in my thoughs, for the destroy
irtg these creatures nra least fri htenmgthem, soaf
to prevent their coming hither any more ; out ad was
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect un-
less I was to be there to do it myself; and what could
one man do among them, when perhaps there might
be twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and put in nve or si
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled tiiei
fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up a]
that was near it; but, as in the first place I should he
very loath to waste so much powder upon them, mv
store being now within the quantity of a barrel, si
neither could 1 be sure of its going off at any certain
time, when it might surprize them ; and, at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the lire about
their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make
them forsake the place; so I laid it aside, and then
proposed, that I would place myself in ambush in
some convenient place, with my three guns all double
loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony
let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound
perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling
in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword. I
made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should
kill them all: this fancy pleased my thoughts for
some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often dream-
ed of it; and sometimes, that I was just going to let
fiy at them in my sleep.
I went so far wfth it in my indignation, that I em-
ployed myself several days to find out proper places
to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for
them ; and I went frequently to the place itself, which
was now grown more familiar to me; and especially
while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of re-
venge, and of a bloody putting twenty of thirty o!
them to the sword, as I may call it; but the horror J
had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous
wretches devouring one another abated mv malac©
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Well, at .ength I found a place in the side of the
villi, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I
saw any of the boats coming, and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, convey
myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of which
there was an hollow laflge enough to conceal me en-
tirely; and where I might sit, and observe all then
bloody doings, and.tnke.rny full aim at their heads,
when they were so ciose'together, as that it would be
next to impossible that I should miss my shoot, or
i hat I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first shoot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design ; and
accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a
orace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol-bullets, and the fowling-piece
1 loaded with near an handful of swan-shot of the
largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about, four
bullets each : and in this posture, well provided with
ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared
myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I continu-
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of the
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about
three miles or more, to see if I could observe any
boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or. stand-
ing over towards it: but 1 began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had lor two or three months constant!)'
kept my watch ; but came always back without any
discovery, there having not in all tl>at time been tlu
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, bin
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every way.
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill tc
look out. so long also I kept up the vigour of my de
bign, an « my spirits seemed to be all the while in a
suitable f.-mif for so outrageous an execution, as the
killing twepcv or thirty naked savages for an offence,
which I had not at all entered into a discussion of ir.
my thoughts, any further than my passions were ai
first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems,
had been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposi-
tion of the wo-ld, to have no other guide than that oi
their own abominable and vitiated passions; and con-
sequently were left, and perhaps had been for some
«>es, to act such honid things and receive such dread-
ful customs, as nothing but natiue entirely abandoned
of 1 leaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy,
could have run them into; but now, when, as I have
said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion
which I had made so long, and so far, every morning
in vain ; so my opinion of the action itself began to
niter, and 1 began, with cooler and calmer thoughts,
to consider what it was I was going to engage in;
what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge
and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom
Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, un-
punished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execu-
tioners of his judgments-upon one another ; also, how
(\ir these'people were offenders against me, and what
right 1 had to engnge in the quarrel of that blood,
which they shed promiscuously one upon another. 1
debated this verv often with myself thus: How do I
know what God himself judges in this particular case?
It is certain these people do not commit this as a
crime ; it is not against their own consciences reprov-
ing, or their light reproaching them. They do not
know it to be an offence, and then'commit it in defi-
ance of divine justice 'is we do in almost all the sins
we commit. Thev think it no more a crime to kill a
captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor
to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When 1 considered this a little, it followed ne-
tessarily, that 1 was certainly in the wrong in it; that
these people were not murderers in the sense that 1
had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more
than those Christians wejpe murderers, who often put
to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fro*
quently, upon many occasions, put whole troops oi
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they
threw down their arms and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit tht£
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me ; these people
had done me no injury : that if they attempted mc,
or f saw it necessary for my immediate preservation
to fall upon them, something might be said for it; brJt
that I was yet out of their power, and they had really
no knowledge of me, and consequently no design
upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me
to fall upon them • that this would justify the conduct
of the Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in
America, where they destroyed millions of these
people, who. however they were idolators and bar-
rians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
these customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to
their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards verv inno-
cent people: and that the rooting them out of the coun-
try is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detes-
tation, even by the Spaniards themselves, at this time,
and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a
mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cru-
el t)', unjustifiable either to God or man : and such, as
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to
be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or
of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain
were particularly eminent for the product of a race of
men, who were without principles of tenderness, or
the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which iu
reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in the
mind.
These considerations really put me to a,_.pause, and
to a kind of a full stop; and t began by little and little
to be off of my design, and to conclude I had taken a
wrrongmeasure in my resolution to attack the savagesj
that it was not my business to meddle wjfh them, un-
less they first attacked me, and this it was my bust
ness, if possible, to prevent; but that if 1 were disco,
vered and attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
lo ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
rill every one that not only should be on shore at that
time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards,
if but one of their, escaped to tell their country people
what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows; and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in prin-
ciples nor in policy, I ought one way or other to con-
cern myself in this affair: that my business was by
all possible means to conceal myself from them, and
not to leave the least signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living creatures upon the island, I
mean of humnn shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I wa n
convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out o t
my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemei
for the destruction of innocent creatures I mean in-
nocent as to me; as to the crimevthey were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national punishments to make a just retri -
bution for national offences: and to bring public jndg*
ments upon those who offend in a public manner, by
such wave as best please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was
a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had not been
suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much rea-
son to believe would have been no Jess a sin than that
of wilful murder, if 1 had comitted it; and I gave
most humble thanks on*my knees to God, that had
thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching
him to gramme the protection of his Providence, that
I might not fall into the hands of borbarians ; or that
J might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had *
49
wore clear call from Heaven to <|o it, in defence of
my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year after
this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion foi
falling upon these wretches, that in a/1 thai time I
never once went up the hill to see whether there were
any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them
had been on shore there, or not; that 1 might not he
tempted lo renew any of my contrivances auaiust
them, or he provoked, hy any advantage which might
present itself, to fall upon them; only this I did I
went and removed my Ivoat, which I had on the otliei
*ide of the island, and carried it dow to the east end
of the whole island, and carried it down to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove
which I found under some high rocks, and where 1
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst
not, at least would not, come with their^boats upon
any account whatsoever.
With my hoat I carried away every thing that I had
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for
the hare going thither; viz. a mast and sail, which I
had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, hut in-
deed which could not he called cither anchor or grap-
ling; however, it was the best J could make of its
kind. All these I removed, that there might not he
the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance
of my boat, or of any habitation urjon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment, viz. to milk my she-
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which,
as it was quite jn the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger: for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of finding any thin?
here, and consequently never wandered off from the
coast; and I doubt not but they might have been
several time* on shore, after nw apprehensions oi
thern had made me cautious, as well as liefoce . and
udeed I looked hack with some horroi upou uic
thoughts of what my condition would have been, if 1
had chopped upon them, and Iveen discovered before
that when naked and unarmed, except with one gun,
and that loaded often only with small shot. 1 walk-
ed every where, peeping and peering about the island,
to see what I could get: what a surprise should I
have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a
man's foot, I had instead of that seen-fifteen or twen-
ty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by the
swiftness of their running, wo possibility of my escap
iug them!
The thoughts; of this sometimes sunk my very soiu
within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I
could not soon recover it; to think what I shouid
have done, and how [ not only should not have been
able to resist them, but even should not have had
presence of mind enough to do what I might have
done; much less what now, after so much conside-
ration and preparation, 1 might be able to do. In-
deed, after satious thinking of these things, I would
be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a
great whiie; but I resolved it at last all into thankful-
ness to 0*at Providence which had delivered me from
so m?..y unseen dangers, and had kept me from those
tnif^niefs, which I couid no way have been theagenl
i» delivering myself from; because I had not the least
otion of any such thing depending, or the least sup-
position of its being possible.
Thisrenewed a contemplation, which often had come
tc my thought in former time, whe first I began to see
the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
run through in this life, how wonderfully we are deli-
vered when we know nothing of it: how, when we are
in a quandary, (as we call it) a doubt or hesitation,
whether to go this way,or that way, a secret hint shall
direct usthis way, when we intended to go an other way;
nay,when sense,ourown inclination,and perhapsbusi'
oessthas called to go the other way,yet a strange impres-
sion ufoti the mind, from we know not what epjjoefr
*nd by we knew not what power, shall over-rule us to
50 this way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had
we gone that way which we would havegone, and even
to our imagination ought to havegone, we should have
been ruined and lost; uponihese, and many like re
flections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with rno,
that whenever I found those secret hints, or pressing
r.f my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that pre
vvnied, or to going this way or that way, I never fail
>?.<\ to obey the secret dictate; though I new no other
reason for it, than tnat such a pressure, or such an
hint, hung upon my mind : I could give many exam
pies of the success of this conduct in the course of my
life; but more especially in the latter part of my in
habiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of,
f I had seen with the same eyes then that I saw with
iow : but 'tis never loo late to be wise; and I cannot
>ut advise all considering men, whose lives are at-
fended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
•-Men though not so extraordinary, not to slight «uch
secret intimations of Providence, let them come from
ivhat invisible intelligence they will; that I shall not
discuss, and perhaps cannot account for ; but certainly
fhey are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the
<ecret communication between those embodied, and
those unemlwdied ; and such a proof as can never be
withstood: of which I shall have occasion to give
some very remarkable instances, in the remainder of
my solitary residence in this dismal place.
11* ieve the reader of this will not think it strange,
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers
I lived in, and the concern that was now upon me,
but an end to all invention, and to all the contrivance
that I had laid for my future accommodations ano
conveniences. 1 had the care of my safety more now
upon my hand than that of my food. 1 cared not to
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise 1 should make should be heard; much less would
I fire a gun, for the same reason; and. above all. I
was very uneasy at making any fire, ,est tne smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should
betray me; and for this reason I removed that part
of my business which required fire, such as burning
of pots and pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the
wood; where, after 1 had been some time, I found
to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where,
1 dare say, no savage, had he been in the mouth of it,
woulo be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would
any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
so much as a safe retreat
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, hy mere accident, (l would say, iJ
I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
things to Providence,) I was cutting down sorm
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and befor*
I go on, I must observe the reason of my making thit
charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as 1 said before; and yet 1 could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. ; so
I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
Jone in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, 1 preserved
the coal to carry hornet and pefbrm the other ser-
vices, which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.
But this by the by: while 1 was cutting down
some wood here* I perceived that behind a very thick
brancli of low brushwood, o* underwood, there wai
a kind of hollow place; I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty i,«o. the mouth of it I
round it was pretty la*ge> thai is to, say, sufficient for
me to stand upright in h>, and perhaps another with
mc; but I must confess to you, I made more haste
out than I did' in, when* looking.further Into the place
which was. perfectly dark, I sa,w two broad shinine
eyes of sores-weatwe,. whether devil; or man I knew
not; whjtf vcmWfcd; like- twa «a*s> the dim li^ht

ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRTJSOE.
from the cave's mouth shining directly in and making
the reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave
that was more frightful than myself; upon this, pluck-
ing up my courage, I took up a large firebrand, and
in I rushed agin, with the stick flaming in my hand -.
I had not gone three steps, in, but I was almost as
much frightened as I was before; for I heard a ver)
loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain ; and \l was
followed by a broken noise, as if of words half-ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again: 1 stepped back,
and was indeed struck with^such a surprise, that itpu»
me into a cold sweat; and if I had had an hat on my
head, I will not answer for it that my hair might
not have lifted it off. But still pluckingup my spirits
as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little,
with considering that the power ^ncl presence of God
was every where, and was able to protect me; upon
this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the
firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw
frying on the ground a most monstrous frightful old
he goat, just making hi.* will, as we say, gasping for
life, and dying indeed of mere old age."
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself, he might even
He there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if anv of them
should be so har-J) as to come in there, wnile he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but ha no manner or shape, either round 01
square, no hands navingever neen employed in mak-
lig it hut those of mere nature I observed also. tha<
there was a place at ihe farther side of it that wain
in farther, but so Jow, that it required me to creej'
.upon my hands and knees to get into it, and whithei
it went I knew not; &o having no candle, J gave ii
over for some time, but resolved to come again the
next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets,
with some wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for 1 made ver}
good candles now of goats tallow ; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all lours,
as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how far it might go, or what was beyond
it. When I was got through the straight, i found the
roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but
never was such a glorious sight seen on tnis island, J
dare say as it was, to look round the sides and rool
of this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles; what it
was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other pre-
cious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to
be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the fwbr was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was
no nauseous creature to be seen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the sides of the roof; the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as
it was a place of security, and such a retreat as 1
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I
was really rejoiced1 at the discovery, and resolved,
without any delay, to bring some of those things which
w was most anxious about to this, place; particularly,
I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,
and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for 1
had three in all) and three muskets; (for of them I
had eight in all) so I kept at mv castle only five, which
itood ready mounted like pieces of cannon, on my
utmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon
any expedition. *
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
1 found, that the water bad penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre oJ the cask •
and this was an agreeable discovery to me at that
time; so I eariied all away thither, never keeping
above two or three pounds of powder with me in my
castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind . I also car-
ried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the autient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the
ro^.ks. where none could come at them; for 1 per-
suaued myself while I was here, if five hundred sava-
ges wore to hunt me, they could never find me out; ot
if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in th«
mouth cf the cave the next day after 1 made this dis-
covery; and 1 found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw hhn in, and cover him with
earth, tnan tu diag him out; so 1 interred him there,
to prevent oftence to my nose.
1 was now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could 1 have hot enjo3'cd
khe certainty that no savages would come to the place
no disturb me, 1 could have been content to have ca-
pitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even
lothe last moment, till I had laid me down and died,
like the old goat, in the cave: 1 had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made
the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal
than it did before; as, first, I had taughrray Pol, as
\ noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly,
ann talked so articulately and plain, that it was very
pleasant to me; and he 'lived with me no less then
six-andtwenty years; how long he migh live after-
wards I knew not; though I know they have a notion
in the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; per-
haps some of my Polls may l>e alive there still, calling
after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish no Eng-
lishmen the ill luck to come there and hear them;
h'it if he did, he would certainly believe it was the
d-jviL My dog was a very pleasant and loving com-
panion to me for no less than sixteen years of my
time, and then died of mere old age ; as for my cats,
they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree,
that'I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to
keep them from devouring me, and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving
them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two
or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose
young, when they had any, 1 always drowned, and
these were part of my family : besides these, I always
kept two or three household kids about me, which* I
taught to feed out of my hand; and I had also more
parrots which talked pretty well, and would all call
Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed,
did I take the pains with any of them that T had done
with him: I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose
names 1 know not, which I caught upon the shore,
Htv\ cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had
planted before my castle wall, being now grown up
*o a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among
these low trees, and bred there, which was very agree-
able to me; so that, as I said above I began to be
very well contented with the life 1 led, if innight but
have been secured from the dread of savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to
make this just observation from it, viz.. How frequent-
ly, in the course of our ih"»s, tne evil, which in itself
we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen
fnto, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very
neans or door of our deliverance, by which alone we
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen
into. I could give many examples of this in the
course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was
it more particularly remarkable, than in the circum-
stances of my last years of solitary residence in this
island.
It was now the month of December, as I said above,
in my twenty-third year ; and this being the southern
solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular
time of my harvest, and required my being pretty
much abroad in the fields; when going out pretty
early in the morning, even before it was thorough
day-light, I was surprised with seeing a light of
some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of
about two miles, towards the end of the islands, where
I had observed some savages had been, as before ; but
not on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it
was on my side of the island.!
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,;
lest T might be surprised; and yet I had no more j
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find
my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediately conclude that
there were people in the place, and wouldJhcn never
give over till they.found mc out. In this extremity
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the lad-
der after me, having made all things without look as
wdd and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pis-
tols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp;
Dot forgetting seriously to recommend myself to th«
divine protection, and earnestly to pravtpGod to de
ver me out of tne nands of the barbarians; and in
this posture I continued about two hours, but began
to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for
had no spies to send out.
After sitting awhile longer, and musing what 1
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so sitting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I ob-
served before, and then pulling tire ladder up aftei
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the
hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had
taken on purpose, 1 laid me down flat on my belly on
the ground, and began to look for the place. I
presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made; not
to varm them, for they had no need of that, the wea-
ther being extreme hot; but as I supposed, to dress
some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which
they had brought with them, whether alive or dead 1
could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
haled up upon the shore ; and as it was then tide o(
ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially see-
ing them come on my side the island, and so near mc
too; but when I observed their coming must be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards
to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that 1
might go abroad with safety all the time of tide ol
flood, if they were not on shore before; and having
made this observation, 1 went abroad about my har
vest work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take boat,
and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away ; I should
have observed, that for an hour and more before they
went off; they went to dancing, and I could easil)
discern their postures and gestures by my glasses; I
could only perceive, by my nicest observation, U-'
they were stark naked, and had not the least cover-
ing upon them ; but whether they were men or women,
that 1 could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard ; and with all the speed I was able to make,
i went away to the hill, where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither
which was not less than two hours, (for I could not go
apace, being so loaded with arms as I was,) I per-
ceived there had been three canoes more of savage?
on that place; and looking out further, I saw ihey
were all at sea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when,
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of
horror which the dismal vork they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by
those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the s;ght, that I began now
to premeditate the destruction of the next that 1 saw
there, let them be who or how many poever.
It seemed evidfent to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of their,
came on shore there again; that is to say, I nevei
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all t
that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are-
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all
this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the
constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon
me by surprise; from whence I observe, that the ex
pectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering
especially if there is no room to shake off that ex
pectation or those apprehensions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and look up most of my hours, whicn should
have been better employed, in contriving how to cir-
cumvent and fall, upon them the very next time 1
should see them ; especially it they should he dividerf,
as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did
I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose
ten or a dozen, 1 was still the next day, or week, or
month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infi-
nitum, till I should be at length no less a murderer
than they were in being men-eaters, and perhaps
much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fah
into the hands of those merciless creatures; if I did
at any time venture abroad, it was not without look-
ing round me with the greatest care and caution ima-
ginable; and now I found, to my great comfort, how
happy.it was that I had providel a tame flock or
herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any account, fire
my <fm, especially near '..hat side of the island, where
they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages;
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have
them come back again, with perhaps two or three
hundred canoes with *hem in a few days, and then I
knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages,* and then
I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice, but
either they made no stay, or, at least, I did not hear
them; but in the month of May, as near as I couid
calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had
a very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen &r
sixteen mouths interval, was very great; I slept un-
quiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day great
troubles overwhelmed my mind ; in the night I dream-
ed often of killing the savages, and the reason whv
1 might justify the doing of it. But to wave all this
for awhile, it was in the middle of May, on the sir-
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
tlar would reckon, for I marked all i/rwn the posi
still; I say, it was on the sixteeum of Mar that ii
blew a great storm of wind all day, with a g*'>at deal
of» lightning and thunder, and a very foul nigr wat-
after it; I know not what was the particular occasion
of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken
up with serious thoughts about my present condition,
I was surprised with the noise of a gun as 1 thought,
fired at. sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before ; for the no
lions this put into my thoughts were quite of another
kind : I started up in the greatest haste imaginable ,
»nd in a trice clapped up my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount-
ing it the second time, got to the top of the hill; that
very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second
gun, which accordingly in about half a moment 1
heard, and by the sound knew that it was from that
part of the sea where I was driven out with the cur-
rent in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns foi
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this
presenceofmindatthatminuteastothink.that though
1 could hot help them, it may be they might help me;
so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on
fire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and blazed
freelv, and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there was any
such ihtngas a ship, they must need see it, and no
doub they did; for as soon as ever my fire biased up
I hes *ti another gun, and after that several others, all
from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long,
rill day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a gieat distance
at sea full east of the island, whether a sail, or an
hull. I coul not distinguish, no not with my glasses,
the distance was so great avia the weatoer stiil some
thing hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
Ilooked frequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move ; so I presently concluded
that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, yoi
may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in in)
hand and ran towards the south-east side of the island,
to the rocks, where I had been formerly carried awaj
with the current; and getting up there, the weather
oy this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast away in
the night upon those concealed rocks which I found
when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my
recovering then from the most desperate hopeless con-
dition that ever I had been in all my life.
Thus,, what is one man's safety is another man's de-
struction ; for it seems these men, whoever they were,
being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being
wholly under water, had been drived upon them in
the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. N. E.
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup
pose they did not, they must as I thought, have endea-
voured to have saved themselves on snore by the help
of their boat; but tbe firing of their guns for help,
especially when they 6aw, as I imagined, my fire,
filled me with many thoughts: first, I imagined, that,
upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves
into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the
hore; but that the sea going very high, they might
have been cast away; other times I imagined, that
they might have lost their boat before, as might be
the case many ways; as particularly, by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times obligee
nien to stave, or take in pieces their boat; and some-
times to throw it overboard with their own hands ,
other times I imagined, they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them uo, and carried them
oft , other whiles 1 fancied they were all gone off to
sea in their boat, and being hurried away by thecur-
*ent that I had been formerly in,.were carred out into
the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery
and perishing; and that perhaps they might by this
ime think of starving, and of being in a condition to
nat one another.
All these were but conjectures at best, so, in th«
condition I was in, 1 could do no more than look
j-pon the misery of the poor men, and pity them;
ivhich had still this good effect on my side, that itgave
me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who
had so happily and comfortably provided for me in
my desolate condition; and that of two ships' compa-
nies who were now cast away upon this part of the
world, not one life should be spared but mine. I
learnt here again to observe, that it is very rare that)
die providence of God casts us into any condition of
life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see
something or other to be thankful for, and may see
others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case^of these men, of whom
! could not so much as see room to suppose any o/
Uiem were saved; nothing could make it rational, so
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish
there, except the possibility only of their being taken
up by another ship in company: and this was but
mere possibility indeed ; for I saw not the least signal
or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
rhat a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I felt
in my soul upon this sight; breaking out sometimes
thus: "O that there had been but one or two, nay,
but one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to
me, that I might but have had one companion, one
fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to have
conversed with!" In all the time of my solitary life,
I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the sa-
nely of my fellow-creatures or so deep a regret a»
the want of it
There are some secret moving springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set a going by some ob*
;ect in view, or be it some object though not in view,
yet rendered present to the mind by the power of
imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its
impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the
object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
, Such were these earnest wishings, "That but on«
wan had been saved ! O that it had been but one !" J
believe I repeated the words, "O that it had been
but one !" a thousand times; and my desires were so
moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms
of my hands, that if I had had any soft thing in my
hand, it would have crushed it involuntarily; and
my feeth in my head would strike together, and set
against one another so strong, that for some time I
coula not part them again.
Let the natunlists explain these things, and the rea-
son and manner of them: all I can say of them is to
describe the fact, which was ever surprising to me
when I found it, though I knew not. from what u
should proceed; it was doubtless the affect of ardent
wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, rea-
lizing the comfort which the conversation of one ol
my fellow-christiane would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or
both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being on
this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship, or no; and had only the affliction
some days after to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck; he had on no clothes but a sea-
man's waiscoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue ltnen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of: he had no-
thing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a
tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten times more
rttlue than the first.
It was now calm and I had a great mind to venture
53
crui in my ooat to this wreck, not doubting but J
might find something on board that might be u^fuJ
to me; but that did not altogether press me so'much,
as the possibility that there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life I might not only save,
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to
the last degree: and this thought clung so to my heart,
that f could not be quiet night nor day, but I musi
venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and
committing the rest to God's providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind, that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to
myself if 1 did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
hack to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh
water, a compass to steer f>y, a bottle of rum, (for 1
had still a great deal of fhat left) a basket full oi
raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out
of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her,
and then went home again for more: my secena
cargo was a great bag full office, the umbrella to set
up over my head for -made, another large pot full o/
tresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,
or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle o/
goat's milk, and a cheese: all which, with great la-
bour and sweat, I brought to my boat; and prayina
to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing
or paddling the canoe along the shore, I came at last
to the utmost point of the island, on that side, viz.
N. E. And now 1 was to launch out into the ocean,
and either to venture, or not to venture; I looked oil
the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very
terible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard
t had been in before, and my heart began to fail me:
for I feresavv, that if I was driven into eithr of the s*
currents I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island
again ; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any
little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably
iost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
so give over my enterprise, and having haled my boat
«nto a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat
me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very pen
sive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my
voyage; when, as I was musing, 1 could perceive that
the tide was turned, and the flood came on, upon
which my going was for so many hours impracticable:
this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up
to the highest piece of ground I could find, and ob-
serve, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents
lay, when the flood came in, that I might jud^e
whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the same
rapidness of the currents, this thought was no
sooner in my head, but I cast my eyes upon a little
hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways
and from whence 1 had a clear view of the currents'
or sets of the tide, and which way 1 was to .'uide
myself in my return: here I found, that as the current
of the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the
shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the north of the island in my return
and I should do well enough.'
-Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide ; and
feposing myself for that night in the canoe, undei
the great watch coat 1 mentioned, I launched out I
made first a litte out to sea full north, till I he«an to
feel the benefit of the current, which sat eastward and
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not sm
hurry me as the southern side current hail done before
and so as to take from me nil government of th •
boat; but having a strong steerage with niv paddle i
<ve»f say, at a great rate, directly for the wieck*
and in less than two hours I came up to it.
Jt was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
f>y its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her was
beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle,
which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great vio-
lence, her main-mast and fore-mast were brought by
the board, that is to say, broken short off, but her
boltsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon
her, which, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and
as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come
to me: and I took him into the boat, but found him
almost dead for hunger and thirst: f gave him a cake
of my bread, and lie ate like a ravenous wolf that
had been starving a fortnight in the snow : I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if i
would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this 1 went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with theiv armn 'ast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed 'probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke
so high, and so continually over her, that tie men
were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they
had been under water Besides the dog, there was
nothing left in the ship that had life, nor ar.y goods
that I could see, but what were spoiled by th>s water:
diere were some casks of liquor, whether wine oi
jrandy I knew noi, which lay lower in the hold, and
-vhich, the water being ebbed out, I could see; bu
'hey were too big to meddle with: I saw several che^
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen,
and I got two of them into the boat without examin-
ing what was in them.
ha3 tre ?tern of the ship been fixed, and the l^r«
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a
tood /o^dgT ; for by what I found in these two chests,
I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal ol
wealth on board ; and if I may guess by the course
she steered, she must have been bound from the Bue-
nos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part oi
America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havanna, in the
Gulph of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: she had
no doubt, a great treasure in her, bur. of no use at tha.
sime to any body; and what became of the rest o,
her people 1 then knew not
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full a
liquor, of about twenty gallons, whichl got into m\
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
lour pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets, I
had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the
powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which
I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,
a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and
with this cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide
beginning to make home again; and the same even-
ing, about an hour within night, J reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning
[ resolved to harbour what I had gotten in' my new
cave, not to carry it home to my^castle. After re-
freshing myself, I got all my cargoon shore, and bean
to examine the particulars: the cask of liquor I found
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
Brasils; and, in a word, not all good; but when I
came to open the chests, I found several things which
I wanted: for example, I found in one a fine case of
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cor-
dial waters, fine, and very good , the bottles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver
J found two pots of very good suecades, or sweet
meats, so fastened aboon the top, that the salt water
had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, which'
'he water had spoiled: 1 found some very good shVrts,
which were very welcome to me, and about a dozen
«ud a hall of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured
neckcloths; the former were al90 very welcome, being
exceeding refreshing to wipe my face jn a hot day.
Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, ]
found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one
of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold,
and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose
they might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, bu
of little value; but by the circumstances, it must hav«
belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was no powder
m it, but about two pounds of glazed powder in the
three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowl-
ing-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got verv
little by this voyage that was of much use to me; for,
as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it;
it was to me as the dirt under my feet; and 1 would
have given it all for three or four pair of English
shoes and stockings which were things I greatly want
ed, but had not had on my feet now for many years:
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which 1
took off the feet of the two drowned men whom 1
saw in the wreck ; and I found two pair more in one
of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but
they wer'e n * like our English shoes, either for ease
or service, being rather what we call pumps than
shoes. I found in the seamen's chest about fifty pie-
ces of eight in royals, but no gold : I suppose this be-
longed to a poorer man than the other, which seemed
to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as 1 had done that before, which
I brought from our own ship; but it was great pity,
as I said, that the other part of the ship had not come
to my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded
my canoe several times over with money, which, if 1
had ever escaped to England, would have lain here
safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them. I went back to niv boat and rowed oi
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, whore
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my
old habitation, where I found every thing safe and
quiet; so I began-4o repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and lake care of rny family affairs; and foi
awhile I lived easy enough; only that I was more vi
gilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did
not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did sti
, with any freedom, it was always to the east part of
the island, wherel was pretty well satisfied the savages
neve/ came, and where I could go without so many
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition
as 1 always carried with me, if I went the other way.
I lived in this conditio.! near two years more; but
my unluck}' head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it
were possible, I might get away from this island ; for
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reason told me, that there was no-
thing left there .worth the hazard of my voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and
f believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from
Police in, I should have ventured to sea, bound any
where, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for aught J know, one half of their
miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfied with
Hie station wherein God and nature hath placed them;
or, not to look back upon my primitive condition,
and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition
to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
fubsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition
for had that Providence, which so happily had seated
me at the Brasilsas a planter, blessed me with con-
fined desires, and coukf I have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time, 1
mean in the time of my being on this island, one ol
die most considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, 1
am persuaded, that by the improvements I iiad mad<
in that little time I lived there, and the increase 1
should probably have made if I had stayed, I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores; n'ntf
what business had I to leave a settled forture, well
(Stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to tun-
supercargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patienci
and time would have so increased our stock ar. homa
that we could have bought them at our own doois
from those whose business it was to fetch them? Aw
though it had cost us something more, yet the difTe/
ence of that price was by no means worth saving a
so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
co reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought expe-
rience of time; and so it was with me now ; and yet,
so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was
continually poring upon the means and possibility of
my escape from this place; and that I may, with the
greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remain-
'ng part of my story, it may not be improper to give
f;ome account of my first conceptions on the subject
of this foolish scheme for my escape; and how, and
upon what foundation, I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fr'gate
laid up, and secured underwater as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before; I had mor*
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at ah
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the In-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came hither.
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the fonr-and-twentieth year of my first setting
foot in this island of solitariness, I was lying in my
bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health, had
no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no,
nor any uneasiness of mind more ihan ordinary, but
could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to
sleep; no, not a wink ah ^ight long, otherwise than
as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set down the innu-
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this
night's time: I ran over the whole history :f my life
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to
my coming to this islam*, and also of that part of my
life since I came to this island; in my reflections upon
the state of my case, since I came on shore on this
island; i was comparing the happy posture of my af-
fairs, in the first years of my habitation here, to that
course of anxiety, fear and care, which I had lived in
ever since 1 had seen the print of a foot in the sand;
not that I did not believe the savages had frequented
the island even all the while, ^nd might have been
several hundred of them at times on the shore there;
but as I had never known it, and was incapable ol
any apprehensions about it, m^ satisfaction was per-
fect, though my danger was the same; and I was as
happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had never
really been exposed to it; this furnished my thoughts
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly
this one: How infinitely good that Providence is,
which has settled in its government of mankind such
narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things;
and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him,
would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept
serene and calm, by having the events of things hid
from his eyes and knowing nothing of the danger*
which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained
me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real dange*
I had been in for so many years in this very island;
and how I had walked about in the greatest security,
and with all possible tt Anquility, even perhaps when
nothing but a brow on a hill, a great tree or the ca
sua) approach of night, had been between me and tb«
55
•vorst kind of destruction, viz. that of Tailing into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have
seized on me with the same view as 1 did on a goat
or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to
kill and dev »ur me, than I did of a pigeon or curlew.
I should unjustly slander myself, if I should say 1
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, tc
whose singular protection I acknowledger I, with great
humility, that all these unknown deliverances were
due, and without which I should inevitably have fal-
len into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up hi considering the nature of these
wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it
came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor oi
ail tilings should give up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity, nay, to something so' much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind ; but as this
ended in some (at that time fruitless) speculations, it
occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what they ventured so far from
home for; what kind of boats they had ; and why 1
might not order myself, and my business so, that
I might be as able to go over thither, as they were to
come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of me if I fell into the hands oi
the savages; or how I should escape from them, it
ihey attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked
by some or other of them, without any possibility ol
delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their
hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I
shouVd bend my course : none of these thoughts, I say,
so much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in
., \ '-)oit to the main land. 1 looked back upon nit
present condition as the most miserable lhat couhl
possibly lie; that I was not able to throw myself into
any thing but death that could be called worse; that
if I reached the shore of the main, I might, perhaps
meet with relief; or I might coast along, as 1 did on
the shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
Loutvtry, and where I might find some relief; and aft6i
11, perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian shif
that might take me in; and if the worst came to the
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all
these miseries at once. Pray, note all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made,
as it were, desperate by the long continuance of my
troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the
wreck 1 had been on board of, and where I had been
go near the obtaining of what I so earnestly longed for,
viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where I was, and of the pro-
bable means of my deliverance; 1 say, 1 was agitated
wholly by these thoughts. All my calm of mind in
my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue
of the disposition of Heaven, seemed to be suspended 
and 1 had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughu
t.o any thing but the project of a voyage to the main .
which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with such violence that it set my very blood
into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer-
vour of my mind aLout it; nature, as if I had been
fatigued arid exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a sound sleep: one would have thought
I should have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of
any thing relating to it; but I dreamed, that as 1 was
going out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, 1
saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savage?
coming to land, and that they brought with them an-
other savage, whom they were going to kill, in ordei
lo eat him; when on a suddea, the savage that it c>'
were going to KiK jumpea away, and ran or his life:
'.hen I thought in my sleep, that he came running into
my little thick grove, before my fortification, to hide
himself; and that 1 seeing him alone, and not perceiv
ing that the others sought him that way, shewed my-
self to him, and, smiling upon him, encouraged him.-
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to
assist him; upon which I shewed my ladder, made
him go up it, and carried him into my cave, and he
became my servant; and that as soon as I had got
this man, I said to myself, "Now I may certainly
venture, to the main land ; for this fellow will serve me
as a pilot, and v/ill tell me what to do, and whither
to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of
being devoured; what places to venture into, and
what to escape. I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the
prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disap-
pointments which i felt upon coining to myself, and
finding it was no more than a dream, were equally
extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was if possible, to get a savage in my possession;
and if possible, it should be one of their prisoners
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill: but these thoughts still were at-
tended with this difficulty, that it was imj>ossible to
effect this, without attacking a whole caravan ofth^m,
ind killing them all; and this was not only a very des-
perate attempt, and might miscarry ; but, on the other
hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to
me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding
so much blood, though it was for my deliverance : I
weed not repeat the arguments which occurred to mo
against this, they being the same mentioned before:
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz. that
chose men were enemies to my life, and would devour
tne if thev couli that it wasself-nreservarion. in tha
nignest degree, to deliver myself from this deatn c i a
life, and was acting in my own defence, as much as
if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; 1
say, though these things* argued for it, yet the thoughts
of shedding human blood for my deliverance were
very terrible to me, and such as 1 could by no means
reconcile myself to a great while.
However, at last, alter many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it, (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time,) the eager prevailing desires of
deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I re-
solved, if possible, to get one of these sai ages into my
hands, cost what it would •. the next thin {then was to
contrive how to do it; and this indeed v as very diffi-
cult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no pro-
bable means for it, so I resolved to put jiyself upon
the watch to see them when they came ,m shore, and
leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as the
opportunity should present, let it be what ». would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, \ s<H myself
upon the scout as often as possible, and ii deid so
often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it \\\* above
a year and a half that I waited, and for a j:re^t part
of that time went out to the west end, aiui vo the
south-west corner of the island, almost every dav, to
see the canoes, but none appeared. This was very
discouraging, and began to trouble me much; though
I can't say that it did in this case, as it had done st.me
time before that, viz. wear of the edge off my desire
to the thing; hut the longer it seemed to be delayed,
die more eager 1 was for'it: in a word, I was not at
first more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager
to be upon them.
Resides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to mako
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any
time, to do me any hurt It was a g\eat while that 1

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
pleasfid myself with this affair, but nothing still pre-
tented; all my fancies and schemes eame*o nothing,
for no savages came near me for a great while1.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, sis it were,
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occa-
sion to put them in execution, I was surprised one
morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes all
on shore together, on my side the island, and the peo-
ple who belonged to them all landed, and out of m\
sight: the number of them oroke all my measures
for seeing so many, and knowing that they always
came four, or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, 1
could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-hand
cd; so I lay still in my castlo, perplexed and discom
forted; however, I put myself into all the same pos
tures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and
was just ready for action, if any thing had presented.
Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any noise; at length being very impatient, I set
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up
to the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual,
standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they could not percieve me by
any means. Here I observed, by the help of my per-
spective glass, that they were no less than Jiirty ir,
number; that they had a fire kindled, and that they
had had meat dressed; how they cooked it, that I
knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing
in I know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the fire.
When 1 was thus looking on them, I.perceived by
my perspectives two miserable wretches dragged horn
the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, ami
were now brought out for the slaughter: I perceived
one of them immediately fall, being knocked down, I
suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for tha* was
their way; and two or three others were at work im-
mediately, cuuing him open fur their cookery, whil*
the other victim was left standing by himself, till the
should be ready for htm. In that very moment thi
poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he'Started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along
the sands, directly towards me. 1 >nean towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that 1 must acknowledge
*-hen I perceived him to run my way ; and especially
when, as I thought, { saw him pursued by the whols
body; and now J expected that pan of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my grove: but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz. that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, 1 kept my station, and my
spirits began to recover, when I found that there were
not above three men that followed him; and still
more was 1 encouraged, when I found that he out-
gtriptthem exceedingly in running, and gained ground
of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an
hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away front
them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and thit
5 knew ru, must necessarily swim over, or the pooi
wretch would be taken there: but when the savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
•he tide"was then up; but plunging in swam throu<-lt
Six about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, arri
ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When
t'ue three pursuers came to the creek. I found that two
tf them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he, standing on the other side, looked at the other,
but went no farther; and soon after went softly back
again, which, as it happened, was very well for him
in the main.
I observer!, thi. the two1 who swam were yet mere
than twice as long -rimming over llie eseel4 tiiau <*'*
fefiWw was that fled from them. It came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed hrcsistibly,
that now was my time to get a servant and peihaps a
companion or asaitant, and that 1 was called plainly
by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I im
mediately got down the ladders with all possible ex-
pedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both atf
Che foot of the ladder, as I observed above ; and get-
ting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill
I crossed towards the sea; and having a very short
cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way be-
tween the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud
to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first per
haps as much frighted at me as at them ; but 1 beckon-
ed with my hand to him to come back: and in the
neantime I slowly advanced toward the two that fol-
'owed; then rushing *at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece; I was
.'oath to fire, because 1 would not have the rest hear,
though at that distance it would not have been easily
beard; and being out of sight of the smoke too, they
would not have easily known what to make of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pur-
sued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I
advanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer,?
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to
shoot at him first; which I did, and killed him at the
first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped,
though he saw both his enemies fallen', an<d killed, (as
rre thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise
of my piece, that he stood stock-stift, and iwither came
forward nor went backward, though he seemed rathe*
uclmeri to fly still, then tocomeon. 1 hallooed again
to him, and made signs to come forward, which he
easily understood, and came a little way, then stopped
again, and then a little farther, and stopped again;
ind I could then perceive that he sfood trembling, as
if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to
•ie killed as his two enemies were. I beckoned him
again to come to me, and give him all the signs ofey>
couragement that I could think of; and he came nearea
and nearer, knee>"n>g down every ten or twelve steps,
in token of acknowledgement for saving his life. I
smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still jvearer. At length he came closa
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kisser! the
ground, and kid his head upon the ground, and taking
me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, i
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for
ever. 1 took him up, and made much of him, an<$
encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet; for I perceive.) the savage, whom I
knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the
blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to
him and shewed him the savage, that he was not
dead: upon this he spoke some words to me; and
though I could nou understand them, yet I thought
they were pleasant tohcar,forthey werethe first sound
of a man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted*
for above frve-and-twenty years. But there was nn
time for such reflections now; the savage, who wa*
knocked down, recover) himself so far as to sit \\f
upon the ground ; and I perceived that my savage be-
gan to be afraid; but when 1 saw that, I presented
my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him:
upon this rny savage, for so I called him now, madea
motion to me to'lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side: so 1 did: he no sooner
had h, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut'
)ff his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany
could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one, who, f had reason to believe,
never saw a sword in bis life before, except their own
wooden sword's: however, it seems, as I learnt after-
wards they make their wooden swords so sharp, so
heavy, mu\ the wood is so hard, that they will cut of!
heads even with them, nay, and arms, and that at one
blow too. When he had (tone this, he comes laughing
vj me in si&n of truunuh, and brought me the swojd
57
€gam, ana*, with abundance of gestures, which I dW
not understand, laid it dowji, with the head of the
lavages that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was, to know
how I had killed the other Indian so far off; so point-
ing to him, he made signs 10 me to let him go to him
«o I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came
to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him;
turned him first on one side, then on t'other; looked
at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no
great quantity of blood had followed ; but he had bled
inwardly, for he was quite dead. Then he took up
his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to
go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making
signs to him that more might come after them.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again tc
hirn to do so. • He fell to work, and in an instant he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, bif.
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into
it, and covered him, and did so also by the other; J
believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an
hour : then calling him away, I carried him not to m}
castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther
part of the island; so I did not let my dream come tr
pass in that part; viz. that he came into my grove
for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins tr
•at, and a draught of water, which I found he wai
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and hav
ing refreshed him, I made signs for him to go to lif
down and sleep; pointing to a place where I had laio
a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it,
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so thf
poor creature lay down and went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, with straight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-hi*
years of age. He had, a very good countenance, not
a fieice and surly .aspect, but seemed to have some
thing very manly irthis face, and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too,,especially when he smiled: his hair was
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead
very high anNd large, and a great vivacity and spark
ling sharpness in his eyes. The colourof his skin wa
not quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an
ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the ^rasilians and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but c fa
bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had it it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to de-
scribe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, not flat like the Negroe's, a very good mouth,
thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and white as
ivory. After he had slumbered, rather than slept,
about half an hour, he waked again, and comes out of
the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats,
which I had in the enclosure just by; when he espied
me, he caine running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the possible signs oi
an humble thankful disposition,, making many antic
gestures to shew it. At last he lays his head flat upon
the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this,
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much he
would serve me as long as he lived. I understood
him in many things, and let him know I was very
well pleased with him. In a little time I began to
speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first,
I made him know his name should be Friday, which
was the day I saved his life; and I called him so for
the memory of the time ; I likewise taught him to say
Master, and then let him know that was to be my
name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and
to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk
m an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
bim, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake
•f bread jp do the like, which he quickly complied
with, and made signs that it was very good foi him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let
him know 1 would give him some clothes; at which
he seemed very glad, for he was stark-naked. As we
went by the place where he had buried the two men,
he pointed exactly to the spot, and shewed me the
marks that he had made to find them again, making
signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat
them: at this I appeared very angry, expressed my
abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him ro
come away, which he did immediately, with great
submission. I then let him up to the top of the hill,
to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
had been, but no appearance of them, or of their
canoes; so that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I look my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his
back, which I found he could use very dexterously,
making him carry one gun for me, and I two for my- •
self, and away we marched to the place where these
creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the
place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my
heart sunk within me at the horrpr of the spectacle .
indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,
though Friday made nothing of it: the place was co-
vered with human bones, the ground'dyed with the
blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-
eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, in short, all the
tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legi
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies
and Friday, by his signs made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to
nimself, was the fourth; that there had been a great
battle between them and their next king, whose sub-
jects, it seems, he had been one of; and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, all which were car-
ried to several places by those that had taken them in
the flight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh,
and whatever remained, and lay them together on an
heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn them
to ashes. 1 found Friday had still an hankering
stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a canni-
bal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least ap-
pearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I
had, by some means, let him know that I would kill
him if he offered it. n
When we had done this, we came back to out
castle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers',
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I
made him a jerkin of goat's skin as well as mv skill
would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good
Uilor; and I gave him a cap, which I had made of a
nare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough .
and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably
well, and mighty well was he pleased to see himself
almost as well clotheo* as his master. It is true he
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside
of his arms; but a little easing them, where he com-
plained they hurt him, and using himself to them, at
rngth he took to them very welL
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
The next day after I came home to my hutch wilh
him, I begar. to consider where 1 should lfcdge him;
and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfeclty
easy myself I made^a little tent for him in the vacant
place between my'two fortifications, in the inside uf
the last, and »n the outside of the first: and as there
was a door or entrance there into my cave, 1 made a
formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards,
and set it up in the passage, a little within the en-
trance; and causing the door to open to the inside, \
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of
the innermost wall without making so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs awaken me; for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of lo:ig
poles, covering all my tent; and leaning up to the side
of the hill, which was again laid cross with small
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thickness with the rice straw, which was strong like
reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go
in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-
door, which if it had been attempted on the outside,
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen
down, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, I
took them all in to my side every night.
But T needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullennes, or
designs; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso-
ever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it
outoi doubt; and soon convinced me, that I needed
to use no precautions as to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that, however it had picked God
in his providence, and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from so great a part oi
the w^nd of his rrea' ores the hj»st uses to which thei*
faculties, and the powers of their souls, are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers
the same reason, the same affections, the same senti-
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of grati-
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing
good, and receiving good, that he has given to us;
and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of
exerting these, they are as read}', nay more ready, to
apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. And this made me very melan-
choly sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions
presented, how mean an use we make of all these,
even though we have these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, adde*' to our understand-
ing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like sav
i»g knowledge from so many millions of souls, who,
if 1 might judge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did.
From hence f sometimes was led too far to invad*
the* sovereignty of Providence; and, as it were, ar-
raign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things,
that should hide that light from some, and reveal it to
Others, and yet expect a like duty from both : but I
shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclu-
sion .- first, that we do not know by what light and law
these should be condemned; but that as ftod was ne-
cessarily, and by the nature of his being infinitely
holy and just, so it could not be, but that if these crea-
tures were all sentenced to absence from himself, it
wh.s on account of sinnmg against that light, which
as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by
such rules as their conscience^ would acknowledge to
be just, though the foundation was not discovered to
us; and, secondly, that still, as we are all ciay in tho
hand of the potter, no vessel couul say to him, "Why
past thou formed mc thus?"
But to return to my new companion : I was great!/
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him every thing that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak
and understand me when I spake; and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was: and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he
could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk tc him.
And now my life began to be so easy, that I began ta
say to myself, that could I but have been safe from
more savages, 1 cared not if I was never to remove
from the place where I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday off
from this horrid way of feeding, and from the relish
; of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let run taste other
i flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the
j woods: I went, indeerJ intending to kill a kid out cf
. my own flock, and brh.g it home and dress it: but as
I was going, I saw a she goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of
; Friday; « Hold," said I, "s.tand still;" and made
signs to him not to stir. Immediately I presented my
piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The poorcrea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the
I savage his enemv, but did net know, or could imagine
how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he
would have sunk down : he did not see the kid J had
shot at, or pe-ceive I had killed it, but ripped up his
waiscoat to /eel if he was not wounded; and, as 1
found, presently thought I was resolved to kill him
for he came and kneeled down to me, and, embrac-
ing my knees, said a great many things I did not un-
derstand ; but I could easily see that his meaning was
to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him, that I would
do him no harm; and taking him up by by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which h«
did , and while he was wondering and looking to s*a
now the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again
and by and by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, si
upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand
a little what I would do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing
-to the parrot, and to my gun, and to theground undei
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill that
bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him look, and im
mediately he saw the parrot fall; he stood like one
frighted again, notwithstanding all that 1 had said to
him; and I found he was the more amazed, because
he did not see me put any thing into the gun; but
thought there must be some wonderful fund of death
and destruction in that tiling, able to kill man, beast,
bird, or any thing near or far off; for the astonish-
ment this created in him was such, as could not ueai
off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun ,
as for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch i
for several days, after; but would speak to it, and talli
to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by him-
self; which, as I afterwards leant of him, was to do
sire it not to kill him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I hac
shot, which he did, but staid some time; for the par
lot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good waj
off from the place where she fell; however, he foun?
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, 1
took this advantage to dharge the 2,nn again, and no
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
other mark that might present; but nothing man
offered at that time; so I brought home the kid; and
the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as
well as I could, and having a pot for that purpose, 1
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good hroth • after I had be&uu to eat som*i 1
59
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made a
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and put-
ting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate
it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth
. with fresh water after it. On the other hand, I took
some meat m my mouth without salt, and I pretended
to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had
done at the salt; but it would not do, he would never
are for salt with meat, or in his broth ; at least, no*
a great while, and then but a very Kille.
Having thus fed him with boiled r*eatand broth, I
was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a
piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before the
fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in Eng-
land, setting two poles up, ono on each side the fire,
and one cross on the top, and lying the string to the
cross stick, letting the meat tum continually ; this Fri-
day admired very much ; but when he came to taste
the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well
he liked it, that I could not but understand him ; and
at last he told me he would never eat man's flesh any
more, which I was very glad to her.
The next day I sot him to work to beating some
com out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, a3
I observed 'jefore; and he understood how to do
it as well as T, especially after he had seen what the
meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of;
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and
bake it too; Mid in a little time Friday was able to do
all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that, having two mouths
to feed instead of one, 1 must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn,
than I used to do; so 1 marked out a larger piece oi
land, and began the fence in the same manner as be-
fore, in which Friday not only worked very .willingly
and verv hard, but did it very cheerfuV.y; and I told
him what it was for, that it was for corn to ma*e
more bread, because he was now with me, and that i
might have enough for him and myself too: he ap-
peared very sensible of that part, and let me know,
that he thought 1 had much more labour upon rne on
his account, than 1 had for myself, and that he would
work the harder for me, if 1 would tell him what to
do.
This was the pleaspntest year of all the life I led in
this place. Friday kegan to talk pretty well, and un-
derstand the names of almost every thing I had oc-
casion to call for, and of every place 1 had to send him
to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, 1
began now to have some use for my tongue again,
which indeed I had very litt'e occasion for before;
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure oi
talking to him, 1 had a singular satisfaction in the fel-
low himself; his simple unfeigned honesty appeared:
to me more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and on his side, I believe, he
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to
love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learnt him English so well, that he could answer me
almost any questions, I asked him, whether the nation
that he belonged to never conquered in battle? At
which be smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that is, he meant, always get the
better in fight; and so we began the following dis-
course. "You always fight the better!" said I
"how came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? if yonr nation beat them,
Jhow came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where mc was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation over beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was; there my nation take one two e^reat thou-
*»d .
Master. But why did not your side recover you
t m the hands of your enemies tnen r
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans, too, eat all up
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been herer [points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side.]
* By this I understood, that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore on the farther part of the island, on the said
man eating occasions that he was now brought for;
and some time after, when I took the courage to cany
him to that side, being the same I formerly mention-
ed, he presently knew the place, and told me, he was
there once when they ate up twenty men, two women,
and one child: he could not tell twenty in English,
but he numbered them by laying so many stones in a
row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows ; that after I had had this discourse with him,
I asked him, how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost?
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that after a little way out \o sea, there was a cur-
rent, and a wind always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon.
This I understand to be no more than the sets of the
tide, as going out, or coming in ; but I afterwards un
derstood it was occasioned by the great draught and
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the mouth
of which river, as 1 thought afterwards, our island lay;
and that this land, which I perceived to the W. and
N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants,
the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told me all he knew with the greatest openness ima-
ginable. I asked him the names of the several nations
of his sort of people, but could get no other name
than Caribs ; from whence I easily understood, that
these were the Caribees, which our maps place on the
part of America which reaches from the mouth of the
river Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards to S»
Martha. He told me, that up a great way beyond the
moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be W. from their country, there dwelt
white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, whiph I mentioned before; and that they
had killed much mans^ that was his word : by which
I understood he meant the Spaniard, whose cruelties
in America had been spread over the whole coun-
eries, and were remembered by all the nations from
father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men ; lie
told me, Yes, yes, I might in two canoe; I could
not understand what he meant by two canoe; till at
last, with great difficulty, 1 found he meant, that it
must be in a large great boat as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find an
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
hat this poor savage might be a means to help me te
do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with mt, and that he began to speak to me, and under-
stand me, I was not wanting to.lay a foundation of
jeligious knowledge in his mind ; particularly I askea
htai one time, Who made him? The poor creatuw

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
did not understand me at all but thought I had asked
who was his father; but I took it by another handle,
and asked him, Who made the sea, the ground he
walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me it
was one old Benamuckee that lived beyond all; he
could describe nothing of this great person, but that
he was very old; much older, he said, than the sea
or theland, than the moon or the stars. I asked him
then, if this old person had made all things, why dh
not all things worship him? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence'said, All things
said O! to him. I asked him, if the people who die
m his country, went away any where? He said, Yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him,
whether those they ate up, went thither too ? he said,
Yes.
From these things 1 began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him,, that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up to-
wards heaven ; that he governs the world by the same
power and providence by which he made it; that ne
was omnipotent, could do every thing for us; give
every thing to us, take everything from us; and thus,
by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of
Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the man-
ner of making our prayers to God, and his being able
to hear us, even into heaven: he told me one day,
that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee,
who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains, where he
dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he went
thither to speak to him? He said, No, they never
went that were young men; none went thither but
the old men ; whom he called their Oowookakee, that
is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, 01
clergy; and that they went to say O! (so he called
saying prayers,) and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee said. Bvthis 1 observed, that there
is priestcraft even among the most blinded ignorant
Pagans in the world; and the policy of making a se-
cret religion, in order to preserve the veneration of
the people to the clergy, is not only to be found in the
Roman, but perhaps among all religions in the world,
even among the most brutish and barbarous savages
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my ma
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their ol
men going up to the mountains to say O.' to their go
Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing wor
from thence what he said, was much more so; tha
if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one
there, it must be an evil spirit: and then I entered
into a long discourse with him about the devil, the
original of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity
to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the
(lark parts of the world to be worshipped instead oi
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made
use of, to delude mankind to their ruin: how he had
a secret access to our passions and to our affections,
to adapt his snares to our inclinations, as to cause
us even to be our own tempters, and to run upon ou;
own destruction by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of a God: nature assisted all my arguments to evi-
dence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,
a^nd over-ruling governing Power, a secret directing
Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying
homage to Him that made us, and the like: butchers
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above
all of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to
do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me or.ee in
such a manner, by a question merely natural and in
nocent, that I scarce knew what to say to nirn. 1
had been talking to him a great deal of the power o
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin,
his being a consuming fire to the workers of. iniquity;
bow, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, aw*
•11 the world, in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
ivas God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Pro-
vidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and the like: "Well," says Friday, " but you
say God is so strong, so great, is he not much strong,
much might, as the devil ?"—" Yes, yes," said 1,
Friday, "God is stronger than the devil, God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
.inder our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations,
and quench his fiery darts."—" But" says he agaii*,
"if God much strong, much might, as the devil, v I y
God not kill the devil, so make him no more wicked:'"
I was strangely surprised at his question ; and alter
all, though 1 was now an old man, yet 1 was but a
young doctor and ill enough qualified for a casuist, or
a solver of difficulties: and at first I could not tell
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and
asked him what he said? but he was too earnest for
an answer to forget his question; so that he repeated
it in the very same broken words, as above. By this
time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, " God
will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for
the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit,
to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy
Friday ; but he returns upon me, repeating my words,
"Reserve at last I me no understand : but why not
kill the devil now, not kill great ago ?"—" You' may
as well ask me," said I, "why God does not kill you
and me, when we do wicked things here that offend
him: we are preserved to repent and be pardoned."
He muses awhile at this; "Well, well," says he,
mighty affectionately, " that well; so you I, devil, all
wicked, all preserve, repewrt, God pardon all." Here
I was run down again by him to the last degree, and
it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of
nature, though thev will guide reasonable creatures to
the knowledge of a Godv and or a worsnip or homage
due to the supreme being of God as the consequence
Df our nature; yet nothing but divine revelation cap
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemp.
tion purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove-
nant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God's
throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaver*
can form these in the soul; and that therefore the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean
he word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised
for the guide and sanctifier of his people, and theab
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in
the saving knowledge of God, and the means of sal
vation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between .
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sud-'
den occasion of going out; then sending him for some-
thing a great way off, I seriously prayed to God that
he would enable me to instruct savingly this pooi
Ravage, assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor
ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowlede
of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and
would guide me to speak so to him from the word of
God, as his conscience might be convinced, his.ey
opened, and his soul saved. When he came again'
me, I entered into a long discourse with him ud
the subject of the redemption of man by the Sayiou
of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gosp.
preached from Heaven, viz. of the repentance towar..
God, and faith of our blessed Lord Jesus: I then e>
plained to him, as well as I could, why our blesse
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, bu
the seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the
fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that ha
came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
In all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
struction and must acknowledge, what I believe all
that act upon the same principle will find, that in lay-
ing things open 10 him, I reallv informed and instruct
«d myself in many things that either I did not Know"
or had not fully considered before; but which occur-
red naturally.to my mind, upon my searching into
them for the information of this poor savage; and 1
had more affection in my enquiry after things upon
this occosion, than ever I felt before; so that whethei
this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no,
I had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to
me : my grief sal lighter upon me, my habitation grew
comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I re-
flected, that in this solitary life, which I had been
confined to, I had not only been moved myself to look
up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that brought
me thither, but was now to be made an i-nstrument,
under Providence, to save the life, and for aught 1
knew the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the
true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doc-
trine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom
is life eternal: I say, when I reflected upon all these
things, a secret joy ran through every part of my
soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought
to this place, which I had often thought the most
dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have be-
fallen me.
In this, thankful frame Icontinued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made,
the three years which we lived here together perfectly
,and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be found in a sublunar}' state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than
I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
stored penitents: we had here the Word of God to
read, and no farther off from his spirit to instruct than
if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know as well as I could the meaning
of what I read ; and he again, by his serious inquiries
and questions, made me, as I said before, a mucn oet-
ter scholar in the Scripture knowledge, than I should
ever have been by my own private reading. Another
thing I cannot refrain from observing here, also from
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how
infinite and inexpressible a blessing it^ is, that the
knowledge of Goa, and of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word oJ
God, so easily to be received and understood, that as
the bare reading the Scripture made me capable ol
understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly
on to the great work of sincere repentance for my
sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salva-
tion, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedienc*

or instructor (I mean, human :) so the plain instruc

creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, a?
I have known few equal to him in my life.
As to the disputes, wrauglings, strife, and conten
tion, which has happened in the world about religion
whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church
government, they were all perfectly useless to us, a-
tor aught I can yet see, they have been to all the res*
in the world: we had the sure guide to heaven, viz
the Word of God ; and vre had, blessed be God! com
fortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching and in
itructing us by his Word, leading us into all truth, anc
making us both willing and obedient to the instruction
of his Word; and I cannot see the least uso that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in religion,
which have made such confusion in the world, would
have been to us, if we could have obtained it. But

take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted and that he could understand almost all 1
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken Eng-
lish, to me, I acquainted Hrni with my own storjr, ol
tt least so mucn of it as relates to my coming inte
the place, hjw I had lived there, and how o „ • 1 *et
him into the mystery (for such it was to him) ol gun-
powder and bullets, and taught him how to shoot; I
gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted
with: and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to
it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in the
frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all the
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and shewed him
as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she
was all beaten in pieces, long before, and quite gone.
I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which wc lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with
my whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood mus-
ing a great while, and said nothing: I asked him what
it was he studied upon? At last, says he, "Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but at last,
when I had examined further into it, 1 understood
by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on
shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he
explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather.
I presently imagined, that some European ship must
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat
might get loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull,
that I never once thought of men making escape from
a wreck thither, much less whence they might come,
so I only enquired after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth,' " We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them in the boat? "Yss,*
he said,'" the boat full of white mans." 1 asked hhn,
how many? he told upon his fingers seventeen. 1
asked him then, what became of them? he told mc,
'« They live, they dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again; for I
f>rcsently imagined, that these might be the men be-
onging to the ship that was cast away in sight of my
island, as I now call it; and who, after the ship waa
struck on the rock, ana tney saw her inevitably lost
had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed
upon that wild shore among the savages.
Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what
was become of them? He assured me they lived still
there, that they had been there about four years, that
the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to
live. I asked him, how it came to pass they did not
kill them, and eat them? He said, "No, they make
brother with them :" that is, as I understood him, a
truce: and then he added, "They eat no mans birt
when make the war fight;" that is to say, they never
eat any men, but such as come to fight with them, and
are taken in battle.
It was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear day dis-
covered the main or continent of America; Friday,
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly
towards the main land, and in a kind of surprise falls
a-jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I
was at some distance from him: I asked him what
was the matter?" O joy!" says he, " O glad! then
see my country, there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure ap
peared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his coun
tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a
mind to be in his own country again; and this ob
serration of mine put a great many thoughts into m«,
which made me at first not so easy about my new
man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt,
>ut that if Friday could get back to his own nation
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
again, he would not only forget all his religion, hut all
his obligations to me; and would be forward enough
to give his countrymen an account of me, and come
back, perhaps, with an hundred or two of them, and
make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they
were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very sorry afterwards: however, as
my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, 1
was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and
kind to him as before; in which I was certainly iu
Ihe wrong too, the honest grateful creature having no
thought about it, but what consisted of the best prin-
ciples, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful
friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure
I was every day pumping him, to see if he would dis
r.overany of the new thoughts which I suspected were
'*i him ; but I found every thing he said was so honest
ind so innocent, that 1 could frn'd nothing to nourish
my suspicion; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he
rru^ie me at last entirely his own again; nor did he
In the least perceive that I was uneasy; and there
fore 1 could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own na-
tion ?—" Yes," he said, "1 be much O glad to be
at my own nation."—" What would you do there?"
6aid I: "would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh
Again, and be a savage as you were before?" He look-
ed full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No
no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to pray
God ; tell them M> eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no
cat man again.- 'Why, then," said I to him, "they
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, '* No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:"
be meant by this, tWy would be willing; to learn. He
added, they learnt much of the bearded mans triat
came in the boat. Then I asked him, if he would go
back to them? He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him 1 would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go !" said 1, "why, they will eat
me if I come there."—" No, no," says he, " me make
them no eat you, me make they much love you:" he
meant he would tell them how I had killed his ene-
mies and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how
kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis-
From this time, I confess, T had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly join with these beard-
ed men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards oi
Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we migh
find some method to escape from thence, being upon
the continent, and a good company together, bette
than I could from -an island forty miles off the shore,
and alone without help. So, after some days, I took
Friday lo work again, by way of discourse ; and told
him I would give him a boat to go back to his own
nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate,
which lay on the other side of the island; and hav-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in
the water), I brought it out, shewed it him, and we
both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast again
as I could; so when he was in, I said to him, "Well,
now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He looked
very dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was be-
cause he thought the boat too small to go so far. 1
told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went
to the place where the first boat lay which I had made,
but winch i could not get into the water; he said
that was big enough; but then, as I had taken no car*
of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty year*
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a
manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat would
do very well, and would carry " much enough vittle,
drink, bread;" that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big aa
that, and he should go home in it. He answered not
one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked
him, what was the matter with him? He asked me
again thus, "Why you anc;ry mad with Friday? what
me done ?" I asked him, what he meant 1 told him
I was not angry with him at all: "No angry! no
angry!" says he, repeating the words several times,
"why send Friday home away to my nation ?"—-
"why," said I, "Friday, did you not say you wish-
ed you were there ?"—-" Yes, yes," says he, "wish be
both there; no wish Friday there, no master there."
In a word, he would not think of going there with-
out me. "I go there, Friday!" said 1; "what should
I do there?" He turned very quick upon me at this;
"You do great deal much good," says he; "you
leach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell
them know God, pray God, and live new life."—
"Alas, Friday," said I, "thou knowest not what
thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself."—
"Yes, yes," says he, "you teechee me good, you
teechee them good."—" No, no, Friday," said I,
"you shall go without me; leave me here to live by
myself, as I did before." He looked confused again
at that word, and running to one of the hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it
me. "What must I do with this?" said I to him
"You take kill Friday," says he. "What must 1
kill you for?" said I again. He returns very quick,
"What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday,
no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly,
that 1 saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so
plainly discovered the utmost affection in him tome,
*nd a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and
often after, that I would never send mm away trom
me if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as 1 found by all his discourse a
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his de
sire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing
them good; a thing, which I had no notion of my
self, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or
desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above,
founded on the supposition gathered from the former
discourse; viz. that there were seventeen bearded
men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe, to under-
take the voyage: there were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas and
canoes only, but even of good large vessels: but the
main thing I looked at, was to get one so near the
water, that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he
knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to
call the tree we cut down, except that is was very
like the tree we call fustick, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or ca-
vity of this tree out, to make it into a boat: but I
shewed him how rather to cut it with tools, which
after I shewed him how to use, he did very handily;
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it,
and made it very hadsomc, especially, when, with
our axets, which I shewed him how to handle, wo
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a
boat; after this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's
time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon
great rollers, into the water: but when she was uv,
•he would have carred twenty men with great ease
63
When she was in the water, and though she wm
to big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity and
how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her? "Yes,"
he said, "he venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind." However, I had a farther design
that he knew nothing ofy and that was, to make a
mast and sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.
As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitch-
ed upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found
near the place, and which there was a great plenty of
in tho island; and I set Friday to work to cut it
down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it: but as to the sail, that was my particular
care; I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old
sails enough; but as I had them now twenty-six
years by me, and had not been very careful to pre-
serve them, not imagining that I should ever have this
kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were
all rotten: and indeed most of them were so; how-
ever I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work, and with a great deal
of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be
sure) for want of needles, I at length made a three-
cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually oui
ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew
how to manage; because it was such a one as I used
in the boat in which I made my escape from Barba-
ry, as related in the first part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last work,
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finish-
ed them very complete, making a small stay, and a
sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to
windward; and, which was more than^ll, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and though
I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew th
usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I ap
plied myself with so much pains to do it, that at law
I brought it to pass, though, considering the many
dull contrivances I had for it 'hat failed, I think it
cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of jiv
boat; for though he knew very well how to patidh*
.he canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the more amazed when he saw
me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail gibed, and filled this way 01
that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed : however, with a little use, 1 made all thesa
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sai-
lor, except that as to the compass I could make him
understand very little of that: on the other hand, as
there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom 01
never any fogs in those parts, there was the less oc-
casion for a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in
the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared to sth
abroad, either, by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentioth yeai
of my captivity in this place; though the three last
years that I had this creature with me, ought rathe1*
to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite
of another kind than in all the rest of my time. 1
kept the anniversary of my landing here with the
same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first;
and if I had such cause of acknowledgement at first, I
had much more so now, having such additional tes-
timonies of the care of Providence over me, and the
great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for 1 had an invincible impression,upon
my thoughts, that my deliverance was at hana\ and
that I should not be another year in this place. How-
ever, I wont on with my husbandry, digging, plant-
ma, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
gra;x>s, aiVl did every necessary thing, sis before.
jThe rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
Hrhen 1 kept more within doors than at other times;
to had I stowed our new vessel as secure as we could,
twinging her up into the creek, where, as I said in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and
haling her up to the shore, at high-water mark, I made
my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough for
her to float in; and then, when the tide was out,
,ve made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep
the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the tide,
from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great
many boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the
months of November and December, in which } de-
signed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provi-
sion, being the store for the voyage; and intended,
in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock; and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon'
nomething of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find
ti turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps
he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to
him, he cried out to me, "O master! O master! O
soi row! O bad!"—" What's the matter, Friday?"
said I. ** O yonder there," says he, ** one, two,
three canoe! one, two three !" By this way of speak-
ing I concluded ther were six; but on inquiry 1
found there were but three. "Well, Friday," said I,
"do not be frighted ;" so I heartened him up as well
as I could. However, I saw the,, poor fellow most
terribly scared; for nothing ran in his head, but that
they were come to look for him, and would cut him
in pieces, and eat him ; the poor fellow trembled so
that I scarce knew what to do with him ; I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as
much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
well as him. "But," said I, "Friday, we must re-
solve to fight them: can you fight, Friday.'*"—** Me
shoot," says he, "but theie come many great num-
ber."—" No matter for that," said I again; "our
guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked
him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend nie, and stand by me, and do just 1 bade
him? He said, "Me die, when you bid die, master;"
so 1 went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum,
that I had a great deal left. When he had drank it,
I made him take the two fowling-pieces which we
always carried, and load them with large swan-shot
as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets,
and loaded them with two slugs and five small bul-
lets each; and my two pistols 1 loaded with a brace
of bullets each: I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet .
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
spective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to
see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by
my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole,
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed,
but nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea : this, with the abhorrence of the .inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indigna
lion, that I came down again to Friday, and told him,
i was resolved to go down to them, and kill them
all; and asked him if he would stand bv me. He

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
was now gotten over his fright, and his spirits being a
ittle raised with the dram I had given him, ho was
very cheerful; and told mc, as before he would die
when I did die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before between us: I gave
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
npon his shoulder; and 1 took one pistol, and the
other three, myself; and in this posture we marched
out. 1 took a small bottle of rum m my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bul-
l*t ; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close lie-
l;md me, and not to stir, shoot, or do any thing till 1
fciu nim; and in the mean time, not to speak a word.
In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand
of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get
into the wood; so that I might come within shot oi
them before I could be discovereu, which I had seen
by »ny glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began.to abate my resolution; I do not
"Wan, that I entertained any fear of their number; for
as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain J
was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone:
but it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occa-
sion, much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip
my hands in blood, to attack people who had neithei
done or intended me any wrong, who, as to me, wr*,re
innocent, and whof.e barbarous customs were their
own disaster, being m them a token indeed of God's
having left them, with the other nations of that part
of the world to such stupidity and to such inhuman
courses; but did not call me to take upon me to be a
judge of their actions, much less an executioner of his
justice; that whenever he thought fit, he would take
the cause into his own hands, and by national ven-
geance punish them for national crimes; but that in
the mean time, it was none of my business; that it was
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and m a state of war wiih those very
particular people, and it was lawful for him to attach
them, but I could not say the same with respect to
me. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved 1 would
only go place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as
God should direct; but that unless something offered
that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them. •<
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels) I marched till I came to the skirt
of the wood, on the side which was next to them;
only that one corner of the wood lay between me and
them: here I called softly to Friday, and shewing
him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word
if he could see there plainly what they were doing:
he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told
rne they might plainly be viewed there; that they
were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of then
prisoners ; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
a little from them, whom he said thoy would kill
next, and which fired the very soul within mc. He
told me, it was not one of their nation, but one of the
bearded men whom he had told me of, who came to
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror
af the very naming the white bearded man, and, going
to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man,
who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hand"
and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes; and
that he was an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the plac
where I was, which, by going a little way about, 1
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then 1
should be within half-shot of them; so I withheld my
passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got be
nind some bushes, which held ill the wav till f cam*
to the other tree, and then 1 came to a little rising
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the
distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
day; « Now, Friday,11 said I," do as I bid thee.11
Friday said, he Would. "Then, Friday," said I, " do
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.11 So I
set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his ; and
with the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him do the like* Then asking him if he was
ready, he said, " Yes.11—" Then fire at them," said
I; and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in
a dreadful consternation; and all of them, who were
not hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately, but
did not know which way to run, or which way to
look; for they knew not from whenee their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that,
as J had bid him, he might observe what I did ; so
as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the
piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did
ihe like; he sees me cock, and present; he did the
same again. «» Are you ready, Friday?" said I.
"Yes," says Se. "Let fly then," said I, «* in the
name of God; and with that I fired again among
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
pieces were now loaden with what I call swan shot.
or small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop; 6'j'
so many were wounded, that they ran about yciJJ
*nd screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, a
miseiably wounded most of them ; whereof three more
fell quickly after though not quite dead.
«* Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharg-
ed pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, *« follow me," said I; which he did, with a
deal of course; upon which I rushed out of the wood,
and shewed myself, and Friday close at my foot; as
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running
as fast as I could, which by the way was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly
towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying
npon the beach, or shore, between the place where
they sat and the sea; the two butchers who were just
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise
of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright ,to the
sea-side, and hud jumped into a canoe, and three more
of the rest made the same way: I turned to Friday,
and bade him step forwards, and fire at them; he un
derstood me immediately, and running about fortr
yards to be near them, he shot at them,and I thought
he had killed them all; /or I saw them all fall on an
heap into the boat; though I saw two of them, up
again quicklv: however, lie killed two of them, and
wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom
of the boat as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, arid cut the flags that bound the poor vic-
tim; and loosing his hands and feet I lifter! him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what ho was.'
He answered in Latin, Christianus.; but was so
weak and faint that he could scarce stand, or speak;
I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did ; and
I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate ) then 1
asked him, what countryman he was? and he said,
Espagnole; and, being a little recovered, let me
know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how
much he was in my debt for his deli vera nee "Scigmu,*

mio I, with as much Spanish as I could make up.

and lay about you/' lie took them very thankfully,
and no sooner had he the arms m his hands. I>ui as il
they had put new vigour into him, lie Hew upon Im-
munerers like a fury, and had cut two of them h;
pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole \va>
a surprise to them, so the pour creatures were so much
frighted with the noise of our pieces, thai they fell
down for mere amazenreni and fear, and had no men
power to attempt their own escape, than their fle'd
had to resist our shot; and that was the case of tho.s<
five that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of then
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright.

being willing to keep my charge ready, because 1 bar

to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from
whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which la\
there that had been discharged, which he did with
great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, J
sat down myself to load aft the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I vva^
loading the pieces, there happened a fierce engage-
ment between the Spaniard and one of the savagQs.
who made at him with one of their great wooden
swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him
before, if I had not prevented it; the Spaniard, who
was as bold and as brave as could be imagined.
(hough weak, had fought this Indian a good while
and had cut him two great wounds on his head; bu
the savage, being a stout lusty fellow, closing in wild
him, had thrown him down, (being faint) and was
wringing my sword out of his hand, when the Span-
iard, though undermost, wisely quitting his sword
)rew I'^p pistol from his girdle, shot the savatie
.through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before
I, who was running to help could come near him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his.
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three, who,
as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,
and all the rest he could come up with: and the
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, 1 gave him one of
he fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not
able to run, they both got from him into the wood,
where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them;
but the other was too nimble for him; and though hi
was wounded, yet he plunged into the sea, and swam
with all his might off to those who were left in the
canoe; which three in the canoe, with one wounded,
who wq know not whether he died or no, were all
that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The ac
count of the rest is as follows:
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropt here and there of then
•wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase ol
them. <
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if
not dead.
21 In all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun shot; and though Friday made ojvo o>
three shot at them, I did not find that he hit any o\
them: Friday would fain have had me take one o!
their canoes, and pursy* them; and indeed I was
*erv anxious about their escape, lest, carrying th<
*ews home to their people, they should come back,
5
pernaps, with two or three hundred of their cm.oi.i
and devour us by mere multitudes ; so 1 consented '.<?
pursue them by sea; and 'running to one of liic-.r
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when i was in the canoe, / was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and
fool, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and alrnos
 lead with fear, not knowing what the matter was: fo
he had not been able to look up over the side of th
boat, he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had
been vied so long, that he had really little life in him.
I' immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak, but
i^rjaned most piteously, believing, it seems still, thai
he was only unbound in order to be killed,
When Friday came to hirn, 1 bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram,
winch with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat; but when Friday
came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried,
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head, and then sung and jumped about again like a
distracted creature. It was a good while before I
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was tha
matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told
me that it was his father.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had work
ed in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, an
of his being delivered from death ; nor indeed can 1
describe half the extravagances of his affection after
this; for he went into the boat and out of the boat a
great many times : when he went in to him, he would
sit down by him, open his breast,and hold his father's
ncad close to his bosom, half an hour together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which
were numbed and stiff with the binding, ami chafed
a-)d rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving
what the case was, gave him some rum out of mv
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deaJ
of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the cano
with the other savages, who were now gotten alrnos
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we di
not; for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I
could not suppose their boat could live, or that thev^
ever reached to their own coast.
But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his
father, that I could notfind in my heart to take him
off for some time: but after I thought he could leave
nim a little, I called him to me, anS he came jump-
ing and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him, if he had given his father any
bread? He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self," So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I also
gave him a dram for himself, but ne would not taste
it, but carried it to his father; T had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my rasins, so I gave
him a handful of them for his father He had no
sooner given his father these rasins, hut I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been
bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was the
swiftest fellow of his feet that ever T saw)—I say, he
ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were
in an instant; and though I called and hallooed tou
after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I
found his pace slacker, because he had something
Vn his hand.
ADVENTURES OE ROBINSON CRUSOE.
When lie came up to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his futhei
some fresh water ; and that he had got two more cakes
or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father: however, as I was
very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it: this water
revived his father more than all the rum or spirits 1
had given him ; for he was just fainting with thirst.
When" his father had drank, I called him, to know
if there was any water left? he said, " Y~es;" and I
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as-
much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the
cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniardnoo, who
was indeed very weak, and was reposing himseli
upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with:
when I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with
the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a
handful of raisins : he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand upon his feet; he tried to d.e
it two or three times, but was really not able, his
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles,
and bathe them with rum, as he had done his fathers.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to see if bis father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen; at which he
started up, and, without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he
came, he only found he had laid himself down to case
his Jimbs: so Friday came back to me presently, and
I then spoke to the Spaniards to let Friday help him
up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and tnen
he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him
close to his father, and presently stepping out again
aunched the boat off, and paddled it along the short
aster than 1 could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into out
creek •, and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went? He told ire.,
"Go fetch more boat ;n so away he went, like tho
wind; for sure never man or horse ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as
I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then
went to help our new guests out of the boat, which hr
did; but they were neither of them able to walk ; s<
that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedv this, I went to work in my thoughts, am
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the banl
while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand
harrow to lay thorn on, and Friday and I carried then:
up both together upon it between us; but when we
got them to the outside of our wall or fortification,
we were at a worse loss than before; for it was im-
possible to get them over; and T was resolved not tc
break it down: so I set to work again; and Friday
and I, in about two hours time, made" »i very handsome
tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being m the space without out out-
ward fence, and between that and tho grove of youna
wood which I had planted: and here we made two
beds of such things as I had; viz. of good rice-straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them on each bed.
My island was now people, and I thought mysell
very rich in subjects; and it mas a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked.
6rs»""of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty; so that I had an undoubted right of dominion:
2dly, My people were perfectly subjected; 1 was ab-
solute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to
me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there
had been occasion for it, for me: it was remarkable
loo, I had but three subjects, and they were of thret
different religions. My man Friday was a Protestai.t
his father a Pagan and a cannibal; and the Spaniard
was a Papist, however, 1 allowed liberty of con-
science throughout my dominions: butthisbythe way.
As soon as 1 had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest
ihem upon, 1 began to think of making some provi-
sion for them; and tb* first thing I did, I ordered
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a
$oat, out of r.iy particular flock, to be killed: then I
cut of the hind quarter, and chopping it into small
pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of
flesh and broth; having put some barley and rice also
iDto the broth ; and as I cooked it without doors, (for
[ made no fire within my inner wall) so 1 carried it
all into the new tent; and having set a table there for
them, I sat down and ate my dinner also with them;
and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Span-
iard spoke the languge of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and,other fire-arms, which, for want at
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which laA opeii to the sun, and
would presently be offensive ; and I also ordered him
to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast,
which I knew were pretty much, and which I couW
•ot think of doing myself nay, I could not bear t»
Bee them, If I went that way: all which he punctu-
ally performed, and defaced the very appearance o*
tne savages being there ; so that when I went again, I
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with
my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire
of his father, what he thought of the escape of the
savages in that canoe? and whether he might expect a
return of them with a power too great for us to resist?
His first onion was, that the savages in the boat
never could live out the storm which blew that night
they went off, but must of necessity be drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were as
sure to be devoured, as they were to be drowned if,
they were cast away; but as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said, he knew not; but it
was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frightexf
with the manner of being attacked, the noise, and the
fire, that he believed they would tell their people they
were all killed by thunder and lightning, and not br
the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz. Friday and f) were two heavenly spirits or furies-
come down to destroy them, and not men with wea-
pons. Tliis, he said, he knew, because he heard them
all cry out so in their language to one another; for it
was impossible for them to conceive that a man*should
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And
this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood
since by other hands, the savages of that part never
attempted to go over to the island afterwards. 'They
wore so terrified with the accounts given by these fou»
, inert, (for it seems they did Escape the sea) that they
'believed, whoever went to that enchain ted island,
\ would be destroyed with fire from the gods.
This however, I knew not, and therefore was undei
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kepi
always upon my guard, I and all my army; for as
tore were now four of us, I would! have ventured
€7
«pon a hundred of them fairlv in the open field at any
lime.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I began to
take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into
consideration, biing likewise assured by Friday's
father, that I might depend upon good usuage from
their nation on his account, li 1 would go.
But my thoughts were, a little suspended, when I
nad a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
( understood, that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life; 1 asked
him all the particulars of their voyage; and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and
to bring back what European goods they could meet
with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; thai
five of their own men were drowned when first the
ship was lost; and that these escape<l through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrive i almost starved on
the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment.
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used at their
first landing to provide themselves some food.
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape? He said, thev had many consul
tutions about it; but that having neither vessel, nor
tools to build one, or provisions of any kind, their
counsels always ended in tears,and despair.
I asked him, how he thought they wolud receive a
proposal from me, which might tend towards ai
©scape; and whether, if they were all here it migtn
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared mostly
their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life
in their hand; for that gratitude was no inherent
virtue in the nature of man ; nor did men always
square their dealings by the obligations they had re
ceived so much as they did by the advantages they
expected; I told him, it would be very hara, that I
should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that
they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New
Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made
a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever,
brought him thither; and that I had rather be deliver-
ed up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall
into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried
into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I \*«as
persuaded, if they were all here, we might with so
many hands build, a bark large enough to carry us all
away either to the Brasils southward, or to the islands
or Spanish coast nortward: but that if in requital
they should, when I had put weapons into their hand?,
carry me by force among their own people, I might
be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my
case worse than it was before.
He answered, with a grezit deal of candour and in-
genuity, that their condition was so miserable, and
= they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor,the thought of using any man unkindly
that should contribute to their deliverance; and that,
if T pleased, he would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again,
and bring me their answer: that he would make con-
ditions with them upon the solemn oath, that the)
would be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear upon
the holy Sacraments and Gospel, to be true to me,
and go to such Christian country asl should agree to,
and no other; and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by my orders, till they were landed safelv in
wich country as I intended ; and that he would bring
a contract from thern under their hands for that pur*
pose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me him-
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him order; and that lie would take
my side to the last drop o( blood, if there should
happen the least breach of faith among his country
men.
He told me, they were all of them very civil hone*
men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin-
able, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;
.out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun-
'try; and that he was sure, if i would undertake ti>e;i
relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to re-
lieve, them, f possible: and to send the old savage and
this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when he had
gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard him-
self started an objection, which had so much prudence
in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it:
and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his com-
rades for at least half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month ; during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and
rice I had laid up; which, as it was more than suffi-
cient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was in-
creased to number four; but much less would it he
sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he said
fourteen still alive, should come over; and least of
all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian
colonies of America. So he told me, be thought it
would be more adviseable, to let him and the other
two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I
could spare seed to sow : and that we should wait an-
other harvest, that we might have a supply of corn
for his countrymen when they should come; for want
might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to
think themseves delivered, otherwise than out of one
difficulty into another: "You know" says he, "the
children ol Israel, though they rejoiced at first at tnen
being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against
God himself, that delived them, when they came to
want bread in the wilderness."
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity,
So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the
wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; and
in about a month's time, by the end of which it was
seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and
trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley
on and sixteen jars of rice, which was in short, all
the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave
ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is t*
say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for
sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six mouths
in the ground in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they
bad come, unless their number had been very great,
we went feely all over the island, whenever we found
occasion; and as here we had our escape or deliver
ance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least foi
me, to have the means of it out ol mine; to this pur-
pose I marked out several trees, which 1 thought fit
for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut
ting them down; and then 1 caused the Spaniard, to
whom I imparted my thoughts, on that^afiair, to over
see and direct their work: I shewed them with what
indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, and 1 caused them to do the like, till they had
\nade about a doxen large planks of good oak, neai
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
tx*<. teec oroad, thirty-five feet long, and from two
incNes to ibuv inches thick: what prodigious laboir
it tot>k up, ipy one n^ny imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my litth
flock of tame goate as much as 1 could; and to thi$
purpose 1 made Fridny and the Spaniard to go out
one day, and myself with Friday, the next day, foi
we took our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with die rest'; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock: but above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pro.
digious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that 1 be-
lieve, had we heen at Alicant, where the raisins of the
sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty
barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part
of our food, and very good living too, I assure you;
for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order ; it
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the
island, but, however, it was enough to answer our
end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice,
which was store enough for our food to the next har-
vest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me ; or, if we had been ready for a voyage,
it would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say,
of America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more
wicker work ; viz. great baskets, in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at
this part, and often blamed me, that i did not make
some things for defence of this kind of work; but I
saw no need of it. And now having a full supply of
food for all the guests expected, F gave the Spaniard
leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do
with those he left behind him there: I gave him a
strict charge in writing not to bring anv man with
him, who would not first swear, in the presence oi
himself and of the old savage, that he would no way
injure, fight with, or attack the person he should find
in the island, who was so kind to send for them in
order to their deliverance ; but that they would stand
by and defend him against all such attempts; and
wherever they went, would be entirely under, and
subjected to his comand; and that this should be put
"ui writing, and signed with their hands : how we were
to have this done, when I knew they had neithei
!>en or ink, that indeed was a question which we
never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old
savage, (the father of Friday) went away in one of
die canoes, which they might be said to come in, or
ather were brought in, when they came as prisoners
uo be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it,
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
•hem to be very good husbands of both, and not to
use either of them but upon urgent occasions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me in view of my deliverance for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them pro-
visions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient fo» their
countrymen for about eight days time; and wishing
them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with
,hem about a signal they should hang out at their re-
turn, by which I should know them again, when they
came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account in the month
of October; but as for the exact reckoning of days,
after I had once lost it, I could never recover it again;
nor haa I kept even the numbeY of years so punctu-
ally, as to be sure that I was right, though, as itprov-
ed when I afterwards examined my account, I found
I had kept a true reckoning of years.
>t was no less than eight days I waited for them,
When a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, bc«n heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running into me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come."
I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; 1 say, regardless of
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my
custom to do,- but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a
league and a half distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call it, and the
v'ind blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I
observed presently, that they did not come from that
side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close for these were not the peo-
ple we looked for, and that wc did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them ; and having
taken the ladder out, I climed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my view the plainer without being
discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me S. S. E.
but not above a league and a half from the shore. By
my obseivation it appeared plainly to be an English
ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion 1 was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I|had reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
consequently friends] was such as I cannot describe;
"»ut yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, T
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred t<#
me to consider what business an English ship could
have in that part of the world; since it was not the
way to or from any part of the world where the Eng-
lish had any traffic; -and I knew there had been no
storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that
if they were English really, it was most probabt
that they were here upon no good design; and tha
I had better continue as I was, than fall into the hand
of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise fie secret hints and notices o
danger, which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that
have made any observation of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, an''
a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the
tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some
friendly agent, (whether supreme, or inferior and sub-
ordinate, is not the question,) and that they are give*
en for our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reasoning; for had I not been made
•cautious by this secret admonition, come from whence
to will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far
worse condition than before, as you will see presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convpnience of land-
ing; however, as they did not come quite far enough,
they did not see the little inlet where I formerly
landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed
just, as I may say, at my door, and would have soon
beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plun-
dered me of ?ji I had.
When they were on Ihore, I was fully satisfied they
were Englishmen, at least most of thova; one or twy
69
t thought wore Dutch, but it did not prove so. There
were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found
were unarmed, and (as I thought) hound.; and when
the first four or five of thetn were jumped on shore,
they took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate
gesture? of entreaty, affliction and dispair, even to a
kind of extravagance; the other two, I could per-
ceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared
concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning pf it should he; Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, " O master!
you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage
mans"—" Why," said I, " Friday do you think <hey
are going to eat them then ?"—" Yes," says Friday,
"they will eat them."—" No, no," said I. 'l Friday:
Lam afraid they will murder them indeed; hut you
may be sure they will not eat them."
AH this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of
the sight, expecting every moment when the three pri-
soners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the
villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as the sea-
men call it) or sword to strike one of the poor men;
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chil)
in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was .gone with him ; or that I had-any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men; for I saw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
tTiy mind another way.
After I had observed the out raucous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fe.1-
iows ran scattering about the land, as if they wanted
to see the country. 1 observed also, that the three
other men had liberty to go 'when* thev pleased; bnt
they sat down all three upon tne ground very pensive
ancl looked like men in dispair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I came
"on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me.
what dreadful apprehensions I had, ancl how I lodged
in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by
wild beasts.
As 1 knew nothing that night of the supply I was
to receive by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the laud, by the storms and tides, by which
I have since been so long nourished and supported;
i-o these three poor desolate men knew nothing how
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how neai
St was to them, and how effectually and really they
were in a condition of safety, at the same time they
thought, themselves lost, and their case desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the
great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his
cieatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst
circumstances they have' always something to be
thankful for, and sometime*, are nearer their deliver-
ance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by wnich they seem
to be brought to their deduction.
It was just at the top of high water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stoori
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and narth
while they rambled about to see what kind of'pla'ct
they were in, they had carelessly staid till the lidi
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as 1 found
afterwards, having drank a little too much brandy,
fell asleep ; however, one of them waking sooner than
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground foi
him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who were straggling
about, upon which they all soon came to the bout:
but it was past all their strength to launch her, the
boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side l>e
ing a soft oozy sand/almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are, per-
haps, the least of all mankind given to forethought
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to
another, (calling thetn off from the boat) " Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide." By
which I was fully confirmed in the main enquiry, of
what countrymen they were.
All this while f kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place
of obseryation, near the top of the hill: and very gla'
f was, to think how well it was fortified. I knew it
was no less than ten hours before the boat could be
on (loat again, and by that time it would be dark, and
T might be more at liberty to see their motions, and
to hear their discourse, if they had any.
Jn the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to
do with another kind of enemy than I had at first: f
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent
marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms:
w took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed, was vcrv fierce; I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap
I mentioned, a naked sword, two pistols in my belt,
and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt till it was dark: but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, 1 found that in short they
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as 1
thought, were all laid down to sleep. The three poor
distressed men, too anxious lor their condition to get
any sleep, were however set down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and as 1 thought out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
• marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, a^s formidable for his arms
as I but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, 1 called- aloud to
them in Spanish, " What are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more co-founded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made: they made no answer at all, but
1 thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I spoke to them in English: "• Gentlemen,"
said I, u do not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect
it."—" He must be sent directly from heaven then,"
said one of them very gravely to me, pulling off his
hat at the same time, " for our condition is past the
help of man."—" All help is from Heaven, Sir," said
I: "but can you put a stranger in the way how to
help you? For you seem to me to be in some great
distress: I saw you when you landed ; and u hen you
seemed to make application to the brutes that came
with you, 1 saw one of them lift up his sword to kill
 you."
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel .?"—" Be in no fear about that, Sir," said 1:
u if God had sent an angel to relieve you* he would
have come belter clothed, and armed after another
manner than you see me in; pray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you ; you see I have one servant on4y; we have
arms and ammunition; tell us freely can we serve
you ?—what is your case?"
"Our case," said he, " Sir, is tco long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but in short, Si», •
I was commander of that ship; my men having mutt
nied against me, thev have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and a* last have set me on shore,
ua this dasolate jJace, with these two men with me.

»ne my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex
pected lo perish, believing the place to be iminhabk
ed, and know not yet what to think olit."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies?"—" sain
F; "do you know where they are gone ?"—" There
they are sir/* said he, " pointing to a thicket of trees;
** my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all."
"Have they any fire arms?" said T. He answered,
** they had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat."—" Well then," said I, "leave the rest
to me; 1 see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prison-
ers?" Me told me there were two desperate villians
among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return to their duty: I asked him, which
they\\vere? He told me, he could not at that distance
describe them; but he would obey my orders in
any thins; 1 would direct. "Well," said J, "let us re-
treat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and
we will resolve farther;" so they willingly went back
with me, till the woods covered us from them.
"Look, you* Sir," said I, "if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?" He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be
wholly, directed and commanded by me in every
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
iive„and die with me in what part of the world soever
1 would send him; and the two other men said th«
same.
"Wei," sai 1 I, "my conditions are but two: I,
That while you stay on this island with me, you will
not pretend to'any authority here; and if I put arms
into your hands, you will upon all occasions give them
»«p to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon
this island, ami in the mean time to be governed by
tr.y orders.
v "2. That if the ship is or may be recoverered, you
will carry me and my man to England passage free."
He gave me all the assurance that the invention and
faith of man could devise, that he would comply
with these most reasonable demands, and besides
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upos»
all occasions as long as he lived.
"Well then," said* I, "here are three muskets fat
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done." He shewed all the testi-
mony of his1 gratitude that he was able; hut offered to
be wholly guided by me: T told him, 1 thought it
was hard venturing anv thing, but the best method 1
lcould think of, was to fire upon them at once, as they
lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put if
wholly upon (Jod's providence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kirl
them, if lie could help it; but that those two were in-
corrigible villians, and had been the authors of all t.lv.
mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, we should be
undone still; for they would go on board, and brinq
the whole ship'scompany, ,in(\ destroy us all. "Well
.then," said I, "necessity legitimates my advice; Kn-
it is the only way to save our lives." However, see-
ing him still cautious of shedding^blood, I told him.
they should go themselves, and manage as they found
convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some ol
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him, if either of them were the
men who he had said were the heads of the mutinv;
He said, No. "Well then," said i, "..you may Km
Them esape, and Providence seems to have wakened
them on purpose to save themselves."—" Now," said
I "if the rest escape you, it is your fault"
Animated with this, he took the musket 1 had given
him in his hand, and pistol in bis belt, and his twr,
comrades with him, with each^ man a piece in hi*
hand : the two men, who were wifch l;u% going frrst.
made some noise, at which one of the seamen, wfr«
was awake, turned about, .and seeing them coming,
cried out tOvthe rest; but it was too late then; for the
moment he cried out, they fired, I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece: they had
so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that
one of them was killed on the spot, and the other- very
much wounded; hut not being dead he started »nt
an his feet, and called eagerly for help to the otheif
but the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too
late to cry for help; he should call upon God 'to for
give his villany; and with that word knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more: there were three more in the company,
and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this
Lime 1 was come; and when they saw their danger
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for me*
cy. The captain told them, he would spare their i
lives, if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had beer) guilty ol
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering
the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Ja-
maica, from whence they came. They gave him all
the protestations of their sincerity that could be de
sired, and he was wil-Ving to believe them, and spare
their lives, which 1 was not against; only 1 obliged
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they
were upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the cap-
tain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and
bring away *he oars and sail, which they did; and
Dy and by, three straggling men; that were (happily
for them") parted from the rest, came back upon
hearing the guns fired ; and seeing their captain, who
before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victoiy waa
complete.
It now remained, that the captain and I should in-
quire into one another's circumstances: I began first,
*nd told him mv whole history, which he heard with
an .attention even to amazement, anrt particularly a
the wonderful manner of my being furnished with
provisions andximnumition : and indeed, as my story
is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deep-
ly; but when he reflected from thence upon himself,
and how 1 seemed to have been preserved there on
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his lace,
and he could not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men intojny apartments, leading
them in just where 1 came out, vi*/. at the top of the
house; where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and shewed tnem all the contrivances I had
made during my long, long inhabiting that place.
All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my for-
tification ; and how perfectly 1 had concealed my re
treat with a grove of trees, which, having now been
planted near twenty years, and the trees growing much
faster than in England, was become a little wood,
and so thick, that it was impassable in any part of it,
but at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it: this I told him was my cas-
tle, and my residence; but that I had a seat in the
country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would shew him that too ano-
ther time; but at present our business xvas to consider
how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to
that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what mea-
sure to take; for that there were still six-and-twenty
hands on board, who having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives
to the law, would be hardened in it now by despera-
tion; and would carry it on, knowing that, if they
were reduced, they should be brought to-the gallows
as soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that therefore there would be
no attacking them with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion* and that thcr*»
ore something was to be resolved on very speedily,
us well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us,
and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred
to me, that in a little while the ship's crew, wonder-
ing what was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certainly come on shore in their other
boat to see for them; and that then perhaps they
might come armed, and be too strong fcft- us: this he
allowed was rational.
Upon this I told him, the first thing we hadto do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every
thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took
tne arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle ol
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, an
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece
of canvass; the sugar was five or six pounds; all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy
«nd sugar, of which 1 had had none left for many
j ears.
When we hao" carried all these things on shore, (the
cars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried
'before as above,) we knocked a great hole in her
bottom, that if they had come strong enough to mas-
ter us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was wot much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship ; "but my view
was, that if ihey went away without the boat, I did
not much question To ";tke her fit again to carry us
away to the Leward Islands, and call upon our friends
the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my
thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and had
first by main strength heaved the boat up upon the
beach, so high that the tide would not float her off a'
high water mark; and, besides, had broken a hole in
herbottomtoobigto.be quickly stopped, and we><>
6at down musing what we should do; we heard tne
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board:
but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat.
At. last, when all their signals and firings picve
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw
them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boa
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as
they approached that there were no less than ten mer.
in her, and that they hall fire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
vre had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the tide
having set them a little to the cast of the other boat,
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place
where the other had landed, and where the boat lay.
By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters oi
all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who he was sure were
lr-d into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpower-
ed and frighted; but that for the boatswain, who, it
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew; and were no doubt, made desperate in theii
new enterprise: and terribly apprehensive he was.
that thej would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our cir-
cumstances were past the operations of fear; that
seeing almost every condition that could be was better
than that we were supposed to be in, we ought to
expect that the consequence, whether death or life
would be sure to be a deliverance: I asked him, what
he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whe-
ther a deliverance were not worth venturing for'
"• And where, Sir," said I,-" is your belief of niy be
sng preserved here on purpose to save your life, whicl
elevated you a little while ago ? For my part," said ).
** there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it."—" What's that?" says he. "Why,"
gaiti I, "'tis that as you say, there are three or four
honest fellows among them, which should be spared:
had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I
Should have thought God's providence had singled
them out to deliver them into your hands , for, depend
upon it, every man of them that comes ashore, are
our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us."
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him: so
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the
first appearance of the boat's coming from the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners and had in-
deed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three (delivered men) to my cave, where they were
remote enough and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods,
"f they could have delivered themselves; here they
left them rxSund but gave them provisions, and pro-
mised them, if they continued there quietly, to give
them their liberty in a day or' two; but that if they
attempted their escape, they should be put to death
without mercy. They promisied faithfully to bear
their confinement with patience, and were veiy thank-
ful that they had such good usuage as to have provi-
sions and a light left thein; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their com-
fort; and they did not know but that he stood centinel
over them at the Entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was
not free to trust them; but the other two were taken
into my service upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their solemny engaging to live and die with
us; so, with them and the three honest men, we were
6even men well armed ; and 1 made no doubt we
should be able to deal well enough with the ten thai
tvere a-coming, considering that the captain had said,
there were three or four honest men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the bench, and came
all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which
I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rathe
have left the boat at an anchor, some "distance from
the shore, with some hands in her to guard her an
so we should not be able to sieze the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they' ran
all to the other ooat; and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprise to find her stripped as above,
of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused awhile upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with alMl-ieii
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpose; then thev came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one : those in the cave, wo
were sure, could not hear; and those in our keeping,
though they hear] it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all oh board again to their ship, and let them know
there, that the men were all murdered, and the long-
boat staved ; accordingly, thev immediately launched
the boat again, and got all of them on board.
The .captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
frunded at this, believing "they would go on board tha
ship again and set sail, giving their comrades up fo
lost, and so^ie should still lose the ship, which he wa
in hopes we^hould have recovered; but he was quick
ly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them coming on shore again; but with
mis new ncisnte in their conduct, which it seems
AD.VENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
hey consulted together upon; viz. to leave three men
in the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up
into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us ii
we let the boat escape, because they wouhfthen row
away to the ship; and then the rest of them would be
sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering the
ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in
the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore,
and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that if
was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.
Those thatcame'on shore kept cloee together march-
ing towards the top of the little hill, under which my
habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though
they could not perceive us; we could have been very
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them; or that they would have j
gone farther off, that we might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill, |
where they could see a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed
till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another,
they sat down together under a tree, to consider of
it: had they thought fit 10 have gone to sleep there,
as the other party of them had done, they had done
he job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions
of danger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could
not. tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they
would all lire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we shoud all sally upon
*hem, just at the juncture when their pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should have them without bloodshed. 1 liked the
proposal, provided it was done while we were neat
enough pto come up to them, before they could load
their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long time very irresolute whatcourse to take ; at length
i told them, there would be nothing to be done in
my'opinion till night; and then, if they did not re-
turn to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to gel
between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat, to get them on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy.- when, af-
ter long consultations, we saw them start all up, and
march down toward the sea: it seems, they had such
dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go
on with their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as 1 perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that they hatl
given over their search, and were forgoing back again;
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts,
was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but 1
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end-to a tittle.
1 ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to,go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile's distance, 1 bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soor#as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it
again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a round,
always answering when the others hallooed, to draw
then) as far into the island, and among the woods, as
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such
ivavs as I directed. *
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed,and they presently heard thein,
and answering, run along the shore westward, towards
die voice they heard, when they were presently stop-
ped by the creek, where the water being upt they
sould not get over, and called for the boat to come
up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed that
the boat being gone up a good way into the creek,
and as it were in a harbour within .the land, they
ook one of the tinee men out of her to go along with
.hem, and left only two in the boat, having fastened
ner to the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leav-
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business, 1
took the rest with me, and, crossing the creek out of
their sight, we surprised the two men before they were
aware, one of them lying on shore, and the other be-
h>g in the boat; the fellow on shore was between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the cap-
t? ,11, who was foremost, ran in upon him and knock-
ad him down, and then called out to him in the boat
u yield, or he was a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down ,- besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the
mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join very sincerely with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so
well managed their business with the rest, lhat they
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill
to anotYier, and from one wood to another, till they
not only heartily t'ned them, but left them where they
were very sure they could not reach back to the bcU
before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily
'red themselves also by the time they came bach t:
US'.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to ma*
sure work with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back tome
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how lame
and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is impos-
sible to express their confusion, when they found the
boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and
their two men gone: we could hear them call to one
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one an-
other they were gotten into an enchanted island ; thai
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered; or else there Were devils or spirits in
it, and they should be all carried awav and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no an-
swer: after some time, we could see them, by the littl»
light there was, run about ringing their hands, lik/i
men in despair; and that sometimes they would g> i
and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore, and walk about again, and so the sanv»
thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leavo
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but 1 was wil-
ling to take them at some advantage, so to spare them,
antl kill as few oi them as I could; and especially I
was unwilling to hazard the killind any of our men,
knowing the other men were very well armed: I re-
solved to wait to see if they did not separate; and
therefore, to make sure of them, I <lrew my ambus-
cade nearer; and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feetasclose to the ground
as they could, that they might not be discovered, and
get as near them as they could possibly, before they
offered to fire.
They had' not been long in that posture, till the
1?
froatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most deject-
ed and dispirited of all the.rest, came walkingtoward*
them with two more of the crew; the captain was sc
eager at having the principal rogue so much in his
power, that he could hardly have patience to let hin:
come so near as to he sure of him; for they only
heard his tongue before: hut when they came nearer
the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, lei
fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the i.eyt
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the third run for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men ; viz
myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-gene: a I .
the captain and his two men, and the three prisoner?
of war whom he had trusted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, ,so thai
they could not see our number; and 1 made the man
they had left in the boat who was now one of us, to
call them by name to try if 1 could bring them lo a
parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms:
which fell out just as we desired : for indeed it was
easy to think, as their condition then was, they would
be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out, as lour'
as he could, to one of them, "Torn Smith, Tom
Smith." Tom Smith answered immediately. "Who's
that? Robinson?" For it seems he knew his voice.
The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's sake, 'J om
Smith, throw down your arms, and yield, or you are
all dead men this moment."
"Who must we yield to? where are they?" says
Smith again. "Here they are," says he; "here is
our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you this two hours ; the boatswain is killed, Will
Frye is wounded, and lam a prison*/ , and if you
do not vield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter then ?" says Tom Smith,
"and we will yield."—" I'll go and ask, if you pro
mise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the cap-
tain, and the captain himself then calls out, " You
Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down your
arms immediately and submit, you shall have your
lives, all but Will Atkins."
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have all been as bad as I," (which by the way was
not true either; for it seems this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid' hold of the captain when they first
mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his
hands and giving him injurious language :) however,
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at
discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy, bv
which he meant me; for they all called me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms^and beg-
ged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed
with them, and two more, who bound them all; and
then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly
with those three, were all but eight, came up and
seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only that 1
kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons ol
state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
bad leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with
them upon the villainy of their practices with him,
and at length, upon the farther wickedness of the it
design; and how certainly it must bring (hem to rnis-
ery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives: as for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the
island; that they thought they had set him on shore
in a barren uninhabited island; but it had pleased
God so to direct them, that the island was inhabited,
and that the governor was an Englishman; that he
might hang them all there if he pleaded; but as h«
had given them all quarter, he supposed he wouic;
send them to England, to be dealt with there as jus-
tice required eycept Atkins, whom lie was command-
ed by the governor to advise to prepare for death {
for that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was ail a fiction of his own, yet it had
its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees lo beg
the captain to intercede with the governor for his life;
and all the rest begged of bin) for God's sake, that
they might not be sent to England.
it now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in to be heart)' In getting
possession of the ship j so I retired in the dark from
thetn, that they might not see what kind of a governor
the)' had, and called the captain to me : when 1 called,
as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to
peak again and say to the captain, "Captain, the
ommander calls for you ;" and presently the captain
replied, " Tell his excellency I am just a-coming."
This more perfectly amused them ; and they all be-
lieved that the commander was just by with his fifty
men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the r*ext
morning.
But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and
two more of the worst of them, and send them pinion-
ed to the cave where the others lay: this was com-
mitted to Friday, and the two men who came on shore
with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ,
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.
The others 1 ordered to my bower, as I called it, ol
vhir-h I have given a full description; and as it was
fenceed in, and they pinioned, the place was secure-
enough, considering they were upon their behaviour
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was
to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try
them, and tell me, whether he thought they might be
trusted or no, to go on board, and surprise the ship.
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the con-
dition they were brought to; and that though the
govcmoi nad given them quarter for their lives, as to
the present action, yet that if they were sent to Eng-
land, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure;
but that if they would join \u such an attempt as to
recover the ship, he would have the governor's engage-
ment for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition: thev
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the worl 1; that they would own him for a father
to them as long as they lived.
"Well," says the captain, "T must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to ccisent to it." So he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that*we might be very secure, I told hira
he should go back again, and choose out five of them,
and tell them that they should see that they did not
want men; but he would takeout those five to be his
assistants, and that the governor would keep the'othei
two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the
castle, (my c^ve) as hostages for the fidelity of those
five; and thfb if they proved unfaithful in the execu-
tion, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no way
ieft them !)ut to accept it.; and it was now the business
of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to per-
suade the other live to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion: 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2.
Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. Tho
other two whom I kept till now in my bovver pinion-
ed ; but, upon the captain's motion, had now released.
4. These five released at last; so thai they were twelve
in all, besides live vv» kept prisoners in the cave for
hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship-. for, as forme,
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asun-
der, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them
fast; but Friday went twice a day to them, to simply
them with necessaries; and I made the other two
carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them, I was the person the
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure that they should not stir
any where but by my direction; that if they did, they
should be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons:
so that as we never suffered them to see me ?.s gover-
nor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like,
upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, hu>.
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
man them; he made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men ; and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other: and they contrived
their business verv well; for they cam*1, up to the <=hb
about midnight. As soon as they came within call m
Uie ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them
he had brought off the men in the boat, but that it
was a long time before they had found them, and the
like; holding them in achat, till they came to the
ship's side ; when the captain and the mate, entering
first with their arms, immediately knocked'down the
second mate and carpenter with the but end of their
muskets ; being very faithfully seconded by their men,
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below; when the olivet
boat, and their men, entering at the fore chains, se-
cured the forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which
went down into the cook-room, making throe men
they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten up, am.1
with two met) and a boy had gotten firearms in theb
hands; and when the mate with a crow split open
the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-
ball, which broke his ami, and wounded two more ol
the men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his
pistol shot the new captain through the head, the bid-
lets entering at his mouth, and came out again behind
one of his ears; so-that he nevet spoke a word; upon
which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken efl'cc
tually, without "any more lives being lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his sue-
ness; which you may be sure I was very glad to hear,
having sat watching upon the shove for it, till nea/
two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid m«
down; and it having been a day of groat fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, i
heard a man call me by the name of governor, gover-
nor; and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms:
"My dear friend and deliverer," says he, "there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all
that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and
Ihere she rode within a little more than half a mile of
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
Rfi they were masters of her; and the weather being
favi, had brougut her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek ; and the tide being up, the
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at
my door.
F was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise: fpr I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
mto my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleaded to go: at
first, for some time, J was not able to answer one
word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast
by him, or 1 should have fallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me:
after I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myself, yet H was a good
while before I could speak a-word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great, an
ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to
compose and bring me to myself; but such was the
floo.l of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits
into confusion; at last it broke into tears, and in a
little while after 1 recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer: and we rejoiced together: I told him, I
looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to de
\iver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be
a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the
testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence, that the eyes
of an infinite Power could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable
whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless Him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in such a wilderness, and such a desolak
condition, but from whom every deliverance muy
always be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me.
he had brought me some little refreshments, such ai
the ship afforded, and such as the wretches who hac
been so long his masters, had not plundered him of. .
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his
men bring the things ashore that were for the gover-
nor; and indeed it was a present, as if I had been
one, not that I was to be carried along with them, but
as if 1 had been to dwell upon the island still, and
they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full o/
excellent cordial waters; six large bottles of Madeira
wine, t.ic bottles held two quarts apiece-; two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the
slip's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas,
and about a hundred weight of biscuit.
Me brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things: but besides these, and
what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-
cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat,
and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
tittle. In a word, be clothed me from head *o foot.
It was n. very kind and agreeable present, as any
15
one may Imagine, to one m my circumstances; dui
never was any thing in the world of that kind so un-
pleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to
wear such clothes at their first putting.on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little anartment,
we began to consult what was to be done witk the
prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering whe-
ther we might venture to take them away with us or
no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be in-
corrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the
captain said, he knew they were such rogues, that
there'was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be de-
livered over to justice at the first English colony he
could come at; and I found that the captain himselj
was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told hin, that, if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make
it their own request that he should leave them upon
the island: " I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, " with all my heart."
"Well," said I, "I will send for them, and talk
with them for you:" so 1 caused Friday and the two
hostages, for they were now discharged, their com-
rades having performed their promise; 1 say, i caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them
there tifl I came.
After some time, T came thither dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being
all met, and the captain with me; I caused the men
to be brought before me, and I told them, I had had
a full account of their villanous behaviour to the cap-
tain, and how they had run away with the ship, and
were preparing to commit farther robberies; but thai
Providence had ensnared them in their own ways,
and that they were fallen into the pit which they had
digged for others.
1 let them know, that by my direction the ship had
been seized, that she lay now in the road, and the}
might see by and by, that their new captain had m
ceived the reward of his villany; for that they might
see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them, I
wanted to know what they had to say, why I should
not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by
my commission they could not doubt I had authority
to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that
they had nothing to say but this, that when they were
taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy; but I told them I knew
not what mercy to shew them; for, as for myself, 1
had resolved to quit the island with ajl my men, and
had taken passage with the captain to go for England:
and as for the captain, he could not carry them to
England, other than as prisoners in irons to be tried
for mutiny, and running away with the ship; the
consequence of which they must needs know, would
be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was hem'
for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island; if they desired that, I did not care, as 'I
had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination to give
them their lives, if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to be
carried to England to be hanged; so I left it on thai
issue.
However the captain seemed to make so/ne difj-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there : upon
this I seemed to be a little angry with the captain, and
told him, that they were my prisoners, not his; and
, that seeing I had offered them so much favour, 1
would be as good as my word ; and that if lie did not
think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty
as I found them ; and if he did not like that, he migh'
take them again if he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods, to the place whence they came, and J
woma *eave tnem some flre-arms, some ammunition
and some directions how they should live very wel^
if they thought fit.
Upon this, f prepared to go on board the ship; but
lold the captain, that I would stay that night to pre-
pare my things; and desired him to go on board in
the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
^end the boat on shore the next day for me ; ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new captain who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up
to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into
discourse with them of their circumstances: I told
them, I thought they had made a right choice ; that
if the captain carried them away, they would cer-
tainly be hangecJ: I shewed them their capiain hang-
ing at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they
had nothing less to expect.
When they >had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them I would let them into the story
of my living there, and put them in the way of mak-
ing it easy to them: accordingly I gave them the
whole history of the place, and of my coming to it:
shewed them my fortifications, the way I made my
bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a
word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I
told them the story of the sixteen Spaniards that were
to be expecied; for whom I left a letter, and made
them promise to treat them in common with them-
selves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords: I had about a bar-
rel of powder left; for after the first year or two I
used but little, and Wasted none. I gave them a de-
scription of the way I managed the goats, and direc
tions to milk and fatten them, to make both butter
and cheese.
In a word, T gave them every part of my own,
torv; and T told them, 1 would prevail with the cap
tain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more,
»nd some garden seed, which I told them I would
have been very glad of; also I gave them the bag ol
peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and
bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, 1 left them the next day, and
went on board the ship: we prepared immediately to
sail, but did not weigh that night: the next mornirg
early, two of the five men came swimming to the
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint
of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for
God's sake, for they should be murdered; and beg-
ged the captain to take them on bpard though he
hanged them immediately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the men,
to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their
chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and
were very thankful for; 1 also encouraged them, by
telling them, that if it lay in my way to send a vessel
tc take them in, I would not forget them.
When 1 took leave of this island, 1 carried on board
for relics the great goat-skin cap 1 had made, my um-
brella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to
take the money I formerly mentioned, which haci lain
by me so'long useless that it was grown rusty or tar-
nished, and c%nld hardly pass for silver, till it had
keen a little rubbed and handled ; and also the money
I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus 1 left the island the nineteenth of Decern.
oer, as I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686,
after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two
month, and nineteen days: being delivered from the
second captivity the same day of the month that I iirrt
made my escape in the barco-Iongo, from among the
Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in Eng-
land the eleventh of June, in the vear 1687; having
been thirty and five years absent. *
When I came to England, I was a perfect stranger
to all the word, as if 1 had never been known there *.
my benefactor and faithful steward, whom 1 had left
in trust with my money, was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow the
second time, and very low in the world: 1 made her
easy as to whai she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude
to her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved
her as my little stock, would afford, which at that
tims would indeed allow me to do but little for her.-
bu^ I assured her I would never forget her former
kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I had suf-
ficient to help her; as shall be observed in its place.'
I went down afterwwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct; except that I found two sisters, and two of
the children of one of my brothers: and as 1 had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been no
provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found
nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little money
I had, would not do much for me as to settling in the
world.
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I
did not expect; and this was that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the
same means saved the ship and cargo, having give-i a
very handsome account to the owners, of the manner
howl had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet them and some other mer-
chants concerned, and all together made me a very
handsome compliment upon that subject, and a pre-
sent of almost two hundred pounds sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the c.ir
camstancesof mv life, and how little wav ibis .voulrt
go towards settting me in the world, I resolved to gL
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some in
formation of the state of my plantation in the Brasils,
and what was become of my partner who, I had
reason to suppose, had some years now given me ovei
for dead.
With this view \ took shipping for Lisbon, where 1
arnved in April following; my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.
When 1 came to Lisbon I found out, by enquiry,
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, ofi
the shore of Africa; he was now grown old and had
left off the sea, having put his son who was far from
a young man, into his ship; and who still used thft
Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and,
indeed, I hardly knew him; but I soon brought my-
self to Ins remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-j
quaintanee, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner; the old man told me, he
had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but
that he could assure me, that when he came away, •
my partner was living; but the trustees, whom I had
joined with him, to lake cognizance of my part, were
both dead ; that, however, he believed that I would
have u very good account of the improvement of the
plantation; for that, upon the general belief of my
being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of vthe plan-
tation, to the procurator fiscal; who had appropriated
it in case I never came to claim it, one thh'd to the
king, and two thirds to the monastry <>f St. Augus-
tine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic
faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to
claim the inheritance, it would be restored* only that
the improvement, or annua) production, being distri
bated to charitable uses, could not be restored: but
M assured me, that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands) and the provedore or steward of the
monastery, hao taken great care all along, that the in-
cumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year
a faithful account of the produce, of which they re-
ceived duly my moiety.
I aksed him, if he knew to what height of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation; and whether ha
thought it might be worth looking after; or whether,
on my going thither, 1 should meet with no obstruc-
tion to my possessing my just right in the moiety.
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what de-
gree the plantation was improved ; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one half of it; and that, to the best
of his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's
third of my part, which,was, it seems, granted away
f.o some other monastry, or religious house, amounted
fo above two hundred moidores a year; that, as to
my being restored to my quiet possessien of it, there
<vas no question to be made of that, my partner being
alive to witness my title, and my name being also
enrolled in the register of the country. Also be told
trie, that the survivors of my two trustees were very
lair, honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed
1 would not only have their assistance for putting me
in possession, but would find a very considerable sum
of money in their hands for my account, being the
produce of the farm, while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above, which, as ho
remembered, was about twelve years.
1 shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the old captain, how it
came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of
my effects, when he knew tha| 1 had made my will,
and had made him the Portuguese captain, my uni-
versal heir, &c.
He told me that was true; bnt that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
o.mnr, until som* certain account should come of my
death; and that, besides, he was not willing to inter
meddle with a thing so remote: that" it was true, he
had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or
alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken
possession of the ingenio, (so they called the sugar-
house) and had given his son, who was now at the
Brasils, order to do it.
"But," says the old man, "I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so accept-
able to you as the rest; and that is,"that believing you
were lost, and all the world believing so also, your
partner and trustees" did offer to account to me in
your name, for six or eight of the first years of profit,
which I received; but there being at that time," says
he, "great disbursements for increasing the works,
building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not
amount to near so much as afterwards it produced;
however," says the old man, " I shall give you a true
account of what I have received in all, and how *
have disposed of it."
_ After a few days farther conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an account of tne six first
years income of my plantation, signed by my partner,
and the merchants' trustees, being always delivered
in goods; viz. tobacco-in roll, and sugar in chests,
besides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence
of a sugar-work ; and 1 found by this account, that
ev^ry year the income considerably increased ; but, as
above, the disbursement being large, the sum at first
was small: however, the old man let me see, that he
was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores
of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen c\ou-
ble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, ho
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon,
»bout eleven years after leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in. a new ship; '*however, my old frwrnl.11 says
11
ne, " you shall Art want a supply in your necessity ,•
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully sa-
tisfied."
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
two hundred Portugal moidoros in gold ; and giving
me the writings of his title to the ship which his son
was gone to the Rrasilsin, of which/he was a quarter
part owner, and his son another, lie puts' them both
in my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kind-
ness of the poor man, to be able to bear this; and re
membering what he had done for me, how he haf
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had user:
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep-
ing at what he said to me: therefore, first I asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much
money at that time, and if it would not straiten him r
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him
ft little ; hut, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
^ Every thing the good man said was full of affec-
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he
spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the moidores,
and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt
for them ; then I returned him the rest, and told him,
if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards
did : and. that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's ship, I would not take it by any means; but that
if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough
to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what
he gave me reason to expect, I would never have o
penny more from him.
When this was past the old man began to ask me
If he should put me in a method to make my claim to
my plantation. I told him, I thought to go over to it
myself. He said, I might do so if I pleased; but
thnt if T rlid not. there were ways enough to secure
my right, and immediately to appropriate the profi.
to my use; and as there were ships in the river
Lisbon, just ready *o go away to Brasil, he made rru
enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit
affirming upon oath that I was alive, and that I wa
the same person who took up the land for the plant
ing the said plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and*
pocuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint
anceatthe place; and then proposed my staying with
him till an account came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable that the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven
months I received a large packet from the survivors
of my trustees, the merchants, on whose account I
went to sea, in which were the following particular
letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account current of the products
of my farm, or plantation, from the year when their
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain,
being for six years ; the balance appeared to be 1174
moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years moro
while they kept the effects in their hands, before th«
government claimed the administration, as being tho
effects of a person not to be found, which they call
civil death,' and the balancc&if this, the value of the
flotation increasing, amounted to crusadoes, whici'
made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustinesac
count, who had received the profits forabove fourtee
years; but not being able to account for what was dit
posed to the hospital, very honestly decr~ '.ed he ha
872 moidores not distributed, which he acknowledge
to my account. As to the king's part, that' refundet
nothing.
There was also a letter of my pamter's, congratu
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive s
giving me an account how tile estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of the
number of squares, or acres, that it contained; how
planted, how many slaves there were upon it; and,
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessing, told mo
he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed
Virgin tMat 1 was alive; inviting me very passionately
to come over and take possession of my own, and in
the mean time to give him orders to whom he should
( eliver my effects,.if I did not come mvseif; conclud-
ing with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of
his family; and sent me as a present, seven fine leo-
pards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which be had sent thither;
and who, it seems, had made a better voyage than I.
He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats,
and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
large as moidores.
Bv the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped me
1200 chests cf sugar, BOO rolls of tobacco, and the rest
of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impossi-
ble to express the flntterings of my very heart, when
T looked over these letters, and especially when I
found all my wealth about me; for as the Brasil ships
come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my
letters brought my goods; and the effects were safe
in the Tagus before the letters came to my hand. In
a word I turned pale, and grew sick ; and had not
the old man run and fetched me a cordial, 1 believe
the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I
had died upon the spot.
Nay. after that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and some-
tiling of the real cause of my illness being known, he
ordered me to be let blood, after which T had relief,
and grew well; but I verily believe, if it had not been
eased by the vent given in that manner to the spirits,
I should nave died.
r wa? now master, flu" ~n a sudden, of above fifty
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate,"
as I might well call it, in the Brasils, oi* above a thou-
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in
England ; and, in a word, J was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to com-
pose myself for the enjoyment of
The first thing I did was to recompense my origi-
nal benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in tlid
beginning, and honest to me at the end. J shewed
him all that was sent me; I told him, that, next to
the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things,
it was owiRg to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold. So I
first returned to him the hundred moidores I had re-
ceived of him; then I sent for a notary, and caused
him to draw up a general release or discharge for the
four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had
acknowledged" be owed me, in the fullest and firmest
manner possible; after which I caused a procuration
to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of
the annual profits of my plantation, and appoint ing
my partner to account to him, and make the returns
by the usual fleets to him in my name; and a clause
in the end being a grant of one hundred moidores a
year to him during his life, out of the effects; an-!
fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life.
And thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer niv
course next and what to do with the estate that Pio-
vidence had Hiusput into my hands; ami, indeed, I
had more care upon my head now than I had in mv
silent state of life in the island, where I war.ted no-
thing but whaH had, and had nothing but what'l
wanted: whereas 1 had now a great charge i/pon m*
and my business was how to secure it: 1 had never?
cave to hide my money in, or a place where it might
lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tar-
nished before any body would" meddle with it On
ths contrary, I knew not where to put it or whom

to trust with it; my old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge 1 had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils seemed,
to summon me thither; but now-1 could not tell how
to think of going thither till 1 had settled my affairs,
and left my effects in some safe hands behind me.
At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who,
I knew, was honest, and would be just to me; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I
knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, 1 had
no way but to go back to England myself, and tak«
my effects with me.
I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this-,, and therefore as 1 had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor,
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thing 1 did, I got
a meichant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent
in London, nor only to p«y a bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in money a hundred pounds from
me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her po-
verty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a
farther supply. At the same time I sent my two sis-
ters in the country, each of them a hundred pounds,
they being, though not in want, yet not in very good
Circumstances; one having been married, and left a
widow; and the other having, a husband not so kind
to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, 1
could not yet pitch upon one to whom 1 durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed "me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils and
have settled myself there.' for I was, as it were, natu-
ralized to the place; but I hr.d some little scruple in
my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me
back of which I shall say more presently. HowRver,
it was not religion that kept me from going thithei
for the present; and as I had made no scruple of be-
ing openly of the religion of the country, all the while
I was among them, so neither did I yet; only that
now and then having of late thought more of it than
formerly, when I began to mink of living and dying
among them, 1 began to regret my having professed
myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die in.
But, as 1 have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to :he Brasils, but that really
I did not know with whom to leave my effects be-
hind me; so I resolved at last to go to England with
them, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make
some acquaintance, or find some relations that would
be faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go
for England wiih all my wealth.
In order io prepare things for my going home, 1
first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved
to give answers suitable to the just and faithful ac-
count of things I had from thence; and first to the
prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks
for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred
and seventy-two moidores,'which was undisposed of
which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, as the prior should direct, desiring the good
radre's prayer for me, and the like.
1 wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees,
with all the acknowledgement that so much justice
and honesty called for; as for sending them any pre-
sent, they were far above having any occasion of it.
Lastly, 1 wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and his in-
tegrity in increasing the stock of the works, giving
him instructions for his future government of my part
according to the powers I had left with my *>ld pa-
tron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became
due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-
larly , assuring him, that it was my intention, no*
only to come to him, but to settle rrijteelf there for the
remainder of my life. To thif I added a very hand-
some present of some Italian silks for his wife and
two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me
he had; with two pieces of fine English broad-cloth,
the best I could get in Lisbon, five nieces of black
bays, and some Flanders lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to go to England. 1
had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had
a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that
time; and though 1 could give no reason for it, yet
the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though
I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases
of such moment. Two of the ships which I had sin-
gled out to go in, I mean more particularly sihgled
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them
to put my things cm board, and in the other to have
agreed with the captain; I say, two of these ship9
miscarried, viz. one was taken by the Algerines, and
the other was cast away on the start, near Torbay,
and all the people drowned except three ; so that in
either of those vessels I had been made miserable,
and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, pressed
me earnestly not to go to sea; but either to go by
land to thb Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay
to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Cailisand Dover;
or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
ihrough France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going
ov sea at all. except from Cailis to Dover, that 1
resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, wa*
by much the pleasanter way; and to makerit more so,
my old captain brought an English gentleman, the
son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel
with me; after which, we picked up two who were
English, and merchants also, and two young Portu-
guese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only: so that
i we were in all six of us, and five servants, the two
merchants and the two Portuguese contenting them
selves with one servant between two, to save the
charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to tra-
vel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday,
who wa9 too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
plying the place of a servant upon the road.
Ih this manner I set out from Lisbon: and oui
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was
the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea jour-
nals, so shall I trouble you with none of my land
journals. But some adventures that happened to us
in this tedious and difficult journey, I must not omit
When we came to ^jjrdrid, we, bGing all of ua
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to
see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth oot
serving; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the
middle of October. But when we came to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the
way, with an account that so much snow was fallen
on the French side of the mountains, that several tra-
vellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, aftei
having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me that Jiad been always used to«
hot climate, and indeed to countries where we could
acarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable.
79
nor Indeed was jPriore painful than it was si/rprfs
ing: to come but ten flays before out of the Old Cas-
tile wiitre the weather was not only warm, but very
hot, ana immediately to feel a wind from the Pyre-
nean mountains, so very keen, so severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and per-
ishing of our fingers and toes, was very strange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold wea-
ther, which he had never seen or felt before in his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said, winter was come before its
time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were
now quite impassible: in a word, the snow lay in
some places too thick for us to tiavel; and being not
hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries, there
was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We staid no less than twenty days
at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,
and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the
severest winter all over Europe that had been known
In many years) I proposed that we should all go a way
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux,
which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on
the French side of the passes as we were on the Spa
nish, had found out a guide, who traversing the coun-
try near the head of Languedoc, had brought then-
over the mountains, by such ways, that they were not
much incommoded with the snow; and where the}
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was fni
Jten hard enough to bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who toid us, he would un
dertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently
out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a
bear out of the hollow way adjoining to a thick wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and bad he
been half a mile before us, he had been devoured in-
deed, before we could have helped him; one of them
fastened upon his horse and the other attacked the
man with that violence, that he had not time, or not
presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hal-
looed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Fri-
day being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Fr.day came in
sight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as the other,
"O master! 0 master!" But, like a bold fellow,
rode directly up to the man, and with his pistol shot
the wolf that attacked him in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he having been used to that kind of crea-
ture in his country, had no fear upon him but went
close up to him, and shot him as above; whereas any
of us would have fired at a farther distance, and have
perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered shoot-
ing the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and the noise
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious mulr'ude of
them; and perhaps indeed theie was not such a few,
as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that had fastened upon the horse, left him immediate-
ly, and fled, having happily fastened upon his head,
where the bosses of the bndle had stuck in his teeth,
so that he had not done him much hurt: the man, in-
deed, was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little
to protect us from wild beasts: for he said, upon theM bove 1,s.knc,e; and h* ™sJust as "w^re tumbling
great snows it was frequent for some wolves to shew down ,b57he dlSQrd" °f ^* h°rse' when Fnday ca™

were told we were in most danger from, especially on
the French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there w#s no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed
to follow him ; as did also twelve other gentlemen,
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed
I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves iiji a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be
seen; but on a sudden, turning, to the left, he ap-
proached the mountain another way ; and though it is
true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadfully, yet
he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us
by such winding ways, we insensibly passed the height
of the mountains without VQpg much encumbered
with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gas-
coigne, all green and flourishing; though indeed thej
were at a great distance, and we had some rough
Way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
ft snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that we
could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should
Boon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began
to descend every day, and to come more north than
before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.
It was. about two hours before night, when oui
guide being something before us, and not just in sight
plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had
i disengaged the poorguide; though we did not present-
I ly discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
si ch a surprising manner, as that which followed be-
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though
at first we were surprised and afraid for him) the
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy,
clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,
which is swift and light; so he has two particular
qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions:
first, as to men, who are not his proper prey, I say
not his proper prey, because though I can't say what
excessive hunger might do, whic)i was now their case,
the ground being all covered witii snow; yet as to
men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they
first attack him; on the contrary, if you meet him in
the woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't
meddle with you; yet then you must take care to be
very civil to him, and give him the road; for he is a
very nice gentleman, he won't go a step out of the
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another way, and keep going on;
for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look
steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; and \i
yr>u throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him,
the ugh it were but a bit of stick as big a? your finger,
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business
aside to pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfac-
tion in point of honour, and this is his first quality;
the next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but
follow at a good round rate till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when
Ave came up to him, he was helping him off from hit
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
horse; for the man was both hurt and frighted, and
indeed the last more than the first,; when'on a sud-
den, we espied the hear come out of the wood, and a
very monstrous one. it was, the biggest by far that ever
J saw: we were all a little surprised when we saw
him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in the fellow's countenance :"0 ! O!
O!" says Friday three times, pointing to him, "6
master! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand
with him, me makee you good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased : " You
fool you," said I, he will eat you up."—" Eatee
me up ! eatee me up !" says Friday twice over again;
"me eatee him up; me make you good laugh • you
all stay here, me shew you good laugh." So down
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and put
on a pair of pumps, (as we call the ilat shoes they
wear) and which he had in his pocket, and gives my
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he
flew, swift like tlte wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him
"Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speakee wit
you." We followed at a distance; for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun-
try was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in
it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone,
and throws at him, and hit him just on the head;
but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it
against a wail; but it answered Friday's end; for the
rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to
make the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh,
as hi) called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
Uims about, and comes after hiin, taking devilish long
«tn"les and shuffling alons at a strange rate, so as ha
would put a horse to a nmluhug gailop. Away rum
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at
him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when
he was going about his own business another way;
and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear
upon us, and then run away; and 1 called out " You
dog," said I, "is this your making us laugh ? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature." He hears me, and cries out, "No shoot,
no shoot, stand still, you get much laugh :" and as the
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one he
turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a
great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned us to
follow, and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the
tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about
five or six yards from the bottom of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at
the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly as I thought it,
of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the
bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, "Ha," says he to us, "now you see me
teachee the bear dance;" so he falls a-jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to-totter,
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see
how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh
heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a
* great deal: when he sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, ** What you come no farther? Pray
you come farther.". So he left jumping and shaking
the bough ; and the bear, just as if hftmderstood what
lie said, did come a little farther; then-he fell a-jump-
ing again, and the bear slopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head and called to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly,
•' O pray ! O pray! no shoot, me shoot b}\ and then;"
lie would have said by and by. However, to shorten
die story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood
>o ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but
aill could not imagine what the fellow would do; for
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
>ff; and we found the bear was too cunning for that
too; for he would not get out far enough to be thrown
lown, but clings fast with his great broad claws and
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the
cud of it, and where the jest would be at last.
But Friday puts us out of doubt quickly; for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not be persuaded to come any farther; "Well, well,"
>aid Friday, "you no come farther, me go, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you;" and upon thi?
he goes out tQ the smallest end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came
near enough to jump down on his feet; and away he
ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.
"Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you
do now? Why don't you shoot him?—" No shoot,"
says Friday, "no yet; me shoot now me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh;" and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he come back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till be
got into the body of the tree; then with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time,
very leisurely. At this juncture, and j-jst befcre ho
could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday st&Tiped
ct<»se to mm, ciappeo me mu/zie of tus piece into hi*
ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a-laughing himself very loud ; "So we
kill oear in my couniry," says Friday. "So you kill
them?" said 1; a why, you have no guns."—«' No,"
•ays he, " no guns, but shoot great much long arrow.*
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but w©
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed except
the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which
I have said something already, I never heard any
tiring that filled mc with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called us
off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous crear
ture off, which was worth saving; but we had three
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left
him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deop and dangerous as on the mountains; and
the ravenous creatures,*as we heard afterwards, were
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed
by hunger, to seek foJjjbod, and had done a great
deal of mischief in theWiflages, where, they surprised
the country-people, killed a great many of their sheep
and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which out
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country, we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side,
and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to
pass to get through the wood; and then we should
come to the village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset, when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, when
we came into the plain. We met with nothing in the
first wood, except that in a little plain within the
81
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we
saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one
after another, as if they had heen in chase of some
prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of ms,
and were gone and out of Fight in a few moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was u
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready
posture; for he believed there were uore wolve.*
a-ooming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us:
but we saw no more wolves till we came through thai
wood which was near half a league, and entered tluj
plain: as soon as we came into the plain, we had oc-
casion enough to look al)out us. The first object we
met with was a dead horse, that is. to say a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least a doneu ol
them at work; we could not say eating of him, bin
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all
the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast-
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him b\
any means; for I found we were like to have more
business upon our hands than we were aware of. We
were not half gone over the plain, but we be.^an tn
hear the wolves howl in the woods, on our left, in a
frightful manner; and presently after we saw alxnit a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,
and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army
drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in
what manner to receive them ; but found to draw our-
selves in a close line was the only way; so we formed
in a moment; but, that we might not have too much
interval, I ordered, that only every other man should
fire; and that the others, who had not fired, should
stand ready to give them a second volley immediate-
ly if they continued to advance upon us; and tha'
then those who had fired at fir*t, should not prcte-.r!
to load their fusils again, but stand ready, with even-
one n pistol, for we were all armed with a fusil and a
pair of pistols each man; so we were, by tins ineilion.
able to fire six vollies, half of us at a time; however,
at present we had no necessity; for, upon firing the
first volley, the enemy made a full slop, being terri-
fied, as well with the noise as with the fire; four o)
them being shot in the head, dropped; several others-
wea* wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see
by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not im
mediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that
had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified
at the voice of a man, I caused all our company to
halloo as loud as we could, and I found the notion
not altogether mistaken ; for upon our shout, they be-
gan to retire, and turn about; then I ordered a second
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the
gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might lose no time, we kept doing; but we
had but little more than loaded our fusils, and put our-
selves into a readiness, when we heard a terrible
"noise in the same wood on our left; only that it was
farther onward the same way we were to go.
The nigbt'was coming on, aud the night began to
<»e dusky, which made it th^worsc on oursjde; but,
the noise increasing, we ctjflaeasily perceive that it
was the howling and yelling^Jpiose hellish creatures;
and, ou a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves on our left, one behind us,and one on our front,
so that we seemed to be surrounded with them ; how-
eter, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way
forward, as fast as we could make our horses go,
which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
ef the entrance of the wood through which we were
to pass at the farther side of the plain; but we were
greatly surprised, when, coming near the lane, or pass,
we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
th^ entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
Heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that way, «i»
rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him,
flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him full speed: indeed the horse had the heels
of them; but as we supposed that he could not hold
it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up
with him at last; and no question but they did.
Here we had a mo<rt horrible sight; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcass of another horse, and of two men devour-
ed by these ravenous creatures, and of one the man
ivas no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun,
lor there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the
man, his head, and the upper part of his body, were
ealen up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
tliev gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey;
and f verily believe there were three hundred of them.
(t happened very much to our advantage, that at the
entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there
lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down
rhe summer before, and I suppose lay there for car-
riage: I drew my little troop in among these trees*
and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before
ris for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three
fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatutes made upon
*.$ in this place; they came on us with a growling kind
of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber (which, as
f said, was our breastwork,) asif they were only rush*
mg upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems,
was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses
"behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I or-
dered our men to fire as before, every man; and the>
took their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several
of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a ne-
cessity to keep a continual firing, for they came o*
like devils, those hehind pushing; on those before.
When we had fired our second volley of fusils, we
thought thpy stopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others
came forward again; so we fired our vollies of pis-
tols; and 1 believe in these four firings we killed se-
venteen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as ma-
ny; yet they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ; so 1
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was
better employed ; for, with the greatest dexterity ima-
ginable, he charged my fusil and his own, while we
were engaged; but, as I said, I called my other man;
and gviving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a
train all along the piece cf timber, and let it be a large
train; he did so, and had but time to get away, when
the wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon
it ; when 1, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the
powder, set it ou fire; and those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
Cell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire: we dispatched these in an instant,
and the rest were so frighted with the light, which the
night, for now it was very near dark made more te> 
rible, that they drew back a little.
Upon*which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout x
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied imme-
diately upon near twenty lame ones, which we found
striding on the ground, and fell a cutting them with
our swords winch answered our expectation for the
crying aud howling they made were better understood
by their fellows; so .that they fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about three sctw* of
them; and had it been daylight, we had killed many
more. The fieW of battle being thus cleared, we marid
forward again; for we had still near a league to go.
We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in tha
woods as we went, several times; and sometimes we
fancied we saw *>me of them, but the snow dauling

CRUSOE.
more we came to the town, where we were to lodgb,
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms,
for, it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and
some bears had broken into that village, and nut them
in a terrible fright; and they weie obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to
preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wo mds
that he could go no farther; so we were oblited t<
take a new guide there, and go toTholouxc, where w<
found a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, anc
no snow, no wolves, or anv thing like them; bin
when we told our story rtt Tholuose, they told us it
was nothing but what was ordinary in the great Jbresi
at the foot of the mountains, especially When the snow
lay on the ground; but they inquirer! much what kind
of a guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring
us that way in such a severe season; and told us, it
was very much we were not all devoured. When we
told ihem how we placed ourselves, and the horses in
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told u?
it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed; for
it was the sight of the horses (hat made the wolves so
furious, seeing their prey: and that at other times the)
are really afraid of a gun; but they being excessive
hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to
cone at the horses had made them senseless of dan-
ger; and that if we had not by the continued lire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of power, mas-
tered them, it had been great odds but that we had
been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content tc
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen,
they would not have taken the horses so much for their
own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise;
and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood
all together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in out
hands, and being so manv in number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in
my life; for seei«g above three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to shelter us, o<r retreat to, 1 gave myself over
for lost; and as it was, I believe, i shall never care to
cross those mountains again; I think I would much
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though 1 uere
sure to meet with a storm once a week.,
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in m)
passage through France; nothing but what other try
vellers have given an account of, with much more ad
vantage than I can. I 'travelled Iron) Tholouse u.
Paris, and without any considerable stay came tc
Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Janu-
ary, after having had a severe cold season to travel in
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe
about me, the bills of exchange, which 1 brough'
with me, having been very currently paid.
My principal guide and privy-counsellor was m\
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
1 had sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely
with every tiling, that I was perfectly easy as to the
security of my effects; and indeed I was very happy
from my beginning, and now to the end, in the un*
- spotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my eftects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to
the Brasils. But now another scruple came in the
way, and that was religion; for as 1 had entertained
some doubts about the Roman religion, ovemwhile I
was abroad, especially in my state of solitude; so I
knew there was no going to the Brasils for me, much
ess going to settle there, unless 1 resolved to embrace
4 the Koman Catholic religion, without any reserve;
except on the other hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to
my principles, be a martyr for religion, and die in the
Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at.home, and, if I
mould find means for it, to dispose of my plantation
To this purpose I wrote to ny old friend at Lisbon,
vho in return gave me notice, that he could easily
dispose of it there: but that if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to the two mer-
chants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the
Brasils, who must fully understand the value of it,
who lived just upon the spot, and who I knew to be
very rich, so that he believed they would be fond o<
buying it; be did not doubt, but I should nmkc 4 or
5000 pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly r agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent meao ac-
count, that they had accepted the offer, and had re-
mitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pav for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my
old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for lUjUUf
pieces of eight for the estate; reserving the payment

life, which I had promised them ; and which the plan-
tation whs to make good ;is a rent-charge. And thus
1 have given the first part of a life of fortune and ad-
venture, a life of iVoviilmce'schequcr-work, and oi
variety which the world will seldom be able to shew
the like of: beginning foolishly, but closing much
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave
to much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of compli-
cated good fortune, I was past running anv more
hazard*. dnd so indeed 1 had been, if other circum-
stances nad concurred: but I was inured to a wan-
dering life, had no family, nor many relations; nor
however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance;
and though 1 had sold my estate in the Brasils, yet I
could not keep that country out of my head, and had
a great mind to be upon the wing again ; especially I
could not resist the strong inclination I had to see mv
island, and to know if the poorSpaniaros were moemg
there ; and how the rogues I left there had used ihem.
My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that almost for
seven years she prevented my running abroad; dur-
ing which time I took my two nephews, the children
of one of my brothers, into my care : the eldest hav-
ing something,of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his
i-state, after my decease; the other I put out to a cap-
tain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a sen-
sible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into
a good ship, and sent him to sea: and this young fel-
low afterwards drew me in, as old as f was, to far-
ther adventures myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here : for,
first of all, I married, and that not either to my dis-
advantage or dissatisfaction ; and had three children,
two sons and one daughter: but my wife dying, ai d
my nephew coining home with good success from a
voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his
importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his
ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was
in the year lf>!>4. Wflfe
In This voyage I vi^Jp my new colony in the
island, saw my successorwie Spaniards, had the whole
story of their lives, and of the villians I left there;
how at fust they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they
afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and
how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence
with them : how they were subjected tothe Spaniards;
how honestly the Spaniards used them ; an history, jl
it were entered into, as full of variety and wondeiful
accidents as my own part: particularly also as to their
battles with the Carribbeans, who landed several times
upon the»island, and as tothe improvement they made
upon the island itself: and how five of them made an
attempt upon the main land, and brought away eleven
men and five women prisoners; by which, at my com-
ing, I found about twenty voung children on the island.

H«*o I stayed about twenty days; left them sup-
plies of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
fowder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which
brought from England with me; viz. a carpenter
and a smith.
Besides this, 1 shared the lands into parts with them,
reserved to myself the property of the whoie, but
gave them such parts respectively, as they agreed on;
and, having settled all things with them, and engaged
them not to leave the place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence
I sent a bark, which 1 bought there, with more peo-
ple, to the island ; and in it, besides other supplies, I
sent seven women, being such as I found proper foi
service, or for wives to such as would take them. As
to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo oj
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing; which I afterwards could not perforin: the fel-
lows proved very honest and diligent, after they were
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them
I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three 01
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some bogy,
which, when 1 came again, were considerably in-
creased.
But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Carribees came and invaded them, and ruin-
ed their plantations, and how they fought with that
whole number twice, and were at first defeated and
one of them killed; but at last a storm destroying then
enemies'canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all
the rest, and renewed and recovered tiie possession of
their plantation, and still lived upon the island :—
All these things, with some very surprising iucidenti
in some new adventures of my own for ten vears more,
I may, perhaps, give a farther account o* herea'Ksu.
PAET II.
THAT homely proverb used on so many occasions i«
England, viz. "That, what is bred in the bone will
not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than
in the story of my Life. Any one would think, that
after thirty-five years affliction, and a. variety of un-
happy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever,
went through before, and after near seven years oi
peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things .
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me
to have had experience of every state of middle life,
and to know which was most adapted to make a man
completely happy ; T say, after all this, any one would
have thought that the native propensity to rambling,,
which I gave an account of in my first setting out into
the world to have been so predominant in my thought,
should be worn out, the vaj^iie part be fully evacu-
ated, or at least condensewHpd I might at sixty-one
years of age have bepn a little inclined to stay at home,
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.
Nay farther, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away m m*.; »or I had no fortune to
make, I had nothing to sock if 1 had gained ten
thousand pounds, I bad been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those 1 had to leave
it to, and that 1 had was visibly increasing; for hav-
ing no great family, I could .not spend the income of
what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive
way Of living, such as a great family, servants, equi-
page, gaiety, and, the like, which were ihingx ! ha I no
notion of, or inclination to: so 'hat 1 had noting in-
deed to do, but to sit'still, and fully enjoy what 1 had
got, and see it increase dailv noon my hands.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had
to go abroad again, which hung about me like a chro-
nical distemper; particularly the desire of seeing m>
new plantation in the island, and the colony I left
there, run in my head continually. J dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day: i
was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy
worked so steadily and stiongly upon it, that I talked
of it in my sleep: in short, nothing could remove i
out of my mind; it even broke so violently into all
my discourses, that it made my conversation tiresoma
for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run
into it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.
I have often heard persons of good jedgment say,
that all the stir people make in the world about ghosts
and apparit'.ons, is owing to the strength of imagina-
tion, and the powerful operation of fancy in their
minds; that there is no such thing asa spirit appear-
ing, or a ghost walking, and the like; that people's
poring affectionately upon the past conversation ol
their deceased friends so realizing it to them, that they
are capable of fancying upon some extraordinary cir-
cumstances that they see them, talk to them, and are
answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing
but shadow and vapour in the thing; and they really
know nothing of the matter.
For my part. I know not to this hour whether there
are any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or
walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing of the stories they tell us of that
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds,
and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my
imagination worked up to such a height, and brough
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may
".all it, that I actually supposed myself oftentimes
upon the spot, at my old castle behind the trees, saw
my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobata
sailors whom 1 left upon the island; nay, I fancied I
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily,
though 1 was broad awake, ns at persons just before
me; and this 1 did till I often frightened myself with
the images my fancy represented t» me: one time ia
my sleep I had the villan) ol the thiee pirate sailors so
lively related to me, by the first Spaniard and Friday**
father, that it was surprising; they told me how they
barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards,
and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid
up, on purpose to distress and starve them; things tha
I had never heard \>f, and that were yet all of them
true in fact; but it was so warm in my imagination,
:md so realized to me, that to the hour I saw them, I
could not be persuaded but that it was or would be
irue; also how I resented it when the Spaniard com-
plained to me, and how I brought them to justice,
rried them before me, and ordered them all three to be
hanged. What there was really in this, shall be seen
in its place; for however I came to form such things
in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits in-
jected it, yet there was, I say, very much of it true.
I own that tnis dream had nothing literally and speci-
fically true; but the general part was so true, th? base
and villanous behaviour of these three hardened
rogues was such, and had been so much worse than all
I can describe, that the dream had too much simili-
tude of the fact; and as T would afterwards have
punished them severely, so if I had hanged them a)l,
I had been much in the right, and should have been
justifiable both by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my story.—In this kind of temper
f had lived some years, I had no enjoyment of my
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion, but
what had something or other of this in it; so that my
wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told
me very seriously one night, that she believed there
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence
upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engaged to a wife and children. Sh«
told me, that it was true she could not think of patf. .

ADVENTTTRES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
mg with me; but as she was assured, that if she vvat
dead it would be the first thing I would do; so, as it
seemed to her that the thing was determined abovej
she would not be the only obstruction ; for if I thought
fit and resolved to go Here she found me very in
tent upon her words, and that I looked very eamestl)
at her; so that it a little disordered her, and she stop-
ped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out
what she was going to say? But I perceived her heart
was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes; "Speak
out, my dear," said I; " are you willing I should go?"
"No," says she, very affectionately, "I am far from
willing: but if you are resolved to go," says she,
-- and rather than I will he the only hindrance, I will
S" with you; for though I think it a preposterous thing
lor one of your years, and in your condition, yet if it
must be," said she again, weeping, "I won't leave
you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is
no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your duty to
go, he will also make it mine* to go with you, or
otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it."
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me
a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy,
and began to argue with myself sedately, what busi-
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a life
of tedious suffering and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a manner, I say, what business had I
to rush into new hazards, and put myself iipon adven-
tures, fit only for youth and poverty to run into?
With those thoughts, I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife
then great with child of another; that 1 had all the
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazards
for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of
seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had
said, of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it
should be my duty to go, 1 had no notion of that; so
after many of these cogitations, I struggled with th«
power of my imagination, reasoned myself oui of it,
as I believe people may always do in like cases,
if they will; and, in a word, I conquered it; com-
posed myself with such arguments as occurred to mj
thoughts, and which my present condition furnished
me plentifully with; and particularly, as the mos*
effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some business that migh»
effectually tte me up from any more excursions of this
kind; for I found the thing return upon me chief!)
when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any thing o^
moment immediately before me.
To this purpose I bought a little farm in the count}
of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. 1
had a little convenient house upon it. and the lane
about it 1 found was capable of great improvement,
and that it'was many ways suited to my inclination,
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and ^improving of land; and particularly, being an
inland country, I was removed from conversing
among ships, sailors, and things relating to the remote
part of the world.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work,
'jecame in one half year a mere country gentleman;
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,
&c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man
always bred to misfortunes was capable of being re-
treated to.
I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull up or cut
down as I pleased; what I planted was for myself,
and what I improved, was for my family; and having
thus left off the thoughts o? wandering, I had not the
least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed tht
middle state of life which my father so earnestly r*
commended tome, a kind of heavenly life, something
like what is described by the poet upon the subject of
a country life:
Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pains, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow froti
unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once; and no
Only made a breach upon me, inevitably and incurable
but drove me, by its consequence, upon a deep relaps
into the wandering disposition, which, as I may say
being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold
of me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper,
came on with an irresistible force upon me; so that
nothing could make any more impression upon me.
This blow was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon ,
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues, I
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of
all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the en-
gine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy
compass I was in, from the most extravagant and
ruinous project that fluttered in my head as above;
and did more to guide my rambling genvis, than a
mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's coun-
sel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. 1 was
happy i(n listening to her tears, and in Doing moved
by her entreaties, and to the las! degree desolate and
dislocated in the world by the loss of her.
When she was gone the world looked awkwardly
round me, I was as much a stranger in it in my
thoughts as I was in the Brasils when I went first on
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assist*
ance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew nei»
ther what to do, or what not to do; I saw the world
busy round me, one part labouring for bread, and the
other part squandering in vile excess or empty plea-
sures equally miserable, because the end they propos-
ed still fled from them; for the men of pleasure every
dav surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for
sorrow and repentance, and the men of labour spent
their strength in daily smugglings for bread to main-
tain the vital strength they laboured with; so living in
a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only
end of a wearisome life, and a wearisome life the only
occasion of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my king-
dom the island, where I suffered no more corn to
grow, because I did not want it; and bred no more
goats, because I had no more use for them; where the
money lay in the drawer till itgrew mildewed, and had
scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years.
All these things, had I improved them as I ought to
have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to
me, would have taught me to search farther than hu-
man enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there was
something which certainly was the reason and end ot
life,superior to all these things, and which was either to
be possessed,or at least hoped for,on this side the grave.
But my sage counsellor was gone, I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind;
my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my
head was quite turned withtffce whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleaWginnocentamusements
of my farm and my garden, my cattle.and my family,
which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to
me, had no relish, and were like music to one that
has no ear, or food to one that has no taste: in a
word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my
form and return to London; and in a few months
after I did so.
When I came to London I was still as uneasy as
before; I had no relish to the place, no employment
in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle
person, of whom it may be said, he is perfectly useless
in God's creation, and it is not one farthing matter to
the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive. This
also was the thing which of all circumstances of lift
85
ras the most my aversion, who had been all my dayi
used to an active life; and I would often say to myself,
** A state of idleness is the very dregs of life;" and
indeed I thought I was much more suitably employed
when I was twenty-six days making a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander
cf a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made; he came to me,
and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance
had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to
life East Indies and to China, as private traders;
"And now, uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea
with me, I'll engage to land you upon your old habi-
tation in the island, for we are to touch at the Brasils."
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserv-
ed, and not communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing
of what he had in his thoughts to say, when that very
morning, before he came to me, I had., in a great deal
of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of
my circumstances in my mind,come to this resolution,
viz. that T would go to Lisbon and consult with my
old pea-captain ; and sO, if it was rational and practi-
cable, I would go and see the island again, and see
what was become of my people there. I had pleased
myself also with the thoughts of peopling the place,
and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent
for the possession, and I know not what; when in the
middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have
•aid, with his project of carrying me thither, in his.
way to the East Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily
at him, " What devil," said 1, " sent you of this un
luckr erran 1 ?" Mv nephew startled, as if he bad brev
frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much dis-
K leased with the proposal, he recovered himself. •* 1
ope it may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir," says he;
•« I dare say you would be pleased to see your new co-
lony there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother-monarchs in the world."
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession I was under,
and of which 1 have said so much, that I told him, in
a few words, if he agreed with the merchants I would
go with him: but 1 told him I would not promise to
go any farther than my own island. "Why, sir,"
says he, «* you don't want to be left there again, 1
hope ?"—" Why," said 1, "can you not take me up
again in your return?" He told me, it could not be
possible that the merchants would allow him to come
that way with aloaden ship of such value, it being
a month's sail out of his way, and might be three oi
four: "Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry," said he,
"and not return at all, then you would be just reduced
to the condition you were in before."
This was very rational; but we both found out a
•emedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which being taken in pieces and ship-
ped on board the ship, mjjht, by the help of some
carpenters, whom we agreeoto carry with us, be set
up again in the island, and finished fit to go to sea in
a few days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importu
nities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my
inclination, that nothing could oppose me: on the
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con-
cerned themselves so much for me, as to persuade me
onp way or other, except my ancient good friend the
widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider
my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless
hazard of a long voyage; and, above ali, my young
chiLdren: but it was to no purpose; I had an irre:
•istible desire to the voyage ; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon )v. L? wmpressioiii
T had upon my mind for the voyage, that it would b«
a kind of resisting Providence, if I should attempt to
stay at home; after which she ceased her expostula-
tions, and joined with me, not only in making pro-
vision for my voyage, but also in settling my family
affairs in my absence, and providing for the education
of my children.
In order to this I made my will, and settled tha
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in 6uch hands, that I was, perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever
might befal me; and for their education, I left it
wholly to my widow, with a sufficient maintenance u»
herself for her care : all which she richly deserved;
for no mother could have taken more care in their
education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January 1694-5, and I with my man Friday went
on board in the Downs the 8th, havjng, besides that
sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
sargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which if I did not find in good condition, I resolved
to leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I
purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to
set on work there upon my own account while I
stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry thern
forward as they should appear willing; particularly,
I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy,
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, but was
also a general mechanic; for he was dexterous at
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was a
good turner, and a good potmaker; he also made any
thing that was proper to make of earth, or of wood;
in a word, we called him our Jack of all Trades.
With these I carried a tailor, who had offered him-
self to go passenger to the East Indies with my ne-
phew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new
plantation, and proved a most necessary handy fellow
as couid oe desired, in many othei businesses besides
that of this trade; for as I observed formerly, necej
Bity arms us for all employments.
My cargo, as near as 1 can recollect, for I have not
kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a suffi-
cient quantity of linen, and some thin English stuffs
for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there,
and enough of them as by my calculation might com-
fortably supply them for seven years: if I remember
right, the materials which f carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things
as they could want for wearing, amounted to above
two hundred pounds, including some beds, bedding,
and household-stuff, particularly kitchen utensils,with
pots, kettles, pewter, orass, &,c. besides near a hun-
dred pounds more in iorn-work, nails, tools of every
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary
things i could think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not what
time and what extremities I was providing for, I car-
ried an hundred barrels of powder, besides swords,
cutlasses,and the iron part of some pi£cs and halberts;
so that, in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts
of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship
to leave behind if there was occasion; that when they
tame there we might build a fort, and man it against
II sorts of enemies: and indeed I at first thought
there would be need enough of it all, and much more,
fcf we hoped to maintain our possession of the island,
as shall be seen in the course of the story.
1 had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had
been used to meet with: and therefore shall have the
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may
ije impatient to hear how matters went with my co-
lony; vet some odd accidents, cross winds, and baci
I w-saltier happened on this first setting out,which made
ADYENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and 1,
Who had never made but one voyage, viz. my first
voyage to Guinea, in which 1 might be said to come
back again as the voyage was at first designed, began
• to think the same ill fate still attended me; and that 1
was born to be never contented with being on shore,
and yet to be always unfortunate at eea.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland,
where we lay wind bound two-and-thirty days; but
we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that provi-
sions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost
plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched
the ship's stores, but rather added to them : here also
I took several hogs, and two cows with their calves,
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on
shore in my island; but we found occasion to dispose
otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very fair gale of wind for some davs; as I re*
member, it migh; be about the 20th of Febvuary, in
the evening late, when the mate having the watch.
came into the round-house, and told us he saw a flasl
of fire and heard a gun fired ; and while he was tell-
ing us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain
heard another. This made us all run out upon the
quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but
in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found
that there was some very terrible fire at a distance.
Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in
which we all agreed that there could be no land that
way in which the fire shewed itself, no, not for five
hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. Upon
this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea;
and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before,
we concluded it could not be far off, we stood directly
towards it, and were presently satisfied we should dis-
cover it, because the farther we sailed the greater the
light appeared, though the weather being hazy we
eould not perceive any tiling but the light for a while.
In about half an hour's sailing, the wind oemg lait
tor us, though not much of it, and weather clearing
up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a
great ship on fire in the middle of the sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster,
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged
in it; I presently recollected my former circum-
stances, in what condition I was in when taken up
by the Portugal captain ; and how much more deplo-
rable the circumstances of the poor creatures belong-
ing to this ship must be if they had no other ship in
company with them : upon this I immediately ordered
that five guns should be fired, one soon afier another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them that
there was help for them at hand, and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though
we could see the flame in the ship, yet they, it being
night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight; when
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had rea-
son to expect it, the ship blow up in the air, and im-
mediately sunk. This was terrible, and indeed an
afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I
concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship,
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the rrpd-
dle of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it was
dark, I could not see; however, to direct them as
well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all
the parts of the ship where we could, and which we,
had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long; letting them know by this, that there was a
ship not far off.
About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered
the ship's boat, by the help of our perspective-glass;
f nd found there were two of them, both thronged
ivi'tli people, and deep in the water; we perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
•aw our ship, and did the utmost to make us see them. ,
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them j
know we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a signal
for them to come on board, and then made more
sail, standing directly to them. In a little^ more than
half an hour we came up with them, and in a word
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four rnen,
women and children; for there were a great many
passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French me*
chant-ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bound
from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The maste
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, how
the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the
steersman; but, on his crying out for help, was, as
every body thought, entirely put out: but they soon
found that some sparks of the fire had gotten into
some part of the ship, so difficult to come at, that
they could not effectually quench it: and afterwards
getting in between the timbers, and within the ceiling
of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and mastered
all the skill and all the application they were able to
exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty
large; being their long-boat, and a great shallop, be-
sides a small skiff, which was of no great service to
them, other than to get some fresh water and provi-
sions into her, after they nan secured themselves from
the fire. Thev had indp*»d small hope of their Uvea
by getting into these boats at that distance from any
land ; only, as they said well, that they were escaped
from the fire, and had a possibility, that some ship
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in.
They had sails, oars, and a compass ; and were pre-
paring to make the best of their way to Newfound-
land, the wind blowing pretty fair; for it blew an
easy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provisions
and water, as, with sparing it so as to be next door
to starving, might support them about twelve days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds, the captain said, C hoped he might eet to the
Danks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some
fish to sustain them till they might go on shore. But
there were so many chances against them in all these
cases; such as storms to overset and founder them •,
rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs; con-
trary winds to keep them out and starve them ; that
it must have been next to miraculous if they had
escaped.
In the mids of their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain with tears
in his eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four
more; these were the five guns which 1 caused to he
fired at first seeing the light: this revived their hearts,
and gave them the notice whicji, as above, 1 designed
it should, viz. that there was a ship at hand for theii
help.
It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took
down their masts and sails; and the sound coming
from the windward they resolved to lie by till morn-
ing. Some time after this, hearing no more guns,
they fired three muskets, one a considerable while
after another; but these, the wind being contrary, we
never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with»efeing our lights, and hear-
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be
fired all the rest of the night: this set them to work
with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at least that
we might the sooner come up with them ; and at last,
lo their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several ges-
tures, the strange ecstacies, the variety of postures,
which these poor delivered people run into, to express
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance \
grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears, groans,
and a very few motions of head and hands, make up
the sum of its variety. but an excess of joy, a surprise
of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it; there were
some in tears, some raging and tearing themselves,
87
•s if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow,
some stark raving an<i downright lunatic; some ran
about the ship stamping with their feet, others wring-
ing their hands; some were dancing, several singing,
gome laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a word; others sick and vomiting, se
veral swooning and ready to faint; and a few wer«
crossing them and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward; brl the passion
\v;as too strong for them at first and they were uot able
to master it; they were thrown into ecstasies and a
kind of frenzy, and so there was but a very few who
were composed and serious in their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to
it, from the particular circumstance of the nation they
belonged to; 1 mean the French, whose temper is al-
lowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and more
sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than of other
nations. I am not philosopher to determine the cause,
but nothing I bad ever seen before came up to it: the
ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when
he found his father in the boat, came the nearest to
it; and the surprise of the master, and his two com-
panions, whom I delivered from the two villains thai
set them on shore in the island, came a little way to-
wards it; but nothing was to compare to this, eithei
that I saw in Friday, or any where else in my life.
It is farther observable, that these extravagances
did not shew themselves in that different manner I
have mentioned, in different persons only; but all the
variety would appear in a short succession of mo-
ments, in one and the same person. A man that we
8aw this minute dumb, and,, as it were, stupid and
confounded, should the next minute be dancing and
hallooing likean antic; and the next moment a-tearing
his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamp-
ing them under his feet like a madman; a few minutes
after thai, we should have him all in tears, then sick,
then swooning; and had no* immediate help been
ted, wouid in a few moments more have been dead-,
and thus it was, not with one or.two, or ten or twen-
ty, but with the greatest part of them ; and, if I remem-
ber right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty
of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old
man and the other a young man; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per
ceived in him ; our surgeon immediately applied pro-
per remedies to recover him ; and was the only man in
ihe ship that believed he was not dead ; and at length
he opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and
rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possi-
ble: upon this the blood which only dropped at first,
(lowed something freely; in three minutes after the
man opened his eyes; and about a quarter of an houT
after that he spoke, grew better, and, in a little time,
quite well; after the blood was slopped he walked
about, told us lie whs perfectly well, took a dram ol
cordial which the surgeon gave him, and was, what
we called, come to himself; about a quarter of an
hour after this they came running into the cabin to
the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman that
had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change
of hiscircumstances in his mind, and this put him into
tn ecstasy of joy: his spirits whirled about fastei
than the vessels couid convey them; the blood grow
hot and feverish; and the man^was as fit for Bedlam
as any cieature that ever was in it; the surgeon would
not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him
Omething, to doze and put him to sleep, which, after
some time, operated upon him, and he walked next
morning perfectly composed and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great com-
mand of his passion, and was really an example of a
lerious well-governed mind • at his first coming on
board tne ship, he threw himself flat on his face, pro*
trating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance ; in
which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him,
really thinking he had been in a swoon : but he spok«
calmly; thanked me; told me he was giving God
thanks for his deliverance; begged me to leave him a
few moments, and that next to his Maker he would
give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
aiso; he continued in that posture about thee mi-
nutes, or a little more, after I left him, then came to
me as he had said he would, and with a great deal
of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes,
thanked me that had, under God, given him and so
many miserable creatures their lives: I told him, I
had no room to move him to thank God for it rather
than me; for I had seen that he had done that al-
ready ; but I added, that it was nothing but what rea-
son and humanity dictated to all men, and that we
had as much reason as he to givt thanks to God, who
had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments
of his mercy to so many of his creatures.
After this the young priest applied himself to his
country-folks ; laboured to compose them ; persuaded,
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his ut-
most to keep them within the exercise of their reason;
and with some he had success, though others were,
for a time, out of all government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as per-
haps, it may be useful to those into whose hands it
may fall, in the guiding themselves in all the extrava-
gances of their passions; for if an excess of joy can
carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of
their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger,
rage and a provoked mind, carry us to? And, indeed,
here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch
over our passions of every kind, as well those of joy
iikd satisfaction, as those of sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extrava
gances among our new gue>ts for the first day; but
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, being fatigued and
frightened, they were qui e another sort of people
the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledg-
ments for the kindness shewn them, was wanting; the
French, it is known are naturally, apt enough to ex-
ceed that way. The captain and one of the priests
came to me the next day , and desiring to speak with
me and my nephew, the commander began to consult
with us what should be done with them; and first
they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all
ihey had was little enough for a return to us for the
kindness received. The captain said, they had saved
some money, and some things of value in their boats,
oatched hastily out of the flames; and if we would
accept it, they were ordered to make an offer of it
dl to us; they only desired to be set on shore some-_
where in our way, where, if possible, they might get
a passage to France.
My nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards; hut 1 overruled him in that part; for I knew
what it was to be set on shore in a strange cc.iitry;
*nd if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea. had
served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance,
f must have starved, or have been as much a slave at
the Brasils as I had been at Barbary. the being sold
to a Mahometan only excepted; and perhaps a Por-
tuguese is not a much better master than a Turk, if
not, in some cases, a much worse.
I therefore told the French captain that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true; but that
it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow creatures,
iind as we would desire to be so delivered, if we were
in the like or any other extremity ; that we had done
nothing for them,, but what we believed they would
. have done foY us if we had been m their case and thef
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
In ours; but that we took them up to serve them, not
to plunder them; and that it would be a most barba-
rous things, to fake that little from them which they
had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore
and leave them ; that this would be first to save them
from death and then kill them ourselves; save them
from drowning and then abandon them to starving;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken
from them: as to setting them on shore, I told then?
indeed that was an exceeding difficulty tons, for that
the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though
we were driven out of our course to the westward a
very great way, which perhaps wasdirected by Heaven
on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible
for us wdlingly to change our voyage .on this parti-
cular account; nor could my nephew, the captain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under \
charter-party to pursue his voyage by the way of Bra-
si I; and all I Vnew he could do for them was, to put!
ourselves in. the way of meeting with other ships!
homeward-bound from the West-Indies, and get them'
passage, if possible, to England or France.
The first pari uf the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East
Indies; they then entreated me, that seeing I was
driven so far to the westward before I met with them,
I would at least keep on the same course to the banks
of Newfoundland, where it was possible I might meet
with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry
them back to Canada, from whence they came.
I thought this but a reasonable request on their
pail, and therefore I inclined H* agree to it; for in-
deed I considered, that to carry ihis whole company
to the East Indies would not only be an intolerable
severity to the poor people, but would be ruining our
whole voyage by devouring all our provisions: so 1
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an un-
foreseen accident mad« absolutely necessary to us;
and m wnicn not one could say we were to hlame;
for the laws of God and nature would have forbid»
that we should refuse to take up two boats full of peo-
ple in such a distressed condition ; and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor
people, obliged us to see them on shore some where or
other, for their deliverance; so 1 consented that we
would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and wea-
ther would permit; and, if not, that I would carry
them to Martinico in the West Indies,
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather
pretty good ; and as it had blowed continually in the
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed
several opport.unit.es of sending them to France; for
we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two
were French, from St. Christopher's; but they had
been so long beating up against the wind, that they
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provi-
sions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for
those they should take in; so we were obliged to go
on. It was about a week after this, that we made
the banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my
story, we put all our French people om board a bark,
which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore,
and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could
get provisions to victual themselves with: when, I
say, all the French went on shore, 1 should remember
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage
with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Ooro-
mandel: I readily agreed to that; for I wonderfully
liked the man, and had very good reason, as will ap-
pear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered them-
selves in our ship, and proved very useful fellows.^
From hence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. and S, by E. for about twenty
days together, sometimes little or no wind at all
When we met with another subject for our humanity
to work upon, almost as deplorable'as that before
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N
and the 19th of March 1684-5, when we espied a
sail, our course S. E. and by S. Wc soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
could not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we fonud she had lost hei
main-topmast, foremast, and bowsprit; and presently
she fires a gun as a signal of distress. The weather
was pretty ••od, wind at N. N W. a fresh gale, and
we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Bar-
bados, a few days before she was ready to sail by a
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate
\ve»e both gone on shore ; so that beside the terror oi
the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for
good artists to bring the ship home; they had been al
ready nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible storm after the hurricane was over, which had
blown them mute out of their, knowledge to thevwest-
ward, and in which they had lost their mast*,, ?,c
above; they told us, they expected to have seen the
Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to
the south-east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.
the same that blew now, and having no sails'to work
the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of square
sail upon a jury-foremast, which they had set up, they
could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring
to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst oi all, was, that they
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides
the fai*gues they had undergone: their bread and
flesh wus quite gone, they had not an ounce left in
the ship, and had had none for eleven days; the only
relief they had, was, their water was not all spent,
and they 'had about half a barrel of flour left; they
'iad sugar enough ; some succades or sweetmeats they
nad at first, hut they were devoured; and they had
•seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-
•sprvnnt. on hoard, who were going passengers, and
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began; and,
having no provisions of their own left; they were in
a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the sea-
men, being reduced to such an extreme necessity them-
selves, had no compassion, wc may be sure, for fhe
poor passengers; and they were indeed in a condition
that their misery is very hard to describe.
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship; the second mate,
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had
been on board our ship; and he told me indeed, that
they had three passengers in the great, cabin, that they
were in a deplorable condition; "Nay," says he,
"I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of
them for above two days ; and I was afraid to inquire
after them," said he, "for 1 had nothing to relieve
them will)."
We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spare; and indeed 1 had so far
overruled things with my nephew, that I would have
victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia,
or any part of the coast of America, to have supplied
ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger, for they were
afiaid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them. The male or commander brought six men
wit!) him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked
like skeletons, and were so weak they could hardly
sit to their oars; the mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved, for he declared he had reserved nothing
from the men and went share and share alike with
them in every bit they ate.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three
mniithfuls before lie began to be sick, and out oi
ordei ; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed
him up something with some broth, which he said
89
wouid he to nim both food and physic; and after h*
had taken it, he grew better; "in the meantime I for-
got not the men; I ordered victuals to be given them,
and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it;
they were so exceeding hungry, that they were in •
manner ravenous, and had no command of them-
selves; and two of them ate witli so much greediness,
hat they were in danger of their lives the next morn-
»g
The sight of these people's distress was very mov-
ing to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island,
where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any
hopes of procuring it; besides the hourly apprehen-
sion I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the
miserable condition of the ship's company, I could
not put out of my thought the story he had told me of
the three poor creatures in the great cabin ; viz. the
mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had
heard nothing of for two or three* days; and whom
he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected, thei/
own extremities being so great; by which I under-
stood, that they had really given them no food at'all;
and that therefore they must be perished, and be all.
lying dead perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called
captain, on board with his men to refresh them, so I
also forgot not the starving crew that were left on
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the
6hip,and with my mate and twelve men to carry them
a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to
boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat
to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep ^uard in
the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking it to eat
raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was well
boiled, and then to give every man but a little at a
lime ; and by this caution he preserved.the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that venr
food that was given tnera on purpose to. save theii
lives.
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into th»
.great cabin and see, what condition the poor passen-
gers were in, and, if they were alive, to comfort them
and give them what refreshment was proper; and the
Burgeon gave him a large pitcher with some of the
prepared broth which he had given the mate that wai
on board, and which he did not question would re-
store them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as 1 said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was
ready; but my mate observed his order, and kept a
good guard at the cook-room door; and the man he
place I thereafter using all possible persuasion to have
patience, kept them 6ff by force: however, he caused
some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and soften-
er] them with the liquor of the meat, which they call
brewis, and gave everyone one,to stay their stomachs,
and told them it was for their own safety that he was
obliged to give them but little at a time. But it was
al| in vain, and had I not come on board, and their
own commander and officers with me, and with good
words and some threats also of giving them no more,
I believe they would have broke into the cook-room
by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace; for
words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry
belly: however, we pacified them,'and fed them gra
dually and cautiously for the first time, and the next
time £ave them more, and at last filled their bellies,
and the men did well enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin
*as of another nature, and far beyond the rest; for
a*, first, the ship's company had so little for them-
selves, it was but too true, that they nad at first kept
them very low, and at last totally neglected them; so
that for six or seven days, it might be said, they had
really had no food at all, and for several days before1
vcrv little.
The poor mother, who, as the mate first reported,
was a woman of good sense and good breeding, had
spared all she could get so affectionately for her son,
that at last she entirely sunk under it: and when the
mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sur.k in
between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite
dead. My mate said all he could to revive and en-
courage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her
mouth; she opened her lips, and lifted up one hand,
but could not speak; yet she understood what he said,
and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late
for her; and pointing to her child, as if she would
have said, they should take care of him. •
However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not; but it was too late, and she died
the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone;
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him; he had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaien- up the rest of it;
however, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him
some time after but two or three spoonfuls extraordi-
nary, he was very sick, and brought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid; she lay all
along upon the deck hard by her mistress, azid Juki'
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and
snuggled for life; her limbs were distorted, one of
her hands was clasped round the frame of one chair,
and she griped it so hard, that we could not easily
make her let it go; her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the
frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like
one in the last agonies of death; and yet she was
alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with hun-
ger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as
the men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for
her mistress, whom she saw dying two or three days
oefore, and whom she loved most tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great
knowledge and experience, and with great application
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hand as
to her senses, for she was little less than distracted for.
a considerable time after; as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a
journey into the country, where sometimes people stay
a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business was
to relieve this tMstrssed ship's crew, but not lie by for
them; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts; how- •
ever, as their captain begged of us to help him to set
up a main-topmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury-
foremast, we did, as it were, lie by him for threo or
four days and then having given him five barrels of
beef and pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a pro-
portion of peas, flour, and what other things we could
spare; and taking three casks of sugar and some rum,
and some pieces of eight of them for satisfaction, w«
left them, taking on board with us,at their own earnest
request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a
pretty, well bred, modest and sensible youth; gteatly
dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as it seems*

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
haa Io3t his father but a few months before at Barba-
does He begged of the surgeon to speak to me, U>
take him out of the ship- for he said, the cruel fellows
had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had,
that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a
small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that
might have preserved her life, though it had been jusl
to keep her alive. But hunger knows no friend, no
relation, no justice, no right; and therefore is remorse-
less, and capable of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his friends, and
put him perhaps in as bad circumstances, almost, as
we found them in ; that is to say, starving in the
world. He said he mattered not whither he went, if
he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he
was among; that the captain (by which be meant me,
for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved
his life, and he was sure would not hurt him; and as
for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she
would be very thankful for it, let us carry them whi-
ther we would. The surgeon represented the case so
affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them
both on board with all their goods, except eleven hogs-
heads of sugar, which could not l>e removed, or come
at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I
made his commander sign a writing, obliging him to
go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers,
a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him,
and all the goods h.e had belonging to the deceased
widow; which I suppose was not done; for I could
never learn that the ship came to Bristol; but was. as
is most probable, lost at sea, being in so disabled a
condition, and so far from any land, that I am of
opinion, the first storm she met w:(h afterwards she
might founder at sea; for she was 1 aky, and had
damage in her hold when I met with her.
I was now inVhe latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather
(hough at first the winds had been contrary.' 1 shaft
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, wea-
ther, currents, &c. on the rest of our voyage; but,
shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow,
shall, observe that I came to my old habitation, tho
island, on the 10th of April, 1G95. It was with nn
small difficulty that I found the place; for as I came
to it, and went from it before, on the south and east
aide of the island, as coming from the Brazils; so now
coming in between the main and the island, and hay-
ing no chart for the coast, nor any land mark, I 'did
not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it
or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oroo-
n.oque, but none for my purpose: only this I learnt
by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great
mi stake "before, viz. that the continent which I thought
1 saw from the island I lived in, was really no conti.
rent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands
reaching from one to the other side of the extended
Mioufh of that great river; and that the savages who
/ame to my island, were not properb those which we
call Carribees, hut islanders and otlrer barbarians of
same kind, who inhabited something nearer to our
side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of the islands to no pur-
pose; some I found were inhabited, and some were
rot. On one of them I found some Spaniards, and
thought they had lived there; hut speaking with them,
found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by,
and that they came thither to make salt, and catch
some pearl-muscles, if they could; but they belonged
to the fslede Trinidad, which lay farther north, in
the latitude of 10 and 11 degrees.
Thus coasting from one island to another, some-
limes with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's
lhallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and
Iherefore kept her with their very good will,) at length
Vcame fair on the south side of my island, and I pw
nently knew the very countenance of the place; so I
brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside with the
little creek where was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and
isked him, if he knew where he was? He looked
about a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried,
O yes, O there, 0 yes, O there !" O pointing to oui
old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a
mad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him from
jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.
"Well, Friday," said i, "do you think we shall
find any body here, or no ? and what do you think,
shall we see your father?" The fellow stood mute
as a stock a good while ; but when I named his father,
the poor affectionate creature looked dejected •, and I
could see the tears run down his face very plentifully.
u What is the matter, Friday? said I; u are you
troubled because you may see your father?"—"No,
no," says he, shaking his head, "no see him more,
no ever more see again."—" Why so," said I, u Fri-
day ? how do you jjjnow that?"—" O no, O no," says
Friday, "he long ago die; long ago, he much old
man."—" Well, well," said I, ** Friday, you don't
know : but shall we see any one else then'?" The fel-
low, if seems, had better eyes than I, and he points
just to the hill above my old house; and though we
lay half a leage off, he cries out, " Me see! me seel
yes, yes, me see much man there, and there, and
there." L> looked, but could see nobody, no, not
with a perspeetive-glass; which was, I suppose, be-
cause 1 coujkl not hit the place; for the fellow was
right as I found upon inquiry the next day, and there
were five or six men ail together stood to look at the
Bhip not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had toM me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired
three guns, to give them notice we were friend?; and
about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a
smoke rise from the side of the creek; so I immedi-
ttelv ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me ; and
hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, I weiu
aireetly on shore, taking with me the young friar i
mentioned, to whom J had told the whole story of my
living there, and the manner of it, and every particu-
lar both of myself and those that I left there, and who
was on that account extremely desirous to go with me.
We had besides about sixteen men very well armed,
if we had found any new guest there which we did
not know of; but we bad no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near
nigh water, we rowed directly into the creek ; and the
first man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whose
life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face per-
fectly well; as to his habit, 1 shall describe it after-
wards. 1 ordered nobody to go on shore at first but
myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat;
for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a
distance, a good way off of the Spaniards, where in-
deed 1 saw nothing of him ; and if they had not let
him go on shore he would have jumped into the sea.
He was no sooner on shore, bm he llevv away to his
father like an arrow out oi a bow. h'wouid have
made any man shed tears in spite of the firmest reso-
lution, to have seen the first transports of this poor
fellow's joy, when he came to his father; how heein-
biaced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him up
in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down
by him; then stood and looked at him a» any one
wotild look at a strange picture ilx a quarter of an
hour together; then lay down upon the ground, and
stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up
again, and stared at him ; one would have though the
fellow bewitched : but it would have made a dog
laugh to see how the next day his passion run out an-
other way: in the morning he walked along the shore,
to and again, with his father, several hours, always
keading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady;
and every now and then would come to fetch some-
thing or other for him from the boat either a lump of
91
uiigar, or oram, a biscuit, or something or other that
was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran anothet
way, for then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and made a thou-
sancl antic postures and gestures, and all the while he
did this he would be talking to him, an! telling him
one story or another of his travels, and of what had
happened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, il
the same filial affection was to be found in Christians
to their parents in our parts of the woridaone would
be tempted to say there hardly would have been any
need of the fifth commandment.
Bnt this is a digression ; I return to my landing. It
would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies
and civilities that the Spaniards received me with.
The first Spaniard whom, as I said, I knew very well,
was he whose life I saved : he came towards the boat
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also:
and he did not only know me at first, but he had
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was come
till I spoke to him. "Seignior,1' said I, in Portu
guese, "do you not know me?" At which he spokt
not a word; but giving his musket to the man that
was with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying
something in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear,
came forward, and embraced me, telling me, he was
inexcusible not to know that face again that he had
once seen, as of an angel from Heaven sent to save
his life : he said abundance of very handsome things,
as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how •, and then
beckoning to the person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his comrades. He then asked me if J
would walk to my old habitation, where he would
give me possession of my own house again, and where
I should see there had been but mean improvements:
so I walked along with him; but, alas! I could no more
find the placq again than if I had never been there;
for they had planted so many trees, and placed them
in such a posture, so thick and close to one another,
in ten years time they were grown so big, that, in
ihot, the place was inaccessible, except by such wind
ings, and blind ways as they themselves only wh<?
made them could find.
I asked them, what put them upon all ihese fortifi-
cations? He told me, I would say there was need
enough of it, when they had given an account how
they had passed their time since their arriving in the
island, especially after they had the misfortune to find
that T was gone: he told me he could not but have
some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard
that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that
one time or other he should see me again : but nothing
that ever befel him in his life, he said, was so sui-
prising and afflicting to him at first, as the disap-
pointment he was under when he came back to the
island, and found I was not there.
As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
6tory to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their num-
ber was so small. "And," says he, " had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purga-
tory;" and with that he crossed himself upon the
hreast. "But, Sir," says he, ** I hope you will not
be displeased, when I shall tell you Ikw, forced by
necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation,
to disarm them, and making them our subjects, who
wou'.d not be content with being moderately our mas-
ters, but would be our murderers." I answered, 1
was heartily afraid of it when I left them there; and
nothing troubled me at my parting from the island,
i»ut that they were not come back, that I might have
put them in possession of every thing first, and left
the other in a state of subjection, as they deserved:
but if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad,
Jnd should be very far from finding any fault with it;
for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungo-
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner oi
mischief.
While 1 was saying this came fhe man whom he had
gent back, and with him eleven men more: in th«
dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what
nat'ic they were of; but he made all clear both to
thein and to me Frst he turned to me, and pointing
to them, said, "These Sir, are some of the gentle-
men wno owe their lives to you;" and then turning
to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who
I was; upon which they all came up one by one, not
as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and
I the like, b- .t really as if they had been ambassadors
or noblemen, and I a monarch or a great conqeror
their behaviour was to' the last degree obliging ana
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly majestic gra-
vity, which very well became them; and, in short,
they had so much more manners than I, that I scarce
knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to
return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in the
island after my going away, is so remarkable, and ha»
sn many incidents, which the former part of my rela-
tion will help to understand, and which will, in most
of the particulars, refer to that account I have already
<nven, that I cannot but commit them with great de-
fight to the reading of those that come after me.
1 shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in
the first person, which will put me to the expense of
ten thousand Said I's, and Said he's, and He told me's
aod I told him's, and the like ; but I shall collect the
facts h'»stoncally as near as 1 can gather thorn out of
my memory from what they related to me, and from
what 1 met with in my conversing with them, and
with the place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly af
1 can, I must go back to the circumstance in which I
left the island, and which the persons were in of whom
I am to speak. At first it is necessary to repeat, that
I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard,
the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages;
I sav, I had sent them away in a large canoe to the
mam, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard'!
companions whom he had left behind him, in order ti
Bave them from the like calamity that he had been in,
and in order to succour them for the present, and that,
if possible, we might together find some way for our
ieliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appear-
tnce of, or the least room to hope for, my own deli-
/erance, any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after hap-
pened, 1 mean of an English ship coming on shore
there to fetch them ofF; and it could not but be a very
great surprise to them when they came back, not only
to find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left
on the spot, possessed of all that I had left behind me,
which would otherwise have been their own.
The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that
I might begin where I left off, was of their own part;
and I desired he would give me a particular account
of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat,
when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me
there was little variety in that part; for nothing re-
markable happ^ed to them on the way, they having
very calm weaBr and a smooth sea ; for his country-
men it conld not be doubted, he said, but that they
were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the prin-
cipal man among them, the captain of the vessel tney
had been shipwrecked in having been dead some
time :) they were, he said, the more surprised to see
him, because they knew not that he was fallen into the
hands of savages, who, they were satisfied, would de-
vour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners;
hat when he told them the story of the deliverance,
and in what manner he was furnished for carrying
them away, it was like a dream to them; and their
astonishment, they said, was something like that of
Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he was,
and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharoah's
court; but when he shewed them the arms, the powder,
the baD and the provisions that he brought them fot
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRTJSOE,
Their Journey ®r voyage, they were restored to them
selves, took a just share of the joy of their deliver
ance, and immediately .prepared to come away with
him.
Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the ho-
nest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly sa
vages, and to borrow two large canoes or periguas
on pretence of going out a-fishing, for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready,
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi-
sions, or any thing in the world, but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used
to make their bread. %
^ They were in all three weeks absent, and in thai
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island ; leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable vil-
lains behind me that any man could desire to meet
with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disap-
pointment you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to
them and gave them provisions and other relief, as 1
had ordered them to do; also they gave them the
long paper of directions, which I had left with them,
containing the particular methods which I took fo»
managing every part of my life there; the way how
I baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and plant-
ed my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and, in a word, every thing I did; all this being
written dpwn, they gave yto the Spaniards, two ol
whom understood English\vell enough ; nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time; they
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my metnod
and Friday's father together managed all their affairs i
for as for the Englishmen they did nothing but ram-
ble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tor
toises, and when they came home at night, the Spa-
v niards provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the other but have left them alone; which,
However, they could not find in their hearts to do
long; but, like the dog in the manger, they would not
eat themselves, and would not let .others eat neither:
but differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial,
and such as are rot worth relating: but at last it
broke out into open war, and it began with all the
rudeness and insolence that can be imagined, without
reasm, without provocation, contrary to nature, and
indeed to common sense; and though, it is true, the
first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves,
whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to
examine the fellows they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a defect in my former relation; and this
was that I forgot to set down among the rest, that
just as we were weighing the auchjpto set sail, there
happened a little quarrel on boardour ship, which I
was afraid once would turn to a second mutiny ; nor
was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his cou-
rage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them
by force, and making two of the most refractory fel-
lows prisoners, lie laid them in irons; and as they
had been active in the former disorders,- and let fall
some ugly dangerous words the second time, he threat-
ened to carry them in irons to England, and have
them hanged there for mutiny, and running away
with the snip.
This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to
do it, frighted some other men in the ship ; and some
of them had put it in the heads of the rest, that the
captain only gave thern good words for the present till
they should come to some English port, and that then
they should be all put into a goal, and tried for theli
lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; upon which it was desired that 1, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down
with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them, that
they might be assured if they behaved well the rest
of the voyage, all they had done for the time past
should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my
honour's word to them they appeared easy, and the
more so, when I caused the two men who were in
irons to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor fcr
that night, the wind also falling calm. Next niornh.$
we found that our two men who had been laid in
irons, had stole each of them a musket and some other
weapons i w'nat powder or shot they had we knew
not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not
yet haled up, and run away with her to their compa-
nions in roguery on shore.
As sopn as we found this, I ordered the long-boat
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to seek the rogues; but they could neither
rind them nor any of the rest; for they all fled into
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore.
The mate was once resolved, injustice to their rogue-
ry, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all their
household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift
without it; but having no order, lie let all alone, left
every thing as they found it, and bringing the pinnace
away, came on board without them.
These two men made their number five: but the
other three villains were so much wickeder than these,
that after they had been two or three days together,
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to shift
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with
them ; nor could ttiey, for a good while, be persuaded
to give them any food: as for the Spaniards, they
were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on snore, the busi
ness began to go forward; the Spaniards would have
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in
their two countrymen again, that as they said, they
might be all one family; but they would not hear of
it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and"
finding nothing but industry and application would
make themiive comfortable, they pitched their tent9
on the north shore of the island, but a little more to
the west, to be out of the danger of the'savages, who
always landed on the east part of the island.
Here \}?.zy built two huts, one to lodge in, and the
other to lay up their magazines and stores in; and
the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed,
and especially some of the peas which I had left them,
they dug and planted, and enclosed, after the pattern
I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well;
their first crop of com was on the ground, and though
it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up
at first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough
to relieve them, and find ihem with bread, or other
eatables; and one of the fellows being the cook's mate
uf the ship, was very ready at making soup, pud-
dings, and such other preparations, as the rice and
the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished
him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men too, in mere humor and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was theirs;
lhat the governor, meaning me, had given them pos-
session of it, and nobody else had any right to it: and,
damn them, ihey should build no houses upon theil
ground unless they would pay them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first, and
isked them to come and sit down, and see what fine
nouses they were that they had built, and teli tnein
ffhat rent they demanded: and one of them merrily
told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped u
they built tenements uoon the land and made improve
93
mints, they would, according to the custom of all
landlords, grant them a long lease; and bid them go
fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the
three, damning and raging, told them they should see
they were not in jest; and going to a little place at
a distance, where the honest men had made a fire tr
dress their victuals, he takes a fire hrand and claps i*
to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on
fire ; and il would have been all burnt down in a few
minutes, if one of the two had not run to ttie fellow,
thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet,
and that not without some difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a
pole he had in his hand; and had not the man avoided
the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had
ended his daysatonce, His comrade, seeing the dan-
ger they were both in, ran in after him, and immedi-
ately they came both out with their muskets; and the
man that was first struck at with the pole knocked
the fellow down who began the quarrel with the stock
of his musket, and that before the other two could
come to help him; and then seeing the rest come at
them, they stood together, and presenting the other
ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them if th«y of-
fered to move hand or foot they were all dead men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed lay down their arms; but see-
ing him resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to lake their wounded man with them,
and be gone: and, indeed, it seems the fellow was
wounded sufficiently with the blow: however, they
were much in the wrong, since they had the advarv
lage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as
ttiey might, have done, and have gone immediately to
the Spaniards, and given them an account how the
rogues had treated them ; for the three villinns studi-
died nothing but revenge and every day gave them
some intimation that they did so.
But not to crowd this part with an account of the
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids and a she goat,
which the poor men had got to breed up tame foi
their.store; and in a word, plaguing them night and
day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three
the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order
to this they resolved to go to the castle, as they called
it, that was my old dwelling, where the three rogues
and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, in-
tending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should
stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morn-
ing before day, and came to the place, and called the
Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that
answered, that they wanted to speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards, having been in the woods, had seen one of the
Nwo Englishmen, whom for distinction, I call the
wriest men ; and he had made a sad complain to th«
Spaniards, of the barbarous usnse they had met with
from their three countrymen, and how they had ruin-
ed their plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they
had laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed
the milch-goat, and their three kids, which was all they
had provided for their sustenance; and that if he and
his friends meaning the Spaniards did not assist them
again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards
came home at night, and they were all at supper, he
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them,
how they could be so cruel, they being harmless in-
offensive fellows, and that they were putting them-
selves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it
had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to
•uch perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly "what
id they to do there? That they came on shore with*
out leave, and that they should not plant or ouild upon
the island; it was none of their ground."—" Why,"
says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior, Inglesc,
they must not starve." The Englishman replied, like
ft true rough-hewn tarpaulin, " they might starve and
be d—ed, they should not plant nor build in that
place."—" But what must they do then, Seignoir?"
says the*Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned,
"Do ! d—n them, they should be servants, and work
for them."—*' But how can you expect that of them?
they are not bought with your money; you have no
right to make them servants." The Englighman an-
swered, "The island was theirs, the governor had
given it to them, and no man had any thing to do there
but themselves;" and with that swore by his Maker,
:hat he would go and bum all their new huts; they
should build none upon their land.
"Why, Seignoir" says the Spaniard, " by the same
rule, we must be your servants too."—" Ay," says
the bold dog, and so you shall too, before we have
done with you;" mixing two or three G—d d—mme's
in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. How-
ever, this little discourse had heated them ; and start-
ing up, one says to the other, 1 think it was he they
called Will Atkins, " Come, Jack, let us go and have
the other brush with them; we will demolish their
castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no colony
m o'ir dominions."
Upon this they were all trooping away, with every
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
Insolent things among themselves, of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered
but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly un
derstand them as to know all the particulars; only
that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking
the two Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards said they did not know;
but it seems thev wandered about the country part of
the night; and then lying down in the place which I
.used to call my bower, they were weary, and overslept
themselves. The case was this: they had resolved to
stay till midnight, and so take the poor men when
they were asleep]; and they acknowledged it after-
wards, intending to set fire to their huts while they
were in theirr?and either burn them in them, or mur-
der them as they came out; and, as malice seldom
sleeps very sound, it was very strange tbey should
not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a des'gn upop
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one thar
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very
luckily for them all,that they were up,and gone abroad
Defore the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.
When they came thither, and found the men gone,
Atkins who it seems was the forwardest man, called
out to his comrades, " Ha ! Jack, here's the nest; but
d—n them, the birds are flown." They mused awhile
to think what should be the occasion of their being
e;one abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the
Spaniards' had given them notice of it; and with that
they shook hano^pand swore to one another, that they
would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as
they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work
with the poor men's habitation; they did not set fire
indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both theii
houses, and pulled them so limb from limb, that they
left not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on
the ground where they stood; they tore all their littla
collected household-stuff in pieces, and threw every
hing about in such a manner, that the poor men
ound, afterwards, some of their things a mile oS
torn their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the
oung trees which the poor men had planted; pulled
up the enclosure they had made to secure their cattle
and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plunder-
ed every thing, as completely as a herd of Tartan
would have done.
n
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever
they had been, though they were but two to three; so
that, had they met, there certainly would have been
bloodshed among them : for they were all very stout
resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them asun-
der, than they themselves could do to meet: for as
they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thither,thet\vo were here; and afterwards, when
the two went back to find them, the three were come
to the old habitation again: we shall see their differ*
ing conduct presently. When the three came back,
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the
work they had been about put them into, they came
up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had
done by way of scoff aud bravado; and one of them
stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had
been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat,
as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about,
fleering in his face, says he to him, "And you, Seig-
nior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you
do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, who,
though quite a civil man, was as brave as a man could
desire to be, and withal a strong well-made man, look-
ed steadily at him for a good while; and then, having
no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him,
and with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as
an ox is felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the
rogues insolent as the first, fixed his pistol at the Spa-
niard immediately; he missed his body indeed, fo
the bullets- went through his hair, but one of them
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much,
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more
hurt than he really was, and that put him into some
heat, for before he acted all in a perfectcalm ; but now-
resolving to go through with his work, he stooped
and took the fellow's musket wh m he had knocked
down and was just going to shoot the man who had
fired at him; when the rest of the Spaniards, being in
che cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot,
they stepped in, secured the other two, and took their
arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their
own countrymen, they began to cool; ajid giving the
Spaniards better words, would have had their arms
Bgain; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that
was between them And the other two Englishmen, and
hat it would be the best method they could take to
keep them from one another, told them they would
do them no harm; and if they would live peaceably
Ihey would be very willing to assist and associate with
them, as they did before; but that they could not
think of giving them their arms again, while they ap-
peared so resolved to do mischief with them to their
own countrymen, and had even threatened them all
to make them their servants.
The rougues were now more capable to hear reason
than to act reason; but being refused their arms, they
went raving away, and raging like madmen, threaten-
ing what they would do,though theyJ^id no fire-arms:
hut the Spaniards, despising their ^reatening, told
them they should lake care how they offered any in-
jury to* their plantation or. cattle; for if they did, they
would shoot them, as they would do ravenous beasts,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their
hands alive, they would certainly be hanged. How-
ever, this was far from cooling them; but away they
went, swearing and raging like furies of hell. As
soon as they were gone, came back the two men in
passion and rage enough also, though of another kind;
for having been at their plantation, and finding it all
demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be
supposed thev had provocation enough; they could
ucarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were
do eager to tell them theirs: and it was strange enough
to find, that three men should thus bully nineteen, and
recieve no punishment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and espeel
ally naving thus disarmed them, made light of their
threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to
have their remedy against them, what pains soever it
cost to find them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, anc lold
them, that they were already disarmed: they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: u But," said
thegrave Spaniard, who was their governor," we will
endeavour to make them do you justice, if you wil.
leave it to us; for, as there is no doubt but they will
come to us again when their passion is over, being
not able to subsist without our assistance, we promise
you to make no peace with them, without having a
full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them,
other than in your defence."
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkard
ly, and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards pro
tested, they did it only to keep them from bloodshed,
and to make all easy at last; " For," said they, " w i
are not so many of us; here is room enough for us all,
and it is great pity we should not be all good friends."
At length they did consent, and waited for the issuj
of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards;
for their own habitation was destroyed.
In about five days time the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, hav-
ing chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came
back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as
I have said, was the governor, and two more with
him, walking by the side of the creek; they came up
in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to
be received again into the family. The Spaniards
used them civilly, but lold them, they had acted so
unnaturally by their countrymen, and so very grossly
by them, (the Spaniards) that they could not come to
any conclusion without consulting the two English-
men, and the rest: but however thev would go to
them, and discourse about it, and tfoey should know
in half an hour. It may be guessed that they were
very hard put to it; for it seems, as they were to wait
this half-hour for an answer,'they begged he would
send them out some bread in the meantime; which
he did, and sent them at the same time a large piece
of goat's flesh, and a broiled parrot, which they ata
very heartily, for they were hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation they were called
in, and a long debate had about them, their two coun-
trymen charging them with the ruin of all their la-
bour, and a design to murder them ; all which they
owned before, and therefore could not deny now;
upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them ; and as they ha%! obliged the two Eng-
lishmen not to hurt the three, while they were naked
and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and
rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same
dimensions, and the other larger than they were be-
fore ; also to fence their gioimd again, where they had
pulled up the fences, plant trees in the room of those
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting corn,.
where they had spoiled it; and in a word, to restore
every thing in the same state as they found it, as near
as they could ; for entirely it could not be, the season
for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges,
not being possible to be recovered.
Well, they all submitted to this; and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again; only that
these three fellows could never be persuaded to work j
I mean, not for themselves, except now and then a
little, just as they pleased; however, the Spaniards
told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably
and friendly together, and study in the whole the
good of the plantation, they would be content to work
for them, and let them walk about aud be as idle as
they pleased ; and thus having lived pretty well toee-
95
thcr for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them theii
arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with
them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began
to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but how-
ever, an accident happened presently upon this,which
endangered the safety of them all; they were obliged
to lay by all private resentments, and look to the pre
servation of their lives.
It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life
I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader or
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the
night and could by no means get any sleep: he was
perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon
men fighting and killing one another, but was broad
awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in
short, he lay a great while ;" but growing more and
more uneasy, he resolved to rise: as they lay, being
so many of them, upon goat-skins laid thick upon
such couches and pads as they made for themselves,
and not in hamm'icks and ship-beds, as 1 did, who
was but one, so they had little to do, when they were
willing to rise, but to get up upon their feet, and per-
haps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps,
and they were ready for going any way that their
thoughts guided thern.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing; and besides, the
trees whidi I had planted, as in my fomer account
is described, and which were now grown tall, inter-
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see
mat it was a clear star-light night; and hearing no
noise, he returned and laid him down again; but ii
was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he compose
himself to anything like rest, hut his thoughts were to
the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what
Having made some<no'ise with .rising and walking
about going out and coining in, another of them wak-
ed, and, calling, asked who it was that was up ? The
governor told him how it had been with him. "Say
you so ?" says the other Spaniard; "such things are
not to be slighted, I assure you ; there is certainly
some mischief working," says he, "near us;" and
presently he asked him., «* Where are the English-
men ?"—^ They are all in their huts," says he, " safe
enti..gh." It seems, the Spaniards had kept posses-
sion of the main apartment, and had made a place,
where the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and^could not come
at the rest. «« Well," says the Spaniard, "there u
something in it, I am persuaded from my own expe-
rience; I am satisfied our spirits embodied have con-
verse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits
unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible world ; and
this friendly notice is given for our advantage, if we
know how to make use of it. Come," says he, " let
us go out and look abroad; and if we find nothing at
all in it to justify our trouble, I'll tell you a story to
the purpose that shall convince you of the justice of
my proposing it."
In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they being strong, and
in good company, nor alone, as I was, used none oi
fny cautions to go up by the ladder, and then pulling
H up after them, to go up a second stage to the top,
but were going round through the grove unconcerned
ftnd unwary, when they were stn-prised with seeing a
light as of a fire, a very little way off from them, and
hearing the voices of men, not of one or two but of a
great number.
in all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to pre-
vent them making the least discovery of there being
*ny inhabitant upon the place ; and when by any ne-
cessity they came to know it, they felt it so efFectn-
aHy, that they that got away, were scarce able to giv«
any account of it, for we disappeared as soon as pos-
sible, nor did ever any that had seen me, escape to
tell any one else, except it were the three savages in
our last encounter, who jumped into the boat, of whom
I mentioned that I was afraid they should go home,
and bring more help.
Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those m2n that so great a number came now toge-
ther; or whether they came ignorantly, and by acci-
dent, on their usual bloody errand,the Spaniards could
not, it seems, understand : but whatever it was, it had
been their business, either to have concealed them-
selves, and not have seen them at all; much less to
have let the savages have seen, that there were any
inhabitants in the place; but to have fallen upon thern
so effectually, as that not a man of them should have
escaped, which could only have been by getting in
between them and their boats: but this presence of
mind was wanting to them: which was the ruin of
their tranquility for a great while.
We need not doubt but that the governor, and the
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back im-
mediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an
account of the imminent danger, they were all in: and
they again as readily took the alarm, but it was im-
possible to persuade them to stay close within where
they were, but that they must all run out to see how
things stood.
While it w'as dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to
view them by the light of three fires they had made
at some distance from one another; what they wera
doing they kn^w not, and what to do themselves they
knew i\ot; for, first, the enemy were too many; and,
6econdly, they did not keep together, but were divid-
ed into several parties, and were on shore in several
places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran strag-
gling all over the shore, they ma^e no doubt, but,
first or last^ some of them would chop in upon tYieir
habitation,or upon some other place, where they would
see the tokens of inhabitant*;; and they were in groat
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which
would have been little less than starving them, if they
should have been destroyed ; so the first thing they re-
solved upon, was to dispatch three men away before
it was light, vix. two Spaniards and one Englishman,
to drive all the goats away to the great valley whert
the cave was, and, if need were, to drive tnem into
the very cave itself.
Could they have seen the savages all together in one
body and at a distance from their canoes, they re
solved, if there had been an hundred ofthem, to have
attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, for
there were some of them two miles off from the other,
8nd, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different
nations.
After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in consider-
ing their present circumstances, they resolved at last,
while it was dark, to send the old savage (Friday's
father) out as a4f)y, to learn if possible something
concerningthem,as what they came for, and what they
intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it, and stripping himself quite naked, as
most of the savages were, away he went. After he
had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that
he had been among them undiscovered, that he foumi
they were two parties and of two several natkns
who had war with one another, and had had a gre.i
battle in their own country, and that both sides having
had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were by
mere chance lander! in the same island for the devour-
ing their prisoners, and making merry; but their
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all
their mirth; that they were in a great rage at one an-
other, and were so near, that he believed they would
fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but
he did not perceive that they had any notion of ant

body's being on the island but themselves. He had
hardly made an end of telling the story, when thev
could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, thai
the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's father used all the arguments he could to
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen;
he told them their safety consisted in it, and that they
had nothing to do but to lie still, and the savages
would kill one another to their hands, and the rest
would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was
impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen,
lK.eir curiosity was so importunate upon their pruden-
t :ils, thai they must run out and see the battle ; how-
ever, they used some caution, viz. they did not go
openly just by their own dwelling, but went farther
mto the woods, and piaced themselves to advantage
where they might securely see them manage the figlv,
and, as they thought, not to be seen by them; but it
seems the savages did see them, as we shall find here-
after.
The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe
the Englishmen, one of them said he could perceivo
that some of them were men of great bravery, of in-
vincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the
light. The battle, they said, held two hours before
they could guess which party would be beaten; but
then that party which was nearest our people's habita-
tion began to appear weakest, and, after some time
more, some of them began to fly; and this put our
men again into a great consternation, lest any of those
that fled should run into the grove before their dwell-
ing for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the
place, and that by consequence the pursuers should
do the like in search of them. Upon this they re-
solved, that they would stand armed within the wall,
and whoever came into the grove they should sally
out over the wall, and kill them, so that if possible
not one should return to give an account of it; they
ordered also, that it should be done with their swords,
or by knocking them down with the stock of the
musket, not by shooting them, for fear of raising an
alarm by the noise.
As they expected it fell out: three of the routed
army fled for life, and crossing the creek ran directly
into the place, not in the least knowing whither they
went, but running as into a thick wood-for shelter.
The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this
within, with this addition to our men's great satisfac-
tion, viz. that the conquerors had not pursued them,
or seen which way they were gone. Upon this the
Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would not
suffer them to kill the three fugitives; but sending
three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to
go round and come in behind them, surprise and take
them prisoners; which was done: the residue of the
conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to
6ea; the victors retired, and made no pursuit, or very
little, but drawing themselves into a body together,
gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed
were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; and
the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon,
they also marched to their canoes. And thus the
Spaniards had their island again fre%to themselves,
their fright was over, and they saw no savages in se-
veral years after. v
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den, and viewing the field of battle, they found
about two-and-thirty dead men upon the spot; some
were killed with great long arrows, several of which
were found sticking in their bodies, but most of them
were killed with their great wooden swords, sixteen
or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle,
and as many bows, with a great many arrows. These
gwords were great unwieldy things, and they must be
very strong men that used them; most of those men
that were killed with them had their heads mashed to
pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it in English,
their brains knocked out, and several of their arms
and legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with
inexpressible rage and fury. They found not on*
wounded man that was not stone dead; for eithei
they stay by their enemy till they have quite killed
them, or they carry all the wounded men, that are not
quite dead, away with them.
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the
consequence appeared terrible to the last degree, espe-
cially upon supposing that some time or other they
should fall into the hands of those creatures, who
would not only kill them as enemies, but kill them for
food as we kill our cattle. And they professed to me,
that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mut-
ton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they
were dead, had something in it so horrible that it nau-
seated their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with unusual terror,
that they were not themselves for some weeks after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brute|
F have been speaking of, and for a great while aftet
they were very tractable, and went about the com-
mon business of the whole soceiety well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all natural-
ized to the country; but some time after this they fell
all into such simple measures again as brought them
into a great deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed;
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, they
macie them servants, and taught them to work for
them, and as slaves they did well enough; but they
did not take their measures with them as I did by my
man Friday, viz. to begin with tbem upon thte princi-
ple of having saved their lives, and then instructed
them in the rational principles of life, much less of
religion, civilizing and reducing them by kind usage
and affectionate arguings ; but as they gave them their
food every day, so they gave them their work too, and
kept them fully employed in drudgery enough; but
they failed in this by it, that they never had them to
assist them and fight for them as I had my man Pri
day, wno was as true to me as the very flesh upon my
bones.
But to come to the family part: Being all now goo<}
friends (for common danger, as I said above, had
efteetually reconciled them,1 they began to consider
their general circumstances; and the first thing that
came under their consideration was, whether, seeing
he savages particularly haunted thatside of the island,
and that there were more remote and rethed parts of
t equally adapted to their way of living, and mani-
festly to their advantage, they should not rather re-
move their habitation, and plant in some more proper
place for ^ieir safety, and especially for the security
of their cattle and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived that
they should not remove their habitation, because that
some time or other they thought they might hear from
their governor again, meaning me; and if I should
send any one to seek them, J would be sure to direct
them on that side, where if they should find the place
demolished they would conclude the savages had
killed us all, and we were gone, and so our supply
would go away too.
But as to their corn and cattle they agreed to re-
move them into the valley where my cave was, where
the land was as proper to both, and where indeed
there was land enough; however,upon second thoughts
they altered one part of that resolution too, and re-
solved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and
plant part of their corn there; and so, if one part was
destroyed, the other might be saved ; and one piece of
prudence they used, which it was very well they did;
viz. that they never trusted these three savages, which
they bad taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of
the plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there; much less of the cave there,
which they kept in case of necessity as a safe retreat;
and thither they carried also the two barrels of pow»
der which I had left them at my coming away.
97
T3ut however they resolved not to change their b&
bilation; yet they agreed, thai as I had carefully co
vered it first with a. wall and fortification, and then
with a grove of trees; so seeing their safety consisted
entirely in therr being concealed, of which they were
/low fuHyjconvirrced, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet. more effectually than hi fbre : 1'
his purpose, as I had planted trees or rather thrust in
stakes which in time all grew to \ne trees) for pome
good distance before the entrance into my apartment,
they went on in tbe same manner, and filled up live
rest of that whole space of ground, from the trees I
had set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as
I said, I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze
where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any
place to land ; or any sign that there had been any
landing thereabout. These stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow, as I had'noted formerly,
they took care to have generally very much larger and
taller than those which I had planted, and placed them
so very thick and close, that when they had been three
or four years grown, there was no piercing with the
eye any considerable way into the plantation. As for
That part which I had planted, the trees were grown
, as thick as a man's thigh; and among them they
placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that,
.in a word, it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile
thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it but
with a little army to cut it. all down; for a little dog
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all
the ground to the right hand, and to the left, and
round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, not
«o much as for themselves to come out, but by the
ladder placed up to the side of the bill, and then lifted
up and placed again from the first stage up to the-top;
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but
what had wings or u itchcraft to assist it, could come
at them.
This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less
mm\ what they afterwards found occasion for; which
served to convince me that as human prudence haa
authority of Providence to justify it, so it has, doubt
iess, the direction of Providence to set it to work, and,
would we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am fully
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters
which our lives are now by our own negligence sub-
jected to: but this by the way.
I return to the story: They lived two yeafs after
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits from
the savages; they had indeed an alarm given them
<»ne morning, which put them in great consternation:
for some of the Spaniards being out early one morn-
ing on the west side, or rather end of the island,
which, by the way, was tha'tend where I never went,
for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with
seeing above twenty canoes of Indiaas just coming on
shore.
They made the best of their way home in hurry
enough and, giving the alarm to their comrades, they
kept plose all that day and the next, going out only al
night to make observation; but they had the good
Wick to be mistaken, for wherever the savages went,
they did not land at that time on the island, but pur-
sued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three
Englishmen, one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves which I men-
tioned they had taken,because the fellow had not done
something right which he bid him do, and seemed a
little untraceable in his shewing him, drew a hatchet
out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it by his side, and
fell upon him, the poor savage, not to correct him bu
to kill him. One of the Spaniards who was by, seeing
him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet,
which he aimed at his head, but struck info his
•howlder, so that he thought he had cut the poor crea
Uira's'arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to
murder the poor man, clapt in between him and th«
7
savage to prevent tne miscmer.
The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as lie intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and whin a
shovel which he bad in his hand (for they were work
ing in the field about the corn-land) knocked the brute
down ; another of the English men running at the sam
time to help his comrade knocked the Spaniard down,
and then two Spaniards more came to help their man,
and a third Englishman fell urton them. Th<sy had
none of them any fire-arms, or any other weapons bu
hatchets and other tools, except the third Englishman;
he had one of my old rusty cutlasses, with which he
made at the last Spaniards and wounded them both.
This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more
help coming in they took the three Englishmen pri-
soners. The next question was, what should be done
with them? they had been so often mutinous, and
were so furious,so desperate, and so idle withal, that
they knew not what course to take with them, for they
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued
not what hurt they did any man; so that, in short, it
was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so
many words, that if they had been his own country-
men he would have hanged them all; for ail la wsand
all governors were to preserve society, and those who
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out
of it; but as they were Englishmen, and that it was
to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they
all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would
u-se them with all possible lenity, and would leave
them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen,
who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood tvp, and
said they desired it might not be left to them ; " r«?,n
says he, " I am sure we ought to sentence them to the
gallows ;" and with that gives an account how Will
Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the
five Englishmen join together and murder all the
Spaniards when they were in their sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to
Will Atkins: "How, Seiginor Atkins," says he,
u will you murder us all? what have you to say to
that?" That hardened villain was so far from denying
it, that he said it was true, and G-d d-mn him they
would do it still before they had done with them
u Well, but Seiginor Atkins," said the Spaniard,
"what have we done to you that you will kill us?
And what would you get by filling us? And what
must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill
you, or will you kill us? Why will you put us to the
necessity of this Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard
very calmly and Smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's
making a jest of it, that had he not been held by three
men, and withal had no weapons with him, it wai
thought he would hare attempted to have killed the
Spaniard in the middle of all the company.
This harebrained carriage obliged them to consider
seriously what was to be done The two Englishmen
and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of
opinion that they sho'uld hang one of the three for
an example to the rest; and that particularly it should
be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with
his hatchet; and indeed there was some reason to be
lieye he had done it, for the poor savage was in such
amiserable condition with the wound he had receiv-
ed, that it was thought he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said, no, it was an
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he
would never consent to put an Englishman to death
though he had murdered half of them; nay, he sai
if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and
had time left to speak, it should be that they should
pardon him.
^ This was so positively insisted on by the governor
Spaniard, that there was nogainsayiug it; and asmer-
ciful councils are most apt to prevail, where they arc
bo earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then
H was to be considered what should be done to keen
them from the mischief they desired; for all agreed,
governor and all, that means were to be used for pre-
serving the society from danger. After a long debate
it was agreed that, first, they should be disarmed, and
not permitted to have either gun, or powder, or shot,
or sword, or any weapon, and should be turned out
of the society, and le|t to live where they would, and
how they could by themselves; but that none of the
rest, either Spaniards, or English should converse with
them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with
them; that they should be forbid to come within a
certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and
that if they offered to commit any disorder, so as to
spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society,
that they should die without mercy, and would shoo!
them wherever they could find them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and
turning to the two honest Englishman, said, «* Hold,
you must reflect, that it will He long ere they can raise
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve;
we must therefore allow them provisions." So he
caused to be added,that they should have a proportion
of torn given them to last them eight months, and for
•eed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to
raise some of their own; that they should have six
jEiilt h-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given them, as
well for present subsistence as for a store; and that
they should have tools given them for their work in
he field; such as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the
ike: Ixit they should have none of these tools or pro-
visions unless they would swear solemnly that they
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with
them or their fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went awaj
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go away
- or to stay; but as there was no remedy they went,
preteuujne, to go and choose a place where they should
settle themselves, to plant and live by themselves; and
some provisions were given, but no weapons.
About f iur or five days after they came again fot
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
selves out an habitation or plantation: it was a very
convenient place indee^, on the remotest part of the
sland, N. E. much about the place where I providen.
lially landed in- my first voyage when I was driven
out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in my
foolish attempt to surround the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and
contrived Them in a manner like my first habitation,
being close under the side of a hill, having some trees
growing already to'the three sides of it; so that by
planting others it would be very easily covered from
the sight unless narrowly searched for. They desired
some dry goat-skins for beds and covering, which
were given them; and upon their giving their words
that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of
their plantations they gave them hatchets, and what
other tools they could spare; some peas, barley, and
rice, for sowing, and, in a word, any thing they want-
ed but arms and amunition.
They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had got in their first harvest, though the
quantity was but small, the parcel of land they had
planted being but little ; .for indeed having all tneir
plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon
their hands and when they came to make boards,
and pots; and such things,, they were quite out of their
element and could make nothing of it; and when the
rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the earth,
they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in
great danger of spoiling: and this humbled them
much ; so they came and begged the Spaniards to help
them, which they very readily did; and in four dayr
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them.
Dig enough to secure their corn and other things froni
the rain: but it was but a poor place at best compar-
ed to mine; and especially as mine "/as then ; for the
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, mu\ made several
new apartments in it.
About Ihree quarters of a year after this separation
a new frolic took these rogues, which, together with
the former villauy they had committed, brought mis-
chief enough upon them, and had very near been the
ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they
led, and that without hope of bettering their circum-
stances; and a whim took them that they could make
a voyage to the continent from whence the savages
came, and would try if they could not seize upon some
prisoners among the natives there, and bring them
home, so as to make them do' the laborious part of
the work for them.
The project was not so preposterous if they had
gone no farther; but they did nothing and proposed
nothing but had either mischief in the design or mis-
chief in the event; and if 1 may give my opinion,
they seemed to he under a blast from Heaven; for if
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things
with divine justice? It was certainly an apparent ven-
geance on *hoir crime of mutiny and piracy that
brought them to the state they were in; and as they
shewed not the least remorse for the crime, but added
new villanies to it, such as particularly that piece of
monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because
he did not, or perhaps could not understand to do what
he was directed, and to wound him in such a manner
as, no question, made him a cripple all his life, and in
a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had
for his cure; and what was still worse, the murderous
intent, or, 10 do justice to the crime, the intentional
murder, foi such to be sure it was, as was afterwardi
me formed design they all laid to nv xder the Span-
iards in cold blood, and in their sleep
But I leave observing, and return to the story:
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and in very humble terms desired to be ad-
mitted to speak with them; the Spaniards vcr> readily
heard what they had to say, which was this, that they
were tired of living in the manner they did, that they
were rrot handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted ; and that, having no help, they fouud they
should be starved: but if the Spaniards would give
them leave to take one of the canoes which they came
over in, and give them arms and ammunition propor-
tioned for their defence, they would go over to the
main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them
from the trouble of supplying them with any other
provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them;
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
destruction they were running into; told them they
had suffered such hardships upon that very spot that
they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them
that they would be starved or murdered, and bade
them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously,they should be starved
if they stayed here, for they could not work, and
would not work; and they could but be starved
abroad; and they were murdered, there was an end
of them, they had no wives or children to cry after
them ; and, in short, insisted importunately upon (heir
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they
would give them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them with great kindness, thai
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like
nake.d men, and be in no condition to defend them-
selves, and that though they could ill spare their fire-
arms, having not enough for themselves, yet they
would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cut-
lass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought suf*
ficiem for them
i

In a word, they accepted t^ie offer, and having
baked them bread enough lo serve them a month, and
given them as much goat's flesh as they could eat while
it was sweet, and a great basket full of dried grapes,
a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid alive to
kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage ovei
the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.
The boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore
was rather too big for ihem to manage; but as they
had a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they
did well enough; they had made a mast of a long
pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which
they had sewed or lnced together; arid away they
went merrily enough ; the Spaniardscalled after them,
"Bon veajo;" and no man ever thought of seeing
them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind,
how quietly and comfortably they lived now those
three turbulent fellows were gone; as for their ever
coming again, that was the remotest thing from their
thoughts could be imagined; when, behold, aftei
twenty-two days absence, one of the Englishmen be-
ing abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange
men coming towards him at a distance, two of them
with guns upon their, shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched,
and became frighted and amazed, to the governoi
Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for
there were strangers landed upon the island, he could
not tell who. The Spaniard pausing awhile, says to
him, ** How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They
are savages to besure."—" No, no," says the Eng-
lishman, »• they are men in clothes, with arms."—
"Nay then," savs the Spaniard, "why are you con-
cerned? If they are not savages, they must be friends;
for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will
vlo us good rather than harm."
While th*v war* debating thus, cam?, the three Eng,
rtshmen, and standing without the wood which was
new-planted, hallooed to them; they presently knew
their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceas-
ed. But now the admiration was turned upon ano-
ther question, viz. What could be the matter, and
what rriade them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men in;
and inquiring where they had been, and what they had
been doing? they gave them a full account of their
voyage in a few words, viz. that they reached the land
in two days, or something less, but finding the people
alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows and
arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but
sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till
they came to a great opening, by which they perceived
that the land they saw from our island was not the
main, but an island : that entering that opening of the
sea, they saw another island on the right hand north,
and several more west; and being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which
lay west, and went boldly on shore; that they found
the people were courteous and friendly to them, and
they gave them several roots, and some dried fish,
and appeared very sociable : and the women, as well
as the men, were very forward to supply them with
any thing they could get for them to eat, and brought
it to them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and inquired, as
well* as they could of them by signs, what nations
were this way, and that way ; and were told of seve-
ral fierce and terrible people, that lived almost every
way; who, as they made known by signs to them,
used to eat men; but as for themselves, they said, that
they never ate men or women, except only such as
they took in the wars; and then they owned that'they
made a great feast, and ate their prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast^ol
that kind, and they told them two moons ago, point-
ing to the moon, and then to two fingers; and thai
their great king had two hundred prisoners now
which he had taken in his war, and they were fcertv.
ing them to make ihein fat for the next feast. The
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those pri
soners, but the others mistaking them, thought they
were desirous to have some of them to carry away for
rheirown eating. So they beckoned to them, poirtt-
ng »o the setting of the sun, and then to the rising;
which was to signify, that the next morning at sun
rising they would bring some for them; and accord
ingly the next morning they brqjteht down five women
and eleven men, and gave thern to the Englishmen
to carry with them on their voyage, just as we would
bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port
town to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did
not know what to do; to refuse the prisoners would
have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that
offered them; and what to do with them they knew
not; however, upon some debate, they resolved to
accept of them; and in return they gave the savages
that brought them, one of their hatchets, an old key,
a knife, and six or seven of their bullets, which, though
they did not understand, they seemed extremely
pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures'hands
behind them, they (the people) dragged the prisoners
into our boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away at
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present would certainly have expected that
they should have gone to work with them, have kill-
ed two or three of them the next morning, and per-
haps have invited the donors to dinner.
But having taken their leave with all the respect
and thanks that could well pass between people, where,
on either side, they understood not one word they
could say, they put off with their boat, and came back
towards the first island, where when they arrived,
they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being
too many of them for their occasion
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing ; nothing
they could say to them, or give them, or do for them,
but was looked upon as going about to murder thern:
they first of all unbound them, but the poor creatures
screamed at that, especially the women, as if they bad
just felt the knife at their throats; for they immedi-
ately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be
killed.
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the same
thing; then they concluded it was for fear they should
sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill; if they
looked at one of them more particularly, the party
presently concluded it was to see whether he or she
was fattest and fittest to kill firs*; nay, after they had
brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly
and treat them well, still they expected every day to «
make a dinner or supper for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unaccount-
able history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard
asked them where their new family was? And being
told that they had brought thern on shore, and put
them into one of their huts, and were come to beg
some victuals for them ; they (the Spaniards) and the
other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole co-
lony, resolved to go all down to the place and see
them, and did so, and Friday's father with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat a',1
bound; for when they had brought them on shore
they bound their hands, that they might not take the
boat and make their escape; there, I sajr, they sat,
all of them stark naked. First, there were three men,
lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, straight and fair
limns, about thirty or thirty-five years of age, and five
women; whereof two might be from thirty to forty,
two more not above twenty-four or twenty-five, and
the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or se-
venteen. The women were well favoured, agreeable
persons, both in shape and features, enly tawny; and
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
two of them, had they been perfect white, would hav*
passed for handsome women, even in Londo.i itself
having very pleasant, agreeable countenances, and oi
a very modest behaviour, especially when they came
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they called
it, though that dress was very indifferent it must be
confessed, of which hereafter.
The sight, you may be sure was son,ethmg uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a just cha
racter) men of the bdkt behaviour, of the most calm,
sedate tempers, and^erfect good humour that ever 1
met with ; and, in particular, of the most modesty, as
will presently appear; I say the sight was very un-
couth, to see three naked men and five naked women,
all together, bound and in the most miserable circum-
stances that human nature could be supposed to be,
viz. to be expecting every moment to be dragged out,
and have their brains knocked out, and then to be
eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty.
The first thing they did was to cause-the ojd Indian,
Friday's father, to go in and see first if he knew any
of them, and then if he understood any of their speech.
As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously
at them, but knew none of them; neither could any ol
them understand a word he said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end, which
was to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands
they were fallen were Christiana; that they abhorred
eating of men or women, and that they might be sure
they would not be killed. As soon as they were as-
sayed of this they discovered such a joy, and by such
awkward and several ways as is hard to describe, foi
£ seems they were of several nations.
The woman who was their interpriter was bid, in
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be
servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away to save their lives? At which they all fel1
a-dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this,
*nd another that, any thing that lav next, to ca.-rvoo
their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to
work.
The governor who found that the having women
among them would presently be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intend'
ed to do with these women, and how they intended
to use them, whether as servants or as women? One
of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readily,
that they would use them as both. To which the go-
vernor said, " I am not going to restrain you from
it; you are your own masters as to that; but this J
think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels
among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only,
viz. that you will all engage, that if any of you take
any of these women as a woman, or wife, he shall
take but one; and that, having taken one, none else
should touch her; for though we cannot marry any oi
you, yet it is but reasonable that while you stay here,
the woman any of you takes should be maintained
by the man that takes her, and should be his wife; 1
mean," says he, " while he continues here; and that
none else should have any thing to do with her." All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it with-
1 out any difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniard if they
designed to take any of them ? But every one answer-
ed, "No:" some of them said they had wives m
Spain; and the others did not like women that were
not Christians; and all together declared, that they
.vould not touch one of them ; which was an instance
of such virtue as I have not met with in all my tra-
vels. On the other hand, to be short, the five Eng-
lishmen took them every one a wife; that is to say, a
temporary wife; and so they set up a new form c$
living for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in
my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceed-
ingly within; the three servants, which they had ta-
ken in the late battle of the savages lived with them;
%xxd these carried on the main part of the colony
supplying all the rest with food, and assisting then
in any thing as they could, or as they found necessity
reauired.
But the wonder of this 9tory was how five such re-
fractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about these
women, and that two of them should not pitch upon
the same woman, especially seeing two or three of
them were, without comparison, more agreeable than
the others; but they took a good way enough to pre-
"et?. quarreling among themselves; for they set the
five women by themselves in one of their huts, and
they went all into the other hut, and drew lots among
them who should choose first.
He that drew to choose first, went away by him-
self to the hut where the poor naked creatures were,
and fetched her out he chose; and it was wortht ob-
serving, that he that chose first took her that was'rec-
koned the homeliest and the oldest of the five, which
made mirth enough among the rest; and even the
Spaniards laughed at it; but the fellow considered
better than any of them, that it was application and
business that they were to expect assistance in as
much as any thing else, and she proved the best wife
in the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves in a row
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of theii
condition returned upon themvagain, and they firmly
believed that they were now going to be devoured:
accordingly when the English sailor came in an;3
fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lament-
able cry, and hung about her and took their leave of
her with such agonies and such affection as would
have grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor was
it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that
(.hey were not to be immediately murdered, till they
fetched the old man, Friday's father, who instantly
let them know that the five men who had fetched them
out one by one, had chosen them for their wives.
When they had done this, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to work,
and the Spaniards came and helped them , and in a
few hours they had built them every one a new hut
or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had al
ready were crowded with their tools, household-stuff,
and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched
farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both
on the north shore of the island, so that they conti-
nued separate as before; andthus my island was peo-
pled in three places, and, as I might say, three towns
were begun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that as
it often happens in the world, (what the wise ends of
God's providences are in such a disposition of things
I cannot say) the two honest fellows had the two
worst wives; and the three reprobates, that were scarce
worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither
seemed born to do themselves good, or any one else,
had three cleyer,diligent, carcful,and ingenious wivfes;
not that the two first were ill wives as to their temper
or humour; for all the five were most willing, quiet,
passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves
i'nan wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike
1 apable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly
i.nd neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to the
disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the
other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the
several improvements, planting, and management of
the several little colonies, the two men had so far ouV
gone the three, that there was no comparison; they
had indeed both of them as much ground laid out for
corn as they wanted; and the reason was, because-,
according to my rule, nature dictated, that it was to
no purpose to sow more corn than they wanted; but
Che difference of the cultivation, of the planting, of tha
fences, and indeed every thing else, was easy to be
teen at first view.
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
101
aoout their huts, that when you came tt>thc place no-
thing was to be seen but a wood; and though they
had their plantation twice demolished, once by their
own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be
shewn in its place; yet they had restored all again,
and every thing was flourishing and thriving aboul
them . they had grapes planted in order, and managed
like a vineyard, though they had themselves never
seen any thing.of that kind; and by their good order-
ing their vines, their grapes were as good again as any
of the others. They had also formed themselves a re-
treat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though
there was not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they
made One with incessant labour of their hands, and
where, when the mischief which followed happened,
they secured their wives and children so as they could
never be found; they having, by sticking innumera-
ble stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily, made a grove impassible except in one
place, where they climed up to get over the outside
part, and then went in by ways of their own leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new settle-
ment compared to what they were before, and were
not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity,
yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind
never left them, and that was their idleness. It was
true, they planted corn and made fences; and Solo-
mon's words were never better verified than in them •
"I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it wap
overgrown with thorns;" for when the Spaniards came
to view their crop, they could not see it in some places
for weeds; the hedge had several gaps in it, where
the wild goats toad gotten in and eaten up the corn;
perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in
to stop them out for the present, but it was only shut-
ting the stable door after the steed was stolen ; where-
as, when they looked on the colony of the othei two,
there was the very face of industry and success upon
ail thev did • there was not * weed to be seen in ail
their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they,
on the other hand, verified Solomon's v\ ords in another
place: "The diligent hand makeih rich ;" for every
thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty withiD
and without; they had more tame cattle than the
others, more utensils and necessaries within doora,
and yet more pleasure and diversion to.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within doors; and having learnt the Eng-
lish ways of dressing and cooking (rom one of me
other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's mate
on board*the ship, they dressed their husbands' vic-
tuals very nicely; whereas the other could not be
brought to understand it; but then the husband, who
as I said, had been cook's mate, did it himself; but
as for the husbands of the three wives, they loitered
about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish and birds;
in a word, any thing but labour, and they fared ac-
cordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably ;
and the slothful lived hard and beggarly ; arid so I be-
i tieve, generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But now 1 come to a scene different from all that
itad happened before, either to them or ine; and tU'
c rigin of the story was this:
Early one morning there name on shore five or sh:
canoes of Indians, or sava-es, call them which yc\?
please : and there is no room to doubt, that they came
upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves; bui
mat part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, arx!
Jo our men too,' that they did not concern themselves
about it as I did; but having been made sensible by
their experience, that their only business was to li-;
concealed, and that, if they were not seen by any c:i
ihe savages, they would gi> off again quietly when thr.ir
business was done, having as yet not the least notion
of there being any inhabitants in the island: I say,
having been made sensible of this, they had nothing
80 do but to give notice to all'the three plantations to
keeo within doors, and not to shew themselves; onh
placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when
the boats went off to sea again.
This was without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known amon^
the savages that there were inhabitants there, which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whoik:
•rolony. After the canoes with the savages were gone
L>l't\ the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some ot
thoiu had the curiosity to go to the place where they
had been, to see wnat they had4)een doing. Here, to
their great surprise, they founwthree savages left bo
hind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground; it wlj|
supposed they had either been so gorged with the':\
inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were asleep, arui|
would not stir when the others went, or they were
wandered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight,
and perfectly at a loss what to do; the Spaniard go-
vernor, as it happened, was with thern, and hhs advice
was asked ; but he professed he'knew not what to do;
as for slaves they had enough already; and as to
killing them, they were none of them inclined to that.
The Spaniard governor told me they could not think
of shedding innocent blood; for as to them, the poor
creatures had done no wrong, invaded none of their
property; and they thought they had no just quarrel
against them to take away their lives.
And here I must, injustice to these Spaniards, ob
serve, that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelly in
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met witb
seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any fo
reign country, who were so universally modest, tem-
perate, virtuous, so very good humoured, and so cour-
teous as these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty, they had
nothing of it in their very nature; no inhumanity, no
barbarity, no outrageous passions, and yet all of thero
men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared iri their
t^arinir ;hn l»»«Hn"'vahlp usa^e, of the three English* -
men , and their justice and humanity, appeared now
in the case of the savages as above. After some con-
sultation they resolved upon this, that thev would lie
still a while longer, till if possible, these three men
might be gone; but then the governor Spaniard recol-
lected that the three savages had no boat; and that if
tney were left to rove about the island, they would
certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it,
and so they should be undone that way.
Upon this they went back again, and there lay the
fellows fast asleep still"; so they resolved to awaken
them, and take them prisoners; and they did so. The
poor fellows were strangely frighted when they were
seized upon and bound, and afraid, like the women,
that they should be murdered and eaten; for it seems
those people think all the world do as thev do, eating
men's flesh ; but they were soon made easy as to that:
and away they carried them.
It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle;. I mean to my palace under
the hill; out they carried them first to the bower,
where wts the chief of their conntry work; such a9
the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and
afterwards they carried them to the habitation of the
two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do; and whether it was by neg-
ligence in guarding them, or that they thought the
fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but
one of them ran away, and taking into the woods,
they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages,
who cairje on shore three or four weeks afterwards,
and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went ot?
again in two days time. • This thought terrified them
exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without
cftood cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an
account that there weie oeople in the island, as al*c
ADVENTURES- OF ROBINSON C«lTTSOE.
*\ow weak and few they were; for this savage, as 1
observed before, had never been told, as it was very
happy he had not, how many they were, or where
they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of
any of their guns, much less had they shewn then) any
other of their retired places, such as the cave in the
7alley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen
had made, and the like.
The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of LUem was, that about two months
after this, six canoesW savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the
north side of the island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an hour after sunrise,
at a convenient place, about a mile from the habita-
tion of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man
had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had
they neon all there the damage would not have been
so much, for not a man of them would have escaped .
but the case differed now very much ; for two men to
fifty were two much odds. * The two men had the
happiness to discover them about a league olT, so that
it was above an hour before they landed, and as they
landed about a mile from their huts, it was some time
before they could come at ihem. Now having great
reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first
thing they did was to bind the slaves which were left,
and cause two of the three men whom they brought
with the women, who, it seems, proved very faithful
to then, to lead them with their two wives, and what-
ever ihev could carry away with them, to their re-
tired place in the woods, which I have spoken of
above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot till they heard farther.
In the neKt place, seeing the savages were all come
on shore, and that they bent their course direely that
way, they opened the fences where their milch-goats
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their goat?
to straggle into the wood, whither thev pleased, that
1he savages might think thev were all bred wild: bin
the rogue wno name with them was too cunning; foi
that, and gave them an acco jnt of it all, for they went
directly to the place.
When the poor frighted men had secured their wives
and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the
throe, who came with the women, and who was at
their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with
all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help ; and in the nir^n time they took their arms, and
what ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the place in the wood where their wives were sent,
keeping at a distance; yet so that they might see, if
possible, which way the savages took.
They had not gone far but that, from a rising ground,
they could see the little army of their enemies come
on directly to their'habitation, and in a moment mora
could see all their lints and household-stuff flaming up
together, to their great grief and mortification; for
they had a very great loss, and to them irretrievable
at least for some time. They kept their station for a
while, till thev found the savages, like wild beasts,
spread themselves all over the place, rummaging
every way, arid every place they could think of, fa
.search for prey, and in particular for the people, o!
whom it plainly appeared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen, seeing this, thinking thenv
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely
some of the wild people might come that way, so they
.night come too many together, thought it proper to
make another retreat about half a mile farther, be-
I'eviug, as it afterwards happened, that the farther
they strolled, the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick
grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of
a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly large:
and in this tree thev both took, thetr standing, resolv-
• iug to see what, might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the sa-
vages appeared running directly that way, as if the)'
had already notice where ihcy stood, and were com*
ing up to attack them; and a little way farther they
espied three more coming after them, and five mora
beyond them, all coming the same way; besides which,
they saw seven or tight more at a distance, running
another way; for in a word, they ran every way*
like sportsmen beating for their game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe,
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or fly;
'm\X after a very short debate with themselves, they
considered that if the savages ranged the country thus
before help came, they might, perhaps, find out their
rotrcat in the woods, and then all would be lost; so
they resolved to stand them there ; and if there were
too many to deal with, then they would get to the top
of the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend
themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammuni-
tion lasted, though all the savages that were landed,
which were near filly, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait fo*
the three, and so take the middle party, by which tho
two and the five that followed would be separated;
at length they resolved to let the two first pass by,
unless they should spy them in the tree, and come to
attack them. The two first savages also confirmed
thenv in this resolution, by turning a little from them
'.ov/ards another part of the wood ; but the three, and
t!>e five after them, came forwards directly to the tree,
as ;f jhey had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and a'g
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the
first shot might hit them all three; to which purpose,
the man who was to fire put three orYour bullets into
his piece, and having a fail loop-hole, as it wore, from
a broken hole in the tree, betook a sure aim, without
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
yards of the tree, so that he conic not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages came
•m, they plainly saw, that one of the three was the
runaway savage that had escaped from them, ai-.-ri thcjy
both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possi-
ble, he should uot escape, though they should both
fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that it
be did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to
have a second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
Him ; for as the savages kept near one another., a little
behind in a line, in a word he fired, and hit two of
them directly ; the foremost was killed outright, being
shot in the head ; the second, which was the runaway
Indian, was shot through the body and fell, but was
not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch in
the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went
through the body of the second ; and being dreadfully
frighted, though not much hurt, sat down upon the
Ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous maimer.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at first;
for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger
than it. really was; the echoes rattling from one side
to another, and the fowls rising from all parts, screarn-
mg and makmg, every sort, a several kind of noisa,
according to their kind; just as it was when 1 lived
Mie first gun that, perhaps, was ever shot off injhat
place since it was an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not know-
ing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till
,hey came to that place where their companions lay,
'3i a condition miserable enough; and here the poor
ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within
reach of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle ovir
the wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed,
inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who
it is very rational to believe, told them that a flas-h of
fire first, and immediately after that thunder from
their gods, had killed those two, and wounded him.
This, J say. is rational; for nothing is more certain
nan that, as they saw no man near them, so they haul
103
never beard a gun in all their lives, or so much ai
heard ot a gun; neither knew they any thing of kill
ij?g or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets;
if they had, one might reasonably believe that they
would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the
fats of their fellows without some apprehension ot
their own.
Our two men, though as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor crea
tures, who at the same time had no notion of their
danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and
the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let
fly both together among them, and singling out by
agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and
killed, or very much wounded four of them ; the fifth,
fnejhied even to death, though not hurt, fell with the
v»'.x: so that our men, seeing them all fall together,
thought they had lulled theuTall.
The belief that the savages were all killed made our
Wo m*-n come boldly out from the tree before they
nad charged their guns again, which was a wrong step,
and they were under some surprise when they came
to the place and found no less than four of the men
alive, and of ttiem two very little hurt, and one not
at all; this obliged them to fall upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made sure of
the runaway savage that had been the cause of all the
mischief, and of another that was hurt in his knee,
End put them out of their pain. Then the man that
W<13 not hurt at. all came and kneeled down to them
with his iwo hands held up, and made piteous Inoan
%& them by gestures mu-I -.igns for his life, but could
frnt say one word to them that they could understand
However, they signified to him to sit down at the
footof a tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him ; and
with what speed they could, made after the other iwa
ndiich were gone before, fearing they, or any more of
them, should find the way to their coveied place in
the woods, where their wives and the few goods they
had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two
men, but it was at. a great distance; however they had
the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley to-
wards the sea, the quite contrary way from that which
led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and
being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree
where they left their prisoner, who a's they supposea
was delivered by his comrades; for he was gone, and
the two piecesof rope-yarn with which they had bound
him, lay just at the foot of the tree.
They were now in as great a concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy
might be, or in what numbers; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if
all was well th re, and to make them easy who were
in fright enough to be sure; for though the savages
were their own country-folks, yet they were most ter-
ribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more, for the
knowledge they had of them.
When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not found it; for indeed it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the per-
sons seeking it had been directed by those, that knew
it, which these were not; they found, then-fore, every
thing very safe, only the women in a terrible fright
While they were here they had the comfort of seven
*f the Spaniards coming to their assistance . the other
ten with their servants, and old Friday, I mean Fri-
day's father, were gone in a body to defend then
bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept there,
in case the savages should have roved owr to that
side of the country; but they did not spread so far.
With the seven Spaniards came one of the savages,
who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly, and with
them also came the savage whom the English nun had
left bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven
men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along
with them, where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others, who were
left when the third run away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to kill
them for their own preservation: however, the Spa-
niard governor would not consent to it; but ordered,
that they should be sent out of the way to my old^ave
in the valley, and be kept therewith two Spaniards
to guard them and give them food ; which was done;
and they were bound there hand and foot for that
night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy them-
selves, to stay any longer there; but taking five of the
Spaniatds, and themselves, with four muskets and a
pistol among them, and two stout quarter staves, away
they went in quest of the savages. And first, they
came to the tree where the men lay that had been
killed; but it was easy to see that some more of the
savages had been there; for they attempted to carry
their dead men away, and had dragged two of them
a good way, but had given it over; from thence they
advanced to the first rising ground where they had
stood and seen their camp destroyed, ano where they
had the mortification still to see some of the smoke;
but neither could they here see any of the savages:
ihey then resolved, though with all possible caution,
to go forward towards their ruined plantation; but a
tittle before they came thither, coming in sight of the
sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarking
again in their canoes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first that there was no way to
come at them to give them a parting blow ; but upon
the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist there ,
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, whe
were not yet noted for having the least inclination to
do any thing good, yet, as soon as they heard of it
(for they,livingremote,knew nothing till all was over),
came and offered their help and assistance, and did
very friendly work for several days to restore their
habitations and make necessaries for them ; and thus
in a little time they were set upon their legs again.
Aboui two days after this the)' had the farther sat-
isfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes com©
driving on shore, and at some distance from them,
with two drowned men : by which they had reason to
believe that they had met with a storm at sea, which
had overset some of them, for it blew very hard the
night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other
hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as
well of what they had done, as of what happened tc
them; and to whet them on to another enterprise ol
the same nature, which they, it seems, resolved to at-
tempt, with sufficient force to carry all before th-em m
for except what the first man told them of inhabitants,
they could say little to it of their own knowledge; for
they never saw one man, and the fellow being killed
that had afnnned it, they had no other witness to con-
firm it to them.
It was five or six mouths after this before they heard
any more of the savages, in which *ime our men were
m hopes they had not forgot their former bad luck;
or had given over the hopes of better; when on a sud-
den they were invaded with a most formidable fleet
of no less than twenty-eight canoes, full of savages,
armed with bows and airows, great clubs, wooden
swords,and such-like engines of war; and they brought
such numbers with them, that in short it put ail out
people into the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
easternmost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do; and ii> the first
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was
their only safety before^ and would much more be so
now, while the number of their enemies was so great,
they therefore resolved, first of all to take down the
huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and
drive away their goats to the old cave; because they
supposed ihe savages would go directly thither as soosi
as it was day, to play the old game over again, though
ihey did not now land within two leagues of it.
In the next place, they drove away all the flock of
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little
appearance of inhabitants any where as possible ; and
the next morning early they posted themselves with all
their force at the plantation of the two men, waiting
for their coming. As they guessed so it happened:
these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east
end of the island, came ranging along the shore, di-
rectly towards the place to the number of two hun-
dred and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our
army was but small indeed; butthat which was worse,
they had not arms for all their number neither: the
whole account, it seems, stood thus :—first, as to men-.
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's father.
3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved very
faithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards.

To their slaves they did not give either musket oi
fusil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long
staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet r
also every one ofourMnen had hatchets. Two of the
vyomen could not be prevailed upon but they woulo
come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages wher.
the first action happened, which I have spoken oi
•vyhere the Indians fought with one another; and the
women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so
often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins,
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a
most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him.
The savages came forward like lions, and our men,
which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage
iu their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now
proved a most usefull fellow, with six men, was plant-
ed just behind a small thicket of, bushes, as an ad-
vanced guard, with orders to let the first of them pass
D'/, and then fire into the middle of them; and as
soon as he had fired to make his retreat, as nimbly as
ho could, round a part of the wood, and so come in
ImhijkI the Spaniards where they stood, having a
thicket of trees all before them.
When the savages came on,they ran straggling about
every *vay in heaps, out of all manner of order, and
Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him ; then
seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he orders
iltree'of his men to fire, having loaded their muskets
with six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as largo
pistols-bullets. How many they killed or wounded
they knew not; but the consternation and surp.ise was
inexpressible among the savages, who were frighted to
the last degree, to hear such a dreadful noise, and see
lh«ir men killed, and others hurt, but see nobony thai
did it. When in the middle of their fright, William
Atkins and his other three let fly again among the
thickest of them; and in less than a minute the fire*
three, being loaded again, gaveihem a third volley.
Had William Atkins and his men retired immecFv
ately, as soon as they had fired, as they were ordereo
to do; or had the rest of the body been at hand to
have poured in their shot continually, the savages had
been elfectually routed; for the terror that was among
them came principally from this ; viz. that they wera
killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, anJ
could see nobody that hurt them : but William Atkins
staying to load again, discovered the cheat; some of
the savages who were at a distance, spying them,came
upon them behind; and though Atkins and his men
fired at them also, two or three times, and killed above
twenty retiring as fast as they could, yet they wound-
ed Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow En«-
lishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard, with one of the Indian slaves who came
with the women. This slave was a most gallanjt fel-
low, and fought most desperately, killing five of the:rj
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the
ar.med staves and a hatchet.
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing three vol-
lies upon them, retreated also: for their number was
so great, and they were so desperate, that though
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so
many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our
men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a
aloud; and it was observed that their wounded men,
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous
by their wounds, and fought like madmen.
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard ana
ihe Englishmen that were killed behind them; and
the savages, when they came up to them, killed them
overagain in a wretched manner, breaking their arms,
le^s, and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords,
likfl true savages. But finding our men were gone,
'•h»v did not seem inclined to pursue them, but drew
themselves up in a kind of ring, which is, it seems,
lltoir custom, and shouted twice in token of their vie*
tory; after which, they had the mortification to see
several of their wounded men fall, dying with the
mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor havingdrawn his little body
up together upon a rising ground, Atkins though he
was wounded, would have had him march, and charge
them again all together at once: but the Spaniard re-
plied, " Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded
men fight; let them alone till morning: all these
wounded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds,
and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall have
the fewer to engage."
The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied mer-
rily, " That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and
that's the reason I would go on while I am warm."—
u Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you
have behaved gallantly, and done your part; we will
j fight for you, if you cannot come on; but I think it
best to stay till morning:" so they waited.
l>ut as it wap a clear moonlight night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men,and a great hurry and noise among
them where they lay, they afterwards resolved tofal
upon them in the night, especially if they could come
to give them but one volley before they were disco-
vered. Thisj-hey had a fair opportunity to do; for
one of the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was
where the fight began, led them round between the
woods and the sea side, westward, and turning short
south, they came so near where the thickest of them
lay, that before they were ^een or heard, eight of them
fired in among them, and did dreadful execution upon
them; in half a minute more eight others fired after
them, pouring in their small shot, in such a quantity,
(hat abundance were killed and wounded : and all thi3
while they were not able to see who hurt them, or
which way to fly.
•The Spaniards charged again with the utmost ex;>e-
MS
dition, and then divided themselves into three bodies,
and resolved to fall in among them all together. They
had in each body eight persons; that is to say, twenty-
four, whereof were twenty-two men, and the two
women, who, by the way, fought desperately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party,
and so of the halberts and staves. They would hava
bad the women keep back; but they said they wero
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marched out from among
the trees and came up to the teeth of the enemy,
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The
savages stood all together, hut were in the utmost con-
fusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from
three quarters together; they would have fought iif they
had seen us; and as'soon as they came near enough to
be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men
gave them nO time, but running up to them, fired
among them three ways, and then fell in with the buti
ends of their muskets, theirswords, armed staves, and
hatchets; and laid about them so well, that in a word
they set up a dismal screaming <ind howling, flying to
. save their lives which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution ; and killed,
or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about one
hundred and eighty of them: the rest, being frighted
Qiit of their wits, scoured through the woods and ovei
the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet
could help them to do ; and as we did not trouble our-
selves much to pursue them, they got all together to
the sea-side, where they landed, and where then
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet,
for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from
the sea-ward, so that it was impossible for them to
put off; nay, the storm continuing all night, when
the tide came up, their canoes were most of them
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore,
ahat it reouired infinite toil to get them off; and some
of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach,
or against one another.
Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little
rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as
well as they could, they resolved to march to that pan
of the island where the savages were lied, and sec
what posture they were in. This necessarily led them
over the place where the fight had been, hud where
they found several of the poor creatures not quite
dead, and yet past recovering life ; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds; for a truly great man,
though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his
enemy, takes no delight in his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order in
this case; for their own savages, who were then
servants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages' army lay,
where there appeared about one hundred still: theii
posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with
iheir knees up towards theinnouth, and'the head put
between the hands, leaning down upon the knees.
When our men came within two musket-shot ol
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets t<«
be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, thai
by their countenance he might know what to expecr,
viz. whether they were still in heart to fight, or were
so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited aiK^discouraged,
and so he might manage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for as soon as the savoyes
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest conster-
nation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly
towards them, they all ran screaming and vailing
away, with a kind of an howling noise, which oui
men did not understand, and had never heard before;
tand thus they ran up the hills into the country.
At first our men had much rather the weather hna
oeen calm, and they had all gone away to sea, dip
they did not then consider, that this might probably
have been the occasion of their coining again in such
multitudes as not to be resisted; or, at least, to come
so many and so often, as would quite desolate the
island and starve them. Will Atkins therefore, who,
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them,
proved the best counsellor in this case. His advice
was, to take the advantage that offered, and clap in
between them and their boats, arid so deprive tbern
of tin? capacity of ever returning any more to plague
the island.
Th^y consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly into the
woods, arid live there desperate; and so they should
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir
about their business, and have their plantation con-
tinually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, in
short, I'3 reduced to a life of contiual distress.
Will Atkins told them they had bettrr have to do
with one hundred men than with one hundred nations;
that us tbey must destroy their boats, so they must
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them-
selves. In a word, he shewed them the necessity ol
it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they went
to work immediately with the boats, and getting some
dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of ihem on fire; but they were so wet that they
would scarce burn. However, the fire so burned the
upper pc;it, that it soon made them unfit for swim-
ming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running
out of the woods, and coming as near as they could
to our men, kneeled down and cried, Oa, 6a, Wa-
ra-nokoa, and some other words of their language,
which none of the others understood any thing of;
out as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises^
it was easy to understand thev begged to have ;heii
boats spared, and that they would be gone, and never
teti/m thither azain
Cut our men were now satisfied, that they had no
way to preserve themselves or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that if
ever so much as one of them got back into their coun-
iry to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that
letting them know that they' should not have any
mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and de-
8troyed them, every one that the storm had not de-
stroyed before ; at the sight of which the savages rais-
ed a hideous cry in the woods, which our people heai i
plain enough; after which they ran about the island
like distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men dia
not really know at first what to do with them.
t Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, con-
sider that while they made those people thus despe-
rate, they ought to have kept good guard at the same
time upon their plantations* for though it is true they
had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not
find their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the
hill, nor the cave irt the valley; yet they found out
my plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to
pieces, and all the fences and planting about it; trod
all the corn under foot; tore up the vines and grapes,
being just then almost ripe, and did our men an ines-
timable damage, though to themselves not one far-
things worth of service.
Though our men were able to fight them upon all
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue
rttem, or hunt them up and down; for as they were
too nimble of foot for our men when thev found them
sinle, so our men durst not go about single for fear of
being surrounded with their numbers .-the best was,
they had no weapons; for though they had bows they
had no arrows left, nor any materials to make -any,
nor had they any c^cd tool or weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same
time our men wore also brought to very hard circum-
<ta»cos by them; for though thejr retreats werepr*-
served, yet their provision was destroyed, and their
harvest spoiled ; and what to do or which way to turn
themselves, they knew not; the only refuge they had
now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by
the cave, and some little corn which grew there. The
three Englishmen, William Atkins and his comrades,
were now reduced to two, one of them being killed
by an arrow, which struck him on the side of his
head, just under the temple, so that he never spoke
more; and it was very remarkable, that this was the
same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave
with his hatchet, and who afterward^ intended to have
murdered the. Spaniards.
I look upon their case to have been worse at this
time than mine was at any time after I first discovered
the. grains of barley and rice and got into the method
of planting and raising my corn, and my tame cattle;
for now they had, as I may say, an hundred wolves
upon the island, which would devour every thing they
could come at, yet could be very hardly come at
themselves.
The first thing they concluded when they saw what
their circumstances were, was, that they would, ii
possible, drive them up to the farther part of the
island, south-east, that if any more savages came on
shore, they might not find one another; then that they
would dai'y hunt and harass them, and kill as many of
thein as they could come at, till they had reduced the
number; and if they could at last tame them, and
oring them to any thing, they would give them corn,
and teach them how to plant, and live upon their dai-
ly labour.
In order to this they followed them, and so terrified
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him,
yet he would fall down for fear; and so dreadfully
frighted they were, that they kept out of sight farther
and farther, till at last our men following them, and
every day almost killing and wounding some of them,
they kep up in the woods and hollow places so much,
vat it reduced them to the utmost misery for want o«
food; and many were afterwards found dead in the
woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to death.
When our men found this it made their hearts re
lent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spaniard
governor, who was the most gentleman-like,generous-
minded man that ever I met with in m} life; and he
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as to
be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them,
and see if they might be brought to some conditions
that might be depended upon to save their lives, and
do us no spoil.
It was some time before any of! them could be
taken; but being weak, and half starved, one of them
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner: he was
sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but
finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him,
and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would be
to them all: that they would not only save their lives,
but would give them a part of the island to live in,
provided they would give satisfaction; thai they
should keep in their own bounds, and not come be-
yond them, to injure or prejudice others; and that
they should have corn given them, to plant and make
it grow for their bread,'and some bread given them
for their present subsistence; and old Friday bade the
fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen,
and hear what they said to it, assuring them that ii
they did not agree immediately they should all be de-
stroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-
duced,in number to about thirty-seven,closed with the
proposal at the first offer, and begged to have some
food given them; upon which twelve Spaniards and
two Englishmen, well armed and three Indian slaves,
and old Friday, marched to the place where they
were; the three Indian slaves carried them a larga
quantity of bread, and some rice boiled up to cakes,
and dried in the sun, and three live goats; and they
were ordered to go to the side of an hill, where they
sat down, ate the provisions very thankfully, and were
the most faithful fellows to their words that could be
thought of; for except when they came to beg victuals
nd directions, they never came out of their bounds;
and there they lived when I came to the island, and I
went to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they wanted
nothing but wives, and they soon would have been a
nation: they were confined to a neck of land sur-
rounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain
towards the sea before them, on the south-east comer
of the island; they had land enough, and it was very
good and fruitful; for they had a piece of land about
a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in
ength.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades such
as I made for myself; and gave among them twelve
hatchets, and three or four knives; and there they
lived, the most subjected innocent creatures that were
ever heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity
with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them,
which was in about two years. Not but that now and
then some canoes- of savages came on shore for their
triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were of sev-
eral nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those
that came before, or the reason of it, they did not
make any search or inquiry aftet their countrymen;
and if they had, it would have been very hard for
them to have found them out.
Thus, 1 think, 1 have given a full account of all that
happened to them to my return, at least that was worth
notice. The Indians, or savages, were wonderfully
civilized by them, and they frequently went among
hem: but* forbid, on oain of death, any ofihe Indians
coming to them, because they would not have their
settlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable,viz.that they taught
the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets; but they
soon outdid their masters; for they made abundance
of most ingenius things in wicker-work; particularly
all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c.
as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and
abundance of other things, being very ingenious a
such work when they were once put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives, scissars,
spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind
which they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very
nandy, that they came at last to build up their huts, or
nouses, very handsomely ; raddling, or working it up
like basket-work all the way round, which was a very
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very
odd; but was an exceeding good fence, as well against
heat, as against all sorts of vermin ; and our men were
so taken with it, that they got the wild savages to
come and do the like for them; so that when I came
to see the two Englishmens's colonies, they looked,ata
distance, as if they lived all like bees in a hive: and
as for Will Atkins, who was now become a very in-
dustrious, necessary, and sober fellow, he had made
himself sucji a tent of basket-work as I believe was
never seen. It was one hundred and twenty paces
round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket, in pannelsor
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven feet high: in the middle was another
not above twenty-two paces ronnd, but built stronger,
he'mg eight-square in its form, and in the eight corners
stood eight very strong posts, round the top of which
he laid strong pieces, joined together with wooden
pins, from which he raised a pyramid before thereof
of eight rafters, ysry handsome I assure you, and
10T
joined together very well, though he had no nails, and
only a few iron spikes, which he had made himself
too, out of t,hc old iron that I had left there; and in-
deed this fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in
several things which he had no knowledge of; he
made himself a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows
to blow the firo; he made himself charcoal for his
work, and he formed out of one of the iron crows a
middling good anvil to hammer upon ; in this manner
*he made many things, but especially hooks, staples
and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the
house: after he pitched the roof of his innermost tent,
he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work,
so fi.rm, and trntched that over again so ingeniously
with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree,
which covered the top, that his house was as dry as
if it had been tiled or slated. Trideed he owned that
the savages made the basket work for him-
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round
this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the
thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house,
Deing about twenty feel, distant; so that there was a
space like a walk within the outer wicker wall, and
without the inner, near twenty feet wide.
The inner place he partitoned off witn the same
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and
out of every one of these there was a door : first, into
the entry, or coming into the main tent; and another
door into the space or walk that was round it; so that
this walk was also divided into six equal parts, which
served not only for a retreat, but to store up anv ne-
cessaries which the family had occasion for. These
six spaces not taking upthe whole circumference,whai
other apartments the outer circle had, were thus or-
dered: as soon as you were in at the door of the outer
circle, you had a short passage straight before you to
the door of the inner house; but on cither side'was a
wicker partition, and a door in it, by which yuu went,
fiist into i* ivge room or store-hruse, twenty feet wid«
and about thirty feet long, and through that into an
other not quite so long : so that in the outer circle wer6
ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be
come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and
served as closets or retired rooms to the respective
chambers of the inner circle ; and four large ware-
houses or barns, or what you please to call them, which
went in through one another, two on either hand of
the passage that led through the outer door to the in-
ner tent.
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the world; nor an house or tent so neatlv con
trived, much less so built. In this great beehive lived
three families; that is to say, Will Atkins and his
companions; the third was killed, but his wife re-
mained with three children; for she was, it seems,
big with child when he died, and the other two were
not at all backward to give the widow her full share
ofevery thing, I mean asto theircorn, milk,grapes, &c.
and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shore; so that they all lived well enough, though it
was true, they were not so industrious as the othei
two, as lias been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that,
as for religion, I don't know that there was any thing
of that kind among them; they pretty often indeed
put one another in mind that there was a God, by the
very common method of seamen, viz. swearing by his
name; nor were their poor, ignorant, savage wives
much th3 better for having been married to Christians,
as we must call them ; for as they knew very little of
God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of en-
ering into any discourse with their wives about a
God, or to talk any thing to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can sa\
the wives had made, from them, was, that they had
taughi them to speak English pretty well; and all th«
children they had, which were near twenty in all
were taught to,speak Englishjrtoo, from their first learn
»ng to sptak, though they at first spoke it in a vcr)
broken mariner, like their mothers. There were nono
of those children above six years old when 1 came
thither; for it was not much above seven years that
they had fetched these five savage ladies over, but they
had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all children,
more or less: I think the cook's mate's wife was big
of her sixth child; and the mothers were all a good
sort of well-governed, quiet, laborious women, modest
and decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant
and subject to their n^S-ers, I cannot call them hus-
bands; andwanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married;
both which were happily brought about afterwards
by my means, or at least by the consequence of my
coming among them
Having thus riven an account of the colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my five runagate English-
men, I must say something of the Spaniards, who were
the main body of the family, and in whose story there
are some incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages;
they told me readily, that they had no instances to
give of their application or ingenuity in that country;
that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of
people; that if means had been put into their hands,
they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair, and
so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that
they thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a
grave and very sensible man, told me he was convinc-
ed they were in the wrong; that it was not the part
of wise men to give up themselves to their misery,
but always to take hold of the helps which reason of-
fered, as well for present support, as for future deli-
verance; he told me that grief was (he most senseless
insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded
only things past, which were generally impossible to
be recalled or to be remedied, but had no view to
things to come, and had no share in any thing that
looked like deliveiance, but rather added to the afflic-
tion than proposed a remedy; and upon tins tie re
pea ted a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot re-
peat in just the same words that he spoke it, yet I
remember I made it into an English proverb of my
own, .thus:
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im-
provements I had made in my solitude; my unwea-
ried application, as he called it, and how I had marie
a condition, which in its circumstances was at first
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more hap-
py than theirs was, even now when they were all to-
gether. He told me it was remarkable that English-
men had a greater presence of mind in their distress
than any people that ever he met w ith; that their unhap
py nation, and the Portuguese, were the worst men
in the world to struggle with misfortunes; for that
their first step in dangers, after common efforts are
over, was always to despair, lie down under it and
die, without rousing their thoughts up to prop'er re-
medies for escape.
. 1 told him their case and mine differed exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the shore without necessa-
ries, without supply of food, or of present sustenance,
till they could provide it; that it is true, 1 had this
disadvantage and discomfort, that I was alone; but
then the supplies I had providentially thrown into my
hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore,
was such a help as would have encouraged any crea-
ture in the world to have applied himself as I had
done. "Seignior," says the Spaniard, " had we poor
Spaniards been in your case we should never have
gotten half those things out of the ship as you did."
44 Nay," says he, " we should never have found means
to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to have gotten
a raft on shore without boat or sail; and how much
less should we have done," said he, "if any of us
| had been alone!" Well, I desired him to abate his

compliment, and go on with the history of' their com
mg on shore, where they landed. He told me- they
unhappily landed at a place where there were people
without provisions; whereas, had they had the com-
mon sense tc have put off to sea again, and gone to
another ismnrl a little farther, they had found provi-
sions though without people; there being an island
that way, as they had been told, where there were
provisions though no people; that is say, that the
Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and
filled the island with goats and hogs at several times,
where they have bred in such multitudes, and wheie
turtle and sea-fowls were in such plenty that they
could have been in no want of flesh though they had
found no bread ; whereas here they were only sustain-
ed with a few roots and herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no substance in them, and which
the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and who
could treat them no better unless they would turn
cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the great
dainty of the country.
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and to
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way oi
living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon
them as unjust, that they, who came thither for assist-
ance and support, should attempt to set up for instruc-
tors of those that gave them bread; intimating, it
6eems, thai none should set up for the instructors oi
others but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
they were driven to: how sometimes they were many
days without anv food at all, the island they were
wpon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived
more indolent, and for that reason were less supplied
with the necessaries of life than they had reason to be-
lieve others ueie in the same part of the world; and
yet they found (hat these savages were less lavenous
and voracious than those who had better supplies of
Also tViey added, that they could not but see witn
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the go-
verning providence of God directs the event of things
in the world, which they said appeared in their cir-
cumstances; for if, pressed by the hardships they were
under, and the barrenness of the country where they
were, they had searched after a better place to live in,
they had then been out of the way of the relief that
happened to them by my means.
Then they gave me an account how the savages
whom they' ,lived among expected them to go out
with them into their wars; and it was true, that aa
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the
disaster to lose iheir ammunition, they should not have
been servicable only to their friends, but have made
themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but
being without powder and shot, and in a condition
that they could not in reason deny to go out with their
landlords to their wars; when they came in the field
of battle they were in a worse condition than the sa-
vages themselves, for they neither had bows nor ar-
rows,' nor could they use those the savages gave them,
so that they could do nothing but stand still and b*
wounded with arrows, till they came up to the teeth
of heir enemy; and then indeed the three halberts
they had were of use to them, and they would often/
drive a whole little army before them with those hal-
berts and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles o.
their muskets: but that for all this, t\iay were some-
times surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger
from their arrows; till at last they found the way to
make themselves large targets of wood, which they
covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they
knew not, and these covered them from the arrows
of tne savages: that notwithstanding these, they were
sometimes in great danger, a.id were once five of
them knocked down together with the clubs of the sa-
vages, which was the time when one of them was
taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom 1
had relieved; that at first they thought ho had been
killed, but when afterwards they heard ho was taUi
prisoner they were under the greatest grief imagina-
ble, and would willingly have all ventured their live*
to have rescued him.
They told me, that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them fighting till they were come to them-
selves, all but he who they thought had,been dead
and then they made their way with their halberts an (
pieces standing close together in a line, through a
body of above a thousand savages, beating down all
that came in their way, got the victory over their ene-
mies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with
the loss of their friend ; whom the other party, finding
him alive, carried off with some others, as I gave an
account in my former.
They described, most affectionately, how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
coYnpanion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz. by wild
men: and yet how more and more they were sur-
prised with the account he gave them of his errand,
and that there was a Christian in a place near, much
more one that was able, and had humanity enough to
contribute to their deliverance.
They described how they were astonishned at the
sight of the relief 1 sent them, and at the appearance
of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since their
coming to that miserable place; how often they dossed
it, and blessed it as bread sent from heaven; and
what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste
it, as also of the other things I had sent for their sup-
ply. And, after all, they would have told me some-
thing of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat
and pilots to carry them away to the person and placo
from whence all these.new comforts came; but they
told me it was impossible to express it by words, for
their excessive joy driving them to unbecoming ex-
travagances, they had no way to describe them but
by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy, having
no way to give vent to their passion suitaoie to tnei
sense that was upon them ; that in some it. worked one
way, and in some another; and that some of them,
through a surprise of joy, would burst out into tears;
others be half mad, and Others immediately faint.
This discourse extremely affected me, and called to
my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and
the poor people's ecstasy when I took them up at
sea, after their ship was on fire; the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when
after twenty-eight years captivity I found a good ship
ready to carry me to my own country. All these
thing made me more sensible of the relation of these
poor men, and more effected with it.
Having thus given a view of-the state of things as
I found them, I must relate the heads of what I did
for these people, and the condition in which I left
them. It was their opinion, and mine too that they
would be troubled no more with the savages ; or that,
if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if
they were twice as many as before; so that they had
no concern about that. Then f entered into a serious
discourse with the Spaniard whom I called governor,
about their stay in the island ; for as I was not come
to carry any of them off, so it would not he just to
carry off some and leave others, who perhaps would
oe unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.
On the other hand I told them, 1 came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry
kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge to
upply them with all things necessary, as well for their
onvenience as their defence; and that 1 had such
articular persons with me, as well to increase and
recruit their number, as by the particular necessary
employments which they were bred to, being artifi-
(iccrs, to assist them in those things in which at pro-
sen hey were to seek. *
109
They were all together when T talked thus to them
and before I delivered to them the stores I had brought,
I asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot
and buried the first animosities that had been amonf,,
them, and could shake hands with one another, and
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, so
that there might be no more misunderstandings or
jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good humour, said, they had met with affliction!
cr.ough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends ; that for his part he would
live and die with them ; and was so far from design-
ing any thing Against the Spaniards, that he owned
they had done nothing to him but what his own bad
humour made necessary, and what he would have
done, and perhaps much worse, in their case; and
that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, fort'is
foolish and brutish thing he had done to them; and
was very willing and desirous of living on terms (I
entire friendship and union with them ; and would do
any thing that lay in his power, to convince them of
it: and as for going to England, he cared not if he did
not go thither these twenty years.
The Spaniards said, they had indeed at first disarm
ed and excluded William Atkins and his two coun
trymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let me know
and they appealed to me for the necessity they were
under to do so; but that William Atkins had behave*
himself so bravely in the great fight they had with th(
savages, and on several occasions since, and hac"
shewed himself so faithful to, and concerned for the
general interest of them all, that they had forgotten all
that was past, and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with arms, and supplied with necessaries, as
any of them ; and that they had testified their satisfac-
tion in him, by committing the command to him,
next to the governor himself; and as they had an en-
tire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
acknowV* pd thev had merited that confidence hv
all the metho'ls that honest men could merit to be va-
lued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this assurance,. that they
would never have any interest separate from one
another. •
Upon thesrt frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together
and indeed we made a splendid feast. I caused the
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress
our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on slice
assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good
beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provi-
sion, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it,
and, in particular, [ gave them ten bottles of French
claret, .and ten bottles of English beer, things that
neither the Spaniards nor the Englishmen had tasted
for many years; and which it may be supposed they
were exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were
gent, coversd up close, on board our ship to the sea-
men, that-they might feast on fresh meat from on
shore, as we did with their salt meat fiom on board
After this feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought but my cargo of goods, wherein,
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I shew-
ed tliem that there was sufficient for them all; and
desired that they might all take an equal quantity of
the goods that were far wearing; that is to say equal
when made up. As first, I distributed linen sufficient
to make every one of them fojir shirts; and, at iht
Spaniards' request, afterwards made them up six:
these were exceeding comfortable to them, having
teen what, as I may say, they had long since forgo
<he use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mention-
ed before, to make every one a light coat like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered, thdK whenever they decaved
they should make more, at they thought fit. The like
for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats, &c.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction,
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men when
they saw the care 1 had taken of them, and how well
I had furnished them ; they told me I was a father to
(hem ; and that having such a correspondent as I was,
in so remote a part of the world, it would make them
forget that they were left in a desolate place : and they
all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place
without my consent.
Then 1 presented to them the people f had brought
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the
two carpenters, all of them most necessary people;
but above all, my general artificer, than whom they
could not name any thing that was more needful to
them; and the tailor, to'shew his concern for them,
went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made
them every one a shirt the first thing lie did; and,
which was still more, he taught the women *iot only
how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made
them assist to make the shins for their husbands and
for all the rest.
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how
qseful they were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy
unhandy things, and made them clever convenient
tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves,
and every thing they wanted of that kind.
But to let them see how nature made artificers at
first, I carried the carpenters to see William Atkin's
basket-house, as I called it, and they both owned they
never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity be-
fore, nor any thing so regular and so handily built,
at least of its kind; and one of them, when he saw it
after musing a good while, turning abnui to me, "I
am sure," says he, "that man has no need of'us;
you need do nothing but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of Tools, and
^ave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake
for we had no harrows or ploughs: and to every sp
parate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broariaxe, ano a
saw; always appointing, that as often as any were
broken, or worn out, they should be supplied, without
grudging, out of the general stores that 1 left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,
scissars, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they had
without tale as they required ; for no man would care
to take, more than he wanted, and he must be a fool
that would waste or spoil them on any account what-
ever. And for the use of the smith f left two tons d
unwrought iron for a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms which I brought
them, was such, even to profusion, that they could
not but rejoice at them; for now they could "march,
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if
there was occasion, and were able to fight a thousand
savages, if they had but some little advantage of sit-*
tuation, which also they could not miss of if'they had
occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also: she
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her
a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with
us, there being no women in the ship hut herself; but
she bote it with patience. After a while, seeing things
so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considering that thev had neither bu-
siness nor acquaintance in the East'lndies, or reason
for taking so long a voyage; 1 say, consitlering all
this, both of them came to me, and desired I would
give them leave to remain on the island, and be en-
tered among my family, as they called it.
I agieed to it readily, and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, pali-
saded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantation
1 heir tents were contrived so, that they had each of
them a room, a part to lodge in, and a middle tent,
hke a great storehouse, to lay all their goods in and

\o eat and drink in.' And now the other two Eng
•ishmcu moved their habitation to the same place, and
so the island was div/uled into three colonies, and no
more; viz. the Spaniards with old Friday, and the
first servants, at my old habitation under the hill,
which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they
had so enlarged and extended their works, as well
under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived,
tnough perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never
was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, 1
believe, in any part of the world; for I verily believe
a thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and if they had not known there was such a thing,
and looked on purpose for it, they would not have
found it; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and
grew so fast matted into one another, that nothing but
cutting them down first, could discover the place, ex-
cept the two narrow entrances where they went in
and out, could be found, which was not very easy.
One of them was just down at the water's edge, on the
"side of the creek; and it was afterwards above two
hundred yards to the place; and the other was up the
ladder at twice, as I have already formerly described
it; and they had a large wood, thick planted, also on
the top of the hill, which contained above an acre,
which grew apace, and covered the place from all dis-
covery there, with only one narrow place between
two trees, not easy to be discovery, to enter on that
side.
Tne other colony was that of Will Atkins, where
there w«re four families of Englishmen, 1 mean those
I had .<ih there, with their wives and children; thre
savages that were slaves; the widow and children o
the Englishman that was killed; the young man and
Ihe maid; and by the way, we made a wife of hei
also before we went away. There wer^r also the twe
carpenters and ihe tailor, whom I hi ought with me
for them; alsoHhe sm'Mh, who was a very necessary
man to them, especially as the yunsmith, to t ike card
of their arm1?: and mv other man, whom F called
Jack of all Trades, who was himself as good almost
as twenty men, for he was not only a very ingenious
fe low but a very merry fellow; and before I went
iway we married him to the honest maid that came
&'ith the, youth in the ship, whom I mentioned before
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natu-
rally to sav something of the French ecclesiastic that
I had brought with me out of the ship's crew whom
I took at sea. h is true, this man was a Roman, and
perhaps it may give offence to some nereafter, if 1
leave any thing extraordinary upon record of a man,
whom, before 1 begin, I must (to set him out in just
colours) represent in terms very much tc his disadvan-
tage in the account of Protestants; as, first, that he
was a Papist; secondly a Popish priest; and thirdly,
a French Popish priest.
* But justice demands of me to give him a due cha-
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person ;.exact in his life, extensive
in his charity, ^.nd exemplary in almost every thing
he did. What then can any one say against my being
very sensible of the value of Such a man, notwith-
standing his profession ? though it may be .my opin-
ion, perhaps as well as the opinion of others wno
shall read this, that he was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had agreed.to go with me to the East Indies,
I found reason to delight exceedingly in his conver-
sation; and he first began with me about religion, in
Mic most obliging manner imaginable.
"Sir," says he, " you have not only, under God"
^'and at that he crossed his breast)', "saved my life,
ut you have admitted me to go this voyage in youi
hip, arid by your obliging civility have taken me into
your family, giving me an opportunity of free con-
versation. Now, Sir," says he, " you see by my
habit what my profession is, and I guess by your na-
tion what yours is. I may think it is my duty, and
doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours on all
occasions to bring all the souls that I can to the kn ,-.\
ledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic dct>
trine; but as I am here under your permission, and in
your family, I am bound in justice to your kindness,
as well as in decency and good manners, to be under
your government; and therefore I shall not, without
your leave, enter into any debates on the points of re-
ligion, in which we may not agree, farther than you
shall give me leave."
1 told him his carriage was so modest that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such people as they call heretics, but that lie was not
ihe first Catholic that I had conversed with without
falling into any inconveniences, or carrying the ques-
tions to any height in debate ; that he should not find
himself the worse used for being of a different opinion
from us; and if we did not converse without any Ois*
like on either side, upon that score, it would be his
fault, not. ours.
He replied, that he thought our conversation might
be easily separated from disputes; that it was not his
business to cap principles with every man 1\3 dis-
coursed with; and that he rather desired me to con-
verse with him as a gentleman than as a religieux.,
that if I would give him leave at any time to dis-
course upon religious subjects, he would readil/ com-
ply with it; and that then he did not doubt but I would
allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as
he could; but that without my leave he would no*
break in upon me with any such thing.
He told me farther, that he would not cease to do
all that became him in his office as a priest as well
as a private Christian, to procure the good of the ship
and the safety of all that was in her; and though per
haps we would not join with him, and he could no*
pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which
he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we
conversed ; and as he was of a most obliging gentle-
man-like behavicur, so he was if I may be allowed
to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, o
(rreat learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his life,
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of many
adventures which had befallen him in the few years
»hat he had been abroad in the world, and particularly
this was very remarkable; viz. that during the voy-
ige he was now engaged in he had the misfortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to go
to the place whither any of the ships he was in were
at first designed : that his first intent was to have gone
to Martinico, and that he went on board a ship bound
thither at St. Maloes; but being forced into Lisbon in
bad weather, the ship received some damage by run
ring aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and
was obliged to unload her cargo there: that finding a
Portuguese ship there, bound to the Madeiras, and
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet with
a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on board
in order to sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the
Portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner, had
been out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fyal •
where, however, he happened to find a very good
market for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore
resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at
the isle of May, to go away to Newfoundland. He
nad no remedy in the exigence but to go with the ship,
and had a pretty good voyage as far as the Banks, (so
they call the place where they catch the fish) where
meeting wjth a French ship bound from France to
Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from thence to
Martinico to carry provisions, he thought he should
have an opportunity to complete his first design. Bui
when he came to Quebec the master of the ship died,
and the ship proceedeefno farther. So the next voy
age he shipped himself for France, in the ship that
was burnt, when we too* them up at sea, and then
shipped them with us for the East Indies, as I have
already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five
voyages, all, as I may call it, in one voyage, besides
what I shall have occasion to mention farther of the
, «ame person.
Ill
But I shall not make digressions into other men'i
iiones which have no relation to my own. I relurr,
to what concerns our afi'irs in the island. He came to
me one morning, for he lodged among us all the while
we were upon the island, and it hapnened to he ju^i
when I was going to visit the [englishmen's colony ai
the farthest part of the island; 1 say he came to me,
and told me with a very grave countenance, that he
had for two or three days desired an opportunity of
.tome discourse with me, which he hoped would not
be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in
some measure correspond with my general design,
which was the prosperity of my new colony, and per-
haps might put it at least more than he yet thought it
was in the way of God's blessing.
1 looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course,'and turning a little short, "How, Sir,11 said
I, "can it be said, that we are not in the wav of
(iod's blessing, after such visible assistances and won
flerful deliverancesas we have seen hers, and of which
1 have given you a large account?"
"If you lr»d pleased, Sir," said he, with a world
jf modesty and yet with great readiness, *« to have
heard me, you would have found no room to have
been displeased, much less to think so hard of me,
that f should suggest, that you have not had wonder-
ful assistances and deliverances; and 1 hope, on your
behalf that you are in the way of God's blessing, and
your design is exceeding good, and will prosper. But,
Sir," said he " though it were more so than is even
possible to you, yet there may be some among you
fnat are not equally right in their actions: and you
know that in the story of Israel, one Achan, in the
camp, removed God's blessing from them, and turned
his hand so against them, that thirty-six rf them,
though not concerned in the crime, were the objects
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that pu-
nishment."
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told
him his inference was so iust, and the whole design
eeenied so sincere, and was really so religious in its
own nature, that 1 was very sorry I had interrupter
him, and begged him to go on; and in the meantime,
because it seemed that what we had both to say might
take up some time, I told him I was going to the F.ng-
lishmens' plantation, and asked him to go with me,
aud we might discoure of it by the way. He told
me he would more willingly wait on me thither be-
cause there, partly, the thing was acted which he de-
sired to speak to me about. So we walked on, and I
pressed him to be free aud plain with me in what he
had to say.
"Why then, Sir," says he, " be pleased to give me
eave to lay down a few propositions as the foundation
of what 1 have to say, that we may not differ in the
general principles, though we may be of some differ-
ing opinions in the practice of particulars. First, Sir,
though we diffei in some of the doctrinal articles of
religion, and it is very unhappy thai it is so, especially
in the case before us, as I shall shew afterwards, yet
there are some general principles in which we both
agree; viz. first, that there is a God, and that this
God, having given us some stated general rules for our
service and obedience, we ought not willingly and
knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do
what he has commanded, or by doing what he has ex-
pressly forbidden; and let our different religions be
what they will, this general principle is readily owned
by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily
follow a presumptuous sinning against his command:
and every good Christian will be affectionately con-
cerned to prevent any that are under his care, living
in a total neglect of God and his commands, It is not
your men being Protestants, whatever my opinion
May be of such, that discharges me from being con-
cerned for their souls, and from endeavouring, if it
lies before me, that they should live in as little dis-
tance from, and enmity with their maker as possible;
•specially if you give me leave to meddle so far io
you* circuit."
'I could not yet imagine what he aimed at. and tolo
him I granted all he had said; and thanked him that
he would so far concern himself for us; and begged
he would explain the particulars of what he had ob-
served, tint, like Joshua, (to take his own parable) I
might put away the accursed thing from us.
"Why then, Sir," says he, " I will take the liberty
von give me; and there are three things which, if I am
right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon
your endeavours here, and which 1 should rejoice, for
your sake, and their own to see removed. And, Sir."
says he, «* I promise myself that you will fully agree
with me in them all as soon as / name them; especi-
ally because I shall convince you that every one of
them may with great ease, and very much io your
satisfaction, Ii2 remedied."
He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
but went on: " First, Sir," says lie, "you have I.fie
four Englishmen, who have fetched'women from
among the savages, and have taken them as their
wives, and have had many children by them all. and
ret are not married to them after any stated legal mau-
ler, as the laws of God and man require; and there-
fore are yet, in the sense of both, no less than adulte-
rers, and living in adultery. To this, Sir," says he,
u I know you will object, that there was no clergyman
or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to perform
the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to v rii*
down a contract of marriage, and have it signed be-
tween them. And I know also, Sir, what the Spanh rd
governor has told you: I mean of the agreement that
'.ie obliged them to make when they took these wo-
men, viz. that they should choose then) out by con-
sent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way,
is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the wo-
men as wives, but only an agreement among them-
selves, to keep them from quarreling.
"But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament cf matri
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one
another as man and wife, but in the i,,r-\ ai ;\i.<i Ir-ai
obligation that there i> in the coniraei to (-(impel the
man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge?
each other; obliging the man to absta.n from, alloihe*
women, to engage in no other contract while tl.eid
subsist; and on all occasions, as ability allows, ic pro-
vide honestly for them and their children ; and t<?
oblige the women to the same, on like conditions, mv-
tatis mutandis on their side.
 "Now, Sir," says he, " these men may, when tht?
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these wo-
men, disown their children, leave them to perish, and
lake other women and marry them whilst these are
living." And here he added, with some warmth,
"How, Sir, isGod honoured in this unlawful liberty?
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in
this place, however good in themselves, and howevei
sincere in yrur design, while these men, who at pre
sent are your subjects under your absolute govern-
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live \v
open adultery?"
I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but much
more with the convincing arguments he supported it
with. For it was certainly true, that though they had
no clergyman on the spot, yet a formal contract on
both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed by
any token which they had all agreed to be bound bv,
though it had been but the breaking a stick between
them, engaging the men to own these women for their
wives upon all occasions, and never to abandon them
or their children, and the women to the same with
their husbands, had been an effectual lawful marriage
in the sight of God, and it was a great neglect that it
was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my yotm»
priest by telling him, that all that part was done'when
I was not here; and they had lived so many years
with them now, that if it was adultery it was past re
medy, they could do nothing in it now.
"Sir," says he, " asking your purdon for such free
oom, you aie right in this; that it being done in yoin
absence, you could not be charged with mat part ol
the crime. But 1 beseech yon, flatUer not yourseli
that you are not therefore under an obligation to do
your uttermost now to put an end to it." How can
you think, but that, let the time past lie on whom it
will, all the guilt tor the future will lie entirely upon
you i Because it is certainly in your power now to put
an end to it, and in nobody's pow\tr but yours."
I was so dull still, that J did not take him right, bin
I imagined that by putting an en(\ to it be meant thai
I should part them, and not suffer them to live toge-
ther any fonger; and 1 said to him 1 could not do that
by any means, for that it would put the whole island
in confusion. He seemed surprised that I should, so
far mistake him. "No, Sir," says he, "I do not
mean that you should separate them, but legally and
effectually marry them now. And, Sir, as my way
of marrying may not be so easy to reconcile them to,
though it will be as effectual even by your own laws;
so your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men ; I mean by a written contract signed by
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses pre-
sent; which all the laws of Europe would decree to
be valid."
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartial-
ity in his discourse, as lo his own party or church,
and such a true warmth for the preserving people
that he had no knowledge Of or relation to ; I say, for
preserving them from transgressing the laws of God;
the like of which I had indeed not met with any wheie.
But recollecting what he had said of marrying them
by a written contract, which I knew would stand too,
I returned it back upon him and told him I granted
all that he had said to be just, and on his part very
kind; mat I would discourse with the men upon the
point now when I came to them. And I knew no
reason why they should scruple to let him marry them
all; which I knew well enough would be granted to
be as authentic and vallid in England as if they were
married by one of our own clergymen. What was
afterwards done in this matter I shall speak of by
itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the seconci
complaint which be had to make, acknowledging!
was very much his debtor for the first, and thanked
h m heartily for it. He told me .he would use the
same freedom and plainness in thcsecond, and hoped
I would take it as well; and this was, that notwith-
standing these English subjects of mine, as he called
them, had lived with these women for almost seven
years, and had taught them to speak English, and even
to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, wo-[
men of tolerable understanding and capable of in-
struction; yet they had not to this hour taught them
•any thing of the Christian religion; no not so much
as to know that there was a God, or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served ; or that their own
idolatry, and worshiping they knew not who, waa
false and absurd. ,
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account
for; and perhaps at last take the work out of their
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warmly
"[ am persuaded," says he, " had those men lived in
the savage country whence their wives came, the sa-
vages would have taken more pains to have brought
them to be idolaters, and to worship the devil, than
any of these men, so far as I can see, has taken with
them to teach them the knowledge of the true God.
Now; Sir," said he, "though I do not acknowledge
your religion, or you mine, yet we should be all glad
to seethe devil's servants, and the subjects of his king-
dom, taught to know the general principles of the
Christian religion; that they might at least hear o
God, and of aRedeemer, and of the resurrection, and
of a future state, things which we all believe; they
had at least been so much nearer corning into tne r>o-
som of the true church, than they are now in the pub-
lic profession of idolatry and devil-worship."
I could hold no longer; 1 look him,in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion. "How
far," said I to him, "have 1 been from understand
ing the mdst essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good of
other men's souls! I scarce have known what belongs
to being a Christian."—«' O, Sir, do not say so," repli-
ed he ; " this thing is not your fault."—'* No," said f,
"but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you?"
—" It is not too late yet," said he; "be not too for-
ward to condemn yourself."—"But what can be done
now?" said 1; " you see I am going away."—" Will
you give me leave," said he, "to talk with these poor
men about it."—"Yes, with all my heart," said i,
"and I will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too."—" As*to that," said he, "we must leave thern
to the mercy of Christ; but it is our business to assist
them, encourage them, and instruct them ; and if you
will give me leave, and God his blessing, I do nof
doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought
home into the great circle of Christianity, if not into
the particular faith that we all embrace; and that even
vhile you stay here." Upon this I said, " I shall not
only give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks
lor it." What followed on this account I shall men
tior. also again in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we
were to blame. "Why really," says he, "it is of
the same nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave'/
With the same plainness as before; it is about youi
poor savages yonder, who are, as I may say, youi
conquered subjects. It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or
ought to be received among all Christians, of what
church, or pretended church soever, viz. that Chris-
tian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible
means, and on all possible occasions. It is on this
orincinle that our church sends missionaries int<»
Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, even
of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most
hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence
among murderers and barbarians,- to teach them the
knowledge of the true God, and to bring thevn over to
embrace the Christian faith,, Now, Sir, you have an
opportunity here to have six or seven-and-thirty poor
savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge
at' God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder
how you can pass by such an occasion of doing good,
which is really worth the expense of a man's whole
life."
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say; I had here a spirit of true christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his particular
principles be of what kind soever. As for me, I had
not so much as entertained a thought of this in my
heart before, and I believe I should not have thought of
it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and
people whom, had we any work For them to do, we
would have used as such, or would have been glad to
have transported them to any other part of the world;
for our business was to get rid of them, and we would
all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any
country, so they had never seen their own. But to
the case : I say I was confounded at his discourse, and
knew not what answer to make him. He looked sar-
nestly at me, seeing me in some disorder; "Sir,"
«aid he, "I shall be very sorry, if what I have said
gives you any offence."—" No, no," said I, "I am
offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly
confounded, not only to think that I should never take
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what no-
tice I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir,"
said I, "what circumstances I am in : I am bound to
the East Tndies, in a shin freighted by merchants, and
to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice
to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while
at victuals and wages upon the owners1 account. It i«
true, 1 agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and il
I stay more I must pay 31. sterling per diem demur
rage; nor can I stay upon demurrage aboveeight day*
more,and I have been here thirteen days already; so
that I am perfecily unable to engage in this work, un
less 1 would suffer myself to be left behind here
again; in which case, if this single ship should mis-
carry in any part of her voyage, I shoul I be just in
the same condition that I was left in here at first, and
from which I have been so wonderfully delivered."
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to
my voyage,'but laid it home upon my conscience,
whether the blessing of saving seven-apd-thirty souls
was not worth my venturing all J had in the world
i>r? I was not so sensible of that as he was, and J
returned upon him thus: 't Why, Sir, il is a valuable
thing indeed to be an instrument in God's hand to con-
vert seven-and-thirty heathens to tiie knowledge ol
Christ; but as you are an* ecclesiastic, and are given
over to that work, so that it seems naturally to fall
into the way of your profession, how is it then that
you do not rather offer yourself to undertake il, than
press me to it?"
Upon this he faced about, just before me, as hr
walked along and putting me to a full stop, made me
a very low bow: "I most heartily thank God, and
you, Sir," says he, "for giving me so evident a call
to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself dis-
charged from it and deisre me to undertake it, I will
most readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all
the hazards and difficulties of such a broken disap-
pointed voyage as I have met with, that 1 have drop
ped at last into so glorious a work."
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while jje
spoke this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face
glowed, and his colour came and went as if he had
been falling mto fits; in a word, he was fired with the
joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a
considerable while before I could tell what to sav tc
him, fori was really surprised to find a man of such
imcerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ordinany rate of men, not of his profession only,
but even of any profession whatsoever. But after 1
had considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he
was in earnest, and that he would venture on the single
consideration of an attempt on those poor people, tc
be locked up in an implanted island for perhaps his
life, and at last might not know whether he should be
able to do them any good or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked mp what 1
called a venture ?" rray, Sir," said he, '* what do
you think I consented to go hi your ship to the East
Indies for?"—"Nay*" said I, "that I know, not, un-
less it was to preach to the Indians."—" Doubtless it
was," said he; "and do you think if I can convert
these seven-and-thirty men to the faith of Christ, it is
not worth'my time, though I should never be fetched
off the island again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more
worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the life
of twenty more o*f the same profession? Yes, Sir,"
says he, " I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin
thanks all my days, if I could be made the least hap-
py instrument of saving the souls of these poor men,
though I was never to set my foot off this island, or
see my native country any more. But since you will
honour me," says he, "with putting me into this
work, (for which I will p»*ay for you all the days of my
life) I have one humble petition to yon," said he,
"besides."—" What is that?" said I. "Why," says
he " it is, that you will leave your man Friday with
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me;
for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they
to me."
I was aensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, be-
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that
for many reasons. He had been the companion ol
my travels; he was not only faithful to me, but sin-
cerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had re-
solved to do something considerable for him it he out
8
lived me as it was probable he would. Then I knew
that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it
would quite confound him to bring him to embrace
another profession; and he would never, while hii
eyes were open, believe that his old master was a he-
retic, and would be damned; and this might in the
end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him
back again to his first idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say thai
I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever; though a work thai to him was of more
value than his life, ought to me to be of much more
value than the keeping or parting with a servant. Bui
on the other hand, T was persuaded, that Friday would
by no means consent to part with me; and then to
force him to it without his consent would be manifest
injustice, because I had promised I would never put
him away, and he had promised and engaged to me
that he would never leave me unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he did
not understand one word of their language, nor they
one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told
him Friday's father had learnt Spanish, which I found
he also understood, and he should serve him for an
interpreter; so he was much better satisfied, and no.
thing could persuade him but he would stay to endea-
vour to convert them; but Providence gave another
and very happy turn to all this.
I come back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen I sent for them all
together ; and after some accounts given them of what
I had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed,
which they were sensible of, and very thankful for; I
began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led,
and gave them a full account of the notice the clergy-
man had already taken of it; and arguing hew un-
christian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them
if they were married men or bachelors? They soon
explained their condition to me, and shewed me that
two of them were widowers, and the other three were
single men or bachelors. I asked them with what
conscience they could take these women, and lie with
them as they had done, call them their wives, and
have so many children by them, and not be married
lawfully to them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as tl eir
wives; and to keep them and own them as their
wives; and they thought as things stood with them,
they were as legally married as if they had been mar-
ried by a parson, and with all the formalities in the
world. %
I told them that no doubt they were married in the
sight of God, and were hound in conscience to keep
them as their wives; but that the laws of men being
otherwise, they might pretend they were not married,
and sft desert the poor women and children hereafter;
and that their wives, being poor, desolate women,
friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help
themselves: I therefore told them, that unless I was
assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for
them; but would take care that what I did should be
for the women and chidren without them; and that
unless they would give some assurances that they
would marry the women, I could not think it was
convenient they could continue* together as man and
wife; for that it was both scandalous to men and of
fensive to God, who they could not think would bless
them if they went on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak fot
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they
had been bom in their own native county, and would
not leave them upon any account whatever; an*r they
did verily believe their wives were as virtuous* aivd as
modest, and did to the utmost of their skilLa**mu*k
for them and for their children as any women couW
possibly do, and they would not part with them on
any account: and Will Atkins for his own particular
added, if any man would take him away, and offer to
carry him home to England* and to make him cap-
tain of the best man of War in the navy, he would not
go with him if he might not carry his wife and chil-
dren with him; and if there was a clergyman in the
ship, he would he married to her now with all his
heart.
This was just as 1 would have it. The priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not far off. So
to try him farther, 1 told him 1 had a clergyman with
me, and if he was sincere I would have him married
the next morning, and bade him consider of it, and
talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need
not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to dc
it, and was glad 1 had a minister with me ; and he be-
lieved they would be all willing also. I then told
him that my friend the minister was a Frenchman,
and could not speak English, but that 1 would act the
clerk between them. He never so much as asked
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was
indeed what I was afraid of. But i say they never
inquired about it. So we parted; I went back to my
clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his
companions. I desired the French gentlemen not to
say any thing to thein till the business was tnorough
ripe, and I told him what answer the men had given
me •;
Before T weni from their quarter they all came to
me, and told me, they had been considering what 1
had said; that they were very glad to hear I had a
clergyman in my company; and they were very wil-
ling to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be
formally married as soon as I pleased ;' for they were
far from desiring to part from their wives; and that
they meant nothing but wlvat was ver> honest wnen
they chose, them. So I appointed them to meet m«
the next morning, and that in the mean time thev
mould let their wives know the meaning oi the mar
"age law; and that it was not only to prevent any
scandal, but a"so to oblige them that they should no*
Ibrsake them, whatever might happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the mean*
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it,
as indeed they had reason to be; so they failed not to
attend all together at my apartment next morning,
where I brought out my clergyman : and though he
had not on a minister's gown, af'er the manner oi
England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of
France; yet having a black vest, something like a
cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very
unlike a minister; and as for his language I was in«
terpreter.
# But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the scruple he made marrying the women because
they were not baptised, and professed Christians, gave
them an exceeding reverence for his person; and
there was no need after that to inquire whether he
jvas a clergyman or no. f
Indeed 1 was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so far that he would not have married them
at all t nay, notwithstanding all 1 «vas able to say to
him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very stea-
dily; and at last refused absolutely to marry diem,
unless he had first talked with the men and the wo-
• men too; and though at first I was a little backward
to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will, per-
ceiving the sincerity of his-design.
When he came to them, he let them know that 1
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and with
the present design; that he was very willing to per-
form that part of his function, and marry them as J
had desired; but that before he could do it, he must
take the liberty to talk with them. He told them that
n the sight of all different men, and in the sense oi
the laws of society, they had lived all this while in an
open adultery; and that it was true that nothing but
tba consenting to marry, or effectually separating them
from one another now, could put an end to it; bul
there was a difficulty in it too, with respect to the
.aws of Christian matrimony, which he was not fully
satified about, viz. that of marrying one that is a pro-
fessed Christian to a savage, an idolator, and a Jica-
then, one that is not baptised; and yet that he did
not see that there was time left for it to endeavour to
persuade the women to be babtised, or to profess the
name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard
nothing of, and without which they could not be bap-
lized.
He told me he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians'themselves \ that they had but little know-
ledge of God or his ways, and therefore he could not
expect that they had said much to their wives on that
head yet; but that unless they would premise him to
use their endeavours with their wives to persuade them
to become Christians, and would as well as they could
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeem-
ed them, he could not marry them ; for he would have
no hand in joining Christians with savages; nor was
it consistent with the principles of the Christian reli-
gion, and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered
it very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near hia
own words as I could, only sometimes adding some-
thing of my own, to convince them how just it was,
and how I was of his mind: and I always very faith-
fully distinguished between what 1 said from mysell
and what were the clergyman's words. They told me
it was very true what the gentleman had said, thai
thev were but very indifferent Christians themselves,
and that they had never talked to their wivesabout re-
ligion.—" Lord, Sir." say.? Will Atkins" how should
we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing our-
selves; and besides, Sir," said he, u should we go to
talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven and
hell, it would be to make them laugh at us, and ask
«K what we believed ourselves ? and if we should tell
^«m we believe all »ne things that we speak of to thrmt
such as of good peuple going to heaven, and wicked
people to the devil, they wculd ask us, where we in
tended to go ourselves who believe all this, and yt\
are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are :Why, Sir/**
said Will, u 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of reli-
gion, at first hearing: folks must have'some religion
themselves before they pretend to teach other peopL.' ,
—" Will Atkins," said I to him, " though I am afraid
what yon say has too much truth in it, yet can you
not tell your wife that she is in the wrong; that thi.K
is a God, and a religion better than her own: that her
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear nor speak;
that there is a great Being that made all things, a\ri
that can destroy all that he has made; that he rewards
the good; and punishes the bad; that we are to ba
judged by him, at last, for all we do here? You are
not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you
that all this is true; and I am satisfied you know it all
to be true, and believe it yourself."
"That's true, Sir," said Atkins; «* hut with what
face can I say any thing to my wife of all this, when
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true?"
"Not true !" said I ; «» what do you mean by that?"
—" Why, Sir," said he, " she will tell me it cannot
be true: that this God (I shall tell her of) can be just,
or can punish or reward, since I am not punished and
sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked crea-
ture as she knows 1 have been, even to her, and tc
every body else; and that 1 should be suffered to live,
that have been always acting so contrary to what 1
must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have
done."
** Why truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou
spcakest too much truth ; and with that I let the cler-
gyman know what Atkins had said, for he was im-
patient to know. "O." said the priest, «* tell him
there is one thing will make Mm the best minister in
the world 10 his wife, and that is repentance; for nont
teacfi repentance like true penitents. He wants no
thing but to repent, and then he will be so much the
better qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be'
able to tell her, that there is not only a God and that
ho is the just rewarder of good and evil; but that ho
U a merciful Being, and, with infinite goodness and;
long-suffering, forbears to punish those that offend •
waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death of o
ginner, but rather that he should return and live % tha
lie oftgi suffers wicke.d men to go on a long time, an<i
Bven reserves damnation to the general day of retribu-
tion : that it is a clear evidence of God, and of a
future siate, that righteous men receive not their re-
ward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come
into another world; and this will lead him to leach
his wife the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last
judgment: let him but repent for himself, he will be
an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife."
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very se-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per-
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it: when
being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end
—" I knew all this, master," says he, "and a great
deal more; but I han't the impudence to talk thus to
my wife, when God and my own conscience knows,
and my wife will be an undeniable evidence against
me, that I have lived as if I never heard of God, or
a future state, or any thing about it; and to talk of my
repenting, alas! (and with that he fetched a deep
sigh; and I could see that tears stood in hjseyes,) 'tis
past all that with me."—" Past it, Atkins!" said I;
"what dost thou mean by that ?"—" I know well
enough what I mean, Sir," says lie; u I mean 'tis too
ate; and that is too true."
I told my clergyman word for word what he said.
The poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for, be
his opinion whatlt will, he had certainly a most sin-
gular affection for the good of other men's souls; and
it would be hard to think he had not the like for his
own)—I sav this zealous, affectionate nnn could not
refrain tear9 also: hut recovering himseli he said to
me, "Ask him but one question: Is he easy thut it
is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were not
bo?" I put the question fairly to Alkins; and he an-
swered with a great deal of passion, "Hew could any
man be easy in a condition that certainly must end
in eternal destruction ? That he was far from being
easy; but that on the contrary, he believed it would
one time or the other ruin him."
"What do you mean 05* that ?" said I.—" Why,"
he said " he believed he should, one time or another,
cut his own throat to put an end to the terror of it."
The clergyman shook his head, with a great con-
cern in his face, when I told him all this; but turning
quick to me upon it, said, "If that be his case, you
may assure him it is not too late; Christ will give
him repentance. But pray,'* says he, "explain this
to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the
merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him,
how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy?
Does he think he is able to sin beyond the power or
reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a
time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and
when God may refuse to hear; but that 'tis never too
ate for men to ask mercy; and we that are Christ'i
Hfervants are commanded to preach mercy at all times,
in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely
repent: so that 'tis never too late to repent."
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned off the dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me he would go and
have some talk with his wife: so he went out awhile,
8,Qd we talked to the rest. 1 perceived they were all
stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion; much as
I was when I we'nt rambling away from my father;
and yet that there were none of them backward to hear
what had been said; and all of them seriously pro-
mised that they would talk with their wives about it,
and do their endeavour tc persuade them to turn
Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good while,
but at last shaking his head, "We that are Christ'i
servants," says he, "can go no farther than to exhort
and instruct; and when men comply, submit to the
reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do;
we are bound to accept their good words; but be-
ieve me, Sir," said he, "whatever you may have
known of the life of that man you call William Atkins,
I believe he is the only sincere convert among them ,
f take that man to be a true penitent; I won't de-
spair of the rest; but that man is perfectly struck with
the sense of his past life; and I doubt not but when
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk
himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach
others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves.
I knew a man," added he, " who having nothing but
a summary notion of religion himself, and being
wicked and profligate to the last degree in his life,
made a thorough reformation in himself by labour-
ing to convert a Jew: and if that poor Atkins begins
but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife,
my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert,
makes himself a penitent; and who knows what may
follow?"
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising
as above to endeavour to persuade their wives to em-
brace Christianity, he married the other three couple;
but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet conie in.
After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, wascurious
to know where Atkins was gone; and turning to me,
says he, " I entreat you, Sir, let us walk, out of youi
labyrinth here and look; I dare say we shall find
this poor man somen here or other, talking seriously
with his wife, and teaching her already, something of
religion." I began to be of the same mind; so wo
went out together, and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were sc
thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see
our; when coming to the edge of the wood I saw
Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, sitting under the
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped
short till my clergymen came up to me, and then
having shewed him where they were, we stood and
looked very steadily at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens;
tnen down to the earth, then out to the sea, tnen to
himself, then to her, K> the woods, to the trees.
"Now," says my clergyman, "you see my words
are made good; the man preaches to her; mark him;
now he is telling her that our God has made him, and
her and the heavens and the earth, the sea, the woods,
the trees, &c.4'—" I believe he is," said I. Imme-
diately we perceived Will Atkins start up up upon his
feet fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his
hands; we supposed he said something, but we could
not hear him; it was too far off for that; he did not
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. Wre
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether
sine said any thing or no wc could not tell. Wrhile
the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could sec the
tears run plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks;
and I could hardly forbear myself; but it was a great
affliction to us both, that we were not near enough
to hear any thing that passed between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear
of disturbing them; so we "resolved to see an end of
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud
enough to us without the help of voice. He sat down
again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again
earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see
him embrace her passionately; another time we saw
him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes,
and then kiss her again, with a kind of transport, very
unusual; and after several of these things, we stwhini
on a suden jump up again and lend her his hand to
iielp her up, when immediately leading her by the ,
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE
hand a step or two, they both kneeled down together,
and continued so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, "St. Paul, St. Paul, behold he prayeth !"-
was afraid Atkins would hear him; therefore I en-
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might
see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess,
was the most affecting, and yet the most agreeable,
that ever I saw inN my life. Well, he strove with
himself,1 and contained himself for awile, but was in
such raptures of joy to think that the poor heathen
woman was become a Christian, that he was not able
to contain himself; he wept several times; then throw-
ing up his hands, and crossing his breast, said over
several things ejaculatory, and by way of giving God
thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success oi
our endeavours; some he spoke softly, and I could
not well hear; others audibly; some in Latin, some
in French; then two or three times the tears of joy
would interrupt him, that he could not speak at all.
But I begged that he would compose himself, ami let
us more narrowly and fully observe what was before
us, which he did for a time, and the scene was nol
ended there yet; for after the poor man and his wife'
were risen again from their knees, we observed he
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observed
by her motion that she was greatly affected with what
he said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying
her hand to her breast, and such other postures as
usually express the greatest seriousness and attention.
This continued about half a quarter of an hour, anc
then they walked away too; so that we could see no
more of them in that situation."
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman
and first I told him, I was glad to see the particulars
we had both been witnesses to; that though I was
hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began
to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man
and his wife, however ignorant they both might De ,
-vid 1 hoped such a beginning would have vet a mora
happy end: "And wno knows," said I, ** but these
two may in time, by instruction and example, work
upon some of the others?" " some of them !" said he,
turning quick upon me, " ay, upon all of them; de-
pend upon it, if those two savages (for he has been
but little better as you relate it) should embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all
the rest; for true religion is naturally communicative,
and he that is once made a Christian will never leave
a Pagan behind him if he canjhelp it." I owned it
was a most Christian principle to thins so, and a tes-
timony of a true zeal, as well as a generous heart in
him. *" But, my friend," said I, " will you give me
liberty to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how
to object the least thing against that affectionate con-
cern which you shew for the turning the poor people
from their Paganism to the Christian religion; but
how does this comfort you, while these poople are, in
your account, out of the pale of the Catholic church,
without which, you believe, there is no salvation; so
that you esteem these but heretics still; and, for other
reasons, as effectually lost as the Pagans thomsejves?"
To this he answered with abundance of candour
and Christian charity, thus: "Sir, I am a Catholic
of the Roman church, and a priest of the o*der of St
Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Ro-
man faith. But yet, if you will believe me, and this
1 do not spoak in compliment to you, or in respect
to my circumstances and your civilities; I say never-
theless I do not look upon you, who call yourselvei
reformed, without some charity; I dare not say, though
I know it is our opinion in general, yet I dare not
say, that you cannot be saved; I will by no means
limit the mercy of Christ, so far as to think that he
cannot receive you into the bosom of his church, in a
manner to us imperceivable, and which it is impossi-
ble for us to know; and I hope you have the same
charity for us. I pray daily for your being all restored
to Christ's'church, by whatsoever methods he who
hi all-wise, it pleased to direct In the mean time,
sure you will allow it to consist with me, as a Ro»nan,
to distinguish far between a Prrtestant and a Pagan,
between him that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a
way which I do not think is according to the true
faith ; and a savage, a barbarian, that knows no God,
no Christ, no Redeemer at all; and if you are no*
within the pale of the Catholic church, we hope yo»
are nearer being restored to it than those that know
nothing at all of God or his church. I rejoice, there-
fore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has
been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel down
and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did, though
not fully enlightened; believing that God, from whom
every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his
heart and bring him to the further knowedge of the
truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this'
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage'
his wife, I can never believe that he shall be cast
away himself; and have I not reason then to rejoice,
the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ,
though they may not be brought quite home into the
bosom of the Catholic church, just at the time when
I may desire it; leaving it to the goodness of Christ
to perfect his work in his own time, and his own way?
Certainly 1 would rejoice if all the savages in America
were brought, like this poor woman,, to pray to God,
though they were to be all Protestants at first, rather
than they should continue pagans and heathens; firm-
ly believing, that He who had bestowed that first light
upon them, would farther illuminate them with a beam
of his heavenly grace and bring them into the pale of
his church, when he should see good."
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning; and it presently occured to
my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal we
might be all Catholic Christians, whatever church or
particular profession we v/ere joined to, or joined in ,
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into
right principles; and in a word as he thought that
me like charity would make us all Catholics, as I told
aim, I believed had all the members of his church the
like moderation they would soon be all Protestants;
and there we left that part, for we never disputed at
all.
However, I talked to him another way; and tak-
ing him by the hand, "My friend," said I, "I wish
all the clergy of the Roman church were blessed with
such moderation, and an equal share of your charity
I am entirely of your opinion; but I must tell you,
that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or
Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition."
"It may be so," said he; "I know not what they
might do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say they
would be the better Christians for that severity ; for I
am sure there is no heresy in too much charity."
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our
business there was over; so we went back our own
way and when we came back we found them wait-
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my cler-
gyman if we should discover to him that we had seen,
him uuder the bush, or no; and it was his opinion
we should not; but that we should talk to him first,
and hear what he would say to us: so we called him
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves ;and
I began with him thus:
"Will Atkins," said I, " pr'ythee what education
had you? What was your father?"
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my
fatner was a clergyman.
What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like
a beast as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says, " He that despiseth
itproof is brutish."
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered
tny father; for God's sake, Sir, talk no more about
that, Sir; I murdered my poor father.
Priest. Ha? a murderer?
11T
'Here the priest started (for I interpreted ever?
word as he spoke it), and looked pale; it seems
he believed that Will had really killed his own
father.
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so,
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill youi
'ather, did you, with your own hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I cut
the thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days:
I broke nis heart jy the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most tender, affectionate treatment that
ever father gave, or child could receive.
R. C. Well, T did not ask you about your father
to extort this confession: I pray God give you repent-
ance for it, and forgive you that and all your other
sins; but I asked you, because I see that, though you
have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as
some are in things that are good ; that you have known
more of religion a great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the confes-
sion that I make about my father, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives,
rhe sins against our indulgent parents are certainly
the first that touch us; the wounds they make lie
deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensible for me,
Atkins; I cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, I
may say every tree in this island, is witness to the
anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and base usage
of a good tender father; a father much like yours by
your description; and I murdered my father as well
ts you, Will Atkins; but think for all that, my re-
pentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.
[I would have said more, if I could have restrained
my passions; but I thought this poor man's
repentance was so much sincerer than mine
that 1 was going to leave off the discourse am
retire, for I was surprised with what lie said,
and thought, that, instead of my going about to
leach and instruct him, the man was made*
teacher and instructor to me, in a most sur-
prising and unexpected manner.]
I laid all this before the young clergyman who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I not
say, Sir, that when this man was converted he would
preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one man be
made a true penitent, here will be no need of me, he
will make Christians of all in the island." But hav-
ing a little composed myself I renewed my discourse
with Will Atkins.
"But, Will," said I, " how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now?"
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that. h3t«
struck a dart through my very soul; .1 have l*een talk-
ing about God and religion to my wife, in order, ai
voir directed me, to make a Christian of her; and slw
has preached such a sermon to me as 1 shall nevei
forget while I live.
R. C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious arguments
to her, conscience has flung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as is not to be re-
Risted.
R. C. Pray Will, let us know what passed between
you and your wife; for I know something of it al-
ready.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac-
count of it : I am too full to hold it, and yet have nc
tongue to express it: but let her have said what she
will, and though I cannot give you an account of it,
this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and
reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin.
Will ? for this has be,en an extraordinary case, that is
certain; she has preached a sermon indeed, if she hai
wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our raws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men
and women were obliged to enter into such compact*
as it was neither in the power of one or other to oieak;
that otherwise, order and justice could not be main-
tained, and men would run from their wives and
abandon their children, mix confusedly with one an-
other, and neither families be kept entire, or inherit
ances be settled by a legal descent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you
make her understand what you meant by inheritance
and families? They know no such thing among the
savages, but marry any how, without any regard to
relation, consanguinity, or family; brother and sister,
nay, as I have been told, even the farther and daugh-
ter, and the son and the mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed ;—my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor
it. Perhaps for any further relations they may not be
so exact as we are; but she tells me they never touch
one another in the near relations you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A. She said she liked it very well; and it was
much better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I ask-
ed her, if she would be married to me our way? Sh«
asked me, what way that was? I void her marriage was
appointed of God; and here we had a strange talk to-
gether indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe.
[N. B. This dialogue detween W. Atkins and his
wife, as I took it down in writing just after he.
told it me, was as follows:]
Wife.. Appointed by your God .' Why, have you a
God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear; God is in every country.
Wife. No, your God in my country; my coumry
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you who God
is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and tn«
earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makee de
earth ; no make my country.
[W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God
not making hercountry.]
Wife. No laugh: why laugh me? This no ting tt
augh.
[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she wa«
more serious than he at first.]
W. A. That'strue, indeed; 1 will not laugh any
more my dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world,
and you, and me, and all things; for he is the only
true God; there is no God but he; he lives for ever in
heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago,
W. A. That'strue, indeed ; but 1 have been a wick-
ed wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint
thee with any thing before, but have lived without
God in the world myself.
Wife. Wrhat have you de great God in your coun-
try, you no know him ? No say O to bun ? No do good
ting for him? That no impossible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that: we live as
if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no
Dower on earth.
Wife. But why God let you do so? Why he n*
makee you good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault.
Wife. But you say me he is great, much great, have
much great power; can make kill when he will: why
he no makee kill when you no serve him? no say G
to him ? no be good mans?
W. A. That'is true; he might sirike me dead, and
I ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked wretch,
that is true: but God is merciful, and does not deai
with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then do you not tell God tankee for thai
too?
W. A. No indeed; I have not thanked God for hi*
mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no tink, believe
he be such one, great much power, strong; no makee
kill you, though you makee him much angry?
"W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you from
believing in God! What a dreadful creature am t I
And what a dad truth is it, that the horrid lives of
Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God up
i here, (she points up io heaven) and yet no do well,
no do good ting ? can he tell? Sure he no tell wh*l
you do.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.
Wife. What he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great powei
strong?
W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say fot it;
and this proves him to be the true God; he is God4
and not man; and therefore we are not consumed,
[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with hor-
ror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
tnoughts of the heart, and all that we do; and
yet that he had dared to do all the vile things
he had done.]
Wife. Merciful what you call dat?
W. A. He is our father and maker; and he pities
and spares us.
Wile, oj then he never makee kill, never angry
when y6u do wicked; then he no good himself, or°i:o
urent able.
W A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is infinitely good.
Mid infinitely great and able to punish too ; and some-
times, to shew his justice and vengeance, he lets fly
Ins anger to destroy sinners and make examples;
many arCcut off in their sins.
Wife. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you,
may be, that he no makee you kill, so you make de
bargain with him, you do bad ting, he no be angry at
you, when he be angry at other mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions
upon his goodness; and he would be infinitely just il
he destroyed me as he has done other men.
Wife. Well and yet no kill, no makee you dead .'
What you say to him for that? You no tell him tankee
for all that too I
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better /
You say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world; 'tis
I have deformed myself, and abused his goodness, and
have made myself an abominable wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no
makee him angry; I no do bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him,
to hear a poor, untaught creature desire to be
taught to know God, and he such a picked
wretch that he could not say one word to her
about God, but what the reproach of his own
carriage would make most irrational to her to
believe; nay, that already she could not believe
in God because he that was so wicked was not
destroyed.]
W. A. My dear you mean you wish I could teach
you*to know God, not God to know you, for he
knows you already, and every thought in your heart
Wife. Why then he knows what I say to you now;
he know me wish to know him; how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I canno*
teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee tokupv
him; and to forgive me tnat I am unwoithy to teatk
Ihee.
[The pooi fellow was in such an agony at her de-
siring him to make her know God, and her
wishing to know him, that he said ho fell down
on his knees before her, and prayed to God to
enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge
of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins and a-:
ceptof his being the unworthy instrument of
instructing her in the principles of religion
after which he sat down by her again, and their
dialogue went on.]
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel
down and lift up his hands.
Wife. What you put down the knee for? What you
hold up the hand for? What you say.? Who you sneak
to ? What is that? J *
W. A. My dear 1 bow my knees in token of my
submission to Him that made me : I said 0 to him, as
you call it, and as you say your old men do to their
idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife. What you say O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and youi
understanding, that you may know him, and be ac-
cepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wife. But he no hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro.
mised to bear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How !ae
bid you ?. What you hear him speak r
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he haj
Ipvealed himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her under
stand that God had revealed himself to us by
his word; and what his word was; but at last
he told it her thus :]
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in tormer
•lays, even from heaven, by plain words; and God
nas inspired good men by his Spirit; and they have
written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. Me no understand that: where is book?
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this
book; but 1 hope I shall, one time or other, get it for
you to read it.
]Here he embraced her with great affeetion ,• but
with inexpressible grief, that he had not *
Bible]
Wife. But how you makee me know that God
teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to he
God.
Wife. What rule? what way you know?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy;
and because he forbids, and,commands us to avoid,
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
consequences.
Wife. That me would,understand, that me fain see,
if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked thing,
he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked thing, ho
makee all thing, he give all thing; he hear me when I
say O to him, as you go to do just now; he makee
me good if I wish be good; he spare me, no makee
kill me when I no be good; all this you say he do:
yes, he be great God; me take, think, believe him be
great God; me say O to him too with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but, raising her up, made her kneel by him ; and he
prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge
of himself by his Spirit; and that by some good pro-
vidence, if possible, she might some time or other
come to have a Bible, that she might read the word of
God, and be taught by him to know him.
[This was the time that we saw him lift her up by
tho han 1, and saw him kneel down by her, a*
above.]
They had several other discourses, it seems, aftei
this, too long to set down here; and particularly she
made him promise, that, since he confessed his own
life had been a wicked, abominable course of provo-
cation against God, he would reform it, and not make
God angry any more, lest he should make him dead,
as she called it, and then she should be left alone, and
never be taught to know this God better; and lest he
should be miserable, as he told her wicked men should
beaftcr death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to m
both, but particularly the young clergymen; he was
indeed wonderfully surprised with it; but under the
greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to
her; that he could not speak English to make her un-
derstand him ; and as she spoke but very broken Eng-
lish he could not understand her. However,heturnen
himself to me, and told me, that he believed there
must be more to do with this woman than to marry
her. I did not understand him at first, but at length
he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be bap-
tized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was foj
going about it presently: "No, no, hold, Sir," said
he ; "though I would have her baptized by all means,
yet I must observe, that Will Atkins, her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to bo
willing to embrace a religious life; and has given her
just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, jus-
tice, and mercy; yet I desire to know of him, if he
has said" any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the
salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith in him,
and the redemption by him ; of the Holy Spirit, th«
resurrection, the last judgment, and a future state/
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him: but ih<
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he
had said something to her of all those things, but thai
he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid, ungodlv
mfe, that he trembled at the apprehensions; thai he*
knowledge of him should lessen the attention sne
should give to those things, and make her rather con-
temn religion that receive it: but he was assured, hs
said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due im-
pressions of all those things, that, if I would but dis-
course with her, she would make it appear to my sa-
tisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as
interpreter between my religious priest and the woman
I entreated him ft: begin with her. But sure such a
termon was never preached by a popish priest in these
latter ages of the world; and, as 1 told him, I thought
he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity
of a Christian, without the errorc of a Roman Catho-
lic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the
Roman bishops were before the church of Rome as-
sumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences ol
men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him,
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she di'i
the first notions cf a God, but with joy and faith, with
an affection and a surprising degree of understanding,
scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed; and
at her own request she was baptised.
When ho was preparing to baptise her, I entreated
lim, that he would perform that office with some cau-
tion, that the man might not perceive he was of the
Roman church, if possible; because of other ill con-
sequences which might attend a difference among us in
that very religion which we weie instructing the°other
in. He told me, that as he had , m consecrated chapel,
nor proper things for the office, 1 should see he would
do ft in amanner that I should not know by it that he
was a Roman Catholic himself if I had not known it
before and so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not under-
stand, he poured a whole dishful of water upon the
woman's head, pronouncing in French very loud,
Mary (which was the name her husband desired me
to give ner, for I was her godfather.) / baptise the*
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of th§
Holy Ghost; so that none could know any thing by
it what religion he was of: he gave the benediction
afterwards in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not
know but it was in French, or else did not take notice
of it at that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will
Atkins, a'wd in a very affectionate manner exhorted
him not only to persevere in that good disposition he
was in, but to support the convictions that were upon
him by a resolution to reform his life; told him it waj
"n vain to say he repented if he did not forsake hi*
crimes; represented to him, ho.v God had honoured
lim with being the instrument of bringing his wife tc
the knowledge of the Christian religion; and that he
should be careful he did not dishonour the grace o/
God; and that if he did, he would see the heathen a
better christian than himself; the savage converted,
and the instrument cast away!
He said a great many good things to them both, and
then recommended them, in a few words, to God1*
goodness; gave them the benediction again, I repeat-
ing every thing to them in English: and thus ended
the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant, agree-
able day to me that ever I passed in my whole life.
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thought:
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty
seven savages, and fain he would have staid upon tiit
island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him
first, that his undertaking was impracticable in itself,
and secondly, that, perhaps I could put it into a way
of being done in his absence, to his satisfaction; o!
*-hich by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board tho
ship, when the young man, whom I had taken outol
the famished ship's company, came to me, and told
/ne. he understood 1 had a clergyman with me, and
that 1 had caused the Englishmen to be married to Uie
savages whom they called wives : that he had a match
too, v^hich he desired m»pht be finished before I went,
between two Christians, which he hoped would nol
be disagreeable to me.
1 knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other Christ an
woman on the island. So I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because ho
found himself in this solitary circumstance. I repre-
sented that he had some considerable substance in the
world, and good friends, as 1 understood by himself,
and by his maid also; that the maid was not only
poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she be-
ing twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and he not
ttbove seventeen or eighteen; that he might very pro-
bably, with my assistance, make a remove from this
wilderness, and come into his own country again, and
that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
.epeni his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to
;ay more, but he interrupted me smiling; and told
me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in
toy guesses; that he had nothing of that kind in h\s
thoughts, his present circumstances being me'ancholy
and disconsolate enough; and he was very glad to
near that I had some thoughts of putting them in a
way to see their own country again ; and that nothing
should have set him upon staying there, but that the
voyage I was going was so exceeding long and hazairt
ous, and would carry him quite out of the reach of all
his friends that he had nothing to desire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property of the
island where he was ; give him a servant or two, and
some few necessaries, and he would settle himself here
like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I
returned to England, I would redeem him, and lipped
[ would not be unmindful of him when I cauTe to
England; that he would give me some letters to hia
friends in London, to It i them know how good I bail

been to him, and what part of the world, and who*
circumstances 1 had left him in; and he promised me,
that whenever I redeemed him,the plantation, and ill
the improvements he had made upon it, let the value
be what it would, should be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, consider-
ing his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, be-
cause he told me positively the match was not for him-
self. 1 gave him all possible assurances, that,if I lived
'to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters,
and to do his business effectually,and that he might de-
pend I would never forget the circumstances I left
him in. But still I was impatient to know who was
the person to be married; upon which he told me it
was my Jack of all trades and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the
match; for indeed I had thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given already ; and as
'or the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober,
and religious young woman; had a very good share
of sense; was agreeable enough in her person; spok^
very handsomely, and to the purpose; always with
decency and good manners, and r*>t backward to
speak when any thing required it, or impertinently
forward to speak when it was not her husiness; very
handy and housewifely in any thing that was beforu
her ; an excllent manager, and fit indeed to have been
governess to the whole island; she knew very well
how to behave herself to all kind of folks she had
about her, and to better if she had found any there.]
I The match being proposed in this manner, we mar-
lied them the same day : and as I was father at th«
altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave hei
a portion, for f appointed her and her husband a
.hfxndsome large space of ground for their plantation;
and indeed this match, and the proposal the young
'gentleman made to ivfe, to give him a small property
in the island, put me upon parcelling it out among
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about
tneir situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious, and as far as I may be allow-
ed to speak positively in such a case, I verily believe
was a true sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to every
one's satisfaction, that they only desired one general
writing jndermy hand for the whole, which I caused
to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting
out the bounds and situation of every man's planta-
tion, and testifying that I gave them thereby, severally,
a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improve-
ments, to them and their heirs; reserving all the rest
of the island as my own property, and a certain renf
for every particular plantation after eleven years, if i
or any one from me, or in my name, came to demano

\s to the government and laws among them, 1 told
th«m, I was not capable of giving them belter rules
than they were able to give themselves; only made
them promise, me to live in love and good neighbour-
hood with one another: and so I prepared to leave
them. . ...
One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook o1
the island, independent, and indeed unemployed ; for
excepting the providing themselves food, which they
bad difficulty enough in doing sometimes, they had i.o
manner of business or property to manage: I proposed
therefore to the governor Spaniard, that he should go
to them with Friday's father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them
fntft their several families as servants, tobe maintained
foWheir labour, hut. without being absolute slaves, foi
I would not admit them to make them slaves by force
fcy any means, because they had their liberty given l>j
capitulation, and as it were articles of surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him, so we allotted
them land and plantations which three or four accept-
ed of, but all the rest chose to be employed as servants
in the several families-we had settled; and thus my
colony was in a manner settled as follows: The
Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which whs
thecapitalcity,and extended their plantation all along
the side of the brook which .made the creek thai I
have so often described, as far as my bower; and as
they increased their culture, it went always eastward..
The English lived in the north-east part, where Will
Atkins and his comrades began, and came on south-
ward and south-west, towards the back part of the
Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addition
of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of room.
All the west end of the island was left uninhabited,
that, if any of the(savages should come on shore there,
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody
would disturb them; and no doubt but they were
often ashore, and went away again, for I never heard
that the planters were ever attacked and disturbed
any more.
It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to
my friend the clergymen that the work of converting
the savages might perhaps be set on foot in his ab-
sence to his satisfaction ; and I told him, that now I
thought it was hut in a fair way, for the savages be-
ing thus divided among the Christians if they would
but every one of them do their part with those which
came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very
good effect.
He agreed presently in that; " if," said he, " they
will do their part; but how," says lie, " shall we ob-
tain that of them?" I told him we would call them all
together, and leave it in (,hanje with them, or go to
Ihem one by one, which he thought best; so we di
vided it—he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all
Papists, and I to the English, who were all Protes-
tants; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and
made them promise that they wpuld never make any
distinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting
the savages to turn Christians, but teach them thega-
eral knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour
Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes one
with another about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house, (I may call
it so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work,
[ believe was not standing in the world again !)
say, when I came thither I found the young woman
I have mentioned above, and William "Atkins's wife,
were become intimates; and this prudent and religi
ous young woman had perfected the work Will At-
kins had begun; and though it was not above four
days after what I have related, yet the new-baptised
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observalion
or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind in the morning, before
I went to them, that among all the needful things I
had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible: in
which I shewed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent
me the cargo of 100/. from Lisbon, where she packed
up three Bibles and a Prayer-book. However, the
good woman's charity had a greater extent than ever
ane imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort
and instruction of those that made much better use
»1 them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket; and when
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found
the young woman and Atkins's baptised wife had
been discoursing of religion together (for William
Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy.) I asked
121
if they were together now? And lie said yes; §o 1
went into the house, and he with n>c, and we found
them together, very earnest in discourse :'" O Sir,"
says William Atkins, " when God lias sinners to re-
concile to himself, and aliens to bring home he never
wants a messenger: my wife has got a new instruc-
tor—I knew I was unworthy, as 1 was incapable of
that work—that young woman has heen scut hither
from Heaven—sheisenough to convert a whole island
of savages." The young woman hlushed, and rose
up to go away, hut I desired her 10 sit still; I told
her she had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped
God would hless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had
any book among them, though I did not ask, but I
put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
"Here," said I to Atkins, "I have brought you an
assistant, that perhaps you had not before." The man
was so confounded, that he was not able to speak for
some time; but recovering himself, he takes it with
both hands, and turning to his wife, " Here my dear,"
says he, did not I tell you our God, though he lives
above, could hear what we said? here is the book 1
prayed for when you and I kneeled down under the
bush; now God has heard us and sent it." When he
had said thus, the man fell in such transports of a pas-
sionate joy, that between the joy of having it, and
giving God thanks for it, the tears run down his face
like a child that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of; for
she firmly believed God, had sent the book upon her
husband's petition: it is true that providentially it
was so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense;
but I believed it would have been no difficult mattei
t*t that time to have persuaded the poor woman to
have believed that an express messenger came from
Heaven on purpose to bring that individual book; but
it was too seriojs a matter to suffer any delusion to
take place: so I turned to the young woman, and
told her we did not desire to impose upon tne new
convert in her first and more ignorant understanding
-of things, and begged her to explain to her that God
may be veiy properly said to answer our petitions,
when in the course o/ nis providence such things are
:* a particular mannei Drought to pass as we petition-
ed for; but we do not expect returns from Heaven in
a miraculous and particular manner; and that it is
cur mercy it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually *,
so that there was I assure you, no priestcraft used
nere; and I should have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so; but
the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to
oe expressed; and there we may be sure was no de-
tusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the
world for any thing of its kind than he was for this
tie; and I believe never any man was glad of a
le from a better principle; and though he had been
>4 most profligate creature, desperate, headstrong, out-
rageous, furious, and wicked to a great degree, yei
'iiis man is a standing rule to us all for the well in-
structing children, viz. that parents should never giv«
>ver to teach and instruct, or ever dispair of the suc-
cess of their endeavours, let the children be ever so
obstinate, refractory, or to appearance insensible of
instruction; for if ever God in his providence touchei
the consciences of such, the force of their education
returns upon them, and the early instruction of parents
is not lost, though it may have been many years laid
asleep, but some time or other they may find the
benefit of it.
Thus it was with this poor man. However igno-
rant he was, or divested of religion and Christian
knowledge, he found ne had some to do with now
more ignorant than himself; and that the least pari
of the instruction of his good father that could now
come to his mind was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible
'value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to
, nations, families,and persons; but he never entertain-
ed the least notion of the worth of it till now, when
being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he
wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also for the
present occasion, though she had one, and so had the
youth, on board our ship among the goods which
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having said
eo many things of this young woman, I cannot omi
telling one story more of her and myself, which has
someting in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young
woman was reduced; how her mistress was starved
to death, and did die on board that unhappy ship we
met at sea; and how the whole ship's company being
reduced to the last extremity, th<* gentlewoman and
her son, and this maid, were firat hardly used as to
provisions, and.at last totally neglected and starved;
that is to say brought to the last extremity of hunger.
One day being discoursing with her upon the ex-
tremeties they suffered, I asked her if she could de-
scribe by what she felt what it was to starve, and how
it appeared ? She told me she believed she could, and
she told her tale very distincly thus:
"First, Sir," said she, "we had for some day*
fared exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger,
but now at last we were wholly without food of any
kind except sugar, and a little wine, and a little water.
The first day after I had received no food at all, I
found myself towards evening, first empty and sickish
at my stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined to
yawning, and sleepy; I lay down on a couch in tho
great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and
awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine
when I lay down. After being about three hour9
awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I
found myself empty, and my stomach sickish again,
and lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being
*ery faint and ill; and thus I continued all the second,
day with a strange variet£—first hungry, then sick
again, with retchings to vomit. The second night,
being obliged to go to bed again without any food
more than a draught of fair water, and being asleep,
I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market
was mightily stocked with provisions, that I bought
some for my mistress, and went and dined very hear-
tily.
"I thought my stomach was full after this, as it
would have been after or at a good dinner; but when
1 waked, 1 was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find
myself in the extremity of famine; the last glass of
wine we had I drank, and put sugar into it, because
of its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but
there being no substance in the stomach for the di-
gesting office to work upon, I found the only effect of
the wine was to raise disagreeable fum#s from the
stomach into the head: and I lay as they told me,
stupid and senseless as one drunk for some time.
44 The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious
with hunger ; and I question, had not my understand-
ing returned and conquered it, I say, I question whe-
ther, if I had been a mother, and had had a little
child with me, its life would have been safe or no.
44 This lasted about three hours, during which time
T was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam
as my young master told me, and as he can now in
form you.
44 In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, whe-
ther by the motion of the ship or some slip of mv foot
I know not, I fell down, and struck my face against
the corner of a pallet-bed in which my mistress lay,
and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose,
and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat
down and bled into it a great deal, and as the htood
ran from me I came to myselY, and the violcnjf <U
the flame or the fevr I was in abated, and so diKhe
ravenous part of the hunger
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE-.
"Then I grew sick, and retcned to vomit, D t'
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring
up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and they
all believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon ,
after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my, sto-!
mach, not to be described, not like the cholic, but a
gnawing eager pain for food, and towards night it
went off with a kind of earnest craving or longing
for food, something like, as I suppose the longing of
a woman with child. I took another draught of water
with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed the sugar,
and brought it all up again ; then 1 took a draught ol
water without sugar, and that stayed with me, and )
laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily
that it would .please God to take me away; and com-
posing my mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awile;
and then waking, thought myself dying, being light
with vapours from an empty stomach: 1 recommend-
ed my soul to God, and earnestly wished that some-
body would throw me into the sea.
"All this while my mistress lay by me just, as I
thought, expiring, but bore it with much more pati-
ence than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had to
herchild, my young master, who would not have taken
it, but she oblfged him to eat it and I believeit saved
his' life. >
u Towards the morning I slept again, and first
when I awaked I fell into a violent passion of cry-
ing, and after that had a second fit of violent hunger,
so that 1 got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful
condition. Had my mistress been dead, so much as 1
loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a piece
of her flesh with as much relish and as unconcerned
as ever I did the flesh of any creature appointed for
food and once or twice T was going to bite my own
arm. At last 1 saw the basin in which was the blood
I had bled at my nose the day before; I ran to it,
and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy
appetite, as if I had wondered nobody had taken it
before, and afraid it should he taken from me now.
"Though after it was down the tnougnts of it filled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and
I drank a draught of fair water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after it. This was the
fourth day; and thus I held it till towards night, when,
within the compass of three hours, I had all these se-
veral circumstances over again, one after another,
v«*. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach,
then ravenous again, then sick again, then lunatic,
then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter
of an hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly. At
night I laid me down, having no comfort but in the
hope that I should die before morning.
All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was
now turned into a disease, and I had a terrible colic
and griping, wind instead of food having fouini its
way into i*y bowels; and in this condition I lay tilj
morning, when I was surprised a little with the cries
and lamentations of my young master who called out
to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up
a little for I had not strength to rise, but found she
was not dead, though she was able to give very little
signs of life.
"I had then such convulsions in my stomach for
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them,
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that
nothing but the tortutes of death can imitate; and this
condition I was in when I heard the seamen above
cry out« A sail! a sail !' and halloo and jump about
rs if they were distractcg\
"I was not able to get off from the bed, and my
mistress much less, and my master was so sick that 1
thought he had been expiring; so we could not open
the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that
occasioned such a combustion; nor had we any cot>
vesration with the ship's company for two (.ays, they
having told us they had not a mouthful of any thing
toMk in the ship; and they told us afterwards they
thH|ht we had been dead.
"It was this dreadful condition we wer* in whon
you were sent to save our lives; and how you found
us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death as I confess I never met
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me $ I am
the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, be-
cause the youth gave me an account of a good part of
it, though I must own not so distinct and so feelingly
as his maid, and the rather because it seeme his mo-
ther fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor
maid, though her constitution being stronger than that
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly wo-
man too, she might struggle harder with it 5 1 say,
the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extre-
mity something sooner than her mistress, who might
be allowed to keep the last bits something longer than
she parted with any to relieve the maid. No ques-
tion, as the case is here related, if our ship, or some
other, had not so providentially met them, a few days
more would have ended all their lives, unles? they had
prevented it by eating one another; and even tKat, as
their case stood, would have served them but a little
while, they being five hundred leagues from any land,
or any possibility of relief, other than in the miracu-
lous manner it happened.—But this is by the way ; I
return to my disposition of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any thing
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought oi
setting up among them; for I found, at least at my
first coming, such seeds of division among them, chat
1 saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it
among them they would upon very slight disgust, have
separated, and gone away from one another; or per-
haps have turned pirates, and so made the island a
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and
religious people, as 1 intended it to be; nor did I leave
the two pieces of brass cannon, that I had or board,
or the two quarter-deck guns, that my nephew took
extraordinary, for the same reason: I thought the?
nad enough to qualify them for a defensive war, against
any that should invade them; but I was not to sal
them up for an offensive war, or to encourage them
to go abroad to attack others, which, in the end, would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and
all their undertakings: I reserved the sloop, there-
fore, and the guns, for their seivice another \w»y, as!
shall observe in its place.
I have now done with the island ; I left them all in
good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition,
and went on board my ship again the fifth day of
May, having been five-and-twenty days among them;
and, as they were all resolved to stay upon the island
till I came to remove them, I promised to send some
further relief from the Brasils, if I could possibly find
an opportunity; and particularly I promised to send
them some catttle ; such as sheep, hogs, and cows; for
as to the two cows and calves which I brought from
England, we had been obliged, by the length of dfcr
voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed
them.
The next day giving them a salute of five guns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All
Saints, in the Brasils, in about twenty-two days: meet-
ing nothing remarkable in our passage but this, that
about three days after we sailed, being becalmed, and
the current setting strong to the N. N. E. running,
as it were, into a ^ay or gulf on the land side1, we
were driven something out of our course; and once
or twice our men cried Land, to the westward; but
whether it was the continent, or islands, we could
not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth
tnd the weather calm, we saw the sea as it were, co-
vered towards the land, with something very black,
not being able to discover what it was; but, after
6ome time, our chief mate going up the main shrouds
d little way and looking at them with a perspective,
cried out it was an army. I cod d not imagine what
be meapt bv an army, and spoke a little hastily, call-
123
ing tho fellow a fool, or some such word: "Nay
Sir," says he, "don't be angry, for it is an army,
and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand
canoes, and you may see them paddle along, and
they are coming towards us two apace, and full
of men."
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so
was my nephew the captain; for he had heard
such terrible stories of them in the island, and
having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it, but said two or
three times, we should all be devoured. I must
confess, considering we were becalmed, and the
current set strong toward the shore, I liked it the
worse; however, I bade him not be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor, as soon as we came
so near as to know that we must engage them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
I told them they had nothing to fear from them
but fire: and therefore they should get their boats
out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and
the other by the stern, and man them both well
and wait the issue in that posture; this I did, that
the men in the boats might be ready, with sheet
and buckets, to put out any fire these savages
might endeavour to fix upon the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight
Been by Christians: my mate was much mistaken in his
calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand ca-
noes: the most wo could make of them when they came
up, being about 126; and a great many of them too; for
some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them,
some more, and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight
which they had doubtless never seen before; nor
could they, at first, as wo afterwards understood, know
what to make of us. They came boldly up, however,
rery near to l»s, and seemed to go about to tow round
us; but we called to our men in the boats, not to lei
them come too near tehm.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six cf theii
large canoes came so near our long-boat, that oui
men beckoned with their hands to them to keep back;
which they understood very well, and went back; but
at their retreat about 500 arrows came on board us
from those boats; and one of our men in the long-
boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some deal boards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence,
like waist board to cover them 'from the arrows oi
the savages, if they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in
a body astern of us, and pretty near, so near that we
could easily discern what they were, though we could
•not tell their design. I easily found they were some
of my old friends, the same sort of savages that 1
had been used to engage with; and in a little time
more they rowed pomewhat farther out to sea, till they
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed
down straight upon us, till they came so near, that
they could hear us speak. Upon this I ordered all
my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any more
arrows, ?nd make all our guns ready; but being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call aloud to them in his lan-
guage, to know what they meant: which accordingly
he did : whether they understood him or not, that 1
know not; but as soon as he had called to them, six
of them, who were in the foremost, or nighest boat
to us, turned their canoes from us; and, stooping
down shewed us their naked backsides; just as if,
in English (saving your presence), the had bid m
kiss . Whether this was a defiance or chal-
lenge, we knew not; or whether it was done in mera
oo*tempt, or a signal to ^he rest but immediately
Friday cried out, they were going to shoot; a*. * -
happily for him (poor fellow !) they let fly about tr..
hundred of their arrows; and, to my inexpressible
grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The Door fellow was shot with no less than
three arrows, and about three more fell very nigh
ffim; such unlucky marksmen they were!
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with
small shot, and four with great; and gave them such a
broadside as they had never had in their lives before,
to be sure.
They were not above half a cable's length off when
we fired and our gunners took their aim so well, that
three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had
reason to believe, by one shot only.
Tho ill manners of turning up their bare backsides
to us, gave us no great offence; neither did I know
for certain whether that, which would pass for the
greatest contempt among us, might be understood so
by them or not; therefore in return, I had only re-
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder
only, which I knew would fright them sufficiently;
but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially as they had killed my
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved ar.d valued,
and who, indeed, so well deserved it; I not only had
been justified before God and man, but would nave
been very glad, if I could to have overset every canoe
there and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed or how many
we wounded at this broadside; but sure such a fright
and hurry never was seen among such a multitude;
there was thiiteen or fourteen of their canoes split
and overset, in all; and the men all seta-swimming,
the rest, frighted out of their wits, scoured away an
fast as they could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; soi
innnose that they were m<*nv of them lost; and oua
men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life,
above ah hour after they were all gone.
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many; but, in short, we never knew
any thing how it went with them; for they fled so fast,
that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see
above three or four straggling canoes: nor did we ever
see the rest any more; for a breeze of wind springing
up the same evening, we weighed and set sail for the
Brasils.
"We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so
sullen, that he would neither ea-t nor speak; and we
all fancied he would starve himself to death; but I
took a way to cure him; for I made them take him,
and turn him into the long-boat, and make him believe
they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave
him where they found him, if he would not speak;
nor would that do, but they really did throw him into
the sea, and came away from him; and then he fol-
lowed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to
Ihem in his tongue, though they knew not one word of
what he said. However, at last, they took him in
ixgain and then he began to be more tractable; noi
ilid I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again ; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man Fri-
day, and would have been very glad to have gone
back to the island, to have taken one the rest from
thence for my occasion, but it could not be: so we
went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said; and
»t was along while before I could make him tinder
stand any thing; but in time, our men taught him
some English, and he began to be a little tractable:
afterwards we inquired what country he came from,
but could make nothing of what he said; for his
speech was so odd, all gutterals, and spoken in the
throat, in such a hollow and odd manner, thai we
could never form a word from him; and we wflk all
if opinion that they might speak that language a^vell
if they were gagged, as otherwise; ncr could we pet

eeive they had any occasion either for teeth,'
tongue, .ips, or palate; but formed their words just as
ayhunting horn forms a tune, with an open tlnoat; he
told us, however, some time after, when we had taught
him to speak a little English, that they were going,
with their kings, to fight a great battle. When he said
kings, we asked him, how many kings? He sai^
there were five nation (we could not make him under
stand the plural s,) and that they all joined to go
against two nation. We asked him, What made them
come up to us? He said, "To, makee te great wonder
look."—Where it is to be observed, that all those na-
tives, as also those of Africa, when they learn English,
they always add two e's at the end of the words where
we use one, and pPace the accent upon the last of
them ; as makce, takee, and the like; and we could
not break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Fri-
day leave it oft", though at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow, once more, I must
take my last leave of him; poor honest Friday! We
buried him with all decency and solemnity possible
by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him into
the sea; and 1 caused them to fire eleven guns for him:
and so ended the life of the most grateful faithful,
honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man
had.
We now went away with a fair wind for Brasil,
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the
north-easternmost land of all that part of America.
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days,
when we made the cape St. Augustine, and in three
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, the
eld place of my deliverance, from whence came both
my good and evil fate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less bu-
siness than I had; and yet it was with great dificulty
that we were admitted to hold the least correspond-
ence on shore. Not my partner himself, who was
alive and made a great figure among them, not nY
two merchant trustees, nor the fame of my wonderftr
preservation in the island, could obtain me that favour:
but my partner remembering that 1 had given five
hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the
Augustines, and three hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prioi
that then was, to go to the governor, and beg leave foi
me presently, with the captain, and one more, besides
eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and
this upon condition absolutely capitulated for, that we
should not offer to land any goods out of the ship, or
to carry *wy person away without license.
They were so strict with us as to landing any goods,
that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore
three bales of English goods, such'as fine broad-cloths,
stuffs and some linen, which I had brought for a pre
cent to my partner.
He was a very generous,broad-hearted man, though
(like me) he came from little at first; and though he
knew not that I had the least design of giving him any
thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provi-
sions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moi-
dores, including some tobacco, and three or four fine
medals in gold. But I was even with him in my pre-
sent, which as I have said, consisted of fine broad-
cloth, English stuffs, lace,'and fine hollands. Also, I
delivered him about the value of 10G7. sterling, in the
same goods, for other uses: and I obliged him to set
up the sloop which I had brought with me from Eng-
land, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in
order to send the refreshments I intended to my plan-
tation.
Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in
a very few days, for she was already framed; and I
have the master of her such instruction as he could
not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an
account from my partner afterwards. I got him soon
"^ " with the small cargo I had sent them; and one
seamen, that had been on shore with me there,
f Wn
offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my
letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficu
ent quantity of land for a plantation ; and giving him
some clothes, and tools for his planting work, which
he said he understood, having been an old planter in
Maryland, and a buccanneer into the bargain.
I encouarged the fellow by granting all he desired;
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage which we
had taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and order-
ed the governor Spaniard to give him his share of
overy thing he wanted, with the rest.
When we came to fit this man out, my old paitner
told me, there was a certain very honest fellow, <*
Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into
the displeasure of the church: "I know not what the
matter is with him," says he, "but on my consci-
ence, I think he is a heretic in his heart; and he has
been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inqui-
sition ;" that he would be very glad of such an oppor-
tunity to make his escape, with his wife and two
daughters; and if I would let them go to the Island,
and allot them a plantation, he would give them a
small stock to begin with; for the officers of the In-
quisition had seized a'i' his effects and estate, and he
had nothing left but a little household stuff, and two
slaves; "And," adds he "though I hate his princi-
ples, yet I would not have him fall into their hands,
for he will assuredly be burnt alive if he does."
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman
with them; and we concealed the man, and his wife
and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put
out to go to sea; and then (having put all their goods
on board the sloop some time before) we put them on
board the sloop, after she was gol out of the bay.
Our seamen was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock, indeed, was much alike, rich
in tools, and in preparations, for a farm; but nothing
to begin with, but as above. However, they carried
over with them (which was worth all the rest) some
materials for olanting; sugar-canes, with some plants of
eanes; which he (1 n.oun the Portugal man) under-
itoori very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in
the island, I sent them by this sloop, three milch cows
and five calves, about twenty-two hogs, among them,
three sows big with pig, two mares, and a stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I en-
gaged three Portugal women to go; and recommended
it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could lave procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor persecuted man had two daughters, and
there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted ; the
rest had wives of their own, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who
were now (with this addition) between sixty and se-
venty people, besides little children; of which there
were a great many; I found letters at London from
them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came buck to
England, being sent back to the Brasils by this sloop*
of which I shall take some notice in its place.

of discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest of
wiy memorandums, would do well to turn his thoughts
entirely from it, and expect to read only of the folies

less by those of other men to beware of the like. »ot

1 had no more business to go to the East Indies,
*.han a man at full liberty, and having committed no
crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire
.lim to lock hiiM up amoug the prisoners there, and
starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from England,
and gone directly to the island : had I loaded her, as 1
did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for tfaa
125
plantation, and for my people; took a patent frow> the
government here, to have secured my property, ic
subjection only to that of England, which, to be sure,
I might have obtained; had I carried over cannon and
ammunition, servants, and people to plant, and, tak-
ing possession of the place, fortified and strengthened
it in the name of England, and increased it with peo
pie, as I might easily have done; had I then settled
myself there, and sent the ship back, loaded with good
rice, as I might also have done in six months time,
and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again
for our supply; had I done this, and staid there my.
self, I had, at least, acted like a man of common
sense; but I was possessed with a wanderjng spirit,
scorned all advantages, pleased myself with being the
patron of these people I had placed there, and doing
for them in a kind of haughty majestic way, like an
old patriarchal monarch; providing for them, as if I
had been father of the whole family, as well as of the
plantation: but I never so much as pretended to plant
in the name of any government or nation, or to ac-
knowledge any prince, or to call my people subjects
to any one nation more than another; nay, I never so
much as gave the place a name ; but left it as I found
it, belonging to no man; and the people under no dis-
cipline or government but my own; who, though I
had an influence over them as father and benefacto*,
had no authority or power to actor command one
way or other, farther than voluntary consent moved
them to comply: yet even this, had I staid there,
would have clone well enough; but as I rambled'from
them, and came thither no more, the last letters I had
from any of them, were by my partner's means, who
iftei wards sent another sloop to the place; and who
sent me word, though I had not the letter till five yean
after it was written, that they went on but poorly,
A"»re malecontent with theirlong stay there; that Will
Atkins was dead; that fivs of the Spaniards were
eome away; and that though they had not been much
molested by the savages, yet thev had had some skir-
mishes with them; that they begged of him to wriu
to me to think of the prx>misc 1 had made to fetc\>
them away, that they might see their own country
again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and they
who will have any more of mc, must be content to
follow me through a new variety of follies, hardships,
and wild adventures; wherein the justice of Provi
dence may be duly observed, and we may see how
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires,
make the strongest of our wishes to be our affliction,
and punish us most severely with those very things
which we think it would be our utmost happiness to
oe allowed in.
Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength oi
his own judgment, as if he was able to choose any
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short-
sighted creature, sees but a very little way before him;
and as his passions are none of his best friends, so his
particularaffections are generally his worst counsellors
I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I had
from a* youth to wander into the world, and how evi-
dent it now was that this principle was preserved in
me for my punishment. How it came on, the man-
ner, the circumstance, and the conclusion of it, it is
easy to give you historically, and with its utmost
variety of particulars. But the secret ends of Divine
Providence, in thus permitting us to be hurried down
the stream of our own desires, are only to be under-
stood of those who can listen to the voice of Provi
dence, and draw religious consequences from God%
Justice and their own mistakes.
Be it had I business or no business, away I went
It is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the res*
•on or absurdity of my own conduct; but to come te
the history—I was embarked for the voyage, and the
voyage I went.
I shall only add here, that my honest and truly pioue
clergyman left me here; a ship being ready to go te
Lisbon, he asked me leave to to thither; being stiU
as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he
began. How happy had it been for me if I had gone
with him?
But it was too late now ; all things Heaven appoints
are best. Had I gone with him, I had never had so
mally things to be thankful for, and you had never
heard of the Second Part of the Travels and Adven-
ures of Robinson Crusoe; so I. must leave here the
fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on with Try
voyage.
From the Brasils we made directly away over the
Atlantic sea to the Cape do Bonne Esperance, or, as
we cull it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a toler-
able good voyage, our coast generally south-east;
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. But
my disasters at sea were at an end; my future rubs
and cross events were to befal me on shore; that it
might appear the land was as well prepared to be our
scourge as the sea, when Heaven who directs the cir-
cumstances of things, pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a super-
cargo on board, who was to direct all her motions
after she arrived at the Cape; only being limited to a
certain number of days for stay, by charter-party, at
the several ports he was to go to. This was none of
my business, neither did 1 meddle with it at all; my
nephew the captain, and the supercargo, adjusting all
those things between them as they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape longer than was need-
ful to take in fresh water, but made the best of oui
way for the coast of Cororaandel; we were indeed
informed that a French man of war of fifty guns and
two large merchant-ships were gone for the Indies;
and as I knew we were at war with France, 1 had
some apprehensions of them; but they went their own
way, and we heard no more of them.
I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, varia-
tions of the compass, latitude*, meridian distances,
trade-winds, situation of ports, and the like; such a«
almost all the histories of long navigation are luil oi
and which make the reading tiresome enough, and are
perfectly unprofitable to all that read, except only to
those who are to go to those places themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our pass-
ing from one to another. We touched first at the
island of Madagascar,, where, though the people are
fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very well
armed with lances and bows, which they use with
inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well witn
them awhile; they treated us very civilly; and foi
some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scis-
sars, &c. they brought us eleven good fat bullocks,
middling in size, but very good in flesh, which we
took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time after
we had furnished ourselves with provisions; and I
that was always too curious to look into every nook
of the world wherever I came, was for going on short
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the
island that we went on shore one evening, and the
people, who by the way are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a dis-
tance; as we had traded freely with them, and haA
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger,
but when we saw the people we cut three boughs on,
of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us.
which, it seems, is a mark in the country not only of
jruce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other
tide set up three poles or boughs also, which is a sig-
al that they accept the truce too; but then this is a
nown condition of the truce, that you are not to pass
oeyond their three poles towards them, nor they come
past your three poles or boughs towards you; so that
you are perfectly secure within the three poleJKand
all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed
like a market for free converse, traffic, and commerce.
When you go thither you must not carry your weapon*

with you; and if they come into that space they stick
up their javelins ard lances all at the first poles, and
come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered
them and the truce thereby broken, away they run
to the poles and lay hold of their weapons, and then
the truce is at an end. •
It happened one evening when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down than
usual, but all was very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several kinds of provisions, foi
which we satisfied them with such toys as we had;
their women also brought us milk and roots, and se-
veral things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet;
and we made us a little tent or hut, of some boughs
of trees, which lay on shore all that night.
I know not what w?* the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her I made
one of them come on shore, and getting some bough?
of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sai>
on the bottom of the boat and lay on board, undei
the cover of the branches of the trees, all night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one ol
our men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling
out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come and
help them, for they were all like to be murdered;
at the same time I heard the firing of five muskets,
which was the number of the guns they had and that
three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were
not so easily frighted with guns as the savages wer6
in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter,
kut rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, witn
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist ou*
men.
V/e got the boat soon to the shore; but our men
were in too much hasfe; for being come to the shor*,
they plunged into the -vatertoget to the boat withal!
the expedition they could, being pursued by between
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine
in all, and only five of them had fusils with them;
the rest, indeed, had pistols and swords, but they
were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of hem being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse, was, that while we
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as
much danger as they were in on shore; for they poured
their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain
to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches
and two or three loose boards, which to our ^reat sa-
tisfaction we had by mere accident, or providence
rather, in the boat.
And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least part .of any of us, they would have been
sure of us. We had, bv the light of the moon, a little
sight of them as they stood pelting us from the shore
with darts and arrows, and having got ready our fire-
arms we gave them a volley, and we could hear by
the cries of some of them, that we had wounded se-
veral; however, they stood thus in battle array on the
shore till break of day, which we suppose was that
they might see the better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with
small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship,
which though she rode a league off, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiv-
ing the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards
the shore, pretty well understood us; and weighing
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as
he dttfat with .the ship, and then sent another boat with
ten nands in her to assist us; but we called to them
not to come too near, telling them what condition we
were in; however, they stood in nearer to us; and j
one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in hit
hand, and keeping our boat between him and th«
enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, upon
which we slipt our little cable, and leaving our anchor
behind, they towed us out of the reach of the arrows,
we all the while lying close behind the barricade we
had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore,
we ran along just by them, and we poured in a broad-
side among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead,
small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot,
which made a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray;
and indeed our supercargo who had been often in
those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure
the inhabitants would not have touched us after we
had made a truce, if we had not done something tn
provoke them to it. At length it came out, viz. tha i
ah old woman, who had come to sell us some milk
had brought it within our poles, with a young womai,
with her, who also brought some roots and herbs; and*
while the old woman (whether she was mother to
the young woman or no they could not tell) was sell
ing us the milk, one of our men offered some rude
ness to the wench that was with her, at which the old
woman made a great noise. However, the seaman
would not quit his prize, but carried her out of the
old woman's sight among the trees, it being almost
dark. The old woman went away without her, and,
as we suppose, made an outcry among the people she
tame from ; who, upon notice, raised this grea,t army
upon us in three or four hours; and it was great odds
but we had been all destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack, as
he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest came
off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion ol
all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black
mistress, for wc could not hear what became of him
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after,
though the wind presented, and made signals for him;
made our boat sail up shore and down shore several
leagues, but in vain; so we were obliged to give him
over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had
been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, nowever, without ven-
turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn
any thing of him or them. It was the third night
after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if 1
could by any means, what mischief he had done, and
how the game stood on the Indian side. I was care-
ful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked
again; but I ought indeed to have been sure that the
men I went with had been under my command he-
fore I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischiev-
ous,' as I was brought into it without any knowledge
or desire.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship besides the supercargo and myself; and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening before.
I landed here, because my design, as I have said,
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if
they had left any marks behind them, or of the mis-
chief we had done them; and I thought if we could
surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might gel
our men again byway of exchange.
We landed wjthout any noise, and divided our men
into two companies, whereof the boatswain command-
ed one, and I the other. We neither could hear nor
ee any body stir, when we landed; so we marched
up, one body at a di&tance from the other, to the
field of battle. At first we could see nothing, it being
very dark; but by and by our boatswain, that led the
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. Thii
mude them bait there awhile; for knowing by the cir
12*7
cumstances that they were at the place where the In
dians had stood, they waited for my coming up
Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise,
which we knew would be in less than an hour, and
then we could easily discern the havock we had made
among them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some
had an arm, and some a leg, shot off, and one his
Dead; those that were wounded we supposed they
had carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for
going on board again; but the boatswain and his party
often sent me word, that they were resolved to make
a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they
called them, dwelt, and desired me to go along with
them, and if they could find them, as they still fan-
cied they should, they did not doubt, they said, get-
ting a good booty, and it might he they might find
Thomas Jeffrys there, that was the man's name we
had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run who had a ship
and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to
make, which depeuded very much upon the lives ol
the men; but as they sent me word they were resolv-
ed to go, and only asked me and my company to go
along with them, I positively refused it, and rose up
(for 1 was sitting on the ground) in order to go to the
boat. One or two of the men began to importune
me to go, and when I still refused positively, began
to grumble, and say they were not'under my com-
mand, and they would go. "Come, Jack," says one
of the men, ''will you go with me? I will go foi
oner" Jack said*he would; and another followed,
and then another; and, in a word, they all left me
but onf, whom, with much difficulty too, I persuaded
to stay . so the supercargo and T, with one man, wpn
back to the boat, where, I told thenj, we wouiri stay
for them, and take care to take in as many of them
ns should be left; for I told them it was a mad thing
they were going about, and supposed most of them
would run the fate of Thomas Jeffrys.
They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it
they would come off again, and they would take care,
&c. So away they went. I entreated them to con-
sider the ship and the voyage; that their lives were
not their own; and that they were entrusted with the
voyage in some measure; that if they miscarried, the
snip might be lost for want of their help? and that
they could not answer it to God and man. I said a
great deal more to them on that head, but I might as
well have talked to the main-mast of the ship; they
were mad upon their journey; only they gave me
good words and begged I would not be angry; said
they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt
but they would be back again in about an hour at
farthest; for the Indian town, they said, was not
above half a mile off; though they found it above
two miles before the got to it.
Well, the.y all went away as above; and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but mad-
men would have gone about, yet to give them their
due, they went about it warily as well as boldly. They
'were gallantly armed that is true; for they had every
man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and every man a
pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of
them nangers, and the boatswain and two more had
pole-axes; besides all which they had among them
thirteeen hand grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and bet-
ter provided, never went about any wicked work in
the world.
When they went out their chief design was plun-
der, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold
there; but a circumstance, which none of them were
aware of, set them on jfire with revenge, and made
ievils of them all. When they came to the few Id
dian houses, which they thought had been the town,
which were not above half a mile off, they weie un
der a great disappointment; for there were not above
twelve or thirteen houses; and where the town was,
or how big, they knew not They consulted there-
for«| what to do, and were some time before they could
resolve; for if they fell upon these they must cut all
their throats, and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the night, though the moon
was up; aud if one escaped he would run away, and
raise all the town, so they should have a whole army
upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they went
away, and left those untouched (for the people were
all asleep), they could not tell which way to look foi
fhe town.
however the last was the best advice; so they re-
solved to leave those houses, and look for the town
as welt as they could. They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree: this they presently con-
cluded would be a good guide to them; for they said
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them
or the town behind them, and if they untied her they
should see which way she went; if she went back
they had nothing to say to her, but if she went for-
ward they hed nothing to do but to follow her; so
they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags,
and the cow went on before them. In a word, the
cow led them directly to the town, which, as they re
ported, consisted of above two hundred houses or
huts; and in some of these they found several fami-
lies living together.
Here they found all silent; as profoundly secure as
•leep and a country that had never seen an enemy
f that t ind could make them. Upon this they called
anothei council to consider what they had to do, and
in a word, they resolved to divide themselves into
three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in three
parts of the town; and as the men came out, to seize -
them and bind them; if any resisted, they need noi
be asked what to do then, and so to search the resto*
the houses for plunder; Dut resolved to march silently
first through the town, and sec what dimensions it was
of, and consider if they might venture upon it or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they
ivould venture upon them; but while they were ani-
mating one another to the work, three of them that
were a little above the rest called out aloud, and told
them they had found Thomas Jeffrys: they all ran
up to the place; and so it was indeed, for there they
found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one arm,
and his throat cut. There was an Indian house just
by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of
the principal Indians who had been concernec in the
fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded
with our shot; and our men found they were awake,
and talking one to another in that house, but knew
not their number.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so ea-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one another
they would be revenged, and that not an Indian who
came into their hands should have quarter; and to
work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as
by the rage and fury they were in might be expected.
Their first care was to get something that would soon
take fire; but after a little search they found that
would be to no purpose, for most of the houses were
low, and thatched with flags or rushes, of which the
country is full: so they presently made some wild-
fire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in the
palms of their hands; and in a quarter of an hour they
set the town on fire in four or five places, and parti-
cularly that house where, the Indians were not gone
to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor
frighted creatures began to rush out to save their lives,
but met with their fate in the attempt, and especially
at the door, where they drove them back, the boat-
swain himself killing one or two with his pole-ax*;
the house being large, and many in it, he did not care
to go in, but called for a hand-grenado, and threw it
among them, which at first fr^ted them; but
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
when ii burst made such havoc among them, thai
they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house were killed or hurt with thegrenado,
except two or three more, who pressed to the door,
which the boatswain and two more kept with t^e
bayonets in the muzzlesof their pieces, and dispatched
all who came that way. But there was another apart
inent in the house, where the prince, or king, or
wnatsoever he was, and several others, were; and
they kept in till the house, which was by this time all
t>' a light flame, fell in .upon them, and they were
S .othcred or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a gun because they
would not waken the people faster than they could
master them; but the lire began to waken them fast
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little to-
gether in bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of lighi combustible stuff, that they
could hardly bear the street between them, and their
business was to follow the fire for the surer execu
lion. As fast as the fire either forced the people ou
of those houses which were burning, or frighted then
out of others, our people were ready at their doors to
knock them on the head, still calling and hallooing
to one another to remember Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing I must confess I was very
uneasy and Especially when I saw the flames of the
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by me.
My nephew the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I was
in ; especially hearing the guns too, for by this time
they began to use their fire-arms. A thousand thought*
oppressed his mind concerning me and the super
cargo what should become of us; and at last, though
he could ill spare any more men, yet, not knowing
what exigence we might be in, he takes another boat,
and with thirteen men and himself comes on shore
*o me.
He was surprised to see m*} and the supercargo n:
the boat with no more, than two men, for one had
oeen left to keep the boat; ttnd though he was glad
chat we were well, yet he was in the same impatience
with us to know what was doing, for the noise con-
tinued and the flame increased. I confess it was next
to an impossibility for any men in the world to re-
strain their curiosity of knowing what had happened,
or their concern for the safety of the men. In a
word, the captain told me he would go and help his
men, let what would come. I argued with him, as 1
did before with the men, the safety of the ship, and
the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners
and merchants, &,c. and told him I would go, and the
two men, and only see if we could at a distance, learn
what was like the be the event, and come back and
tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nophew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for
he could not think of having his men lost for want ol
help; he had rather, he said, lose the ship, the voy-
age, and his life, and all: and so away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than
1 was to persuade them not to before; so, in short,
the captain ordered two men to row back the pin-
nace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship, leav-
ing the long-boat at an anchor; and that when they
came back six men should keep the two boats, and
six more come after us, so that he left only sixteen
men in the ship; for the whole ship's company con-
sisted of sixty-^five men, whereof two were lost in the
first quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt
little ot the ground we trod on, and being guided by
the fire we kept no path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns were sur
pn$ing to us before, the cries of the poor people werr
now quite of another nature, and filled us with hor
ror. I must confess I never was at the sacking of a
city, or at the taking of a town by storm ; I have
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ire
land and killing man, woman and child; and I had
read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebourg
and cutting the throats of 22,000 of both sexes; but j
never had an idea of the thing itself before, noi is it
possible to describe it, or the horror which was upon
our minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and at length came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of it
for the fire. The first object we met with was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for
the house was consumed; and just before it plain
now to be seen by the light of the fir.}, lay four men
and three women killed; and as wo thought, one or
two more lay in the heap among the fire. In short,
these were such instances of a rage altogether barba-
rous, and of a fury something beyond what was hu-
man, that we thought it impossible our men could be
guilty of it; or if they were the authors of it, we
thought that every one of them ought to be put to the
worst of deaths: "but this was not all; we saw the fire
increased forward, and the cry went on just as the
fire wont on, so that we .were in the utmost confusion.
We advanced a little way farther, and beheld to our
astonishment three women naked, crying in a most
dreadful manner, and flying as if they had indeed had
wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men, na-
tives, in the same terror and consternation, with thrJe
of our English butchers (for I cancallthem no better)
in the rear, who, when they could not overtake them,
fired in among them, and one that was killed by
their shot fell down in our sight: when the rest saw
us, believing us to be their enemies, and that w would
murder them as well as those that pursued ihem, they
set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women,
and two of them fell down as if already dead with
the fright •
Mv very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran
shill'in mv veins, when I saw this ; and I believe had
the thiee English sailors that pursued them come on,
I had made our men kill them all. However, ws
took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know
;hat we would not hurt them, and immediately they
came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands
lifted up, made piteous lamentations to us to save
them, which we let them know we would do; where-
upon they kept up together in a huddle close behind
us for protection. I left my men drawn up together
and charged them to hurt nobody, but if possible to
get at some of our people, and see what devil it was
possessed them, and what they intended to do; and
m a word to command them off, assuring them that if
they staid till daylight they would have a hundred'
thousand men about their ears: I say, I loft them
and went among those flying people, taking only two
of our men with me; and there was indeed a piteous
spectacle among them; some of them had their feet
terribly burnt with trampling and running through the
fire, others their hands burnt; one of the women had
fallen down in the fire, and was almost burnt to death
before she could get out again; two or three ot
the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, form our
men pursuing, and another was shot through the bo-
(\y^ and died while I was there.
I would fain have learnt what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they .
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them
knew nat what was the occasion themselves. I was
so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt,
that I could not atay there, but went back to my own
men: 1 told them my resolution, and commanded
them to follow me, when in the very moment came
four of our men, with the boatswain at their head, run-
ning over the heaps of bodies they had killed, ail co-
vered with b}ood and dust, as if they wanted more
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them
as loud as they could halloo, and with much ado one
*f them made them hear, so that they knew who w«
ere, and came up to us.
120
As soon as the boatswain saw us ne set up a halloo,
like a shout of triumph, for having as he thought,
more help come; and without bearing to hear inc.
"Captain," says he, "noble capiain, J am glad you
are corne; we have not half clone yet: villains ! hell-
hounds dogs! I will kill as many of them as poor Tom
has hairs upon his head. We have sworn to spare
none of them , we will root out the very name of them
horn the earth." And thus he ran on, out of breath
too with action, arid would not give us leave to speak
a word.
At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him
a little, "Barbarous dog '." said I, " what are you
doing? I won't have one creature touched more upon
pain of death. I charge you upon your life to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
man this minute."
"Why Sir," says he," do you know what you do,
or what they have done? Jf you want a reason fo;
what we have done, come hither;" and with that h*
shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree witl
his throat cut. **
1 confess I was urged then myself, and at anothe
time should have been forward enough; but 1 thought
they had carried their rage too far, and thought ol
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, "Cursed
be their anger for it was fierce; and their wrath, foi
it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my
hands; for when the men I carried with me saw the
sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain
them, as I should have had with the others; nay, my
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me b
their hearing, that he was only concerned for ftar ol
the men being overpowed; for, as to the people, ne
thought not one of them ought to live; for they had
all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor
man, and that they ought to be used like murderers.
Upon these words away ran eight of my men with the
boatswain and his crew to complete their bloody
work: and I, seeing it ouiie out of my power to re-
strain tnem, came away pensive and sad, «or x couio
not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and
cries of the poor wretches that fell Into their hand*
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and,two men, and with these I walked back to
the boats. It was a very great peace of folly in me,
I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for as
it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run
over the country, there stood about forty men armed
with lances and bows at the little place where the
twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned before,
but by accident I missed the place, and came di-
rectly to the sea-side i and by that time I got to the
sea-side it was broad day: immediately I took the
pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to assist
the men in what might happen.
I observed that about the time I came to the boat-
side the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abat-
ed; but in about half an hour after I got on board I
heard a volley of our men's fire-arms, and saw a great
smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was our men
falling upon the forty men, who, as I said, stood at
the few houses on the way; of whom they killed six-
teen or seventeen, and set all those houses on fire,
but did not meddle with the women or children.
By the time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace our men began to appear; they came droi*
ping in some and some, not in two bodies, and in
form, as they went out, but all in heaps, straggling
here and there in such a manner that a small force of
resolute men might have cut them till off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole coun-
ry. The people were amazed and surprised, and so
frighted that I believe a hundred of them would hare
fled at the sight of but five of our men. Nor in all
this terrible action was there a man who made any
considerable defence; they were so surprised, between
ihe terror of the fire, and the sudden attack of our
* men in the dark, that they knew not which way to
turn themselves; for If they fled one way they were
9
met by one party, if nacK agam Dy another; so tn*t
they were every where knocked down. Nor did any
of our men receive the least hurt, except one who
strained his foot, and another had one of his hands
very much burnt.
I was very augrj^with my nephew the captain, and
rideed with all the men, in my mind, but with him
>n pajiicular, as well for his acting so out of his duty,
as commander of the ship, and having the charge of
the voyage upon him, as in his prompting rather than
cooling the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel
an enterprise: my nephew answered me very respect-
fully, but told me that when he saw the body of the
poor seaman whom they had murdered in such a cruel
and barbarous manner,'he was not master of himself,
neither could he govern his passion; he owned he
should not have done so, as he was commander of the
ship, but as he was a man and nature moved him,
he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men the]'
were not subject to me at all, and they knew it welt
enough, so they took no notice of my dislike.
The next day wc set sail, so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of thei
number they killed; some said one thing, some ano-
ther; but according to the best of their accounts, put
all together, they killed and destroyed about a hundred
and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left
not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, as he was
ijiitc dead, for his throat was so cut that his head
was half off, it would do him no service to bring him
avvay; so they left him where they found him, only
took him down from the tree where he was hanged
by one hand.
However just our men thought this action to be, 1
was against them in it, and I always after that time
told them God would blast the voyage; for I looked
jpon the blood they shed that night to be murder in
them: for though it is true that they killed Thomas
Jeffrvs, yet it was true that JefTrvs was the aoreres^or.
Dad broken the truce, and nad violated or oeoaucnea H
a young woman of theirs, who carne to our camp in-
nocently, and on the faith of their capitulation. -
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not, and that
the war was begun the night before by the natives
themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our
men without just provocation; so that as we were in a
capacity to fight them, we might also be in a capacity
to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary
manner; that though the poor man had taken liberty
with a wench, he ought not to have been murdered,
and that in such a villanous manner; and that they
did nothing but what was just, and that the laws of
God allowed to be done to murderers.
One woulc think this should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shoreamong heathens
and barbarians; but it is impossible to make man-
kind wise but at their own experience; and their ex-
perience seems to be always of most use to them when
it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, anc*
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to
touch at Surat; but the chief of the supercargo's de-
sign lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he missed of
the business outward-bound he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.
The first disaster that befel us was in the Gulf ol
Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the Gulf were surrounded by the
Arabs, and either all killed or carried away into sla-
rery; the rest of the boats crew were not able to
escue them, and had but just time to get oft" their
boat. I began to upbraid them witn the just retribu-
tion of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very
warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my cen-
sures than I could shew any warrant for in Scripture,
and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver, 4t
*ljere our Saviour intimates that those men on whom
ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
the tower of Siloam fell, were not sinners above all
ihe Galileans; but that which indeed put me to silence
in this case was, that none of these five men who
were now lost were of the number of those who went
on shore to the massacre of Madagascar (so I alwayi
called it, though our men could no^bear the wordrao^
sacre with any patience :) and indeed this last circum
stance, as I have said, put me to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on thissubjec
had worse consequences than I expected; and the
boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found
that I continually brought that affair upon the stage,
that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used
the men very ill on that account, and himself in par-
ticular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no
command in the ship or concern in the voyage, they
were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know
. but I might have some ill design in my head, and per-
haps call them to an account for it when they came to
England; and that therefore, unless I would resolve to
have done with it, and also not to concern myself far-
ther with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave
the ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with
me among -them.
f heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him that I did confess I had all along oppos-
ed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would al
ways call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him
than any of the res*; that as to my having no com-
mand of the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my
mind in things which publicly concerned us all; as to
what concern I had in the voyage, that was none of
his business; I was a considerable owner of the ship,
and in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak,
even farther than I had yel done, and would nor be
Accountable to him or ary one else; and began to be
a little warm with him; he made but little reply to
me at the time, and I thought that affair had been
over. We were at this time in the road to Bengal;
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore
with the supercargo, in the ship's boat to divert my-
self; and towards evening was preparing to go on
board, when one of the men came to me, and told me
he would not have me trouble myself to come down to
the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on
board. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in
at so insolent a message; and I asked the mai: who
bade him deliver that errand to me? He told me, the
coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bid him
let them know he had delivered his message, and that
i had given him no answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, adding, what I presently fore-
saw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in
the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on
board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it but I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for before I had spoken to him on shore the
matter was effected on board : the boatswain, the gun-
ner the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak with the
captain; and there the boatswain making a long ha-
rangue, (for the fellow talked very well) and repeating
all he had said to me, told the captain in a few words,
that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were
loath to use any violence with me; which if I had not
gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to
oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to
tell him, that as they shipped themselves to serve in the
* ship under his command they would perform it faith-
fully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and
sail no farther with him; and at that word All, he
(timed his face about towards the main-mast, which
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at
which all the seamen being got together, they cried
out, "One and All, One and All!"
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind; and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told them
calmly he would consirjer on the matter, but that he
could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about
it: he used some arguments with them to shew them
the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing, but it
was'all in vain ; they swore and shook hands round,
before his face, that they would go all on shore unless
he would engage to them not to suffer me to come on
board the ?hip.
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might take
it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them ; told them
that I was a very considerable owner in the ship, and
that in justice he could not put me out of my own
house; that this was next door to serving me as the
famous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in
the ship, set the captain on shore in an uninhabited
island, and ran away with the ship; that let them go
into what ship they would, if ever they came to Eng-
land again it would cost them dear; that the ship was
mine, and that he would not put me out of it; and
that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too,
than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they
pleased. However, he would go on shore, and talk
with me there, and invited the boatswain to go with
him, and perhaps they might accomrc odatethe matter
with me.
But they all rejected the proposal; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
on board nor on shore; and if I came on board, they
would go on shore. "Well," said the captain, "li
you are all of this mind, let me go on shore, and talk
with him :" so away he came to me with this account,
a little after the message had been brought to me fioui
the coxswain.
I was very glad to to see my nephew I must confess
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a
remote country, and nothing to help myself; in short,
I had been in a worse case than when I was all alone
in the island.
But they had not come to that length, it seems, ta
my great satisfaction ; and when my nephew told me
what they had said to him, and how they had sworn,
and shook hands, that they would one and all leave
the sh'p, if I was suffered to come on board, I told
him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I
would stay on shore; I only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary things on shore,
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and J would
find my way to England as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew;
but there was no way to help it, but to comply with
it. So, in short, he went on board the ship'again,
and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded tc
their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on
board the ship. So the matter was over in a very few
hours; the men returned to their duty, and 1 begun
to consider what course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for 1 was near three thousand
leagues by sea, farther off front England than I waa
at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by
land, ov%r the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might
go from thenqe to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of
Persia, and from thence might take the way of the ca-
ravans, over the deserts of Arabia, to Allcppo and
Scanderoon, and from thence by sea again to Italy,
and so overland into France; and this put together,
might be, at least, a full diameter of thegloble; but,
if it were to be measured, I suppose it would appear
lo be a great deal more.
I had another way before me, which wai to wait foJ
some English ships, which were coming to Eengai,
from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get passage
on board them for England; but as I came hithei
without any concern with the English East India Com-
pany, so it would be difficult to go from hence with-
out their license, unless with great favour of the cap-
tains of the ships, or of the Company's factors; and to
both I was an utter stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by
tontrarieties, to see the ship set sail without me; a
treatment, 1 think, a man in my circumstances scarce
ever met with, except from,pirates running away with
a ship, and setting those that would not agree with
..heir villany on shore: indeed this was the next door
to it both ways. However, my nephew left me two
servants, or rather, one companion and one servant:
the first was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to
go with me; and the Other was his own servant. 1
took me also a good lodging in the house of an Eng-
lish woman, where several merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man. Here I was handsomely enough entertained;
and that 1 might not be said to run rashly upon any
thing, 1 stayed here above nine months, considering
what course to take, and how to manage myself. I
had some English goods with me of value, and a con-
siderable sum of money; my nephew furnishing me
with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit
for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be strait-
ened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage
too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought here some
very good diamonds, which, of all other things, was
lie most proper for mo, in my circumstances, because
I might always carry my whole estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none falling to my
mind, the English merchant, who lodged with me, and
withwnom i naJ contracted an intimate acquaintance,
came to me jne' morning: "Countryman," says he.
"t have a project to communicate to you, which, at
It suits with my thoughts, may, for ought I know, sun
with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly con-
sidered it.
"Here we are posted," says he, "you by acci-
dent, and I by my own choice,"in a part of the world
very remote from our own country; but it is in a
country where, by us who understand trade and busi-
ness^ a great deal of money is to be got: if you wil
,3ut a thousand, pounds to my thousand pounds, we
jvill hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds;
you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we will go
a trading voyage to China; for what should we stand
still for? The whole world is in motion, rolling round
and round; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies
and earthly, are busy and diligent: why should we be
idle? There are no drones," says he," living in the
world but men: why should we be of that number?"
I liked this proposal very well; and the more be-
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much good
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say, but
that I might, by my loose and unhinged circumstances,
be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, and in-
deed for any thing else; or otherwise trade was none
of my element; however,,! might, perhaps, say with
some truth, that if trade was not my element, ram-
bling was; and no proposal for seeing any part of the
world, which I had never seen before, could possibly
come amiss to me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a
•hip to our mind; and when we got a vessel, it waa
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage, and manage
the sailors which we should pick up there. After
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and gunner,
English'; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portugese
foremast-men: with these we found we could do welJ
enough, having Indian seamen, such as they are, ta
make up.
v. There are so many travellers wh*» have written the
history ot their voyages and travels this way, that it
would be but very little diverson to any body, to
give a long account of the places we went to, and ths
people who inhabit there: those things I leave.to
others, and ,-ofer the reader to those journals and tra-
vels of Englishmen many of which, I find are pub-
lished, and more promised every day. It is enough
or me to tell you that we made the voyage to Achin,
n the island of Sumatra, first; and from thence to
Siam, where "we exchanged some of our wares for
opium, and for some arrack; the first, a commodity
which bears a great price among the Chinese, and
which, at that time, was very much wanted there: in
a word, we went up to Susham; made a very great
voyage; were eight months out; and returned to Ben-
gal: and I was very well satisfied with my adventure.
I observe, that our people in England often admire
how the officers, which the Company send into India,
and the merchants which generally stay there, get such
very good estates as they do, and sometimes come*
home worth sixty, seventy, and a hundred thousand
pounds at a time. But it is no wonder, or, at least,
we shall see so much farther into it, when we consider
the innumerable ports and places where they have a
free commerce, that it will then be no wonder; and
much less will it be so, when we consider, that at all
those places and ports where the English ships come,
there is so much, and such- constant demand for the
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain
vent for the return, as well as a market abroad for tlie
goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and 1 got
so much money by the first adventure, and sach an
msi£nt into the method of getting more, that, had 1
been twenty years younger, I should have been tempt
ed to have staid there, and sought no farther for make
,*»g my fortune. But what was all this to a man #.n the ,
wrong side of three-score, that was rich eticugl And
came abroad more in obedience to a restless de* of
seeing the world, than a covetous desire of gecC io
ti And indeed 1 think it is with great justice 'that 1
now call it a restless desire, for it was so: when [ was
at home, I was restless to go abroad; and now I was
abroad, I was restless to be at home I say, what was
this gain to me? I was rich enough already; nor had
I any uneasy desires about getting more money; and
therefore the profits of the voyage to me were things
of no great force to me, for the prompting me forward
Io farther undertakings, hence I thought, that by thie
voyage I had made no progress at aU* because I was
come back, as I might call it, to the place from whence
I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, which like
rJiat which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied
with seeing, was still more desirous of wandering and
seeing. I was come into a part of the world which I
never was in before; and that part in particular which
I had heard much of; and was resolved to see as
much of it as I could; and then I thought I might say
I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:
T do not name this to insist upon my own, for I ac^
knowledge his was most just, and the most suited to
the end of a merchant's life; who, when he is abroad
upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as
the best thing for him, which he is like to get the most
money by. My new friend kept himself to the nature
of the thing, and would have been content to have
gone, like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn,
backward and forward, provided he could, as he called
St, find his account in it: on the other hand, mine, as
old as I was, was the notion of a mad rambling boy
that never cares to see a thing twice over.
But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled
resolution imaginable, which way to go. In the inter-
val of these consultations, my friend, who was always
upon the search for business, proposed another voyage
to me, viz., among the Spice Islands; and to bring
tome a load of cloves from the Manillas, or there*
ibouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but

the islands belong partly to the Spaniards ; though w
went not so far, but to some other, where they have
not the whole power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon,
&c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage;
the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into
it; however, at last, nothing else#ffering, and finding
that really stirring about and trading, the profit being
so great, and, as I may say, certain, had more plea-
sure in it, and more satisfaction to the mind, than sit-
ting still; which, to me especially, was the unhappiest
part of life, I resolved on this voyage too: which we
made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and seve-
ral islands, whose names I do not remember, and
came home in about five months. We sold our spice,
which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, to the
Persian merchants, who carried them away for the
Gulf; and, making near five of one, we really got a
great deal of money.
, My friend, when we made up this account, smiled
at me: "Well now," said he, with a sort of an agree-
able insult upon my indolent temper, " is not this bet-
ter than walking about here, like a man of nothing to
do, and spending our time in staring at the rfonsense
and ignorance of the Pagans?"—" Why truly," said I,
"my friend, I think it is; and I begin to be a convert
to the principles of merchandising. But I must tell
you," said 1, " by the way, you do not know what I
am doing; for if once I conquer my backwardness,
and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass
you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall
pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still."
But to be short with my speculations: a little while
after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia
she was a coaster, not an European trader, and of
about two hundred tons burden: the men, as they pre-
tended, having been so sickly, that the captain had not
men enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal;
and, as if having^got money enough, or being willing,
for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public no-
tice that he would sell his ship .* this came to my ear*
before my new partner heard of ix; and I had a great
mind to buy it. So I went home to him, and told him
of it: he considered awhile, for he was no rash man
neither; but musing some time, he replied, " She is a
little too big; but, however, we will have her." Ac-
cordingly we bought the ship; and, agreeing with the
master, we paid for her, and took possession ; when
we had done so, we resolved to entertain the men, if
we could, to join them with those we had, for the
ursuing our business; but on a sudden, they not hav-
ing received their wages, but their share of the money*
as we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be
found. We inquired much about them, and at length
were told, that they were all gone, together, by land,
to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and
from thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to
the Gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while,
as that I missed the opportunity oi going with them;
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company as
would both have guarded me and diverted me, would
have suited mightily with my great design; and I
should both have seen the world, and gone homewards
too; but I was much better satisfied a few days after,
when I came to know what sort of fellows they were •
for, in short, their history was, that this man they
called captain was the gunner only, not the comman-
der; that they had been a trading voyage, in which
they were attacked on shore by some of the Malaccans,
who had killed the captaih and three of his men ; and
that after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in
number, had resolved to run away with the ship,
ft-hich they did, and had brought, her in at the Bay of
Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore
of whom we shall hear further.
Well; let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought; for we never inquired any thing of the sea-
men, who, if we had examined, would certainly hav«,
faltered in their accounts, contradicted one another,
and perhaps have contradicted themselves; or, one
now or other, we should have seen reason to have sus-
pected them; but the man showed us a bill of sale
for the ship, to one Emanual Clostershoven, or some
such name, (for I suppose it was ajj a forgery) and
called himself by that name, and we could not con-
tradict him; and being withal a little too unwary, or,
at least, having no suspicion of the thing, we went
through with our bargain.
However, we picked up some Engish seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and we now resolved
for a second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c.
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca
isles; and, in short, not to fill this part of my story
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark-
able, I spent from first to last, six years in this coun-
try, trading from port to port, backward and for-
ward, and with very good success; and was now the
last year with my partner, going in the ship above-
mentioned on a voyage to China; but designing first
to go to Siam, to buy rice.
Jn this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to
oeat up and down a great while in the straits of Ma-
lacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner got
clear of those difficult seas, but we found our ship
had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our
industry, to find out where it was. This fore'd us to
make for some port; and my partner, who knew the
country better than I did, directed the captain to put
into the river of Cambodia; for I nad made the Eng-
lish, mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being
willing to take the charge of the ship upon myselfL
This river lays on the north side of the great bay, or
gulf, wnich goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board
an English East India ship, which rode in the same
iver, up ac or near the city of Cambodia • what
if you are taken, you will be hanged for a piiate,
and the particulars be examined into afterwards. I
thought, Sir," added he," I should have met with a
better reception than this, for doing you a piece of
service of such importance."—" 1 can never be un-
grateful," said I, " for any service, or to any man that
offers me any kindness; but it is past my comprehen-
sion," said I, " what.they should have such a design
upon me for: however, since you say there is no time
to be lost, and that there is some villanous design in
hand against me, I will go on board this minute, and
put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak,
or if we can swim without stopping it: but, Sir,"
said I, " shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all
this? Can you give me no farther light into it?"
"I can tell yon but part of the story, Sir," says he;
"but I have a Dutch seaman here with mc, and, I
believe, I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but
there is scarce time for it: but the short of the story
ts this, the first part of which, I suppose, you know
well enough, viz. that you were with this ship at Su-
matra; that there your captain was murdered by the
Malaccans, with three of his men; and that you, or
some of those that were on board with you, ran away
•rith the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is
the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as pi-
rates, I can assure you, and executed with very little
eeremony ; for you know merchant-ships show but
little law to pirates, if they get them in their power/*
"Now you speak plain English," said I, " and r
thank you; and though I know nothing that we hav*
done, like what you talk of, but I am sure we cama
onestly and fairly by the ship; yet seeing such won
s a-doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean ho-
lestly, I will be upon my guard."—«« Nay, Sir/'saya
he, " do not talk of being upon your guard; the bes*
defence is to be out of the aanger: if you have an^
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men, put
out to sea without fail at high-water; and as you havt
a whole tide before you, you will be gone too for oui
133
before they can come down; for they will come
away at high-water; and as they have twenty miW
to come, you'll get near two hours of them by ihe
difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of the
way: besides, as they arc only boats, and not ships,
they will not venture to follow you far out to sea
especially if it blows." *
"Well,"said I, " you have been very kind in this;
what shall I do for you to make you amends ?"—
"Sir," says he, " you may not be^so willing to make
me amends, because you may not be convinced oi
the truth of it: I will make an offer to you; I have
nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship
, which I came out of England in; and the
Dutchman that is with me, has seven months pay due
to him ; if you will make good our pay to us, we will
go along with you: if you find nothing more in it,
we will desire no more; but if we do convince you,
that we have saved your life, and the ship, and the
lives of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to you.'
I consented to this readily; and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as 1
came to the ship's side, my partner who was on board,
came on the quartei deck, and called to me with a
great deal of joy, "O ho ! O ho ! we have stopped the
leak!"—"Say you so?" said I? "thank God: but
weigh-the anchor then immediately."—"Weigh!"
says he; "what do you mean by that? What is the
matter ?" says he. "Ask no question^," said I, " but
all hands to work, and weigh without losing a min-
ute." He was surprised: but, however, he called
the captain, and he immediately ordered the anchor j
to be got up; and though the tide was not quite done,
yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea;
then I called him into the cabin, and told him the
story at large; and we called in the men, and they
told us the rest of it: but as it took us up a great deal
of time, so before we had done, a seaman comes to
the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that the captairj
t*ade him tpil us, we were chased. "Chased !" sai^
I; "by whom, and by what?"—" By five sloops, oi
boats," said the fellow, "full of men."—" Very wclJ,"
said I; "then it is apparent there is something in it."
In the next place, I ordered all our men to be called
up; and told them, that there was a design to seize
the ship, and to take us for pirates ; and asked them,
if they would stand by us, and by one another? The
men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain,
what way he thought best for us to manage a figni
with them ; for resist them I resolved we would, and
that to the last drop. He said, readily, that the way
was to keep them off with our great shot, as long as
we could, and then to fire at them with our small
arms to keep them from boarding us; but when nei-
ther of these would do any longer, we should retire
to our close quarters; perhaps they had not materials
to break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musket-balls and
fimall pieces of old iron, and what next came to hand;
and thus we made ready for fight; but all this while
fcept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see th^
boats at a distance, being five large long boats follow*
ing us, with all the sail thu\ could make.
Two of these boats, which by our glasses, we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were neai
two leagues a head of them, and gained upon us con-
siderably; so that#c found they would come up with
us: upon which wc fired a gun without shot, to i?i-
timate that they should bring to; and we put out a
flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but they kept
crowding after us, till they came within shot: upon
this we took in our white (lag, they having made no
answer to it; hung out the red flag, and fired at thorn
with shot: notwithstanding this, they came*on till
they were near enough to call to them with a speaking
trumpet, which we had on board: so we called to
*hem, and keep off at their pera.
I, "by whom, and by what ?"—" By five sloops, ot
boats," said the fellow," full of men."—" Very well,"
said I; "then it is apparent there is something in
it." In the next place, I ordered all our men to be
called up; and told them, that there was a design to
seize the ship, and*o take us for pirates; and asked
them, if they would stand by us, and by one another?
The men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they
would live and die with us. Then I asked the cap
tain, what way he thought best for us to manage a
fight with them; for, resist them I resolved we would,
and that to the last drop. He said, readily, that the
way was to keep them off with our great shot, as lon»
3bs we could, and then to fire at them with our sniali*-
arrns, to keep them from boarding us; but when nei-
:her of these would do any longer, we should retire
to our close quarters; perhaps they had not materials

and thus we made ready for fight; but all this while
kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see the
boats at a distance, being five large long-boats fol-
lowing us, with all the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which, by our glasses, we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near
two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us con-
siderably ; so that we found they would come up with

answer vto it: hung out the red flag, and fired at them
with shot; notwithstanding this, they came on till
they were near enough to call to them with a speaking-
trumpet, which we had on board ; so we called to
them, and bade them keep off at their peril.
it was all one, they crowded after us, and endea-
voured to come under our stern, so to board us on
our quarter; upon which, seeing they were resolute
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that fol
lowed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so thai
they lay upon our broadside, wnen immediately we
fired five guns at them; one of them had been levelled
so true, as to carry away the stern of the hindermost
boat, and bring them to the necessity of taking down
their sail, and running all to the head of the boat to
keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough
of it; but seeing the foremost boat still crowd on af-
ter us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made
up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her,
and we could afterwards see her take out the men:
we called again to the foremost boat, and offered a
truce to parley again, and to know what was her bu-
siness with us; but had no answer; only she crowded
close under our stern. Upon this, our gunner, who
was a very dexterous fellow, run out his two chase-
guns, and fired at her; but the shot missing, the men
in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came on:
but the gunner getting quickly ready again, fired
among them a second time; one'shot of which, though
it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men,
and we could easity- see had done a great deal of mis
chief among them; but we, taking no notice of that
weared the ship again, and brought'our quarter tc oeat
upon them; and, firing three guns more, we found'
the boat was split almost to pieces; in particular, h«r
turider, and a piece of her stern, were shot quite away,
go they handed their sail immediately, and were in
gieat disorder: but, to complete their mifortune, out
gLnner let fly two guns at them again; where he hit
thfin we could not tell, but we found the boat wan
si? king, and some of the mer. already in the wate?
I'f. hi tins I immediately manned out our pinnact,

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
pick up some of the men, if they could, and save them
from crowning, and immediately to come on board
with them ; because we saw the rest of the boats be-
gan to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed
their orders, and took up three r*en; one of whicfc
was just drowning, and it was a good while before we
could recover him. As soon as they were on board,
we crowded all the sail we could make, and stood
farther out to sea; and we found, that when the other
three boats came up to the first two, they gave over
their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which though
J knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I apprehended, 1 took care that we should
change our course, and not let any one imagine whi-
ther we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward
quite out of the course of all European ships, whethei
they were bound to China, or any where else within
the commerce of the European nations.
When Ave were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and inquire first, what the mean-
ing of all (his should be? The Dutchman let us intr
the secret of it at once ; telling us, that the fellow that
sold us the ship, as we said, was no more than a
thief that had run away with her. Then he told us
how the captain, whose name too he mentioned, though
J do not remember it now, was treacherously mur-
dered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, with
three of his men; and that ne, this Dutchman, and
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered
about a great while; till at len^'h he, in particular,
in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam
off to a Dutch ship, which sailing 'near the shore in
its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for
fresh water; that he durst not come to the part of
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the
night to take in the water farther off, and swimming
a great while, at last the ship's boat took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, when
'wo of the seamen helongmg to the shin had arrived,
having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an
account, that the fellow who had run away with tire
ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were
gone a cruising in her; aiuMhat they had already
taken an English ship, and two Dutch ships, very
richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner
said very well, if we had fallen into their hands, and
they had such, a prepossession against us beforehand,
it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves,
or to hope for any good quarters at their hands -, es-
pecially considering that our accusers had been our
judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated, and ungo-
verned passion have executed ; and therefore it wdt
his opinion, we should go directly back to Bengal,
from whence we came, without putting in at any port
whatever; because there we could give an account of
ourselves, and could prove where we were when the
ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the like;
and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put
to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges,
we should be sure to have some justice; and not be
hanged first and judged afterwards. _
I was some time of my partner's opinion ;but after
a little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought
it was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning
to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the
Strait of Malacca; and that if the alarm was given,
we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, as
well bv the Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere;
that if we should be taken, as it were, running away,
we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked
the English sailor's opinion, who said, He was of my
mind, and that we should certainly be taken
This danger a little started my partner, and all the
ship's company; and we immediately resolved to go
away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on lo China
and from ^nence pursuing the first cesign, as tc trade
find some way or other to dispose of the ship, anA
come back in some of the vessels of the country, such
as we could get. This was approved of as the best
method for our security; and accordingly we steered
away N. N. E. keeping above fifty leagues off from
the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniences; for,
first the winds, when we came to that distance from
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade as we call it, from the E. and
E. N. E., so that we were a long while upon our
voyage, and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, might be got in before us; and if not, some
other ship bound to China might have information of
us from them, and pursue us with the same vigour.
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long-boats',
to have been in the most dangerous condition that
ever I was in through all my past life; for whatever
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued
for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thing
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, mucfe
less, thievish. I had chiefly been mine own eriemy;
or, as I may rightly say, I' had been nobody's enemy
but my own. But now I was embarrassed in the
worst condition imaginable; for, though I was perfect
\y iwnocent, I was in no-condition to make that inno-
cence appear: and if I had been taken, it had been
under a supposed guilt of the worst kind; at least,a
rime esteemed so among the people I h^d to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape,
#hough which way to do'it 1 knew not; or what port
or place we should go to. My partner, seeing me
trrtas dejected, though he was the most concerned at
first, began to encourage me; and describing to me tlra
several ports of that coast, told me, he would put io
»n tne coast of Cocmncnma, or the bay of Tonquin;
intending to go afterwards to Macao, a town once in
the possession of the Portuguese, and where still a
^reat many European families resided, and particu-
larly the missionary priests usually went thither, in oiv
iltrto their going forward to China.
Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly,
ihough after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight
of the coast very early in the morning; and upon re-
flection upon the past circumstances we were in, and
the danger, if we nad not escaped, we resolved to put
into a small river, which, however, had depth enough
of water for us, and to see if we could, either over
land or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what
ships where in any port thereabouts. This happy step
was, indeed, our deliverance, for though we did not
immediately see any European ships in the bay of
Tonquin, yet, the next morning, there came into the
bay two Dutch ships; and a third without any colours
spread out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman,
passed by at about two leagues distance, steering for
the coast of China; and, in the afternoon, went by two
English ships, steering the same course; and thus we
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both
one, way and the other. The place we were in was
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by oc-
cupation or profession; and though, i :s true, we had
not much to seek of them, and except getting a few
provisions, cared not how little4^e had to do with
them; yet it was with much difficulty that we kept
ourselves from being insulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of'this country, within a
few leagues of its utmost limits northward, and by
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin: and it was
in this beating up along the shore that we discovered
as above, that in a word, we were surrounded with
enemies. The people we were* among were the most
baroarous of all tne inhabitants (\£ the coast; having
oo correspondence with any other nation, and dealing
only in fish and oil, and such gross commodities:
and it may be particularly seen that they are, as I said,
the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants, viz. that
among other customs they have this one, that if any
vessel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon
their coast, they presently make the men all prisoners,
lhat is to say, slaves; and it was not long before we
found a spice of their kindness this way, on the occa
sion following:
I have observed above that our ship sprung a-leak
at sea, and that we could not find it out: and however
it happened, that, as I have said, it was stopped un-
expectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be
seized by the Dutch and English ships, near the bay
of Siam; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we
were in this place, to lay her on.shore, take out what
heavy things wc had on board, which were not many,
and to wash and clean her bottom, and if possible to
find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lighted the ship, and brought
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one side,
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at
her bottom; for, on second thoughts, we did not care
to lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a
proper place for it.
The^ inhabitants,-who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the shore
to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down on one
side in such a maner, and heeling toward the shore,
and not seems; our men, who were at work on her
bottom with stages, and with their boats, on the off
side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast
away, and lay so very fast on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plur>
der the ship; and if they had found us there, to have
carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever
they call him, for we knew not who was their go-
vernor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work, on
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing and
graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man knows
how.
nis hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down m
the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he understood
his business better than I could teach him, for he
grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by main force
out of their own boat into ours: where, taking him
by the two ears, he beat his head so against Jhe boat'g
gunnel, that the fellow died instantly in his hands;
And, in the mean time, a Dutchman, who stood next,
ook up the musket, and with the but end of it so laid
about him, that he knocked down five of them who
attempted to enter the boat. But this was little to-
wards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearles, be-
cause ignorant of their danger, began to throw them-
selves into the long-boat, where we had but five men
to defend it. But one accident gave our men a com-
plete victory, which deserved our laughter rather than
any thing else, and that was this:—
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just
let down into the boat; one filled with boiling pitch,
and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such
stuff as the shipwrights used for that work; and the
man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle
m his hand, with which he supplied the men that were
at work with that hot stuff: two of the enemy's men
entered the boat just where this fellow stood, being in
the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted them with a
ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and
scalded them, being half naked, that they roared out
like two bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out
"Well done/Jack, give them some more of it;" when
stepping forward himself, he takes one of their mops
and dipping it in the pitch pot, he and his man threw
it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the
men in \hree boats, there was not one that was not
scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful, pitiful
manner, and made such a howling and crying, that I
never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, nothing like
A; for it is worth observing, that though pain natu-
ral jy makes all people cry out, yet every nation have
a particular way of exclamation, and make noises as
different from one another as their speech. I cannot
give the noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it,
for I never heard any thing more like the noise of the
wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in the

were a little surprised, could not imagine what their
design was; but being willing to be sure, we took this
opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and others
to hand diwn arms and ammunition to those that
were at work to defend themselves with if there should
be occasion; and it was no more than need; for, in
less than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they
agreed,.it seems, that the ship was really a wreck; tha/
we were all at work endeavouring to save her, or to
save our lives by the help of our boats; and when we
handed our arms into the boats, they concluded by that
motion that we were endeavouring to save some of
our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted they
all belonged to them, and away they came directly
upon our men, as if it had been a line of battle.
Our men seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and
cried out to us to know what they should do? I imme-
diately called to the men who worked upon the stages,
to slip them down and get u\> the side into the ship*,
'and bade those in the boat to row round and come
on board; and those few of us that were on board
worked with all thestrength and hands we had to bring
the ship to rights; but, however,neither the men upor
the stage, nor those in the boats, could do as they
were ordered, before the Cochinchinese were upon
them, and, with two of their boats, boarded our long-
boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their pri-
soners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English sea-
man, a stout, strong, fellow, who having a musket in
I was never pleased with a victory better in .my
life; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and
that our danger was imminent before; but as we got ,
this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man
the fellow killed with his naked ..ands, and which I
was very much concerned at; for I was sick of kill-
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in
my own defence, knowing they came on errands
which they thought just, and knew no better; and that
though it may be a just thing, because necessary,?for
diere is no necessary wickedness in nature; yet I
thought it was a sad "life, when we must be always
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve
ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still; and I would,
even now, suffer a great deal, rather than I would
take away the life even 'of the worst person injuring
me. J believe, also, all considering people, who know
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they en-
tered seriously into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story. All the while this was
doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the
men on board, had with great dexterity brought
the ship almost to rights; and, having gotten the guns
into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid
)ur boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not
sffttr to fire, for the carpenter would do the work
without him; but bade him heat another pitch kettle,
which our cook, who was on board, took care of. But
:he enemy was so terrified with what they met with
»n their first attack, that they would not come on
again; and some of them tnat were fartnest off, seeing
Jie ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we sup-
posed, to see their mistake, and gave over the enter-
prise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we
got clear of this merry fight; and having gotten some
rice, and some roots and bread, with about sixteen
good big hogs on board two days before, we resolved
to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever
came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be
surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps
more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us.'
We therefore got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. In
the meantime, lying at an anchor some distance from
the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now
in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if
any enemy had presented. The next day, having
finished our work within board, and finding our ship
was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail, we
would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we
wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen se-
veral ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before;
so we kept on N. E. toward the isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant-ship, as a Dutch or English merchant-ship in
the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine
islands, and this we did, that we might not fall into
the way of any of the European ships; and then we
steered north again, till we came to the latitude of 22
degrees 20 minutes, by which means we made the
island of Formosa directly, where we came to an
anchor, in order to get water and fresh provisions,
which the people there, who are very courteous and
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly, and
dealt verv fairlv and nunctuallv with us in all theii
agreements and bargains, which is what wt aid not
find among other people, and may be owing to the re-
mains of Christianity, which was once planted here by
a Dutch mission of Protestants, and is a testimony of
what I have often observed, viz. that the Christian
religion always civilizes the people and reforms their
manners, where it is received, whether it works sav-
ing effects upon them or not.
From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beyond all the ports of China where our European
ships usually come; but being resolved, if possible,
not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not fail of being entirely ruined ; nay, so great was
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them,
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chosen
to fall into the hands of the Spanish Inquisition.
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we
resolved to put into the first trading port we should
come at, and standing in for the sho*e, a boat came
off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on
board, who, knowing us to be an European ship,
came to offer his service, which indeed we were very
glad of, and took him on board; upon which, without
asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat
he came in, and sent it back.
I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began
to talk with him about carrying us to the gulf of Nan-
quin, which is the most northern part of the coast of
thina. 'The old man said he knew the gulf of Nan-
quin very well; but smiling, asked us what we would
do there?
I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us. our best port had been to have put in ai
Macao, where we could not fail of a mat kef for nm
opium to our satisfaction, and .might, for our money, |
have p jrchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as
we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
<*f which he was very opinionated, or oonceited, I
told him we were gentlemen, as well as merchants,
and that we had a'min'd to go and see the great city
of *Pekin, and the famous court of the monarchs of
China. "Why then," says the old man," you should
go to Ningpo, where, by'the river that runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the
great canal. This canal is a navigable made stream,
which goes through the heart of that vast empire of
China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable
hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to
the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred
and seventy leagues."
"Well," said I, "Seignior Portuguese, but that is
not our business now-; the great question is, if you can
carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we
can travel to Pekin afterwards?" Yes, he said, he
could do so very well, and there was a great Dutch
ship gone that way just before. This gave me a
little shock; a Dutch ship was now our &rror, and we
had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had
not come in too frightful a figure; we depended upon
it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we
were in no condition to fight them; all the ships they
trade with in those parts, being of great burden, and of
much greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and said
to me, " Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of
the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation."—" No," said I, "that's true; but I
know not what liberties men may take when they are
out of the reach of the laws of their country."—
"Why," said he, " you are no pirates, what need
you fear; they will not meddle with peaceful me>
ehanis. sure."
If I had any blo'od in my body that did not fly up
into my face at that word, it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it;
for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion
imaginable; nor was it possible foi me to conceal it
so, but that the old man easily perceived it.
"Sir," said he, "I find you are in some disorder in
your thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which
way you think fit, and depend upon it I'll do you al
the service I can."—" Wh)1-, Seignior," said 1, "it is
true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution at this
time, whether to go in particular; and I am something
more so for what you said about pirates. I hope there
are no pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill con-
dition to meet with them; for you see we have but a
small force, and very weakly manned."
"O Sir," said he, "do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward; nor
was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work:
she was not built for a privateer, but was run away
with by a reprobate crew that were on board, after
the captain and some of his men had been murdered
by the Malaccans, at or near the island of Sumatra."
"What!" said 1, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, "did they murder the captain?"—"No,"
said he, "I do not understand that they murdered
him; but as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it
is generally believed they betrayed him into the hands
of the Malaccans, who did murder him; and, per-
haps, they procured them to do it."—" Why then,"
saijl 1, " they deserved death, as much as if they had
done it themselves."—"Nay," said the old man,
»* they do deserve it, and they will certainly have it, if
they light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they
have all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue
mcy will give him no quarter."
But," said 1 to him, " you say the pirate is gono
137
out of these seas; how can they meet with him then ?*
~" Why, that is true," said lie," they do say so;
but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the
river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were
left on shore'when they ran away with her; and some
English and Dutch traders being in the river, they
were within a little of taking him. Nay," said he
* if the foremost boats had been well seconded by th
rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding
only two boats within reach of him, tacked about,
and firec! at these two, and disabled them before the
others came up ; and then standing off to sea, the
others were not able to follow him, and so he got
away. But they have all so exact a description of the
ship, that they will be sure to know him; and where-
ever they find him, they have vowed to give no quar-
ter to either the captain or the seamen, but to hang
them all up at the yard-arm."
"What!" said I, *« will they execute them, right
or wrong; hang them first, and judge them after-
wards?"—" O sir!" said the old pilot, " there is no
need to make a formal business of it with such rogues
as those; let them tie them back to back, and set them
a-diving; it is no more than they rightly deserve."
1 knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he
could do me no harm; so I turned short upon him.
"Well, Seignor," said I," and this is the very rea-
son why I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and
not to put back to Macao, or to any other part of the
country where the English or Dutch ships came; foi
lie it known to you, Seignor, those captains of the
English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to
"justice, or how to behave themselves as the laws of
God and nature direct; but being proud of theii
offices and not understanding their power, they would
act the murderers to punish robbers; would take upon
ihem to insult men falselv accused, and determine
tnem gunty witnout due inquiry; and perhaps I may
live to call some of them to an account of it, where
they may be taught how justice is to be executed; and
that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some
evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the
man."
With this I told him, that this was the very ship they
had attacked; and gave him a full account of the skir-
mish we had with tjjeir boats, and how foolishly and
coward-like they had belyived. J told him all the
story of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchman
served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe
that this story of killing the master by the Malaccans
was not true; as also the running away with the ship;
but that it was all a fiction of their own, to suggest
that the men were turned pirates; and they ought to
have been sure it was so, before they had ventured to
attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men
who were killed there, in our just defence, to answer
for.
The old man was amazed at this relation ; and told
us, we were very much in the right to go away to the
north; and that if he might advise us, it should be to
sell the ship in China, which we might very well do,
and buy*or build another is the country; " And,"
said he, " though you will not get so good a ship, yet
you may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else."
I told him I would take his a/lvice when I came to
any port where I cojald find a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He replied, I should meet
with customers enough for'the ship at Nanquin, and
hat a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go
back again; and that he would procure me people
both to buy one and sell the other.
"Well, but, Seignior," says I, " as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest,
mnocent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, bo
murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find th«
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by prov-
ing this was the ship, and so innocent men may pro-
bably be overpowered and murdered."—«« Why," said
the old man, " I'll find out a way to prevent that
also; for as I know all those commanders you speak
of very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I
will b^ sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let
them know that they had been so much in the wrong;
that though the people who were on board at first
might run away with the ship, yet it was not true tha»
they had turned pirates; and that in particular those
were not the men that first went off with the ship, but
innocently bought her for their trade; and I am per
suaded they will so far believe me, as, at least, to act
more cautiously for the time to come."—" Well," said
I, " and will you deliver one message to them from
me?"—"Yes, I will," says he, "if you will give it
under your hand, in writing, that I maybe able to
prove it came from you, and not out of my own
head." I answered, that I would readily give it him
under my hand. So I took a pen and ink, and paper,
and wrote at large the story of assaulting me with tho
long-boats, &x. the pretended reason of it, and the
unjust, cruel design of it; and concluded to the com-
manders that they had done what they not only should
have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever they came
to England, and I lived to see them there, they should
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were
not grown out of use before I arrived there.
My old pilot read this over and over again, anJ
asked me several times if I would stand to it. 1 an
swered, I would stand to it so long as I had any thing
left in the world: being sensible that I should, one
time or other, find an opportunity to put it home to
them. But we had no occasion ever to let the pilol
carry this letter, for he never went back again. While
those things were passing betweetr us, by way %f di*
course, we went forward directly for Nanquin, an-*,
in about thirteen days sail, came to ancnor at tK
Boutli west point of the great gulf of Nanquin; where
by the way, I came by accident to understand, that
the two Dutch ships were gone that length before me,
and that 1 should certainly fall into their hands. I
consulted my partner again in this exigency, and h«
was as much at a loss as" I was, and would very gl&tfly
Wave been safe on shore .almost any where. How-
ever, I was not in such perplexity neither, but I asked
the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour, which
I might put into, and pursue my business with the
Chinese privately, and be in no clanger of the enemy.
He told me if 1 would sail to the southward about
two-and-forty leagues, there was a little port called
Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually
landed from Macao, on their progress to teach theChris-
tion religion to the Chinese, and where no European
ships ever put in: and, if I thought proper to put in
there, I might consider what farther course to take
when r was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a place for merchants, except that at some certain
times they had a kind of a fair there, when the mep-
chants from Japan came over thither to buy theChinese
merchandises.
We all agreed to go back to this place: the name
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell
wrong, for I do not particularly remember it, having
lost this, together with the names of many other places
set down in a little pocket book, which was spoiled by
the water, on an accident which I shall relate in its
order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or
Japanese merchants we correspond with, call it by a
different name from that which our Portuguese pilot
gave it, and pronounced it as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to^go to
this place, we weighed the next day, having only gone
twice on shore, where we were to get fresh water- on
both which occasions the people of the country were
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of things
lo sell to us; I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea,
fie* apd *wne fowls; but nothing without money.
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary) not till five days; but it was very much to oui
satisfaction, and I was joyful, and I may say thank-
ful, when I set my foot'safe on shore, resolving, and
my partner too, thatif it was possible to dispose of
ourselves and effects any other way, though not every
way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot
on board that unhappy vessel again: and indeed I
must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life
that ever 1 had any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in
constant fear. Well does the Scripture say, "The
fear of man brings a snare;" it is a life of death, and
the mind is so entirely suppressed by it, that it is ca-
pable of no relief; the animal spirits sink, and all the
vigour of nature, which usually supports men undei
other afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest
exigencies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the
fancy, by heightening every danger;, representing the
English and Dutch captains to be men incapable of
hearing reason, or distinguishing between honest men
and rogues; or between a story calculated for our own
turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to decieve, and
a true genuine account of our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the
goods we had on board, the course wc steered, our
frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such and
such ports; even our very manner, the force we had,
the number of men, the few arms, little ammunition,
and short provisions; all these would have served ic
convince any man that we were no pirates. The
opium, and other goods we had on board, would
make it appear that the ship had been at Bengal; the
Dutchman, who it is said, had the names of all the
men that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many
jthe* rmrticvtlar circumstances, micht have made ii
evident to the understanding of any commander, whose
hands Ave might fall into, that we were no pirates. •
But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered
our understandings, and set the imaginations to work,
to form a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps, might
never happen. »We first supposed, as indeed every
body that related to us, that the seamen on board the
English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch,
were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especi-
ally at our beating off their boats, and escaping, that
they would not give themselves leave to inquire
whether we were pirates or no; but would execute us
off-hand, as we call it, without giving us any room foi
a defence. We reflected that there was really so mucn>
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce
inquire after any more: as, first, that the ship was cer-
tainly the same, and that some of the seamen among
them knew her, and had been on board her; and,
secondly, that when we had intelligence at the rivei
Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine
us, we fought their boats, and fled: so that we made
no doubt but they were as fully satisfied, of our being
pirates as we were satisfied of the contrary; and I
often said, I knew not but I should have been apt to
have taken the like circumstances for evidence, if the
tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have
made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces,
without believing, or perhaps considering, \tftiat they
might have to offer in their defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our appre-
hensions ; and both my partner and I too scarce slept
a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms;
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken ,
of killing, and being killed; and one night, I was /in
such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seaman
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of
the cabin I lay in, with such a force as wounded my j
hand most grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and j
bruised the flesh, so that it not only waked me out of
my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost
two of my fingers.
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel usag«
we should meet w'nh from them, if we fell into their
hands: then the story of Amboynacame into my head,
and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, as they
did our countrymen there; and make some of our
men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimei
they never were guilty of; own themselves, and all of
us, to be pirates; and so they would put us to death,
with a formal appearance of justice; and that they
might be tempted to do this for the gain of our'ship
and cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds, put all together.
These things tormented me, and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the captains
of ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had
surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac-
countable for it when they came into their own coun-
try. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for, if they
will act thus with us, what advantage would it be to
us that they would be called to an account for it? or,
if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction
would it be to us to have them punished when they
came home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
T now had upon the past variety of my particular cir-
cumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I, who
had spent forty years in a life of continued difficulties,
and was at last come, as it were, at the port or haven
which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty,
should be a volunteer in new sorrows, by my own un-
happy choice; and that I, who had escaped so many
dangers in my youth, should now come to be hanged
in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime I
was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of;
and in a place and circumstance, where innocence was
not like to be "any protection at all to me.
Aftev these thoughts, something of religion wouxd
,ome in; and 1 would be consirlering.that this seemed
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence;
and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it as such •
that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from
being innocent as to my Maker , and I ought to look
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were
most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution ; and that
l ought to submit to this, just as I would to a ship-
wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a
disaster upon me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take
its place -v and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous resolution, that 1 would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have fallen
into the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters,
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me, when they
nad taken me, than by those who would perhaps glut
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbari-
ties .- that, in the case of the savages, I always resolved
to die fighting to the last gasp; and why should 1 not
do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me
at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than
ever it was to think of being eaten by men? for the
savages, give them their due, would not eat a man till
he was dead ; and killed him first, as we do a bullock;
but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty
of death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed I was
sure to put myself into a kind of fever, with the agita-
tions of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and
my eyes sparkle, as if "I was engaged; and I always
esolved that I would take no quarter at their hands;
nt even at last, if I could resist no longer, I would
blow up the ship, and all that was in her, and leave
them.but little booty to boast of.
But by how much the greater weight the anxieties
and perplexities of those things were to our thoughts
w'tile we were at sea, by so.much the greater was our
139
satisfaction when we sawourseiveson snore; ana mj
partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy
load upon his back, which he was to cany up a hill,
and found that he was not able to stand long under it;
but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off their back,
And the hill disappeared, the ground before him show-
ing all smooth and plain; and truly it was so; we
were all like men who had a load taken off their backs.
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, whc
was now our friend, got usa lodging, and a warehouse
for our goods, which, by the way, was much the same:
. it was a little house, or hut with a large house joining
to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with
large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which it
seems there were not a few in the country. However,
the magistrates allowed us all a little guard, and we r ad
a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, whc
stood sentinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint
of rice, and a little piece of money, about the value ol
three-pence, per day; so that our goods were kept
very safe.
The fair or mart usually kept in this place had been
over some time; however, we found that there were
three or four junks in the river, and two Japanners, I
mean ships from Japan, with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone away, having
Japanese merchants on shore.
The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for ui
was to bring us acquainted with three' missionary Ro-
mish priests, who were in the town, and who ban
been there some time, converting the people to Chris-
tianity; but we thought they made but poor work of
K, and made them but sorry Christians when they had
done. However that was not our business. One of
these was a Frenchman, whom they called Fathei
Simon; he was a jolly well-conditioned man, ver\
*ree in his conversation, not seeming so serious ana
grave as the other two did, one of whom was a Por-
tuguese, and the other a Genoese: but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agreeablo
company; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work
they came about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate them-
selves among .the inhabitants wherever they had oppor-
\ tunity. We often ate and drank with those men; and
though I must confess, the -conversion, as they call it,
of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the pue
conversion required to bring heathen people to the
faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more
than letting them know the name of Christ, say some
t prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue
which they understand not, and to cross themselves,
and the like ; yet it must be confessed that these reli-
gious, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief
that these people should be saved, and that they are
the instrument of it; and, on this account, they under-
go not only the fatigue of the voyage, and hazards of
living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, with
the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work:
and it would be a great want of charity in us, what-
ever opinion we have of the work itself, and the man-
ner of their doing it, if we should not have a good opi-
nion of their zeal, who undertake it with so many haz-
ards, and who have no prospect of the least temporal
advantage to themselves.
But to return to my story: This French priest,
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor; and waited only for
anothor priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with, him; and we scarce ever
met together but he was inviting me to go that jour-
ney with him, telling me, how he would show me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire ; and among
tne rest, the greatest city in the world ; " A city," said
he, "that your London and our Pans put togethei
cannot be equal to." This was the city of Pekin,
which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of
people; but as I looked on those things with different
eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of
them in few words, when 1 come, in the course of mf
travels, to speak more particularly of them.
But first I come t/> my friar or missionary: dining
with .him one day, and being very merry together, I
showed some little inclination to go with him; and he
pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a
great many persuasions, to consent. "Why, Father
iSimon," says my partner, " why should you'desire
!our company so much? You know we are heretics,
jand you do not love us, nor can keep us company
with any pleasure."—" O!" says he, "you may, per-
haps, be good Catholics in time; my business here is
to convert heathens, and who knows but I may con-
vert you too?"—" Very well, Father," said I, "so
you will preach to us all the way."—" I won't be
troublesome to you," said he, "our religion does not
divest us of good manners; besides," said he, " we
are all here like countrymen, and so we are, compared
to the place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and
I a Catholic, we may be all Christians at last; at least,"
said he, " we are all gentlemen, and we may converse
50, without being uneasy to one another." I liked that
part of his discourse very well, and it began to put me
in mind of my priest that I had left in the Brasils;
but this Father Simon did not come up to his charac-
ter by a great deal; for though Father Simon had no
appearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet ha
had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and
sincere affection to religion that my other good eccle-
siastic had, of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had something
else before us at that time; for we had all this while
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of; and wo
began to be very doubtful what we shouid do; for we
were now in a place of very little business, and once
I was about to venture to sail for the nvei of Kilan\
and the city of Nanquin: but Providence seemed now
more visible, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself
in our affairs; and I was encouraged from this very
time to think I should, one way or other, get out of
this entangled circumstance, and be brought home to
my own country again, though I had not the least
view of the manner; and when 1 began sometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what method it wai
to be done. Providence, I sayi began here to clear
up our way a little; and the first thing that offered
was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan
merchant to us, who began to inquire what goods we
J)ad; and, in the first place, he bought all our opium.
Hid gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold
by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin,
and some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven
ounces each. While we were dealing .with him for
our opium, it came into my head, that he might, per-
haps, deal with us for the ship too; and 1 ordered the
interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up his
shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but
in a few days after, he came to me, with one of the
missionary priests for his interpreter, and told rne4ie
had a proposal to make to me, and that was this: he
had bought a great quantity of goods of us when he
had no thoughts (or proposals made to him) of buying
the ship, and that, therefore, he had not money enough
to pay for the^ship; but if I would let the same men
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence
to the Philippine islands with another loading, which
he would pay the freight of before they went from
Japan; and that, at their return, he would buy the
ship. I began to listen to his proposal; and so eager
did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not
but begin to entertain a notion myself of going with
him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands away
to the South Seas; and accordingly I asked the Ja-
panese merchat t if he would not hire us to the Philip-
pine islands, and discharge us there. He said, no, he
could not do that, for then he could not have the return
of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, he
said, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking
him at that proposal, and going myself; but my part-
ner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, repre-
senting the dangers, as well of the seas, as of the Ja-
panese, who are a false, cruel, treacherous people;
and then of the Spaniards at the Phillippines, more
false, more cruel, more treacherous than they.
But, to bring this long turn of our affairs to a com-
clusion, the first thing we had to do was to consult
with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and
know if they were willing to go to Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my
nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me that he thought that
voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I
undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I pleas
ed to order him; and if ever he came to England, and
I was there, and alive, he would render me a faithful
account of his success, and it should be as much mino
as I pleased.'
I was really loath to part with him; but consider
ing the prospect of advantage, which was really con-
siderable, and that he was a young fellow as likely to
do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go;
but first I told him, I would consult my partner, and
gi/e him an answer the next day. My parUiei and I
discoursed about it, and my partner made a most ge-
nerous offer: he told me, ** You know it has been an
unlucky ship, and we both resolve not to go to sea in
it again; if your steward (so he called my man) will
venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel to
him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live
v.o meet in England, and he meets with success abroad,
he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship'*
freight to us, the other shall be his own."
If rhy partner, who was no way concerned with
my young man, made him such an offer, I could da
no less than offer him the same; and all the ship's
company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing
from him, obliging him to account for the other;
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant
{)roved a very punctual honest man to him, protected
lim at Japan, and got him a licence to come on shore>
which the Europeans in general have not lately ob-
tained, paid him his freight very punctually, sent him
to the Philippines, loaded him with Japan and China
wares, and a supercargo of their own, who traffick-
ing with the Spaniards, brought back European goods
again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spice*;
and there he was not only paid his freight very well,
and at a very good price, but being not willing to
6ell the ship then, the merchant furnished him with
goods on his own account; that for some money and
some spices of his own, which he brought with him,
he went back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, whew,
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a
good aquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made
a free ship; adl the governor of Manilla hired him to
go to Acapulco, in America, on the coast of Mexico;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to
Mexico; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe,
with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily,
emd there he sold his ship; and having there also ob-
tained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he
found means, some how or other, to go to Jamaica
with all his treasure; and about eight years after came
to England, exceeding rich; of which I shall take
notice in its place; in the mean time, I return to our
particular affairs.
Being now to part with the ship and ship's com-
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider wflfat
re> oinpense we should give to the two men that gave
to such timely notice of the design against us in the
^ver of Cambodia. The truth was, they had dor»
us a considerable service, and deserved well at our
hand; though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues too; for, as they believed the story of our be-
ing pirates, and that we had really run away with the
ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed after
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a-rogue-
ing brought him to do it. However, the service they
did us was not the less; and, therefore, as I had pro-
mised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the mo-
ney to be paid to them, which they said was due to
them on board their respective ships; thac is to say,
the Englishman nineteen months pay, and to the
Dutchman seven; and, over and above that, I gave
each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
consented them very well: then I made the English-
man gunner of the ship, the gunner being now made
second mate and purser: the Dutchman I made boat-
swain: so they were both very well pleased, and
proved very serviceable, being both able seamen,
and very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home foi
my money, what could I think of myself now, when
1 was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from
Jiome, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pros-
pect of return!
All we had for it was this, that in about four months
time there was to be another fair at that place where
we were, and then we might be able to purchase all
sorts of the manufactures of the country, and withal
might possibly find some Chinese junks or vessels
from Nanquin, that would be to be sold, and would
carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I
liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our
particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any En*
elite 1 or Dutch shins came thither, perhaps we mighi
nave an opportunity to load our goods, and get pas*
sage to some other place in India nearer home.
Upon these hopes \ve resolved to continue here;
but to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
neys into the country; first, we went ten days journey
to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing
indeed: they say it has a million of people in it t
which, however I do not believe: it is regularly built*
(he streets all exactly straight, and cross one anothei
in direct lines, which gives the figure of it great ad-
vantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable peopla
of these countries with ours; their fabrics, their man-
ner of living, their government, their religion, theit
wealth, and their glory, (as some call it) I must con-
fess, I do not so much as think it worth naming, or
worth my while to write of, or any,that shall come
after me to read.
It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran-
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go-
vernment, the manufactures, the commerce, and the
conduct of these people; not that they are to be won-
dered at, or indeed, in the least to be regarded; but
because, having first a notion of the barbarity of those
countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail
there, we do not expect to find any such things so
far off.
Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France
and Spain? What are their cities to ours, for wealth,
strength, gayety of apparel, rich furniture, and an infi
nite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our merchants'
fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our city -of
London has more trade than all their mighty empire. >
One English, or Dutch, or French man of war, of
ieighty guns, would fight with and destroy all the ship-
ping of China. But the greatness of their wealth,
their trade, the power of their government, and strength
141
ol tneir armies are surprising to us, because, as I have
said, considering them as a barbarous nation of pa-
gans, litUe better than savages, we did not expect such
things among them; and this, indeed, is the advan-
tage with which all their greatness and power is re-
presented to us: otherwise, it is in itseli nothing al
all; for, as I have said of their ships, so it may hi
said of their armies and troops; all the forces of tbeii
empire, though they were to bring two millions of
men into the field together, would be able to do no-
thing but ruin the country and starve themselves. If
they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to
fight a disciplined army, one line of German cuiras-
siers, or of French cavalry, would overthrow all the
horse of China; a million of their foot could not stand
before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be
one to twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if 1
say, that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000
French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China.
And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of olii
engineers, in assaulting and defending towns; there
is not a fortified town in China could hold out one
month against the batteries and attacks of a European
army; and at the same time, all the armies of China
could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided
it was not starved: no, not in ten years siege. They
have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward,
clumsy, and uncertain in going off; they have pow-
der, but it is of no strength ; they have neither disci-
pline in the field, exercise in their arms, skill to attack,
nor temper to retreat. And therefore I must confess
it seemed strange to me when I came home, and
neard our people say such fine things of the power,
riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese,
because I saw and knew that they were a contempti-
ble herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected
•to a government qualified only to rule such a people;
and* in a word, for I am now launched quite besid*
my design, I say, in a word, were not its distance
inconceivably great from Muscovy, and were not tn€-
Muscovite empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-
governed a crowd of slaves as they, the czar of Mus-
covy might, with much ease, drive them all out of theii
country, and conquer them in one campaign; and
had the czar, who 1 since hear is a growing prince,
and begins to appear formidable in the world, fallen
this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in
which attempt none of the powers of Europe would
have envied or interrupted him; he might, by this
time, have been emperor of China, instead of being
beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the lat-
ter was not one to six in number. As their strength
and their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce,
and husbandry, are imperfect and impotent, compared
to the same things in Europe. Also, in their know-
ledge, their learning, their skill in the sciences; they
have-globes and spheres, and a smatch of the know-
ledge of the mathematics; but when you come to in-
quire into their knolwedge, how short-sighted are the
wisest of their students! They know nothing of the
motion of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, ab-
surdly ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed, they
think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away
with it; and they fall a-clattering with all the drume
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster
away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of this kind which 1
have made in all the account I have given of my na-
vels, so I shall make no more descrip*ions of coun-
tries and people: it is none of my business, or any
part of my design; but giving an account of my own
adventures, through a life of infinite wanderings, and
a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few have
heard the like of, I shall say nothing of the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people, I have
yet to pass through, more than relates to my owd
story, and which my concern among them will make
necessary. I was now, as near as 1 can compute, in
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty do-
«?ees north of the line, for we were returned fror-
franquin; I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pa
kin, which 1 had heard so much of, and Father Simoa
importuned me daily to do it. At length his time of
going away being set, and the other missionary who
was to go with him, being arrived from Macao, it
was necessary that we should resolve either to go, of
not to go: so I referred him to my partner, and let
it wholly w his choice; who at length resolved it in
the affirmative; and v/e prepared for our journey
We set out with very good advantage, as to finding the
way; for we got leave to travel in ihe retinue of one
of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy, yr principal
magistrate, in the province where they reside, and
who take great state upon them, travelling with great
attendance, and with great homage from the people,
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them,
because all the countries they pass through are obliged
to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants.
That which 1 particularly observed, as to our travel-
ling with his baggage, was this; that though we re-
ceived sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our
horses, from the country, as belonging to the mandarin,
yet we were obliged to pay for every thing we had
after the market price of the country, and the manda-
rin's steward, or commissary of the provisions, col-
lected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the
retinue of the mandarin, though it was a very great
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in him,
but was, indeed, a great advantage to him, consider-
ing there were about thirty other people travelling in
Jbe same manner besides us, under the protection of hi*
retinue, or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This
I say, was a great advantage to him: for the country
furnished all the provisions for nothing, and he took
all our money for them.
Wc were five and twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the way of
living, all very miserable, though they boast so muck
of the industry of the people: I say miserable, and
co it is; if we, who understand how to live, weie to
endure it, or to compare it with our own; but not so
to these poor wretches, who know no other. The
pride of these people is infinitely great, and exceeded
by nothing but their poverty, which adds to that
which I call their misery. I must needs think the
naked savages of America live much more happy, be-
cause, as they have nothing, so they'desire nothing,
whereas these are proud and insolent, and, in the
main, are mere beggars and drudges; their ostenta-
tion is inexpressible, and is chiefly showed in thew
clothes and buildings, and in the keeping multitudes of
servants or slaves, and, which is to the last degree
ridiculous, their contempt of all the world but them-
selves.
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after-
wards, in the deserts and vast wilderness of Grand
Tariary, than here: and yet the roads here are well
paved and well kept, and very convenient for travel-
lers, but nothing was more awkward to me, than to
see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all
their famed ingenuity is no more. My friend, Father
Simon, and T, used to be very merry on these oc-
casions, to see the beggarly pride of those people.
For example, coming by the house of a country gen-
tleman, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues
off from the city of Nanquin, we had, first of al),
the honour to ride with the master of the house about,
two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don, was very proper for a
scaramouch, or merry-andrew: bein:; a dirty calico,
with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, such a9
hanging sleeves, taffety, and cuts and slashes almost
on every side: it covered a rich tajfety vest, as greasy
us a butcher, and which testified, that his honour must
needs be a most exquisite sbven.
His horse, was a poor, lean, starved hobbling crea

tare, such as in England might sell for about thirty
or forty shillings; and he had two slaves followed nim
on foot, to drive the poor creature along: he had a
whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast
about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and
thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants;
and we were told he was going from the city 10 hii
country-seat, about half a league'before us. We tra
veiled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode
away before us; and as we stopped at a village about
an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country-
seat of this great man, we saw him in a little place
before his door, eating his repast; it was a kind of a
garden; but he was easy to be seen; and we were
to understand, that the more we looked on him, the
better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head, and
on the south side; but under the tree also was placed
a large uinbrell'a, which made that part look well
enough: he sat. lolling back in a great elbow chair,
being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being
brought him by two women slaves: he had two more
whose office, I think few gentlemen in Europe would
accept of their service in, viz. one kd the 'squire
with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one
nand, and scraped off what he let fall on his wor-
ship's beard, and taffety.vest,with the other; while the
great fat brute thought it below him to employ his
cwn hands in any of those familiar offices, which kings
and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with
the clumsy fingers of their servants.
I took this time to think what pain men's pride
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tern,
per, thus ill managed, must be to a man of common
sense; and,leaving the poor wretch to please himself
with our looking at him, as if we admired his pomp,
whereas we really pitied and contemned him, wc
pursued our journey: only Father Simon had the cu-
riosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the
country justice had to feed on, in all his state; which
he said he had the honour to taste of, and which was,
I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce
have eaten, if it had been offered him, viz. a mess of
boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and »
little bag filled with green 'pepper, and another plant
which they have there, something like our ginger
but smelling like musk and tasting like mustard; ali
this was put together, and a small lump or piece of
lean mutton boiled in it; and this was his worship'*
repast, four or five servants more attending at a dis-
tance. If he fed them meaner than lie was fed him-
self, the/spice excepted, they must fare very coarsely
indeed.
As for ovu mandarin with whom we travelled, he
was respected like a king; surrounded always with
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a dis-
tance; but this I observed, that there was not a horse
in his retinue, but tnat our carriers' pack-horses in
England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
and such-like trumpery, that you cannot see whether
they are fat or lean, in a word, we could scarce sec
any thing but their feet and their heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity that I had given an account of being over,
I bad no anxious thoughts about me; which made
this journey much the pleasanter to me, nor had I
any ill accident attended me, only in the passing 01
fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free
of the country, as they call it; that is to say, threw
me in: the place was not deep, but it wetted rne all
over: I mention it, because it spoiled my pocket-
book, wherein I had set down the names of several
people and places which I had occasion to remember,
and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted,
and the words were never after to be read, to my greal
Joss, as to the names of some places which I touched
at in this voyage
At length we arrived at Pekin: I had nobody with
me but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had
given me to attend me as a servant, and who proved
very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody
with him but one servant, who was a kinsman. Ai
for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see th»
court, we gave him his passage, that is to say, bore
J his charges for his company; and to use him as an in-
terpreter, for he understood the language of the cour-
try, and spoke good French and a little English; and
indeed, this old man was a most useful implement to
us every where, for we had not been above a week
at Pekin, when he came laughing: "Ah, Seignior In-
glese," said he, " I have something to tell you, will
make youi heart glad."—"My heart glad," said I;
"what can that be? I don't know any thing in thii
country can either give me joy.or grief, to any great
degree."—u Yes, yes, said the old man, in broken
English, «* make you glad, me sorrow:" sorry, he
would have said. This made me more inquisitive.
u Why," said 1, "will it make you sorry ?"—" Be
cause," said he, "you have brought me here twenty-
five days journey, and will leave me to go back alone;
and which way shall I get to my port afterwards,
without a ship, without a horse, without pecune?" so
he called money; being his broken Ltttin, of which he
had abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovy and Polish merchants in the city, and thai
they were preparing to set out on their journey, by
land, to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and ht
was sure we would take the opportunity to go with
them, and leave him behind to go back alone. I con-
fess I was surprised with this news: a secret joy
spread itself over my whole soul, which I cannot de-
scribe, and never felt before or since; and I nad nc
power, for a gooi while, to speak a word to the old
man , but at last I turned to him: "How do yo*
know this?" said I: "are you sure it is true?"—
"Yes," he said, " t met this morning m the street
in old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one
you call a Grecian, who is among them; he came last
from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind,
and is now resolved to go back with the caravan to
Moscow, and so down the river of Wolga to Astra-
can."—" Well, Seignior," said I, " do not be uneasy
about being left to go back alone; if this be a method
for my return to England, it shall be your fault if
you go back to Macao at all.?' We then went to cork
suit together what was to be done, and I asked my
partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and whe-
ther it would suit with his affairs: he told me he
would do /ust as I would; for he had settled all his
affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in such
good hands, that as we made a good voyage here, if
he could vest in China silks, wrought and raw, such
as might be worth the carriage, he would be content
to go to England, and then make his voyage back to
Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this', we agreed, that, if out
Portuguese'pilot would go with us, we would bear hi*
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased;
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him far-
ther; for the service he had done us was really worth
all that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot
to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker for us
on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan mer-
chant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it; and, being willing
V) gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing him jus-
tice, and very willing also to have him with us besides,
for he was a most neccessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, vhich,
as I compute it, came to about one hundred and
•eventy-five pounds sterling between us, and to bear
his charges, both for himself and horse, except only a
horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him
143
to let mm know what we had resolved: I told him,
he had complained of our being like to let h:.m gc
back alone, and I was now to tell him we were re-
solved he should not go hack at all: that as we had
resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolv-
ed also he should go with us, and thai we called him
lo know his mind. He shook his head, and said ii
was a long journey, and he had no pecune to carry
him thither, nor to subsist himself when he came thi-
ther. We told him we believed it was so, and there-
fore we had resolved to do something for him, thai
should let him see how sensible we were of the service
he,had done us; and also how agreeable he was to
Us: and then I told him what we had resolved to give
him here, which he might lay out as we-, would do
our own; and that as for his charges, if he would go
with us, we would set him safe ashore (life and casual
ties excepted,) either in Muscovy or in England,
which he would, at our own charge, except only the
carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other merchants, they had many things
to do; and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some odd days before all things
were got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when
we set out from Pekin. My partner, and the old pilot
had gone express back to the port where we had first
put in, to dispose of some goods which he had left
there; and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had
Borne knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where 1
bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two
hundred pieces of other very fine silks, of several
sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought
to Pekin against my partner's return: besides this.
we bought a very large quantity of raw silk and
6ome other goods; our cargo amounting, in these
goods only, to about three thousand five hundred
pounds sterling, which, together with tea, and some
fine calicoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and
cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share,
besides those we rode upon; which, with two or three
spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions,
made us in short, twenty six camels and horses in our
retinue. *
The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember,, made between three and four hundred
horses and camels, and upwards of a hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events. For as the eastern caravans are subject to be
attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars:
but they are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs,
nor so barbarous when they prevail
The company consisted of people of several na-
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly: for there were
about sixty of them who were merchants or inhabi-
tants of Moscow, though of them some were Livo-
nians; and to our particular satisfaction, five of them
were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great
experience in,business, and very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the passen-
gers, except the servants, to a great council, as they
termed it. At this great council every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common stock, foi
the necessary expense of buying forage on the wav,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfy
ing the guides, getting horses, and the like. Anr-
here they constituted the journey, as they called it, viz.
they named captains and officers to draw us all up,
and give the command in case of an attack; and gav«
every one their turn of command. Nor was this form-
ing us into order anv more than what we found need-
ful upon the way, as shall be observed in its place.
Tne road all on this side of the country is very po-
pulous, and is full of potters and earth makers; that
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the
China ware; and, as I was going along, our Portu-
guese pilot, who had always something or other to say
to make us merry, came sneering to tne, and told me,
le would show the greatest rarity in all the country?
and that 1 should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that I had
>een one thing which was not to be seen in all the
world beside. I was very importunate to know what
t was; at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house,
milt all with China ware. ** Well," said I, " are
-iot the materials of their building the product of their
)vvn country • and so it is all China ware, is it not?"
—" No, no," says he, " I mean it is a house all
<nade of China ware, such as you call so in England;
ar, as it is called in our country, porcelean."—u Well
said 1, "such a thing may be: how big is it? can
we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we
will'buy it."—"Upon a camel!" said the old pilot,
Holding up both his hands; "why there is a family
)i' thirty people lives in it."
1 was~ then curious, indeed, to see it; and when 1
came to see it, it was nothing but this: it was a tim-
oer house, or a house built, as we call it in England,
with lath and plaster, but all the plastering was really
China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with tie
earth that maKes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked .very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in
Lngland is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot,
were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the
little square tiles we call galley tiles in England, ali
made of the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine
indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed
with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but join-
ed so artificially with mortar, beina made of the same
earth, that it was very nard to see wnere tne tiles met,
The floors of the rooms were of the same composi-
tion, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use
in several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c. as hard as stone,
and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some
.smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it
,vere,pavcd with the same tile: the ceilings, and, in a
word, all the plastering work in the whole house,
were of the same earth; and, after "ail, the roof was
covered with tiles ot the same, but of a deep shining
olack.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and lite-
rally to be called so; and had I not been upon the
journey, 1 could have staid some days to see and exa-
mine the particulars of it. They told me there were
fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, ali paved at
the bottom and sides with the same, and fine statues
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the
porcelean earth, and burnt whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure
they excel in their accounts of it; for they told me
such incredible things of their performance in crockery-
ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as know-
ing it could not be true.—One told me, in particular,
of a workman that made a ship, with all ite tackle,
and masts, and sails, in earthen-ware big enough to
ca/ry fifty men. If lie had told me he launched it,
and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said
something to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the
whole story, which was, in short, asking pardon for
the word, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and said
nothing to it.
This odd sight kept.me two hours behind the cara-
van, for which the leader of it for the day fined me
about the value of three shillings; and told me, if it
had been three days journey without the wall, as it was
three days within, he must have fined me four times
as much, and made me ask pardon the next council-
day: so I promised to be more orderly; for, indeed,
I found afterwards the orders made for keeping ati
together were absolutely necessary for our common
safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made for a fortification against the Tartars; and a very
gveat work it is, going over hills and mountains in an
endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or,
indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could
hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thou
sand English miles, but that the country is five hun-
dred in a straight measured line, which the .wall
bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings
it takes; 'tis about four fathoms high, and as man)
thick ir, some places
1 stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without tres-
passing on our orders, ibr so long the caravan was in
passing the gate; I say, 1 stood still an hour to look at
it, on every side, near and far off; I mean, what was
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who
had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was
mighty eager to hear my opinion of it I told him it
was a most excellent thing to keep off the Tartars,
which he happened not to understand as 1 meant it,
and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot
laughed: "O, Seignior lnglese," said he, «* you speak
in colours."—"In colours!" said I; "what do you
mean by that ?"—" Why, you speak what looks white
this way, and black that way; gay one way, and dull
another way: you tell him it is a*good wall to keep
out Tartars; you tell me, by that, it is good for no-
thing but to keep out Tartars; or will keep out none
but Tartars. I understand you. Seignior lnglese, 1
understand you," said he, joking; "but Seignior
Chinese understand yau his own way."
"Well, " said I, " Seignior, do you think it would
stand out an army of our country-people, with a good
train of artillery ; or our engineers, with two compa-
nies of miners? Would they not batter it down in ten
days, that an army might enter in battalia, or mow it
dp in the air, foundation and all, that there should be
no sign of it left?"—" Ay, ay," said he, "1 know
that." The Chinese wanted mightily to know what J
taid, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after,
for we were then almost out of their country, and he
was to leave us in a little time afterwards: lout when
he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest ol
the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of
the Chinese power and greatness while he staid.
After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a
wall, something like the Picts wall, so famous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we began
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, as
being subject to the inroads and depredations of the
Tartars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are
not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open
country.
And here I began to find the neces%ity of keeping
together in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, i wondered how that
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con-
temptible fellows; for they are a mere herd or crowd
of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline, or manner of fight.
Their horses arc poor, lean, starved creatures,
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we
found the first day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leadei
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but hunt-
ir' of sheep ! However it may be called hunting too
for the creatures are the wildest, and swiftest of foot,
lhat ever I saw of their kind ; only they will not rwin
a great way, and you are sure of sport when you be-
gin the chase; for they appear generally by thirty oi
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always Keep to-
gether when they fly.
In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap
to meet with about forty Tartars: whether they were
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked
foro.notber kind of prey, I know not; but as soon aa
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very
loud, but with a barbarous sound that 1 had never
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear
again. We all supposed this was to call their friends
about them: and so it Was; for in less than half a
quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or fifty more ap-
peared at a about a mile distance; but our work was
over first, as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to
be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn, he
told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but to
charge them immediately, without loss of time; aim
drawing us up in a line, he asked, if we were resolv
cd? We tola him, we were ready to follow him -. -Ln
he rode directly up to them. They stood gazing at u*y
like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor show-
ing the face of any order at all; but as soon as the-?
saw us advance, they let fly their arrows; which ho\y
ever, missed us very happily: it seems they mistook
not their aim, but their distance; for their arrows al
fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, tha'l
had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must hav»
had several men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at 9
ejreat distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, re-
solving to fall in amqng them swora m hand; for so
our bold Scot that led us, directed. -He was, indeed,
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool
courage too, that I never saw a man in action, fitter
for command. As soon as we came up to them, we
fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew; but they
(led in the greatest confusion imaginable; the only
stand any of them made was on our right, where three
•>f 'hem stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come
back to the-ni, having a kind of scimitar in their hands
and their bows hanging at their backs. Our brave
commander, without asking any body to follow him
galloped up close to them, and with nis fusil knocked
one of them off his horse, killed the second with his
pistol, and the third ran away; and thus ended our
fight; but we had this misfortune attending it, viz. that
all our mutton that we had in chase got away. We
had not a man killed or hurt; but, as for the Tartars,
there wore about five of them killed ; how many were
wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that the
other party was so frighted with the noise of our guns,
that they fled, and never made any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominions,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards ; but in about five days we entered a vast great
wild desert, which held us three days and nights
march; and we were obliged to carry our water with
us in great leather bottles, and to encamp all night,
just as I have heard they do in the deserts of Arabia.
Tasked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told me this was a kind of border that migh*
be called No Man's Land; being part of the Great
^arakathy, or Grand Tartary; but that, however, u
was reckoned to China; that there was no care taken
here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves; and
therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole
march, though we were to go over some much larger.
In passing this wilderness, which I confess, was at
the first view very frightful to me, we saw two or
.hree times little parties of the Tartars, but they seem-
ed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design
upon us; and so like the man who met the devil, if
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say
to them ; we let them go.
Once, however, a party of them came so near, as to
stand and jaae at us, whether it was to consider what
they shoula do, viz. to attack us, or not attack uc, w«
knew not; but when we were passed at vwne distance
by them, we made a rear guard of forty men, and
•tood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half a
mile, or thereabouts, before us. After a while they
marched off, only we found they assaulted us with five
arrows at their parting; one of which wounded a
horse, so that it disabled him; and we left him t,he
^ext day, poor creature, in great need of a good far-
rier. We suppose they might shoot more arrows,
which might, fall short of us; but we saw no more
arrows, or Tartars, at that time.
We travelled near a month after this, the ways be.
ing not so good as at first, though still in the dominion!
of the emperor of China; but lay, for the most part,
in villages, some of which were fortified, because of
the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to one
of these towns, (it was about two clays and a half's
journey, before we were to come to the city of Naum,)
1 wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to
be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses also,
such as they are, because so many caravans corning
that way, they are very often wanted. The person
that I spoke to to get me a camel, would have gone
and fetched it for me; but I, like a fool, must be offi-
cious, and go myself along with him. The place wns
about two miles out of the village, where, it seems,
they kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little
variety. When we came to this place, it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park,
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the doors.
Having bought a camel, and agreed for the price, 1
came away; and the Chinese man, that went with me,
led the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars
on horseback: two of them seized the felllow, and
took the camel from him, while the other three stepped
up to me and my old pilot; seeing us, as it were, un-
armed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword,
which could but PI defend me against three horsemen
The first that came up siopp*Q snort upon my draw,
iiig my sword, (for th«y are arrant cowards,)but a
second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the
head which 1 never felt till afterwards, and wonder-
ed, when I came to myself, what was the matter with
me, and where I v;as,fcr he laid me flat on the ground;
but my never-failing eld pilot, the Portuguese (so Pro-,
vidence, unlooked for, directs deliverance from dan-
gers, which to Us are unforeseen,) had a pistol in hii
pocket, which I kntur nothing of, nor the Tartars nei-
ther; if they had, I suppose they would not have at-
tacked us; but cowards are always boldest when there
is no danger.
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and lay-
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him
down by main force a little#towards him with the
other, he shot him into the head, and laid him dead on
the spot; he then immediately stepped up to him who
had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come
forward again (for it was all done as it were in a mo-
ment) made a blow at him with a scimitar, which he
always wore, but, missing the man, cut his horse into
the side of his head, cut one of his ears off by the
root, and a great slice down the side of his face. The
poor baast, enraged with the wounds, was no more to
be governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well
enough too; but away he flew, and carried him quite
out of the pilot's reach; and, at some distance, rising
upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell
upon hiin.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, see-
ing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him,
he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured
weapon he had by his side, something like a pole-axe,
but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from him,
and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with,
it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal'with
*till:, and, seeing ho did not fly as he. expected, nor
10 l
come on to fight him as he aoprehended, but stood
Hock still, the old man stood stifl too, and falls to work
with his tackle to charge his pistol again i but as soon
as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it
to be the same or another, I know not, away he scoured
and left my pilot, my champion, I called him afterwards
a complete victory...
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought,
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a
tweet sleep; but as I said above, I wondered where 1
was, how 1 came upon the ground, and what was the
matter: in a word, a few minutes after, as sense re-
turned, I felt pain, though 1 did not know where; I
clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody;
then 1 felt my head ache, and then, in another mo-
ment, memory returned, and every thing was present
to me again. ">
1 jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a Tar-
tar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly by
him: and looking farther I saw my champion and
cjeliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had
done, corning back with his hanger in his hand. The
old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me,
and embraced me witli a great deal of joy, being afraid
before that I had been killed; and seeing me bloody,
would see how 1 was hurt, but it was not much, only
what we call a broken hoad; neither did I afterwards
find any great inconvenience from the blow, other than
the place which was hurt, and which was well again
in two or three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory;
for we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel;
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before
the Chinese judge of the place ; that is to say, in Eng-
lish, he went before a justice of the peace. Give him
his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and
impartiality; and having heard both sides he gravely
Mked the Chinese man that went with me to buy the
camel, whoie servant hs wj»s ?" 1 am no servant,"
said he, " but went with the stranger.'* ".V whose re-
quest?" said the justice. "At the stranger's request,**
said he. "Why then," said the justice, " you were
the stranger's servant for the time; and the camel being
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to him, and
he must pay for it."
I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a
word to say; but admiring to see such just reasoning
upon the consequence, and so accurate stating the case,
I paid willingly for the camel, and sent for another;
but you may observe, Isent for it; I did not go to fetch
it myself any more: I had had enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire: they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications
go there; for this T will venture to affirm, that all the'
Tartars in Karakathy, which, I believe, are some mil-
lions, could not batter down the walls with their bows
and arrows; but to call it strong if it were attacked
with cannon, would be to make ibuse who understand
it laugh at you.
We wanted, as 1 have said, about two days journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to
every part of the road, to tell all travellers and cara-
vans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them; for .
that an»unusualbody of Tartars, making ten thousand
in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles be-
yond the city. ( .
This was very bad news to travellers; however, it
was carefully done of the governor, and we were very
glad,to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly,
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sentut
from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and threa
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with those
we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in out
rear, and our men on each side of our camels, with
•ur baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre. In
(i«hin irder, and well prepared for battle, we thought
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mogu
Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next clay, whet
they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It. was early in the morning, when ifarching from
a little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry ; and
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan be:n»
over, the rear-guard was behind: but they did not aj>
pear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold,
by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was
at hand; they were at hand indeed, for ihey came
on upon the spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked
so big the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them ; which is a certain
sign in a soldier, that he is just ready to run away.
My old pilot was of my mind ; and being near me, he
called out: "Seignior Inglese," said be, "those fel-
lows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; foi
if the Tartars come on, they will never stand it."—
"I am of 3'our mind," said I; "but. what course
must be done *"—" Do.nc?" said he ; " let fifty of oui
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and en-
courage them, and they will fight like brave fellows
in brave company;' but without it they will every
man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to om
leader, and told hjm, who was exactly of our mind:
and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing
and fifty to the left., and the rest made a*line of re
berve ; for so we marched, leaving the last two hun
dred men to make another body to themselves, and to
guard the camels ; only that, if need were, they should
6end a hundred men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumera
ole company they were; how many, we could not tell
but ten thousand we thought was the least. A part]
of them came on first, and viewed our posture, tra
rersing me ground in the front of our line; and ah
we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
saluo on each wing with their shot, which was done;
bi*t they went off, and I suppose went back to give an
account of the reception they were like to meet with;
and, indeed, that salute clogged their stomachs; for
they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of
it, and, wheeling off to the left, they gave over the de*
sign, and said no more to us for that time; which was
very agreeable to our circumstances, which were but
very indifferent for a battle with such a number.
Two clays after this we came to the city of Naum,
or Nanum. We thanked the governor for his care foi
us, and collected to the value of one hundred crowns,
or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a gar-
rison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers
kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the
Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they do
now, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of
the country (which lies from the city west, for about
two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit for use; and
more especially, being so very remote, and so difficult
to send troops hither for its defence; for we had yet
above two thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so
called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen day?
lassing over, and which, as I said, was to be called
Jo Man's Land: and on the 13th of April we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think
the first city, or town or fortress, whatever it might
bo called, that belonged to the czar of Muscovy, was
called Argun, being on the west side of the rivei
Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction, thai
[ was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian coun*
Cry ; or, at least, in a country governed by Christianst
lor titdugh the Muscovites,do, in my opinion, but wit'
R
deserve the name of Christians (yet such they pretend
to be, and are very devout in their way;) it would cer-
tainly occur to any man who travels the world as 1
have clone, and who had any power of reflection; 1
say, it would occur to him, to reflect, what a blessing
it is to be brought into the world where the name of
God, and of a Redeemer, is kno.vn, worshipped, and
dored—and not where the people, given up by Heaven
to sirong delusions, worship tl*e devil, and prostrate
themselves to stocks and stones; worship monsters,
elements, horrible shaped animals, and statues, or
images of monsters. Not a town or city we passed
through but lhad their pagods, their idols, and their
temples; and ignorant people worshipping even the
works of their own hands!
Now we came where, at least a face of the Christian
worship appeared, where the knee was oowed to Jesus;
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian re-
ligion was owned, and the name of the true God was
called upon and adored : and it made the very recesses
of my soul rejoice to see it. 1 saluted the brave Scotch *
merchant I mentioned above, with my first acknow-
ledgment of this; and, taking him by the hand, 1 said
to him, "Blessed be God, we are once again come
among Christians.'" He smiled, and answered, " Do
not rejoice too soon, countryman;-these Muscovites
are but an odd sort .of Christians; and but for the
name of it, you may see a very little of the substance
for some months farther.of our journey."
"Well," said I, " but still it is better than pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils."—" Why, I'll telJ
you said he; "except the Russian soldiers in garri-
sons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a thou-
sand miles farther, is inhabitod by the worst and most
ignorant of pagans." And so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
sol id earth, if I understand anything of the surface of
the globe, that is to be found in any part of the world:
ye had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea.east-
ward; we had at least two thousand to the bottom ol
the Baltic sea, westward; and almost three thousand
miles, if we left that sea, and went on west to the Bri
!ish and French channels; we had full five thousand
miles to the Indian or Persian sea* south; and about
eight nundred miles to the Frozen sea, north; nay, if
some people may be believed, there might be no sea
north-east till we came round the pole, and conse
quently in the north-west, and so had a continent of
and into America, no mortal knows where; though 1
could give some reasons why 1 believe that to be a
mistake too.
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good
while before we came to any considerable town, we
had nothing to observe there but this: first, that all the
rivers run to the east." As I understood by the charts
which some of our caravans had with them, it waa
plain that all those rivers ran into the Great river Ya-
mour, or Gammour. This river, by the natural course
of it, must run into the east sea, or Chinese ocean.
The story they tell us, that the mouth of this river is
choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz.
three feet about, and twenty or thirty feet :.igh, I
must be allowed to say.I believe nothing of; but as its
navigation is of no use, because there is no trade that
way, the Tartars, to whom alone it belongs, dealing in
nothing but cattle; so nobody that ever I heard of,
-as beer, curious enough either to go down to the
mouth of it in boats, or to come up from the mouth of
it in ships; but this is certain, that this river running
due east, in the latitude of sixty degrees, carries a vast
concourse of rivers along with it, antl finds an ocean
to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea
there.
Some leagues to the.north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due
north as the Yamoui runs east; and these are all found
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus,
named so from the northernmost nations of the Mogul
Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the first Tartar*
U1
in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, an
the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident
that the northern ocean hounds the land also on that
side; so that it does not seem rational in the least tc
think that the land can extend itself to join with Ame-
rica on thai side, or that there is not a communication
between the northern and the eastern ocean; hut of
this I shall say no more; it was my observation a
that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by
easy and moderate journeys, and were very visibly
obliged to the' care the czar of Muscovy has taken to
have cities and towns built in as many places as an
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garri
son, something like the stationary soldiers placed by
the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire,
some of which 1 had read,were particularly placed in
Britain for the security of commerce, and for the lodg-
ing of travellers; and thus it was here; though wher-
ever we came at these towns and stations the garrison*
and governor were Russians, and professed mere pa
gans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun,
moon, and stars, or all the host nf heaven; and not
only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that
ever I met with, the niost barbarous, except only that
they did not eat man's flesh, as our savages of Ame-
rica did
Some instances of this we met with in the country
between Arguna, where we entered the Muscovite do-
minions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together
called Nertzinskay; in which space is a continued de-
sert, or forest, which cost us twenty clays to travel over
it. In a village near the last of those places, I had
the curiosity to go and see their way of living; which
is most brutish and unsufferable; they had, 1 suppose,
a great sacrifice that day; for there stood out upon an
old stump of a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful
as the devil, at least as any thing we can think of to
represent the devil that can be made. It had a head
certainly not so much as resembling any creature^. lha<
the world ever saw ; ears as big as goats horns, and as,
high ; eyes as big as a crown-piece,; and a nose like a
crooked lam's horn, and a mouth extended four-cor-
nered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hookeu
like a parrot's under bill. It was dressed up in the
filthiest manner that you can suppose; its upper gar-
ment was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a
great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns grow
ingthrough it: it was about eight feet high, yet had nc
feet or legs, or any other proportion of pails.
This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the vil-
lage; and when I came near to it, there were sixteen
orseventeencreatures,whether men or women I could
not tell, for they make no distinction by their habits,
either of body or head ; these lay all flaton the ground,
round this formidable block of shapeless wood. 1
saw no'mot'on among them any more than if they had
been logs of wood, like their idol; at first 1 really
thought they had been so; but wheu I came a little
nearer, they started up upon their feet, and raised a
howling cry,as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased
at our disturbing them. A little way off'from this
monster, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all oi
sheep-skins and covv-skins,dried,stood three butchers:
I thought they were such; for when I came nearer tc
them, I found they had long knives in their hands,
and in the middle of the tew* appeared three sheep
killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol;
and these three men priests belonging to it; and tht
seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who
brought the offering, and were making their prayers
o that stack. »
1 confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was
at'any thing in my life: to see Cod's most gloriouf
and best creiilure,lo whom lie had granted so many ad-
santages, even by creation, above the rest of the workt
of his hands, ves.ed with a reasonable soul, and that
doul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both*
!o honour his Maker and be honoured by him ; I say,
to see it sunk and degenerated to a degree so more
than stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing
a mere imaginary object, dressed up by themselves,
and made terrible to themselves by theirown contriv-
ance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; and that this
-hould be the effect ol mere ignorance, wrought up
into hellish devotion by the devil himself; who, envy-
ing his Maker the homage and adoration of his crea-
tures, had deluded them into such gross, surfeiting, sor-
did, and brutish things, as one would think should
shock nature itself.
But what signified all the astonishment and reflec-
tion of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before my
eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think
it impossible. All my admiration turned to rage: and
I rode up to the image or monster, call it what you
will, and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on
its head in two in the middle, so that it hung down by
one of the horns; and one of the men that was with
,me, took hold of the sheep skin that covered it, and
pulled at it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry and
howling ran through the village, and two or three hun-
dred people came about my ears, so that 1 was glad to
scour for it: for we saw some had bows and arrows;
but I resolved from that moment to visit them a^ain.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some
horses, wfcich they wanted, several of the horses hav-
ing been lamed and jaded with the badness of the
way, and our long march over the last desert; so we
nad some leisure here to put my design in execution.
I communicated my project to the Scots merchant, of
Moscow, of whose courage I had had a sufficient tes-
timony, as above. I told him what T had seen, and
with what indignation I had since thought that human
nature could be so degenerate. J told him I was fe>-
aolved, if I could get but four or five men well armed
to go with me, to go and destroy that vile abomi-
nable idol; to let them see, that it had no power to
help itself, and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to he prayed to, much less help them that
offered sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: said he, cl Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it ?"-—
II Propose !" said I: * to vindicate the honour of God
which is insulted by this devil-worship."—" But how *
will it vindicate the honour of God," said he, tl while
the people will not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you cfould speak to them too, and tell them
so? and then they will fight you too, I will assure you,
for they are desperate fellows, and that especially in
defence of their idolatry."—u Can we not," said I,
"do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons in
writing in their own language?"—" Writing!" said
he; "why there is not in five nations of them one
man that knows any thing of a letter, or how to read
a word in any language, or then own."—" Wretched
ignorance!" said 1 to him: "however, I have a
great mind to do it; perhaps nature may draw infer-
ences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they
are to worship such horrid things.''—" Look you,
Sir," said he; "if }rour zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but in the next place, I
would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjected by force to the czar of Muscovy's domi-
nion, and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of .Nertzinskay,
and complain, and demand satisfaction; and if ha
cannot give them satisfaction, it is ten to one but they
will revolt: and it will occasion a new war with all
the Tartars in the country."
This, I confess put new thoughts into my head for
awhile; but I harped upon the same string jtfill; and
all that day I was uneasy to put my project in execu-
tion. Toward the evening the Scots merchant met
me h/ accident, in our walk abou* the town, and desF
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
to speak with me: "I believe," said he, " I have
put you .off 3',our good design ; 1 have been a litile
concerned about it since; for I abhor theidol, ana
idolatry, as much as you can do."—"Truly," said I,
"you have put it o'ff'a little, as to the execution of it,
but you have not put it all out of my thoughts; and, I
believe, I shall do it still, before ( quit "this place,
though I were to be delivered up to them for a satisfac-
tion."—" J\To, no," said he, " God forbid "hey shouhl
deliver you up to such a crew of monsters 1 jdiey shall
not do that neither ; that would be murdering you in-
deed."—"Why," said I, " how would they use me?"
—" Use;you !" said he: "V\) tell you how they serv-'
ed a poor Russian, who affronted tnem in their wor-
ship just as you did, and whom tncy took prisoner,
after they had lamed him with an arrow, that he coulu
not ry.r. away, they took him and stripped him stark
naked, and set him upon the top of the i'dol monster,
and stood all round him, and shot as man)* arrows
into him as would stick over his whole body; and
then they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in
him, as a. sacrifice to the idol."—" And was this the
same idol?" said I.—" Yes," said he, "the very
same."—" Well," said I, " I will tell you a story."
So I related the story of our men at Madagascar, and
how they burnt and sacked the village there, and killed
man, woman, and child, for, their murdering one of
our men, just as it is related before: and when I had
done, I added, that I thought we ought to do so to this
village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when
I talked of doing so to that village, said l*e, "You
mistake very much, it was not this village; it was
almost a hundred miles from this place; but it was-the-
same idol, for they carry him about in procession all
over the country."—" Well,".said f, ;-then that idol
ought to be punished for it; ahd it shall," said I, " if
I live this night out."
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design,
ani told me. T should not «;o alone, but he would go
witn me; but he would go first, and bring a stout fel-
low, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; "and
one," said he, " as famous for iiiszeal'as you can de-
sire any one to be againsf'such devilish things as these."
In a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman,
whom he called captain Richardson; and I gave him
a full accouni of what I had seen, and also what I in-
tended; and he told me readily, he would go with me,
. if it Cost him.his life. So we'agreed to go, only wc
three. I 'had, indeed, proposed it to my partner, but
he declined it. He said he was ready to assist me to
the utmost, and upon all occasions, jjpr my defence;
but that this was an adventure quite out of his way.
so, I say, \ye resolved upon our work, only wo/three, and
my man-servant,' and to put it in execution that night,
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable^
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay.it till the next night, because the caravan being
iO set forward in the'morning, we supposed the go-
vernor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction
upon us when we were out of his power.' The Scots
.'merchant, as steady in his resolution to enterprise it, as
bold iii executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown
of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows,
and had provided the same for himself and Ins coun-
tryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not: be
able to determine who we were. •'
All the first night we spent in mixing up some com-
bustible matter \V'nh aqua-vita*, gunpowder, and such
other materials as we could get.; and, having a-good
quantity of tar in a'liule pot, about an hour after night
we set out upon our expedition. • ,
We came'to the place about eleven o'clock at night,
and found that the people had not the least jealousy ot
danger attending their idol. The night .was cloudy,
yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol
stood just in the same posture and place that it did
before. The people seemed to be all at their rest;
only, that in the great -hut,-or tent, as we called %
*Uere'we saw the three oriests, whom we mistook fo*
butchers, 'we saw a light, and going up close to tne
door, we hear 1 people talking, as if there were five or
six of them • we concluded, therefore, that if we set
wildfire to the idol, these men would come out imme-
diately, and run up to the place to rescue it from tho
destruction that we intended for it;«and what to do
with them we knew not. Once we thought of carry-
'ng it away, and setting fire to it at a distance; but
when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for
our carriage; so we were at a loss again. The second
Scotsman was for setting fire to the 'tent or hut, and
knocking the creatures that were there on the head,
when they came out; bujt I could not join with.that;
I was against kjlling them, if it was possible to be
avoided. "Well then,'-' said the Scois merchant, " I
will tell you what we will do ; we will try to make",
them prisoners, tie their hands, and make them stand
and see their idol destroyed." •
As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough
about us, which we used to tie our fire-works together
with ; so we resolved to attack these people first, and
with as little noise as we could. The first thing we
did, we knocked at the door, when one of the priests
coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped
his mouth, and lied his hands behind him, and led bun
to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not
make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him
on the ground. ~
Two'of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was;
but we waited so long till the third man came back to
us ; and then nobody coming out, we knocked again
gently, and immediately "out came two more, and we
served then-1 just in-the same manner, but were obliged
to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol,'
some distance from one another; when going back, we
found two more were come out to the door, and »
third stood behind them within the door. We seized
the two, and immediately tied thern,1 when the third
stepping hack, and crying out, my Scots merchant
went in after him, and taking out a composition we
had njade, that would only smoke and stink, he set
fire to it, and threw it in among them: by that time
the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by the
arm, led them away to the idol,, and left them there,
tu soe if their, idol would, relieve them, making haste
back to us. • k' j.
When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut
with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated
we then, threw in a small leather bag of another kind,
which flamed like a candle, and following it in, we
found there were but four people left, who, it seems,
were two men and two women, and, as we supposed,
had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They
appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least so as to
sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak neither,
for the smoke. ^
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the other,-and all without any noise. 1 .should have
said, we brought them out of the house, or hut, first,
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any
more' than they were. When we had done this, we
uarried them all together to the idol: when we came
there we fall to work with him.; and first we daubed
him all over, and his robes also, with tar, , and such
other stulT as we had, which was tallow mixed with
brimstone: then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a
g,reat piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and .then stick-
ing all the combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked- about to see if we could find any
hing else to help to burn him ; when rfiy Scotsman
remembered that'by the tent, or hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap, of dry forage, whether straw
or r'.shes I do not remember; away he and the other
Scotsman ran,'and fetched their arms "full* of that.
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, and
brought them, having untied their feet and ungagged
tbeirniouths, and made them stand up, and set thcra
just before their monstrous idol;, and then se fire to
the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the
idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and
deformed the shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw
it burnt into a mere block or log of wood; and then
getting the dry forage to it, we found it would be. soon
quite consumed; so we began tp think of going away;
but the Scotsman said, "No, we must not go, for
these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves
into the fire, and burn, themselves-with the idol." So
we'resolved to stay till the forage was burnt down too,
and then we came away and left them.
In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for, our
journey; nor could any man suggest that we had-been
any where but in our beds, as travellers might be sup
posed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigues of that
day's journey.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a great
multitude of thecountry people, not only of this vil-
lage, but of a hundred more, for aught I know, to the
town-gates; and in a most outrageous manner de-
manded satisfaction of the Russian governor, for the
insulting, their priests, and burning their great Cham-
Chi-Thaungu; such a hard name they gave the mon-
Etrous.^reature they worshipped. The people of Nert-
ainskay were at first in great consternation; for they
said the Tartars were no less than thirty thousand, and
that in a few days more they would be one hundred
thousand stronger.
The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable.
He assured them he knew' nothing of it, and that there
'ciad not a. soul of his garrison been abroad; that it
could,not be from any'body there; and if they would
let him know who it was, he should be exemplarily
unished. They returned haughtily, That all the coun
ny reverenced the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who
dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to
offer violence to his image, but some Christian, mis-
creant; so they called them, it seems; and they there-
fore denounced w'aragainst bim,andall the Russians,
who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a
breach, or to have anv cause of war alleged to be given
by him, th« czar having straitly charged him to treat
the conquered country with gentleness and civility,
gave them still all the good words he could; at last he
told them, there .was, a caravan gone toward Russia
that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who
had done them this injury; and that, if they would be
satisfied with that, he would send after them, to inquire
into it. This seemed to appease them a little; and ac-
cordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a
particular account how the thing was, intimating
withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, they
should make their escape; but that whether they had
done it or not, we should make all the haste forward
that,was possible; and that in the meantime he would
keep, them- in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. However
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew
any thing x>f the mailer; and, as for us-that were
guilty, we were the least of all suspected; none so
much as asked us the question; however, the captain
of the caravan, for the lime, took the hint that the go-
vernor gave us, and we marched or travelled two days
and two nights without any considerable stop, and then
we lay at a village.called Plothus; nor did,we make
any long stop here, but hastened on toward Jarawena,
another of the czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where
we expected we should be safe; but it.is to be observ-
ed, that, here we began, for two or three day's march
to.enter upon a vast nameless desert, of which 1 shall
$ay more m its place;. and which if we had now been
>Hpon it, it is more than probable we had been all de-
ittoyed. It was the second davJs march from Plpthai
that by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance,
some of our people began to be sensible we were pur-
sued. We had entered the desert, and bad passed by a
great lake, called Scbanks Osier, whan we perceived a
very great body of horse appear on the -other side of
the lake to the north, we travelling west. We observ-
ed they went away west, as we did ; but had supposed
we should have taken that side of the lake, whereas
we very happily took the south side: and in two days-
more we saw them not, for they, believing we were
still before them, pushed on, till they came to the
river Udda: this is a very great river when it passes
farther north, but when we came to. it, wejound u
narrow and ford able.
The third day, they either found their mistake or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
toward the dusk of the evening. We had, to our
great satisfaction, justf pitched upon a place for our
camp, which was very convenient for the night; for as
we were upon a desert, though but at the begming of
it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no
towns to lodge at, and indeed, expected .none but the
city of Jarawena, which we had yet two days march
to ; the desert, however, had some few woods in it or;
this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great
river Udda. It was in a narrow strait, between two
small but very thick woods, that we pitched our little
camp for that night, expecting to be attacked in the
sight.
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued
for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go
about in troops in that desert, so the caravans always
fortify tnemselves every night against them, as against
armies of robbers; and'it was therefore no new.thing
to be pursued.
But we had, this night, of all the nights of our tra-
vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay betweeu
two woods, with a little rivulet running just before our
front: so that we could not be surrounded, or attacked
any way, but in our front or rear: we took care also
jo make our front as strong as we could, by placing
onr packs, with our camels and horses, all in a lineoii
the side of the river, and we felled some trees in oui
rear.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but the
enemy was upon us before we had finished our situa-
tion: they dicUiot come on us like thieves, as we ex
pecied,'but sent three messengers to us, to demand the
men to be delivered to them, that had abused then
fu-iests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-Thaungu. thai
they might burn them with fire; and, upon this, thc-v
said, they would go away, and do us no farther harm,
otherwise they would burn us all with fire. Our mei
looked very blank at this message, and began to stare
at one another, to see who looked with mos't guilt in
their faces, but, nobody was the word, nobody did it
The leader of the caravan sent word^he was well as-
sured it was not done by any of our camp; that we
were peaceable merchants, travelling on our'business,
that we had done no harm to them, or to any one else;
and therefore, they must look farther for their enemies,
who had injured them, for we were not the people;
so desired them not to disturb us; for, if they1 did,we
should defend ourselves.
They were far from, being satisfied with this for an
answer, and a great crowd of them came down in the
morning, by the break of day, to our camp; but, seeinu
us in such an advantageous situation, they durst come
10 farther than the brook in our front, where thev
stood, and showed us such a number, as, indeed, ter-
rified us very much; for those that spoke least of them
spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood, and looked
at us awhile, and then setting up a great howl^ thr\
et fly a cloud of arrows among us; but we were'wo!)
enough fortified for that, for we were sheltered undrr
our baggage; and I do not remember that one man
cf us was hurt.
Some tinie after this we saw them move a little to
wir right and expected them on the rear, when a ru:i-
aing fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, oi J araweua,
A D V E N T U R E S 0 F R. 0 B IX S 0 3ST CRUSOE.
in the pay of the Muscovites, call in* to the leader 'M 1
the caravan, said to him,*1I will >end all these peo- I
pie away to Sibeilka. This was a c,;,v four or live
• lays journey at least to the south, ard rather behind
us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting or»
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as i(
were, back to Nertzinskay; after this, he takes a great
circuit about, and comes to the army of the Tartars,
.is if he had been sent express to tell them along story
that the people who had burnt their Cham-Chi-Thaun
«ru were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants,
as he called them ; that is to say, Christians; and thai
trey were resolved to burn the god Seal Isarg, belong-
ing to the Tonguses.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and per feed)
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, thai
they all took it from him, and-away they drove, in a
mnSt violent hurry, toSibeilka, which, it seems, was
five days journey to the south; and in less than three
hours they were entirely out of our sight, and we never
heard any more of them, or ever knew whether they
went to that other place called Sibeilka or no.
So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena,
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there
we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
fatigued with the last day's march, and with want of
rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which held
us three-and-twenty days inarch. We furnished our-
selves with some tents here, for the better accommo-
dating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the
caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wagons of the
country, for carrying out water and provisions; and
these carriages were our defence every rJght round our
little camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless
they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after
this long journey; for in this desert we saw neithev,
house or tree, or scarce a bush: we saw, indeed,
abundance of the sable-huntsrs, as they called them.
These are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which
this country is a part; and they frequently attack small
caravans; but we saw no numbers of them together.
[ was curious to see the sable skins they catched; but
1 could never speak with any of them; for they durst
not come near us; neither durst we straggle from our
company to go near them.
After we had passed this desert,' we came into a
country pretty well inhabited ;• that is to say, we found
towns and castles settled by the czar of Muscovy, with
garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans
and defend the country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his
czarish majesty has given such strict orders for the
well guarding the caravansand merchants, that if there
are any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments
of the garrison are always sent to see travellers safe
from station to station. /
'And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom t had
an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
v Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered
us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any
danger, to the next station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe we should find the country better peopled
and the people mdre civilized; but I found myself
mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the
Tonguses to pass through; where we saw the same
tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than be-
fore; only as they were conquered by the Muscovites,
and entirely reduced, they were not so dangerous; but
for the rudeness of manners, idolatry, and-polytheism,
no people in the world ever went beyond them. They
are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are
built of the same. You know not a man from a wo-
man, neither by the ruggedness of thejr countenances
or their clothe*; and in the winter, when the ground
:s covered with snow, they live under ground, jb
houses like vaults, which have cavities or caves going
from one to another.
if tne Tartars had their Oham-Chi-Thaungu for «
whole village, or country, these had idols in every lut
and every cave: besides, they worship the stars, the
sun, the water, the snow ; and, in a word, everything
that they do not understand, and they understand hut
very litile;so that almost every element, every un-
common thing, sets them a sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe people than countries
any farther than my own story comes to be concerned
in them. I met with nothing peculiar to myself in all
this country, which, 1 reckon, Vas from the deser»
which 1 spoke ol'last, at least four hundred miles, half
of it being another detcrt, which took us up twelve
days severe travelling, without house, tree, or bush ,
but we were obliged*again to carry our own provi.
sions, as well water as bread. After we were out of
this desert, and had travelled two days, we came m
Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the great rivei
Janezay, This river, they told us, parted Europe from
Asia, though our rnap-makers, as lam told, do not
agree to it; however, it is cenainly the eastern bound,
ary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes a pro-
vince only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself
equal in bigness to. the whole empire of Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance aiuf paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. AH
the country between the river Oby and the river Jane-
zay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any nation
for aught 1 know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors, whom
I had opportunity to converse with, that the pagans
are not much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, foi
being under the Muscovite government; which they
acknowledged was true enough, but, they said, it was
none of their business; that if the czar expected to
convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects
»t should be done by sending clergymen among them,
not soldiers ; and they added, with more sincerity than
I expected, that they found it was riot so much the
concern of their monarch to make the people Chris-
tians, as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild.uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a bar.
barous soil; 'tis only barren of people, and wants
good management; otherwise it is in itself a most
pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inha-
bitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as,
are sent among them from Russia; for this is the
country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, whithei
the Muscovite criminals, that are not put to death, are
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible
they should ever come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, till I came to Tobolski, the capital of Siberia,
where I continued some time, on the following occa-
sion : —
We had been now almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter began "tocome on apace; whereupon
my partner and I called a council about our particular
affairs, in which we found it proper, considering that
we were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us
of sledges and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in
the winter-time; and, indeed, they have such things,
as it would be incredible to relate the particulars of,
\$ which means the Russians travel more in the win-
ter than they can in summer ; because in these sledges,
they are able to run night and day; the snow being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which
tne hills, the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth,
and j>ard as a stone; and they run upon the surface
without any regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey
of this kind ; I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways; either I must go oh as
me caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go
151
off west for Narva, and the gulf of Finland, at.d 9
either by sea or land to Dantzic, where 1 might possi-
bly sell my China cargo to good advantage; or I must
leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from
whence 1 had but six days by water to Archangel,
and from thence might be sure of shipping, either tc
England, Holland, or Hamburg.
xVoiv to go any of these journeys in the wintei
would have been preposterous; or as to Dantzic, the
Baltic woulcUbe frozen up, and I could not get pas-
sage; and to go by land in those countries, was fai
less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise tc
Archangel, in October all the ships would be gone
from thence, and even the merchants, who dwell there
in summer, retire south to Moscow in the winter, when
the ships are gone; so I should have nothing Inn
extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of
provisions, and must lie there in an empty town al)
sthe winter: so that, upon th^ whole, 1 thought it
large, or my people so many. The Russian grandct
looked a little sui prised, and fixing bib eyes steadily
upon me, began to wonder what I meant.
I toid him his wonder would cease when I had ex-
plained myself. First, I told him, I had the absolute
disposal of the lires and fortunes of all my subjects:
that notwithstanding my absolute power, I had no* *
one person disaffected to my government, or 10 in
person, in all my dominions. He shook his head a
that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the czar of Mu»
oovy. I told him, that all the lands in my kingdom
were my own, and all my subjects were not only irv
tenants, but tenants at will; that they would'alf figfi
for me 10 the last drop; and that never tyrant, "for
such 1 acknowledged myself to be, was ever so uni-
versally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by his
subjects.
After amusing them with these riddles in govern-
ment for awhile, 1 opened the case, and told them the
much my better way to let the caravan go, and tc ! ttory at large, of my living in the island, and how I
fmike provision to winter where I was, viz. at Tobol- ' managed both myself and the people there that were
*.Vi, in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty degrees, where 'under me, just as I have since minuted it down.
J was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter They were exceedingly taken with the story, and espe-
with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as the country cially the prince, who told me with a si-ih, that the
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, an. I excel- true* greatness of life, was to be master of ourselves •
lent company; of all which I shall give a full account , that he would not have changed such a state of life as
in its place. # 'mine, to have been czar of*Muscovy; and that he
I was now in a rquite different climate from my found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be
beloved island, where I never felt coid, except when'l 1 banished to there, than ever he found in the highest
had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to
bear my clothes on my back, and never marie any fire
but without doors, for my necessity, in dressing my
rood, &.c. Now I made me three good vests,' witli
arge robes, or gowns over them, to hang down to the
feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these lined
with furs, to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm house, 1 must confess, I greatly dis-
like our way in England, of making fires in ever*
room in the house, in ooen chimneys, which, when tb
fir© was oui, always kept the air in tne room coid as
the climate. But taking an apartment in a good house
in the town, I ordered a chimney to,be built like a
furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove:
the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the
dt)or to come at the fire went in another, and all the
rooms were kept equally warm, but no fires seen ; like
as they heat the bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same cVimatc in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm
withjn; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incom-
moded with any smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
country so barbarous as that of the most northerly
part of Europe, near the Frozen ocean, and within but
a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state criminals
of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished;
this city was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen,
colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the nobility, gen-
try, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here were
the famous prince Galifken, or Galoffken, and his
son; the old general Robostisky, and several other
persons of note, and some ladies.
By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe-
less, 1 parted with here, I made an acquaintance with
several of these gentlemen, and some of them of the
irst rank; and from these, in the long winter nights,
in which I staid here, I received several agreeable vi-
sits. It was talking one night with a certain prince,
one of tlje banished ministers of state belonging to the
czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my particular caset
began. He had been telling me abundance uf fine
things,and the greatness, the magnificence, and domi-
nions, and the absolute power of the emperor of the
Russians. 1 interrupted him, and told linn I was a
greater and more powerful prince than eve* the csat
of Muscovy was, though my dominions were not so
authority he enjoyed in the court of his master, the
czar: that the height of human wisdom was to brin*
our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make
a calm within, under the we'ght of the greatest storm
without. When he came first hither, he said, he used
to tear the hair from his he*d, and. the clothes from
his back, as others had dor<j before him; but a little
time and consideration had made him look into him-
self, as well as round himself, to things without: that
he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought
to reflect upon the state o< Mniversal life, and how
little this world wae concerned in its true felicity, was
perfectly capable oC naking a felicity for itself, fully
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends
and desires, with but very little assistance from the
world; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life,
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order
to health, completed, in his opinio^ all that the world
could do for us: and though the greatness, the autho-
rity, the riches, and the pleasures, which some enjoy-
ed in the world, and which he had enjoyed his share
of, had much in them that was agreeable to us, yet
he observed, that all those things chiefly gratified' the
coarsest of our affections; such as our ambition, our
particular pride, our avarice, our vanity, and our sen-
suality; all which were, indeed, the mere product ot
the worst part of man, were in themselves crimes-
and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes •
but neither were related to, or concerned with, any of
those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of those
graces which distinguished us as Christians; that be-
ing now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he
enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he said
he was at leisure to look upon the dark side'of them
where he found all manner of deformity; and was
now convinced, that virtue only makes a man truly
wise, rich, 'and great, and preserves him in theuvay
to a superior happiness in a future state; and in this
he said, they were more happy in their banishment,
than all their enemies were, who had the full posses-
sion of ah the wealth and power that they (the ba-
nished) had left behind them.
"Nor, sir," said he, " do 1 bring my mind to his
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but if 1 know any thine
ot myself,'I would not go back, no, not though mv
master, the czar, should call me, and offer to reinstate
me in all my former grandeur; I say, I would no
more go back to it, than I believe my soul, when it
shall be delivered from this prison of the body and •
has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, would
A'DVEftiTtJRES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE,
come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is m* i
enclosed in, ahcl leave Heaven to deal in the dirt and
•grime of humati affairs.'*
He spake this with so much warmth in his temper,
so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, whi(«,
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident
it was the true sense of his soul; and indeed there
was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a mo
narch in my old station, of which 1 had given him ai.
account, but that I thought he was not a monarch
only, but a great conqueror ; for that he that has got
a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the
absolute dominion over himself, and whose reasor
entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than Ire
that conquers a city. "But, my lord," said I, " shall
1 lake the liberty to ask you a question ?"—" With
all my heart," said he; "If the door of your liberty
was opened, " said I," would not you:take hold of it
to deliver yourself from this exile?"
"Hold," said he, " your question is subtle, and
requires some serious just, distinctions to give it a sin-
cere answer : and Til give it you from the bottom of
my heart. Nothing that I know of in this world
would move me to deliver myself from the; state*of
banishment, except these two: first, the enjoyment of
my relations ; and secondly, a little wanner climate.
But I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of
the court, the'glory, the power, the hurry of a ministei
of state; the wealth, the gayety, and the pleasures;
that is to say,.follies of a courtier; if my master should
send me word this moment, that he restores me to all
i>e'banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at
fill, I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts
and these frozen lakes, for the palace of Moscow."
"But my lord," said I, " perhaps you not only
are banished from the pleasures of the court, and from
the power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed
before, but you may he absent too from some of tb*
"tonveniences of life; your, estate perhaps, confiscate
sd, and your effects plundered ; and the supplies, left
you here may not be suitable^to the ordinary demands
of life." i
"Ay," said he, " that is, as you suppose me to be
a lord, or, a prince, &,c. So indeed,! am ; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, a human, crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and"so I
can i suffer no want, unless I should be visited with
sickness and "distempers. However, to put the ques-
tion out of dispute; you see our manner; we are in
ilris place five persons of rank ; we live perfectly re-
tired, as suited to a state of banishment, we have
something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes .
which keeps us from the mere necessity-of hunting
for our food ; but the poor soldiers who are here, with-
out that help, live in as much plenty as we. They go
into the woods, and catch'sables and. foxes; the la-
bour of a month will maintain them a year; and as
the way of living is not expensive, so it is not hard to
get sufficient to ourselves ; so that objection is out of
doors." :'",
I have no roomtogive a full account of the most
agreeable conversation T had with this truly great
man : in all which he showed, that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup-
portefl by religion, a^ well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his contempt of the world was really a^
much as he had expressed, and that he was alway*
Jhe'sarjieto the last, as will appear in the story I an
going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadfu)
winter I thought it to be. The cold was so intense
•hat I could not so much as look abroad without be
ng wrapt,in furs, and a mask of fur before my face
or -rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, and
two for sight. The little daylikht we had, as we reek i
oried, for three' 'hioivtlis, not' above five hours a day,
or six at most: only that the snow lyii\g on the ground
continually, and the weather being clear; it was neve-)'
^uitedark. Our horses were kept (or rather starved r
under ground; and as for our servants, (for we hired
servants here to look after our horses and ourselves)
we bar] every now and then their fingers and toes to
thaw, and take care of, lest they should mortify ano
fall off. ."
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of birnaloes, which
is pretty good beef. All the stores of provisions for
the winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured.
Our drink was water mixed with aqua-vitoe instead
of brandy; and, for a treat, mead instead of wine;
which, however, they haVe excellent good. The hun-
j ters, who ventured abroad all weathers, frequently
j brought us in fresh venison, very fat and good; and.
i sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for
| the last. We had a good slock of tea, with which we
treated our friends as above; and in a word, we lived
j very cheerfully and well, all things considered.
It was now March, and the days grown consider-
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so
other travellers began,to prepare sledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going;,
but my measures being fixed, asl have said, for Arch-
angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no
motion, knowingNvery well, that the ships from vthe
south do not set out for that part of the world- till
May or June; and that if 1 was there at the beginning
of August, it would be as soon as,any ships would be
ready'to go away; and therefore, I say, I made no
haste to be gone, as others did; in a word, I saw a
great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away
before me. It seems,, every year they go from thence
to Moscow for trade; viz. to carry furs, and biiy ne-
cessaries with 'them, which they bring back to fur-
nish their .shops; also others went on the same errand
to Archangel '> hut then they also being to come back
again above eight hundred miles, went all-out before
me.. . .' >
In- short, about the latter end of May, I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all these people wei^
banished by the czar of Muscovy,to Siberia, and yet,
when they came there, were at liberty to go whither
they, would; why did they not-then go away to any
pant of the world wherever they thought fit? and I be
gan.to examine what should hinder them from mak,
ing such an attempt.
But my wonder was over when T entreated upon
that .subject-with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: "Consider, first," sai'd lie, " the
place where we are; and, secondly, the'condition we
are in: especially,",said he, "the generality of the
people who are banished- hither. We are surround-
ed," said he, "w,it)i stronger things than bars and
bolts: on, the- north side it is an unnavigabie ocean,
where ship never sailed, and boat ))e\'C.v swam; ^nei-
ther, if we had both, could .we know, whither to ,go
with them. .Every other'way," said he, "we have
above, a thousand miles to. pass through-the czar's mm.
dominions, and ,b,y ways utterly impassable, except
by the roads made by the government, and throu-'i
the towns garrisoned by its troops; so that'.we could;
neither pass.undiscovered.by the road, on subsist any
9ther way; so thai it is in ,yuin to attempt it.
Iwdis silenced indeed, at once, and found that ihe'v
herein a prison, every jot as secure as if they had
been locked up in the castle of Moscow,; however, it
came into my thoughts, that I might certainly be made
an instrument to procure the.esGape of this excellent
oersoos and' t'hatit was very; easy for me to carry hi ry
avvny, there being no guard over him in the country ;•
and as I was hot going to Moscow, but to Archangel,
and that I went in the nature of a caravan, by which
! was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the
desert, but.could encampeverv night where I woula\
we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel^
153
where I could immediately secure him on hoard an
ICng.ish' or Dutch ship, and carry him off safe along
with me; and as to his subsistence, and other parti*
culars, that should be my care, till he should better
supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke ; nay, I could see in his
verv face, that what I said put his' spirits into an ex-
ceeding ferment; his colour frequently changed, his
eye's looked red, and his heart fluttered, tlmt it might
be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he
immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it
were, expected what he would say to it; and after he
had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How
unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we arc, that
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares
to us, and we are made tempters of one another! My
dear friend," said he, " your offer is so sincere, has
such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is
so calculated for my advantage, that I must have very
little knowledge of the world, if 1 did not both won
der at it, and acknowledge the obligation I have
upon me to you for it: but did you believe I was sin-
cere in what I have so often said to you of my con-
.tempt of the world? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that 1 had really maintained that
degree of felicity here, that had placed me above all
that the world could give me, or do for me? Did you
believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not
go back, if I was recalled even to be all that once I
was in the court, and with the favour of the czar my
master? Did you believe me, my friend, to be an ho-
nest man, or did you think me to be a boasting hypo:
crite ?"Here he stopped, as if he would hear what I
would say; but, indeed, I soon after perceived, that
he stopped because his spirits were in motion : his heart
was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was,
I confess, astonishfd at the thing, as well as at the
man, and I used some arguments with him to urge
him to set himself free; that, he ought to look upon
this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance,
and a summons by Providence, who has the care and
good disposition of all events, to do himself good, and
to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. "How
do you know, sir," said ne, warmJy, u but that, in-
stead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint
of another instrument, representing, in all the alluring
colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to
my ruin ? Here I am free'from the temptation of re-
turning to my former miserable greatness; there I am
not sure, but that all the seeds of pride, ambition,
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my na-
ture, may revive and take root, and" in a word, again
overwhelm me; and then the happy prisoner, whom
you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall be the
miserable slave of his own senses, in the full posses-
sion of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain
in this blessed confinement,Vanished from the crimes
of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the
expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the ex-
pense of the future happiness which now 1 have in my
view, but shall then, I fcary quickly lose sight of;
for L am but flesh, a man, a mere man, have passions
and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me
as any man: O be not my friend and my tempter
both together!"
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
Und stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admir-*
cd what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so great,
that, though the weather was extremely cold, it put
him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted
«o give vent to his mind ; so I said a word or two
hat I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again; and then I withdrew to my own apart-
ment.
About, two hours after, I heard some body at ot
near the door of the room, and 1 was going to open
me door; but he had opened it, and come in: " My
fr<'.'<w friend," said be, " 3'ou had almost overset me,
bin J am recovered : do not take it ill that I do not
clo.-e with your offer; I assure you, it is not for want
of a 5-ense of the kindness'oT it in you ; and I com*
(omake the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you;
but, I hope, I have got the victory over myself."
"My Lord," said I, " I hope you are fully satis-
fied, that you did not resist the call of Heaven."—
"Sir," said he, " if it had been from Heaven, the
same power would have influenced me to accept it:
but f hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from
Heaven that I decline it; and 1 have an infinite satis-
. faction in the departing, that you shall leave me an ho-
, ne.st man still, though not a fvea man."
i I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
i profession to him of my having no end in it, but a
| sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very
passionately, aifd assured me, he was sensible of that,
 and should always acknowledge it: and with that he
'offered me a very fine present of sables, too much
'indeed forme to accept from a man in his circum-
: stances: and I would have avoided them, but he would
J not be refused.
| The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts;
but were far short of the value of his sables, which in-
deed, when I came to England, I found worth near
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one
piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold5
which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage,
which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would
not take any more; and sent word by my servant,
that he desired to speak with me.
When 1 came to him, he told me, I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not meve
him any more in that affair; but that, since [ made
such a generous offer to him, he asked me, if f had
kindess enough to offer the same to another perwisg
th;U he would name to me, in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him, that I could not say 1
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom f had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance:
however, if he would please to uiine the person to
me, I would give him my answer, and hoped he would
rot be displeased with me, if he was with my answer.
He told me, it was only his son, who, though I had
not seen, }-et was in the same condition with him-
self, and above two hundred miles from him, on the
other side, the Oby; but that, if 1 consented, he would
send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it.
I made some ceremony in letting him understand that
it was wholly on his account; and that seeing I could
not prevail on him, I would show my respect to him
by mv concern for his son: but these things are too
tedious to repeat here. He sent away the next day
for his son, and in about twenty days he came back
with the messenger, bringing six or scvenliorses loaded
with very rich furs, and which, in the whole amount-
ed to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young lord at a distance till night, when ho
came incognito into our apartment, and his father
presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted
there the manner of our travelling, and every thing
proper for the journey. ^
1 had bought a considerable quantity of sables, nlack •
fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs that are
very rich ; I say, 1 had bought them in that city for
exchange for some of the goods brought from China;
in particular, for the cloves ajid nutmegs, of which 1
sold the greatest part here ; and the rest, afterwards at
Archangel, for a much better price than I could have
done at London ; and my partner, who was sensible
of the profit, arid whose business, more particularly
than mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased
with our stay, on account of the traffic we made hero.
It was in the beginning of June when I ieit thtc
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the
worid; and, indeed, it is so for out of the road of
commerce, that 1 know not how it should he much
talked of. We were now come to a very small cara
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all,
and all of iliem passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was most
natural also, that I should take more servants with
me than 1 had before, and the young lord passer" for
my steward, what great man I passed for myself 1
know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We
had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over
that we met with in all the journey; indeed,! call it
the worst, because the way was "very deep in some
places, and very uneven in others \ the best we had to
say for, it was, that we thought we had no troops of
Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they never came
on this side the river Oby, or at least but very sel-
dom; hut we found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country; and who led us
by private roads, that we avoided qpming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such
'as Tumen, Soloy, Kamaskoy, and several others; be-
cause the Muscovite garrisons, which are kept there,
are^very curious and strict in their observation on
travellers, and searching, least any of the banished per-
sons of note should make their escape that way into
Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept out of
the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when
we might have had good accomodation in the cities
on the way: this the young lord was so sensible of,
that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we
came to several cities on the way; but lay abroad him-
self, with his servant, in the woods, and met us al-
ways at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed th«
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
between Europe and Asia; and the first city on the
European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, which is
as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident alte-
ration in the people, their manners, their habit, their
religion, and their business; but we were mistaken;
or as we had a vast desert to pass, which, by rela-
ion, is near seven hundred miles long in some places,
but not above two hundred miles over where wc
passed it; so, till we came past that horrible place,
,ve found very little difference between that country
and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly Pagans,
and little belter than the savages of America; their
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living
wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, and
the villages near them: where they are Christians, as
they cali themselves, of the Creek church, but even
these have their religion mingled with so many relic's
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, escap-
ed, as before, have been plundered and robbed, ami
perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves: of what
country they were; whether the roving bands of the
Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the
banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far; or whether
thejvwere the sable hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback, carried
bows and arrows, and were at first about hve-and-
forty in number. They came so near to us as within
about two musket shot; and, asking no questions
they su mounded us with their horses, and looked very
earnestly upon us twice. At length they placed them-
selves just in our way; upon which we drew up in
a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen
men h\ all: and being drawn up thus, we halted,
and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his
(oa-d, to see who they were: his master was the mow
ivilling to let him go, because he was not a little ap-
prehensive that they were a Siberian troop sent out
after him. The man came up near them with a flag
of truce, and called to them; but though he spoke
.evornl of their languages, or dialects of languages ra»
dter, he could not understand a word they said : how-
ever, after some signs to him not to come nearer to
ihem at his peril, so he said he understood them to
mean, offering to shoot at him if he advanced, the
fellow came back no wiser than he went only that
bv their dress he said, he believed them to be some
Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes; and
that there must be more of them on the great desert,
though he never heard that ever any of them were
seen so far north before.
This was small comfort to us; however, we had no,,
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a quar
terof.a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of
trees, which stood close together, and very near the
r».ad; I immediately resolved* we should advance to
those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there; for, first, I considered that the trees would in a
great measure cover us from their arrows; and in the
next place, they could not come to charge us in a
body: it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who
proposed it: and who had this excellency attending
him, namely, that he was always readiest and most
apt to direct and encourage us in .cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what speed
we could, and gained that little wood, the Tartars, or
thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keeping
their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When
we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction,
that it was a swampy, springy, piece of ground, and
on the other side, a great spring of water, which, run-
ning out in a little rill or brook, was a little farther
joined by another of the like bigness; and was, in
short, the head or source of a considerable river, called
Afterwards the Wirtska. The tree's which grew about
this spring, were not in all above two hundred, but
were very large, and stood pretty thick; so that a3
soon as we got in, we saw ourselves-perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they alighted and attacked us
m foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese,
•vtth indefatigable application, cut down great arms
vjf the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite off,
from one tree to another; so that he made a conti-
nued fence almost round us.
Wre staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours without perceiving they made any oifer
to stir; when about two hours before night, they came
down directly upon us; and, though we had not per-
ceived it, v/e found they had been joined by some
more of the sanfe, so that they were near fourscore
horse, whereof, however, we fancied some were wo-
men. They came in till they were within half a shot
of our little wood, when we fired one musket without
ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue, to
know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; but
as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came
on with a double fury, directly to the wood-side, not
imagining we were so barricaded, that the)' could not
oreak in. Our old pilot was our captain as well as
he had been our engineer; and desired of us, not to
(ire upon them till they came within pistol shot, that
we might be sure to kill; and that, when we did the,
we should be sure to take good aim. , We bade him
give the word of command; which he delayed so long
that they were, some of them, within two pikes length
of us when we fired.
We aimed so true, (or Providence directed our shot
o sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the first
volley, and wounded several others, as also several of
heir horses; for we had all of us loaded our pieces,
with two or three bullets apeaoo at least.
They were lemhly surprised with our fire, and re-
created immediately about one hundred rods from us,
,n which time we loaded our pieces again, and, see-
ing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and caught
15$
four or five of their horses, whose riders, we suppos-
ed, were killed; and coming up to the dead, we could
easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not frfliu
what country, or how they came to make an excur-
sion of such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to atiaclr
us again, and rode roundour little wood, to see where
else they might break in; but finding us always ready
to face them, they went off again, and we resolved
not to stir from the place that night. 
We slept but little, you may be sure; but spent the
most part of the night in strengthening our situation,
and barricading the entrances into the wood: and,
keeping a strict watch, we waited for daylight, and,
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discoven
jndeed: for the enemy, who we thought were discou
raged with the reception they had met with, were now
increased to no less than three hundred, and had set
up^eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were
resolved to besiege us; and this little camp they harl
pitched, was upon the open plain, at about three quar-
ters of a mile from us. We were indeed surprised at
this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave myself
over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of my ef-
fects did not lie so near me (though they were very
considerable) as the thoughts of falling into the hand?
of such barbarians; at the latter end of my journey,
after so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone
tnrough; and even in sight of our port, where we ex-
pected safety and deliverance. As for my partner,
tie was raging: he declaicd, that to lose his goods
would be his ruin; and he would rather die than be
6tarved; and he was for fighting to the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed it
6elf, was for fighting to the last also; and my old pilo
was of the opinion we were able to resist them all,
in tho situation we then were in: and thus we spent
the day in debates of what we should do; but toward
evening, we fonnd that the number of our enemies
ttili increased: perhaps, as they were abroad m seve-
ral parties for prey1} the first had sent out scouts tc
call forhelp^nd to acquaint thern.of their booty; and
we did not know but by the morning they might still
be a greater number; so I'began to inquire of those
people we had brought from Tobolski, if there were
no other, or more private ways, by which we might
avoid them in the night, and perhaps either retreat to
6ome town, or get help to guard us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight
he would engage to carry us off in the night by a way
that went north toward the river Petraz, by which
he made no doubt but we might get away, and the
Tartars never the wiser; but he sa-id, his lord had told
him he would not return, but would rather choose to
.fight. I told him, he mistook his lord; fcr that he
was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it;
that I knew his lord was brave enough by what he
had showed already: but that his lord knew bcttcj
than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight
five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced
them to it; and that if bethought it possible for us to
escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to
attempt it. He answered if his lord gave him such
order, he would lose his life if he did not perform ii
We soon brought his lord to give'that order, thong!,
privately, and we immediately,prepared for the put-
ting it in practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be daik,we kindler
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all night,, that the
Tartars might conclude we were still there; but, as
goon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we could see
the stars, (for our guard would not stir before] having
all our horses and camels ready loaded, we followed
our new guide, who, I soon found, steered himself
by the pole or north star all the country being level
••r a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, n be-
gan to be lighter still; not that it was quite darK a!*
night, but the moon began to rise; so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by
six o'clock nest morning we were gotten nf.ar forty
miles, though the truth is, we almost snoil.-d ouj
hor?es. Here we found a Russian village, named Kir-
r.-azinskoy. where we rested, and heard nothing of
(he Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours he-
fore night we set Out again, and travelled till eight the
next morning, though not quite so hastily a:- before;
and anout seven o'clock we passed a little river, called
Kirtza, and came to a good lar»e town inhabited by
Russians, and very populous, called Ozomys. 1 here
we heard, that peveral troops or herds of Kalmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but thar we w.irc
now completely out of danger of them, whi'-h was to
o:ir (£icai icit'.sfaction, you maybe sure. Here we
were old.ged to get some fresh horses, and having
need enough of rest, we staid five days; and my part-
ner and 1 agreed to give the honest Siberian, who
brought us hither, the value of ten pistoles for his con-
ducting us.
In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the
river Witzogda, whicn running into the river Dwina;
we were there verv happily near the end of our tra-
tHs by land, that river being navigable in seven days
passage to Archangel. From hence we came to Law-
renskoy, where the river Joins, the third of July, and
provided ourselves with two luggage-boats, and a
Darge, for our convenience. We embarked the se-
venth, and arrived all safe at Archangel the eighteenth,
having been a year, five mouths, and three days on
Ihe journey, including our stay of eight months and
odd days at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks fot
the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer,
had not a Hamburghercome in above a month soon^
than any of the English ships; when after some con-
sideration, that the city of Hamburgh might happen,to
oe as good a market for our goods as London, we all
took freight with him; and having put our goods on
board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board to take care of them; by which means my
young lord had a sufficient oppoitunity to conceal
himself, never coming on shore again in all the time -
we staid there; and this he did, that he migl^ not be
geen in the city, where some of the Moscow merchant*
would certainly have seen and discovered him. \
W'e sailed fiom Archangel the twentieth of August,
the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad voy-
age, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of September.
Here my partner and 1 tound a very good sale tor
our goods, as well those of China, a* the sables, &.c.
of Sibera ; and dividing the produce of our effects, my
share accounted to 3475 I. 17s. 3d. notwithstanding
so many losses we had sustained, and charges we had
been at-only remembering that 1 had included, in
this, about 600 /. worth of diamonds, which I had
purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went
up to the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna,
where he resolved to seek protection, and whore he
.could correspond with those of his fathei's friends
who were left alive. He cues not part without all the
testimonies he could give of gratitude for the service
i had done him, and his sense of my kindness to the
prince his father.
To conclude: having staia near four months in Ham-
burgh, 1 came from thence over land to the Hague,
where I embarked in the packet, and 4 arrived in
London, the tenth of January, 1705, having* been gone
from England ten years and nine months*
And here, resolving to harass myself no n^re, 1
am preparing for a longer journey than all these, hav-
ing lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety,
And learnt sufficiently to know the value of retire-
Mot, and the blessing of ending our days in peace.
THE END.
