 ON THE 
 
 DEATH OF JOSEPH SCALIGER 
 
 That all created things perish, and that there is 
 nothing immortal in the world, save the power of mind 
 and the works of the understanding, are the particular 
 lessons of this day. To earth, to earth we have com- 
 mitted Joseph Scaliger's poor emaciated body, the nar- 
 row house in which that great spirit, prince of letters, 
 tarried sixty-eight years as a distinguished guest: in 
 which he produced so many splendid works, so many 
 divine monuments, so many writings that shall ever 
 live with all posterity. Though by this death I feel 
 myself so broken in spirit and maimed, that if voice by 
 tears, mind by very anguish oppressed become dumb, 
 I believe that I deserve all men's indulgence: yet I 
 fear lest some great and honorable men, who in all 
 lands are wont to employ the name of Scaliger, not as 
 that of a learned man, but as the appellation of learn- 
 ing itself, may accuse me of unadulterated rashness 
 and presumption. Their charge I neither reject, nor 
 am able to evade : so far from it, that I perceive I have 
 no defence left against them, except piety. Must an 
 oration on ScaUger be delivered ? I see many of my 
 colleagues, men of distinction, none who is not my

 superior in learning. Must it be adequate to his dig- 
 nity ? Then indeed I fear that all must be silent! But 
 since also of heavenly things many speak daily, not 
 trying to add praise unto them, which is either super- 
 fluous or impertinent, but leaving the admiration of 
 them free to all: so for us the mere mention of his vir- 
 tues shall suffice, but we shall leave the commendation 
 in detail to those who are prodigal of their judgment, 
 or who have less accurately compared the weakness of 
 their own powers with his greatness. If he had set 
 great store on noble birth, he was of the blood of kings 
 and princes: if on the deeds of his ancestors, none 
 could have numbered more trophies, more victories in 
 the same race ; if, finally, he had wished to be esteemed 
 for the lofty spirit which was conspicuous in the stock 
 of the Scaligers, he had as witnesses all histories, all 
 annals; nor could he turn his eyes to any place, where 
 he did not find the praise of his house. But indeed the 
 spirit above fortune, the mind eager for immortality, 
 the understanding fit for all sciences, the unresting 
 nights and days were vexed by the desire for eternal 
 fame: which by a fatal and secret law draws the power 
 of the understanding to itself, away from the pursuit of 
 perishable things, away from the dust and dirt of 
 human life. To such fame he was led, not by some 
 pedagogue, not by a common schoolmaster, not by a 
 hireling, but by him whose name I cannot mention 
 without veneration and awe, by the incomparable 
 and divine hero, Julius Scaliger: that he might have 
 the same man as the author of his nobility, of his life,

 and of his reputation. For when that grand old man, 
 oppressed by poverty and the envy of his folk, saw 
 nothing left except the splendor of race, a hard load for 
 unfortunate men, he resolved to close accounts with 
 the harshness of the fates, and, living quietly, to pre- 
 serve only the consciousness of that noble birth which 
 he could no longer support. Though he had made 
 many campaigns, and in youth had not been able to 
 ripen quietly at home, without constant action, that 
 untamed courage which nature implants in heroes, at 
 last he devoted himself wholly to those arts which he 
 taught his son in a manner worthy of himself. Of this 
 work and labor he received such great reward, that 
 when he considered the talents of the boy, he could 
 never restrain his tears. For the very sight of the 
 child admonished him of the ruin of his race, to which 
 Fortune, when she had struck her hardest, had left 
 greatness of understanding and loftiness of spirit rather 
 for pain than for consolation. For as fire by transfer 
 is not quenched, but commonly blazes fiercer: so in 
 those two men the deprivation of rank, the loss of an- 
 cestral wealth and dominion, quickened the generous 
 flame. So that even then our Joseph seemed to design 
 a new principality: which indeed, I will say, no matter 
 what prince hears me, he has at length obtained. 
 
 In the nineteenth year of his age he went to Paris, 
 and in that city he bound his spirit by a most audacious 
 vow. For perceiving that the sciences have certain 
 metes and bounds, but judging it to be the mark of a 
 narrow spirit to tarry within a single science, first 
 
 
 since the memory of man he undertook to range 
 through all disciplines together with languages. But 
 as he had learned that Greece is the mother, and as it 
 were the fountain head of all sciences, he wholly neg- 
 lected the pursuit of pleasure and speedily mastered 
 that language. Such was his eagerness, such was his 
 swiftness in acquirement, that, neglecting the trifles of 
 the grammarians, except as he formed his own gram- 
 mar from the reading of the poets, he learned Homer 
 complete in twenty-one days, the rest of the poets 
 within four months, and the other writers within the 
 space of two years. This heavy task performed, he 
 began the sacred tongue. I remember to have often 
 heard from his lips, that when he lived in Paris, at the 
 time when that famous and shocking massacre was 
 raging, he sat so intent upon his Hebrew that for some 
 time he heard neither the clash of arms, nor the groans 
 of children, nor the wailing women, nor the shouting 
 men. Allured by the marvellous sweetness of these 
 languages, while continually, like a fire, his ardor for 
 learning grew, he acquired in succession Chaldean, 
 Arabic, Phoenician, Ethiopic, Persian, and especially 
 Syriac. Similarly he directed himself with great spirit 
 to philosophy and mathematics. At this period the 
 name of Cujacius excelled in weight and fame; all 
 acknowledged his primacy in the law. With him Scali- 
 ger dwelt five years, in such wise that he wholly blotted 
 out from his spirit the enjoyment of literature, and 
 with his teacher, who became his friend, clave un- 
 dividely to the comparison of laws. And lest anything 
 
 
 should be wholly lacking, while he dihgently studied 
 the writings of the theologians, and particularly of the 
 ancient ones, he staid a long time at Geneva because of 
 Theodore Beza. What shall I say of great Hippocrates, 
 some of whose treatises, formerly printed at Paris, he 
 illustrated with notes; ^ whose Aphorisms, imitating 
 Celsus, he translated into Latin ? ^ 
 
 Equipped with this erudition, with learning so un- 
 precedented in a single man, as soon as he began to 
 unfurl the sails of understanding and to display that 
 omniscient memory of his, and to make trial of fame 
 with favorable breeze, at first all were astounded, nor 
 did they speak longer as of a man, but as of some new 
 monster. Theologians, lawyers, physicians, but espe- 
 cially those acquainted with the best Hterature, ap- 
 plauded vehemently, clung to him, and seemed unable 
 to praise him enough, either for their own satisfaction 
 or for his deserts. Some called him " bottomless pit of 
 erudition," others " sea of sciences "; some " the sun 
 of the learned," others " the divine offspring of a 
 divine father," others " the child of the gods "; some 
 " perpetual dictator of letters," others " the greatest 
 work and miracle of nature," some " nature's last 
 effort," some one thing, some another: whose selected 
 testimonies, in concise form, we shall publish together, 
 that the jealous may perceive the unanimity of the 
 learned. At last, by too great merit, and, as he himself 
 judged, by the immoderate praises of others, he began 
 
 ' See Bernays, Scaliger, pp. 239, 284. 
 ' I have not yet found this translation. 
 
 
 to earn the dislike of the wicked. But indeed, — let 
 them rage, let them be angry, let them mingle heaven 
 and earth, the ignorant who know not to judge of such 
 great erudition, or the malevolent who cannot bear it, 
 — he has left no more certain mark of his merit than 
 envy. For if we consider the Scaliger princes, his an- 
 cestors; whose family, as all bear witness, stood twelve 
 hundred years, who in power, victories, martial re- 
 nown, superiority of spirit and body, surpassed even 
 their peers: none among them all endured envy so 
 great, as our philologian (for so the facetious term him) 
 and unfortunate antiquarian sustained. There was 
 never a wicked man who could bear his virtue, or an 
 ignorant man who could endure his knowledge; and 
 (to repeat) that he provoked the wicked, that he boldly 
 scorned the ignorant, are alike proofs of his divine and 
 extraordinary superiority. For as glory from virtue, 
 so from glory, jealousy and envy must be expected. ^ 
 
 And if anyone so fears envy, as to think that he must 
 forsake the royal road of virtue lest he might displease 
 any of the wicked, he is a traitor to his colors and a 
 deserter. And indeed he is on the road to deserve uni- 
 versal contempt, who dares not bravely uphold the 
 praise of the good : which one must renounce once for 
 all, or else with unconquerable spirit wage war against 
 the powers of evil. He who is not able to do this, let 
 him prepare to depart unto some solitary spot, where 
 he need not even behold the sight of any great man; 
 and let him spend the remainder of his life in the pur- 
 suit of pleasure alone. There let him have his thoughts, 
 
 
 there his spirit, there all the hope of his life. In the 
 bosom and embraces of harlots, among drunkards him- 
 self more drunken, let him pass all his days heavy with 
 intoxication or surfeit: but let him not expect malice 
 and envy; not without reason did God and nature 
 make these things inconsistent. For as in battle he 
 who throws away his shield and gives divorcement to 
 valor, is in a httle while trampled on by men and 
 beasts, and perishes under feet: so he who cannot bear 
 envy, must bear contempt, which succeeds without 
 delay to the place of virtue. To me indeed jealousy 
 and malice seem the meat and viands of great souls, 
 and as it were a kind of sustenance; and often I have 
 admired our poets, the first authors of wisdom. For 
 whenever I behold their Hercules, who is put forward 
 by them as a perfect example of merit; whenever I 
 consider that back which they are wont to bestow 
 upon him, those sinews, that chest, those muscles: 
 truly I judge that the men were divine, who, that he 
 might become such a one, designated Envy as his 
 nurse : by whose frequent blows he might be hardened 
 as in a school of exercise; by whom irritated as long as 
 he lived, at length, having obtained immortality, he 
 mounted to heaven. Indeed as the wind, if it wander 
 in open air, perishes by that liberty and is diffused; but 
 if it be confined within the bowels of the earth, it 
 moves earth itself and escapes with violence: so they 
 in whose hearts that generous blood has glowed prefer, 
 in Envy's presence, to burst a passage to eternity, 
 rather than to journey quietly. Nor does there seem 
 
 
 a better way for heroes to rise to heaven than on the 
 shoulders of scoundrels. If this ever chanced to any, 
 assuredly it was to our hero: whose understanding, 
 picked from the purest fire, could not return to its 
 source without the aid of these calumnious blasts. Be- 
 fore he went, he owed the world many works: which, 
 whenever he joined conflict with wickedness, and gave 
 rein to his most righteous anger, he wrote with a spirit 
 greater because provoked. Often by calumnies, often 
 by falsehoods he had to be reminded of his own char- 
 acter: that from the bitterness of hatred he might 
 understand his greatness, and reflect upon his race; 
 from which, when he lost the rest, he retained nothing, 
 save Envy, greater than a private citizen's lot. That 
 pledge of most noble stock, this inheritance he received 
 from princes and kings; this inheritance he preserved 
 with unconquerable spirit even to the last breath; this 
 pledge at last, by the fame of his name, by the integrity 
 of his life, he extorted from wickedness itself. 
 
 I will not speak here of his moral character. I will 
 pass by his remarkable continence, temperance, so- 
 briety. But who does not admire in our hero the 
 matchless and divine constancy of spirit ? When once 
 he had joined this party,^ he could not be prevailed 
 upon by any prayers of adversaries, by any promises, 
 by any honors, even so far as to be willing to give any 
 one a hope of his conversion: lest even by the least 
 suspicion he might seem to have failed in the duty of a 
 pious man or an honorable citizen. Be assured, most

 illustrious auditors, that there is nothing more power- 
 ful than ambition, especially when it has invaded an 
 elevated and lofty spirit. It ruins everything, it de- 
 stroys everything, it storms the bulwarks of the mind 
 more strongly than all artillery and engines; nor is it 
 wont to regard anything except itself. And as they say 
 that bull's blood softens adamant, so the firmest coun- 
 sels totter at ambition's touch. But Scaliger bore a 
 mind absolutely free from the power and dominion of 
 this quality. What now shall I say of his contempt for 
 riches ? Most of us who are here know, some even saw, 
 that the illustrious and most noble man, Pierre Jean- 
 nin, president of the Parlement of Dijon, counsellor to 
 the king of the French, and now ambassador to the 
 Netherlanders, true glory of the toga, and patron of the 
 Muses, when he had twice ordered in vain that a great 
 sum of money be offered him, at length came to this 
 city a few days before his death, and added his own 
 authority and entreaties to the gift: and yet he did not 
 obtain that our old man should permit, even when 
 asked, that which others are wont to desire. By this 
 high deed, it seems to me, he dealt a staggering blow to 
 Fortune herself, and drove from his house and gates 
 that fickle jade, who had merited so ill of his ancestors, 
 and vigorously ordered her to mind her own business. 
 I think that he wished before his death, then already 
 close at hand, to leave to friends some illustrious ex- 
 ample of his merit, which could be calumniated more 
 easily than imitated by adversaries: of whom there is 
 none so perfectly wise, that he does not prefer to con- 
 
 
 temn the glory of Scaliger, rather than to copy his 
 virtues. I should have more to say, did I not know 
 there are some who cannot listen undisturbed even to 
 what I have spoken. 
 
 Something must now be said of his services to the 
 University. Nearly sixteen years have passed, since 
 the illustrious fathers, curators, and consuls of our city, 
 amid the arms by which they were then beset, amid 
 unparalleled and unremitting struggles for hberty, 
 snatched her Palladium from France, and called to this 
 city, at a liberal salary, the foremost name in Europe 
 (for so they rightly judged). That day seems to me, 
 as our former curator, Janus Dousa, wisely said, the 
 second founding of our University. For the Uberal dis- 
 ciplines and their students had lost their leader, Justus 
 Lipsius, a man of an eloquence most pleasant indeed, 
 but inimitable, and, as he himself judged, not even to 
 be attempted by others; while most of the students, 
 carried away by unhappy emulation of the distin- 
 guished Lipsius, and now abandoned by their teacher, 
 — whose writings they preferred to imitate feebly, 
 rather than to beheve his just warning, — fooUshly 
 desired to follow models which they could not success- 
 fully copy; and from these causes the study of Utera- 
 ture had entered upon a great crisis. If any one wished 
 to write in Latin, dead words were fetched from as far 
 back as Pacuvius and Ennius; sentences danced along; 
 a lean and jejune speech, juiceless and meagre, broken 
 by some short phrases and plays on words, or by 
 abrupt clauses and short questions, occasioned nausea 
 
 
 and disgust. You would have said it was stage players, 
 or an unfortunate train of the halt, who, while the 
 choregus is busy within, entertain the spectators to the 
 accompaniment of a flutist, and when sometimes, with 
 the greatest effort, they attempt to jump, are more 
 likely to fall than to go. If any one had emended a 
 single passage of Nonius or Festus, had restored a letter 
 or syllable in one place, ejected one in another, and had 
 vaUantly performed this trifling play without soUd 
 knowledge of facts, he appeared to have captured 
 Troy. And yet — please gods and men ! — they called 
 these Critics. That great Apollo staid this contagion 
 and pestilence by the mere impression of his arrival. 
 By unaffected dignity, speech masculine and strong, a 
 majesty of style his own and, as it were, hereditary, 
 he inspired the poor wanderers with shame. He united 
 so many arts, languages, disciplines, and sciences, that 
 if a philologian must know all those things, truly I can 
 affirm to you that no one after him will be a philo- 
 logian; and indeed that the rest, all who despise letters, 
 know far fewer things. To pass by all lesser works, he 
 pubHshed in this very city the book which he wrote on 
 the Emendation of Chronology (for the former edition 
 was nothing to the second).^ Of this work no one was 
 ever competent to judge without assistance. An old 
 man, near his end, he pubhshed that immense and 
 Herculean work,^ in which he revises the Chronicle of 
 
 * De Emendatione Temporum (ist ed., Lutetiae, 1583, repeated, 
 Francofurti, 1593; 2d ed., Lugduni Batavorum, 1598: " Castigatius 
 et multis partibus auctius, ut novum videri possit "). 
 
 * Thesaurus Temporum (Lugduni Batavorum, 1606). 
 
 
 Eusebius, notes the errors of all historians and chronog- 
 raphers, illustrates all ecclesiastical and profane anti- 
 quity. We have seen the illustrious and venerable old 
 man so intent upon this work, that often, when I had 
 visited him in the morning, I would discover him at 
 evening in the same spot. Neither food nor drink, and 
 sometimes not even sleep, could in any way recall the 
 attention of his mind from his purpose. If he had 
 aimed at nothing but glory, he could have given cart- 
 loads of notes on all authors. These notes, scattered at 
 random and dispersed, he did not even deign to collect, 
 and shared with his friends without reserve. And some 
 are found, who dare to blame him because he delivered 
 no lectures from the platform; as if indeed there are 
 not also some among us who wrote nothing. Now a 
 lecture is heard by the audience and presently perishes; 
 while writings are perused by the whole world, and, 
 if genius and painstaking are added, never die. No 
 one can fail to know that his house was as it were a 
 kind of oracle and shrine, to which all were wont to 
 come, who were uncertain about words or facts. Men 
 of all ranks, of all ages used to come: except those who 
 preferred to contemn merit rather than to admire it. 
 Whom can the wicked or slothful blame, if Scaliger 
 could not teach them the things which they were not 
 willing to learn from him ? Or why do they demand 
 from the innocence of the illustrious man the punish- 
 ment of their own negligence ? Why should I recount 
 the heavy burden of letters, and labor of writing, by 
 which almost alone he often complained that his day 
 
 
 was destroyed ? Frenchmen, or Germans, or Italians, 
 or Englishmen sent him some question every day, to 
 which he had to reply. For no one doubted that there 
 was one man in this city, who without any trouble 
 could make clear matters of which all men throughout 
 the world were ignorant. There was, there was that 
 time, when in a single house of this city one man was 
 master of more languages than any one in Europe. 
 There was, there was that time, when the house of one 
 man in this city was the Museum of the whole world: 
 when distant Maronites and Arabs, Syrians and Ethio- 
 pians, Persians and some of the Indians had in this city 
 the man to whom they could unfold their thoughts 
 through the interpretation of language. All these 
 things, except his name, are now quenched, over- 
 thrown, destroyed: nor is any solace left, save from his 
 kingly liberality. For since he could serve the Uni- 
 versity no more by his presence, he left to it all his 
 foreign manuscripts. Having these, we now challenge 
 all Ubraries in this department. But, great hero, the 
 more splendid we all acknowledge this gift of thine to 
 be, the more do we recognize our weakness. For as 
 none was able even to move the weapons of Achilles 
 slam, so all shall behold thy armory of wisdom, perhaps 
 no man will ever use it all. But that too shall be a 
 token of thy greatness. For we shall look upon all 
 volumes there left as spoils from human ignorance and 
 envy, and in their contemplation the secret memory of 
 thy great name shall inflame our mind and spirit : and 
 they who are unwilling to proclaim thy praises shall 
 still be compelled to admire thy erudition. 
 
 
 But thou, O lofty soul, who, free from thy weaker 
 part, now dost triumph over malice, over fortune, and 
 finally over death itself, which, with unmoved coun- 
 tenance, with great courage, without moans or lamen- 
 tation, thou didst bravely look upon during its long 
 approach, and at last endure; who with utmost delight 
 didst steal away that spirit of thine, derived from 
 kings and princes, from a world ungrateful, and unable 
 to bear the majesty of thy race in thy condition: now 
 Hberated unto thy dignity, thou wanderest through the 
 immeasurable spaces of the air; now the glory which 
 men preferred to envy the living, they will at least 
 yield to the dead. Whatever of thee anyone could 
 hate, a part the power of disease gradually consumed; 
 what remained from disease, earth now holds. Thou 
 shalt be on the Ups, in the mind of all: and the great- 
 ness of thy name shall be bounded by the whole world ; 
 the duration of thy fame, by the vast profundity of 
 time. Farewell, true and last offspring of the Scali- 
 gers! Farewell, blood of heroes! Farewell, prince of 
 letters! Farewell, victor over Envy! Farewell, con- 
 queror of monsters! Farewell, farewell, and adieu for- 
 ever! But if anything of human thoughts is left in 
 thee, if thou still cherishest regard for thy friends, if of 
 him who has ever honored thee as parent and teacher, 
 whom thou art wont to call the first-bom of thy sons, 
 to whom from thy most sacred inheritance, which up- 
 rightness did not allow to be greater, thou didst wish 
 some part to come, to whom thou didst commit thy 
 writings, that is, the orphans of thy understanding; if 
 
 
 of him thou, established in light, amid the rejoicings of 
 thy kin, yielding thy whole being to the embraces of 
 thy Julius, — if of me, of me, I say, thou canst still 
 have memory, O father, accept this last gift, which I 
 offer thee with sorrow of my life, with tears, with 
 mourning and lamentation. As for me, orphaned of 
 the best of parents, robbed of my teacher, deprived of 
 the most delightful witness and patron of all studies, I 
 shall go on, amid enemies of letters, and disgraces to 
 the human race, to wallow in the mire of calumnies 
 and malignity, until I am united with thee and with 
 eternity itself. And ye, noble, illustrious, distinguished 
 men, and ye, excellent and chosen youths, never in this 
 hall shall ye see the august countenance of ScaHger. 
 When ye see this place empty of his body, reflect that 
 the University is empty of all his sciences and virtues. 
 I have spoken.

 ON THE 
 
 DEATH OF JOSEPH SCALIGER 
 
 That all created things perish, and that there is 
 nothing immortal in the world, save the power of mind 
 and the works of the understanding, are the particular 
 lessons of this day. To earth, to earth we have com- 
 mitted Joseph Scaliger's poor emaciated body, the nar- 
 row house in which that great spirit, prince of letters, 
 tarried sixty-eight years as a distinguished guest: in 
 which he produced so many splendid works, so many 
 divine monuments, so many writings that shall ever 
 live with all posterity. Though by this death I feel 
 myself so broken in spirit and maimed, that if voice by 
 tears, mind by very anguish oppressed become dumb, 
 I believe that I deserve all men's indulgence: yet I 
 fear lest some great and honorable men, who in all 
 lands are wont to employ the name of Scaliger, not as 
 that of a learned man, but as the appellation of learn- 
 ing itself, may accuse me of unadulterated rashness 
 and presumption. Their charge I neither reject, nor 
 am able to evade : so far from it, that I perceive I have 
 no defence left against them, except piety. Must an 
 oration on ScaUger be delivered ? I see many of my 
 colleagues, men of distinction, none who is not my 
 
 Br

 superior in learning. Must it be adequate to his dig- 
 nity ? Then indeed I fear that all must be silent! But 
 since also of heavenly things many speak daily, not 
 trying to add praise unto them, which is either super- 
 fluous or impertinent, but leaving the admiration of 
 them free to all: so for us the mere mention of his vir- 
 tues shall suffice, but we shall leave the commendation 
 in detail to those who are prodigal of their judgment, 
 or who have less accurately compared the weakness of 
 their own powers with his greatness. If he had set 
 great store on noble birth, he was of the blood of kings 
 and princes: if on the deeds of his ancestors, none 
 could have numbered more trophies, more victories in 
 the same race ; if, finally, he had wished to be esteemed 
 for the lofty spirit which was conspicuous in the stock 
 of the Scaligers, he had as witnesses all histories, all 
 annals; nor could he turn his eyes to any place, where 
 he did not find the praise of his house. But indeed the 
 spirit above fortune, the mind eager for immortality, 
 the understanding fit for all sciences, the unresting 
 nights and days were vexed by the desire for eternal 
 fame: which by a fatal and secret law draws the power 
 of the understanding to itself, away from the pursuit of 
 perishable things, away from the dust and dirt of 
 human life. To such fame he was led, not by some 
 pedagogue, not by a common schoolmaster, not by a 
 hireling, but by him whose name I cannot mention 
 without veneration and awe, by the incomparable 
 and divine hero, Julius Scaliger: that he might have 
 the same man as the author of his nobility, of his life, 
 
 
 and of his reputation. For when that grand old man, 
 oppressed by poverty and the envy of his folk, saw 
 nothing left except the splendor of race, a hard load for 
 unfortunate men, he resolved to close accounts with 
 the harshness of the fates, and, living quietly, to pre- 
 serve only the consciousness of that noble birth which 
 he could no longer support. Though he had made 
 many campaigns, and in youth had not been able to 
 ripen quietly at home, without constant action, that 
 untamed courage which nature implants in heroes, at 
 last he devoted himself wholly to those arts which he 
 taught his son in a manner worthy of himself. Of this 
 work and labor he received such great reward, that 
 when he considered the talents of the boy, he could 
 never restrain his tears. For the very sight of the 
 child admonished him of the ruin of his race, to which 
 Fortune, when she had struck her hardest, had left 
 greatness of understanding and loftiness of spirit rather 
 for pain than for consolation. For as fire by transfer 
 is not quenched, but commonly blazes fiercer: so in 
 those two men the deprivation of rank, the loss of an- 
 cestral wealth and dominion, quickened the generous 
 flame. So that even then our Joseph seemed to design 
 a new principality: which indeed, I will say, no matter 
 what prince hears me, he has at length obtained. 
 
 In the nineteenth year of his age he went to Paris, 
 and in that city he bound his spirit by a most audacious 
 vow. For perceiving that the sciences have certain 
 metes and bounds, but judging it to be the mark of a 
 narrow spirit to tarry within a single science, first 
 
 
 since the memory of man he undertook to range 
 through all disciplines together with languages. But 
 as he had learned that Greece is the mother, and as it 
 were the fountain head of all sciences, he wholly neg- 
 lected the pursuit of pleasure and speedily mastered 
 that language. Such was his eagerness, such was his 
 swiftness in acquirement, that, neglecting the trifles of 
 the grammarians, except as he formed his own gram- 
 mar from the reading of the poets, he learned Homer 
 complete in twenty-one days, the rest of the poets 
 within four months, and the other writers within the 
 space of two years. This heavy task performed, he 
 began the sacred tongue. I remember to have often 
 heard from his lips, that when he lived in Paris, at the 
 time when that famous and shocking massacre was 
 raging, he sat so intent upon his Hebrew that for some 
 time he heard neither the clash of arms, nor the groans 
 of children, nor the wailing women, nor the shouting 
 men. Allured by the marvellous sweetness of these 
 languages, while continually, like a fire, his ardor for 
 learning grew, he acquired in succession Chaldean, 
 Arabic, Phoenician, Ethiopic, Persian, and especially 
 Syriac. Similarly he directed himself with great spirit 
 to philosophy and mathematics. At this period the 
 name of Cujacius excelled in weight and fame; all 
 acknowledged his primacy in the law. With him Scali- 
 ger dwelt five years, in such wise that he wholly blotted 
 out from his spirit the enjoyment of literature, and 
 with his teacher, who became his friend, clave un- 
 dividely to the comparison of laws. And lest anything 
 
 
 should be wholly lacking, while he dihgently studied 
 the writings of the theologians, and particularly of the 
 ancient ones, he staid a long time at Geneva because of 
 Theodore Beza. What shall I say of great Hippocrates, 
 some of whose treatises, formerly printed at Paris, he 
 illustrated with notes; ^ whose Aphorisms, imitating 
 Celsus, he translated into Latin ? ^ 
 
 Equipped with this erudition, with learning so un- 
 precedented in a single man, as soon as he began to 
 unfurl the sails of understanding and to display that 
 omniscient memory of his, and to make trial of fame 
 with favorable breeze, at first all were astounded, nor 
 did they speak longer as of a man, but as of some new 
 monster. Theologians, lawyers, physicians, but espe- 
 cially those acquainted with the best Hterature, ap- 
 plauded vehemently, clung to him, and seemed unable 
 to praise him enough, either for their own satisfaction 
 or for his deserts. Some called him " bottomless pit of 
 erudition," others " sea of sciences "; some " the sun 
 of the learned," others " the divine offspring of a 
 divine father," others " the child of the gods "; some 
 " perpetual dictator of letters," others " the greatest 
 work and miracle of nature," some " nature's last 
 effort," some one thing, some another: whose selected 
 testimonies, in concise form, we shall publish together, 
 that the jealous may perceive the unanimity of the 
 learned. At last, by too great merit, and, as he himself 
 judged, by the immoderate praises of others, he began

 to earn the dislike of the wicked. But indeed, — let 
 them rage, let them be angry, let them mingle heaven 
 and earth, the ignorant who know not to judge of such 
 great erudition, or the malevolent who cannot bear it, 
 — he has left no more certain mark of his merit than 
 envy. For if we consider the Scaliger princes, his an- 
 cestors; whose family, as all bear witness, stood twelve 
 hundred years, who in power, victories, martial re- 
 nown, superiority of spirit and body, surpassed even 
 their peers: none among them all endured envy so 
 great, as our philologian (for so the facetious term him) 
 and unfortunate antiquarian sustained. There was 
 never a wicked man who could bear his virtue, or an 
 ignorant man who could endure his knowledge; and 
 (to repeat) that he provoked the wicked, that he boldly 
 scorned the ignorant, are alike proofs of his divine and 
 extraordinary superiority. For as glory from virtue, 
 so from glory, jealousy and envy must be expected. ^ 
 
 And if anyone so fears envy, as to think that he must 
 forsake the royal road of virtue lest he might displease 
 any of the wicked, he is a traitor to his colors and a 
 deserter. And indeed he is on the road to deserve uni- 
 versal contempt, who dares not bravely uphold the 
 praise of the good : which one must renounce once for 
 all, or else with unconquerable spirit wage war against 
 the powers of evil. He who is not able to do this, let 
 him prepare to depart unto some solitary spot, where 
 he need not even behold the sight of any great man; 
 and let him spend the remainder of his life in the pur- 
 suit of pleasure alone. There let him have his thoughts, 
 
 
 there his spirit, there all the hope of his life. In the 
 bosom and embraces of harlots, among drunkards him- 
 self more drunken, let him pass all his days heavy with 
 intoxication or surfeit: but let him not expect malice 
 and envy; not without reason did God and nature 
 make these things inconsistent. For as in battle he 
 who throws away his shield and gives divorcement to 
 valor, is in a httle while trampled on by men and 
 beasts, and perishes under feet: so he who cannot bear 
 envy, must bear contempt, which succeeds without 
 delay to the place of virtue. To me indeed jealousy 
 and malice seem the meat and viands of great souls, 
 and as it were a kind of sustenance; and often I have 
 admired our poets, the first authors of wisdom. For 
 whenever I behold their Hercules, who is put forward 
 by them as a perfect example of merit; whenever I 
 consider that back which they are wont to bestow 
 upon him, those sinews, that chest, those muscles: 
 truly I judge that the men were divine, who, that he 
 might become such a one, designated Envy as his 
 nurse : by whose frequent blows he might be hardened 
 as in a school of exercise; by whom irritated as long as 
 he lived, at length, having obtained immortality, he 
 mounted to heaven. Indeed as the wind, if it wander 
 in open air, perishes by that liberty and is diffused; but 
 if it be confined within the bowels of the earth, it 
 moves earth itself and escapes with violence: so they 
 in whose hearts that generous blood has glowed prefer, 
 in Envy's presence, to burst a passage to eternity, 
 rather than to journey quietly. Nor does there seem 
 
 
 a better way for heroes to rise to heaven than on the 
 shoulders of scoundrels. If this ever chanced to any, 
 assuredly it was to our hero: whose understanding, 
 picked from the purest fire, could not return to its 
 source without the aid of these calumnious blasts. Be- 
 fore he went, he owed the world many works: which, 
 whenever he joined conflict with wickedness, and gave 
 rein to his most righteous anger, he wrote with a spirit 
 greater because provoked. Often by calumnies, often 
 by falsehoods he had to be reminded of his own char- 
 acter: that from the bitterness of hatred he might 
 understand his greatness, and reflect upon his race; 
 from which, when he lost the rest, he retained nothing, 
 save Envy, greater than a private citizen's lot. That 
 pledge of most noble stock, this inheritance he received 
 from princes and kings; this inheritance he preserved 
 with unconquerable spirit even to the last breath; this 
 pledge at last, by the fame of his name, by the integrity 
 of his life, he extorted from wickedness itself. 
 
 I will not speak here of his moral character. I will 
 pass by his remarkable continence, temperance, so- 
 briety. But who does not admire in our hero the 
 matchless and divine constancy of spirit ? When once 
 he had joined this party,^ he could not be prevailed 
 upon by any prayers of adversaries, by any promises, 
 by any honors, even so far as to be willing to give any 
 one a hope of his conversion: lest even by the least 
 suspicion he might seem to have failed in the duty of a 
 pious man or an honorable citizen. Be assured, most

 illustrious auditors, that there is nothing more power- 
 ful than ambition, especially when it has invaded an 
 elevated and lofty spirit. It ruins everything, it de- 
 stroys everything, it storms the bulwarks of the mind 
 more strongly than all artillery and engines; nor is it 
 wont to regard anything except itself. And as they say 
 that bull's blood softens adamant, so the firmest coun- 
 sels totter at ambition's touch. But Scaliger bore a 
 mind absolutely free from the power and dominion of 
 this quality. What now shall I say of his contempt for 
 riches ? Most of us who are here know, some even saw, 
 that the illustrious and most noble man, Pierre Jean- 
 nin, president of the Parlement of Dijon, counsellor to 
 the king of the French, and now ambassador to the 
 Netherlanders, true glory of the toga, and patron of the 
 Muses, when he had twice ordered in vain that a great 
 sum of money be offered him, at length came to this 
 city a few days before his death, and added his own 
 authority and entreaties to the gift: and yet he did not 
 obtain that our old man should permit, even when 
 asked, that which others are wont to desire. By this 
 high deed, it seems to me, he dealt a staggering blow to 
 Fortune herself, and drove from his house and gates 
 that fickle jade, who had merited so ill of his ancestors, 
 and vigorously ordered her to mind her own business. 
 I think that he wished before his death, then already 
 close at hand, to leave to friends some illustrious ex- 
 ample of his merit, which could be calumniated more 
 easily than imitated by adversaries: of whom there is 
 none so perfectly wise, that he does not prefer to con- 
 
 
 temn the glory of Scaliger, rather than to copy his 
 virtues. I should have more to say, did I not know 
 there are some who cannot listen undisturbed even to 
 what I have spoken. 
 
 Something must now be said of his services to the 
 University. Nearly sixteen years have passed, since 
 the illustrious fathers, curators, and consuls of our city, 
 amid the arms by which they were then beset, amid 
 unparalleled and unremitting struggles for hberty, 
 snatched her Palladium from France, and called to this 
 city, at a liberal salary, the foremost name in Europe 
 (for so they rightly judged). That day seems to me, 
 as our former curator, Janus Dousa, wisely said, the 
 second founding of our University. For the Uberal dis- 
 ciplines and their students had lost their leader, Justus 
 Lipsius, a man of an eloquence most pleasant indeed, 
 but inimitable, and, as he himself judged, not even to 
 be attempted by others; while most of the students, 
 carried away by unhappy emulation of the distin- 
 guished Lipsius, and now abandoned by their teacher, 
 — whose writings they preferred to imitate feebly, 
 rather than to beheve his just warning, — fooUshly 
 desired to follow models which they could not success- 
 fully copy; and from these causes the study of Utera- 
 ture had entered upon a great crisis. If any one wished 
 to write in Latin, dead words were fetched from as far 
 back as Pacuvius and Ennius; sentences danced along; 
 a lean and jejune speech, juiceless and meagre, broken 
 by some short phrases and plays on words, or by 
 abrupt clauses and short questions, occasioned nausea 
 
 
 and disgust. You would have said it was stage players, 
 or an unfortunate train of the halt, who, while the 
 choregus is busy within, entertain the spectators to the 
 accompaniment of a flutist, and when sometimes, with 
 the greatest effort, they attempt to jump, are more 
 likely to fall than to go. If any one had emended a 
 single passage of Nonius or Festus, had restored a letter 
 or syllable in one place, ejected one in another, and had 
 vaUantly performed this trifling play without soUd 
 knowledge of facts, he appeared to have captured 
 Troy. And yet — please gods and men ! — they called 
 these Critics. That great Apollo staid this contagion 
 and pestilence by the mere impression of his arrival. 
 By unaffected dignity, speech masculine and strong, a 
 majesty of style his own and, as it were, hereditary, 
 he inspired the poor wanderers with shame. He united 
 so many arts, languages, disciplines, and sciences, that 
 if a philologian must know all those things, truly I can 
 affirm to you that no one after him will be a philo- 
 logian; and indeed that the rest, all who despise letters, 
 know far fewer things. To pass by all lesser works, he 
 pubHshed in this very city the book which he wrote on 
 the Emendation of Chronology (for the former edition 
 was nothing to the second).^ Of this work no one was 
 ever competent to judge without assistance. An old 
 man, near his end, he pubhshed that immense and 
 Herculean work,^ in which he revises the Chronicle of 
 
 * De Emendatione Temporum (ist ed., Lutetiae, 1583, repeated, 
 Francofurti, 1593; 2d ed., Lugduni Batavorum, 1598: " Castigatius 
 et multis partibus auctius, ut novum videri possit ").

 Eusebius, notes the errors of all historians and chronog- 
 raphers, illustrates all ecclesiastical and profane anti- 
 quity. We have seen the illustrious and venerable old 
 man so intent upon this work, that often, when I had 
 visited him in the morning, I would discover him at 
 evening in the same spot. Neither food nor drink, and 
 sometimes not even sleep, could in any way recall the 
 attention of his mind from his purpose. If he had 
 aimed at nothing but glory, he could have given cart- 
 loads of notes on all authors. These notes, scattered at 
 random and dispersed, he did not even deign to collect, 
 and shared with his friends without reserve. And some 
 are found, who dare to blame him because he delivered 
 no lectures from the platform; as if indeed there are 
 not also some among us who wrote nothing. Now a 
 lecture is heard by the audience and presently perishes; 
 while writings are perused by the whole world, and, 
 if genius and painstaking are added, never die. No 
 one can fail to know that his house was as it were a 
 kind of oracle and shrine, to which all were wont to 
 come, who were uncertain about words or facts. Men 
 of all ranks, of all ages used to come: except those who 
 preferred to contemn merit rather than to admire it. 
 Whom can the wicked or slothful blame, if Scaliger 
 could not teach them the things which they were not 
 willing to learn from him ? Or why do they demand 
 from the innocence of the illustrious man the punish- 
 ment of their own negligence ? Why should I recount 
 the heavy burden of letters, and labor of writing, by 
 which almost alone he often complained that his day 
 
 
 was destroyed ? Frenchmen, or Germans, or Italians, 
 or Englishmen sent him some question every day, to 
 which he had to reply. For no one doubted that there 
 was one man in this city, who without any trouble 
 could make clear matters of which all men throughout 
 the world were ignorant. There was, there was that 
 time, when in a single house of this city one man was 
 master of more languages than any one in Europe. 
 There was, there was that time, when the house of one 
 man in this city was the Museum of the whole world: 
 when distant Maronites and Arabs, Syrians and Ethio- 
 pians, Persians and some of the Indians had in this city 
 the man to whom they could unfold their thoughts 
 through the interpretation of language. All these 
 things, except his name, are now quenched, over- 
 thrown, destroyed: nor is any solace left, save from his 
 kingly liberality. For since he could serve the Uni- 
 versity no more by his presence, he left to it all his 
 foreign manuscripts. Having these, we now challenge 
 all Ubraries in this department. But, great hero, the 
 more splendid we all acknowledge this gift of thine to 
 be, the more do we recognize our weakness. For as 
 none was able even to move the weapons of Achilles 
 slam, so all shall behold thy armory of wisdom, perhaps 
 no man will ever use it all. But that too shall be a 
 token of thy greatness. For we shall look upon all 
 volumes there left as spoils from human ignorance and 
 envy, and in their contemplation the secret memory of 
 thy great name shall inflame our mind and spirit : and 
 they who are unwilling to proclaim thy praises shall 
 still be compelled to admire thy erudition. 
 
 
 But thou, O lofty soul, who, free from thy weaker 
 part, now dost triumph over malice, over fortune, and 
 finally over death itself, which, with unmoved coun- 
 tenance, with great courage, without moans or lamen- 
 tation, thou didst bravely look upon during its long 
 approach, and at last endure; who with utmost delight 
 didst steal away that spirit of thine, derived from 
 kings and princes, from a world ungrateful, and unable 
 to bear the majesty of thy race in thy condition: now 
 Hberated unto thy dignity, thou wanderest through the 
 immeasurable spaces of the air; now the glory which 
 men preferred to envy the living, they will at least 
 yield to the dead. Whatever of thee anyone could 
 hate, a part the power of disease gradually consumed; 
 what remained from disease, earth now holds. Thou 
 shalt be on the Ups, in the mind of all: and the great- 
 ness of thy name shall be bounded by the whole world ; 
 the duration of thy fame, by the vast profundity of 
 time. Farewell, true and last offspring of the Scali- 
 gers! Farewell, blood of heroes! Farewell, prince of 
 letters! Farewell, victor over Envy! Farewell, con- 
 queror of monsters! Farewell, farewell, and adieu for- 
 ever! But if anything of human thoughts is left in 
 thee, if thou still cherishest regard for thy friends, if of 
 him who has ever honored thee as parent and teacher, 
 whom thou art wont to call the first-bom of thy sons, 
 to whom from thy most sacred inheritance, which up- 
 rightness did not allow to be greater, thou didst wish 
 some part to come, to whom thou didst commit thy 
 writings, that is, the orphans of thy understanding; if 
 
 
 of him thou, established in light, amid the rejoicings of 
 thy kin, yielding thy whole being to the embraces of 
 thy Julius, — if of me, of me, I say, thou canst still 
 have memory, O father, accept this last gift, which I 
 offer thee with sorrow of my life, with tears, with 
 mourning and lamentation. As for me, orphaned of 
 the best of parents, robbed of my teacher, deprived of 
 the most delightful witness and patron of all studies, I 
 shall go on, amid enemies of letters, and disgraces to 
 the human race, to wallow in the mire of calumnies 
 and malignity, until I am united with thee and with 
 eternity itself. And ye, noble, illustrious, distinguished 
 men, and ye, excellent and chosen youths, never in this 
 hall shall ye see the august countenance of ScaHger. 
 When ye see this place empty of his body, reflect that 
 the University is empty of all his sciences and virtues. 
 I have spoken.
