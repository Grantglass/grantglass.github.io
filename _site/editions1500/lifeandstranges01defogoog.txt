THE 



PREFACE. 



'TH HE fuccefs the former part of this Work 
'^ has met with in the world, has yet been 
no other than is acknowledged to be due to 
the furprifmg variety of the fubjeft, and to 
the agreeable manner of the performance. 

All the endeavours of envious people to re- 
proach it with being a romance, to fearch it 
for errors in geography, inconfiftency in the 
relation, and contradidlions in the fadl, have 
proved abortive, and as impotent as mali- 
cious. 

The juft application of every incident, the 
religious and ufeful inferences drawn from 
every part, are fo many teftimonies to the 
good defign of making it public, and mull 
legitimate all the part that may be called in- 
vention or parable in the ftorJ^ 

Vol. II. A The 



IV PREFACE. 

The Second Part, if the Editor's opinion 
rtiay pafs, is (contrary to the ufage of Second 
Parts) every way as entertaining as the Firft ; 
contains as ftrange and furprifing incidents, 
and as great a variety of them; nor is the 
application lefs ferious or fuitable ; and doubt- 
lefs will, to the fober, as well as the ingenious 
Reader, be every way as profitable and di- 
verting; and this makes the abridging this 
Work as fcandalous,- as it is knavifh and ridi- 
culous. Seeing, to fhorten the Book, that they 
may feem to reduce the value, they ftrip it of 
all thofe refledlions, as Vv^ell religious as moral, 
which are not only the greateft beauties of the 
WoRKj but are calculated for the infinite ad- 
vantage of the Reader, 

By this, they leave the Work naked of its 
brighteft ornaments; and yet they would (at 
the fame time they pretend that the Author 
has fupplied his ftory out of his invention) 
take from it the improvement, which alone 
recommends that invention to wife and good 
men. 

The injury thefe men do to the Propri- 
etors of WouKS, is a practice all honeft

O F 



ROBmsON CRUSOE, 



THAT homely proverb ufed on fo many occa- 
fions in England^ viz. That what is bred in the 
bone will not go oiit ofthefiejh^ was never more verified 
than in the ftory of my LIFE. Any one would think 
that after thirty-five years afftiftion, and a variety of 
unhappy circumftances, which few men, if any, ever 
went through before, and after near feven ye2[rs of 
peace and enjoyment in the fulnefs of all things ; 
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed 
me to have had experience of every ftate of middle 
life, and to know which was moft adapted to mak« 
a man compleatly happy ; 1 fay, after all this, any 
one would have thought that the native propenfiiy to 
rambling, which I gave an account of in my firft 
letting out into the world to have been fo predomi-

nant in my thoughts, Ihould be worn out, the volatile 
part be fully evacuated, or at leaft condenfed, and I 
might at 6 1 years of age have been a little inclined to 
ftay at home, and have done venturing life and for- 
tune any more. 

Nay farther, the common motive of foreign ad- 
ventures was taken away in me ; for I had no fortune 
to make, I had nothing to feek : if I had gained ten 
thoufand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had 
already fufEcient for me, and for thofe I had to leave 
it to ; and that 1 had was vifibly increafmg ; for 
having no great family, I could not fpend the income 
of what I had, unlefs I would fet up for an expenfive 
way of living, fuch as a great family, fervants, 
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I 
had no notion of, or inclination to ; fo that I had 
nothing indeed to do but to lit ftill, and fully enjoy 
what I had got, and fee it increafe daily upon my 
hands- 
Yet all thefe things had no effefl: upon me, or at 
leaft not enough to refift the ftrong inclination I 
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a 
chronical diftemper ; particularly the defire of feeing 
my new plantation in the ifland, and the colony I left 
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it 
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day ; 
it was uppermoft in all my thoughts, and my fancy 
worked fo fteadily and ftrongly upon it, that I talked 
of it in my fleep ; in (hort, nothing could remove it 
out of my mind ; it even broke fo violently into all 
my difcourfes, that it made my converfation tirefome j 
for I could talk of nothing elfe, all my difcourfe run 
into it, even to impertinence, and I faw it myfelf. 

I have 



t)F kOBINSON CRtJSOE. 3 

t have often heard perfons of good judgment fay, 
that all the ftir people make in the world about 
ghofts and apparitions, is owing to the ftrength of 
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy 
hi their minds ; that there is no fuch thing as a fpirit 
appearing, or a ghoft walking, and the like 5 that 
people's poring affeftionately upon the part converfa- 
tion of their deceafed friends fo realifes it to them, 
that they are capable of fancying upon foine extra- 
ordinary circumftances that they fee them, talk to 
them, and are anfwered by them, when, in truth, 
there is nothing but (hadow and vapour in the thing ; 
and they really know nothing of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether 
there are any fuch things as real apparitions, fpeftres, 
or walking of people after they are dead, or whether 
there is any thing in the ftories they tell us of that 
kind, more than the produft of vapours, fick minds, 
and wandering fancies : But this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to fuch a height, and brought 
me into fuch excefs of vapours, or what elfe I may 
call it, that I aftually fuppofed myfelf often-times 
upon the fpot, at my old caftle behind the trees, faw 
my old Spaniard^ Friday^ father, and the reprobate 
faiiors whom I left upon the ifland ; nay, I fancied I talk- 
ed with them, and looked at them as fteadily, though 
I was broad awake, as at perfons juft before me ; and 
this I did till I often frightened myfelf with the images 
my fancy reprefented to me : one time in my fleep I 
had the villainy of the three piratefailorsfo lively related 
to me by the firft Spaniard and Fridayh father, that 
it was furprifmg ; they told me how they barbaroufly 
attempted to murder all the Spaniards^ and that they 

B 3 fet 



4 LJLFE AND ADVENTURES 

fet fire to the provifions they had laid up, on pur- 
pofe to diflrefs and ftarve thenij things that I had 
never heard of, and that were yet all of thenir 
true in fad : but it was fo warm in my imagina- 
tion, and fo realifed to me, that to the hour I faw 
them, I could not be perfuaded but that it was or 
'Vvould be true; alfo, how I refented it when the 
Spaniard complained to me, ^nd how I brought them 
to juftice, tried them before me, and ordered them. 
^W three to be hanged : what there wa« really in this, 
fhall be feen in its place : for however I came to form 
fuch things in my dream, and what fecret converfe 
of fpirits injeded it, yet there was, I fay, very much 
of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing 
literally and fpecifically true : but the general part 
was fo true, the bafe and villainous behaviour of thefe 
three hardened rogues was fuch, and had been fo 
much worfe than all I can defcribe, that the dream 
had too much fimilitude of the fad, and as I would 
afterwards have puniftied them feverely ; fo if I had 
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and 
Ihould have been juftifiable both by the laws of God- 
and man. 

But to return to my ftory. In this kind of temper 
Lhad lived fome years; I had no enjoyment of my 
life, no pleafant hours, no agreeable diverfion but 
what had fomething or other of this in it, fo that 
my wife, who faw my mind fo wholly bent upon it, 
told me very ferioufly one night, that flie believed 
there was fome fecret powerful impulfe of Providence 
upon me, which had determined me to go thither 
again ; and that flie found nothing hindred my going* 
but my being engaged to a wife and children. She^ 

told 



OJF R03IN150II CRlJSOE. 5 

told me, that it was true flie could not think of part- 
ing with me ; but as fhe was affured, that if fhe was 
dead it would be the firft thing I would do ; fo, as 
it feemed to her that the thing was determined above, 
Ihe would not be the only obftruftion : for if I 

thought fit, and refolved to go here fhe found 

me very intent upon her words, and that I looked 
very earneftly at her ; fo that it a little difordered her, 
and fhe flopped, I afked tier why flie did not go on, 
and fay out what fhe was going to fay ? But I per- 
ceived her heart was too full, and fome tears flood in 
her eyes : Speak out, my dear, faid I, are you willing 
I fhould go ? No, fays fhe, very afFeftionately, I am far 
from willing : but if you are refolved to go, fays fhe, 
and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will 
go with you; for though I think it a prepofle- 
rous thing for one of your years, and in your condi- 
tion, yet if it muft be, faid fhe again, weeping, I 
won't leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, you mufl 
<lo it ; there is no refifling it ; and if Heaven makes 
it your duty to go, he will alfo make it mine to go 
with you, or otherwife difpofe of me, that I may 
not obftrufl: it. 

This affedionate behaviour of my wife brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to confider 
what I was doing ; I correfted my wandering fancy, 
and began to argue with myfelf fedately, what bufi- 
nefs I had, after tbreefcore years, and after fuch a 
life of tedious fufFerings and difaflers, and clofed in 
fo happy and eafy a manner, I fay, what bufinefs had 
I to rufh into new hazards, and put myfelf upon adven- 
tures, fit only for youth and poverty to ru.i ii» :'

6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

- With thofe thoughts, I confidered my new engage- 
ment ; that I had a wife, one child born, and my 
wife then great with child of another ; that I had 
.all the world could give me, and had no need to feek 
hazards for gain ; that I was declining in years, and 
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained, 
than of feeking to increafe it ; that as to what my 
wife had faid, of its being an impulfe from Heaven, 
and that it Ihould be my duty to go, I had no notion 
of that; fo after many of thefe cogitations, I ftrug- 
gled with the power of my imagination, reafoned my- 
felf out of it, as I believe people may always do in like 
cafes ^ if they will ; and, in a word, I conquered it; 
compofed myfelf with fuch arguments as occurred to 
my thoughts, and which my prefent condition fur- 
niflied me plentifully with ; and particularly, as the 
mod effeftual method, I refolved to divert myfelf 
with other things, and to engage in fome bufmefs 
that might effeftually tie me up from any more 
excurfions of this kind ; for I found the thing return 
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, 
or any thing of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpofe I bought a little farm in the coun- 
ty of Bedford^ and refolved to remove myfelf thither. 
I had a little convenient houfe upon it, and the land 
about it I found was capable of great improvement, 
and that it was many ways fuited to my inclination, 
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting 
and improving of land ; and particularly, being an 
inland country, I was removed from converting 
among Ihips, failors, and things relating to the re- 
mote part of the world. 

In 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 

In a word, I went down to my farm, fettled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
horfes, cows, fheep ; and fetting ferioufly to work, 
became in one half year a meer country gentleman ; 
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my 
fervants, cultivating the ground, enclofmg, planting, 
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the moft agreeable 
life that nature was capable of direding, or that a 
man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being 
retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles , I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleafed : what I planted was for my- 
felf, and what I improved, was for my family ; and 
having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had 
not the leaft difcomfort in any part of my life, as to this 
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the 
middle ftate of life which my father fo earneftly re- 
commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, fome- 
thing like what is defcribed by the poet upon the 
lubjeft of a country life : 

Free from vices ^ free from care^ 
Age: has no pains ^ and youth nofnare. 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unforefeen Providence unhinged me at once ; 
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable and 
incurable, but drove me, by its confequence, upon 
a deep relapfe into the wandering difpofition ; which 
as I may fay, being born in my very blood, foon re- 
covered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a 
violent diftemper, came on with an irrefiftible force 
upon me J fo that nothing qould make any more 
B 4 impreflion

impreffion upon me. This blow was the lofs of 
my wife. 

It is not my bufinefs here to write an elegy upon 
my wife, to give a charafter of her particular virtues^ 
and make my court to the fex by the flattery of a 
funeral fermon. She was, in a few words, the ftay 
of all my affairs, the center of ail my enterprizes, 
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that 
happy compafs I was in, from the moft extravagant 
and ruinous projeft that fluttered in my head as 
above ; and did more to guide my rambling genius, 
than a mother's tears, a father's inftruftions, a friend's 
counfel, or all my own reafoning powers could do. 
I was happy in liftening to her tears, and in being 
moved by her entreaties, and to the laft degree defo-^ 
late and diflocated in the world by the lofs of her. 

When fhe was gone, the world looked aukwardly 
round me ; I was as much a flranger in it, in my 
thoughts, as I was in the Brajils when I went firfl 
on fliore there j and as much alone, except as to th$ 
afrifl:ance of fervants, as I was in my ifland. I knew 
neither what to do, or what not to do. I faw the 
world bufy round me, one part labouring for bread, 
and the other part fquandring in vile exceffes or 
empty pleafures, equally miferable, becaufe the end 
they propofed ftill fled from them j for the men of 
pleafure evpry day furfeited of their vice, and heaped 
up work for forrow. and repentance ; and the men 
of labour fpent their flreqgth in daily ftrugglings for 
breath to maintain the vital ftrength they laboured 
with ; fo living in a daily circulation of forrow, living 
but to work, an4 working but tp live, as if daily 

br^ad 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

bread were the only end of a wearifome life, and a 
wearifome life the only occafion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my 
kingdom, the ifland ; where I fuffered no more corn 
to grow, becaufe I did not want it; and bred no 
more goats, becaufe I had no more ufe for them : 
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mil- 
dewed, and had fcarce the favour to be looked upon 
in twenty years. 

All thefe things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reafon and religion had diftated 
to me, would have taught me to fearch farther than 
human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there 
was fomething which certainly was the reafon and 
end of life, fuperior to all thefe things, and which 
was either to be poffeiTed, or at leaft hoped for, on 
this fide the grave. 

But my fage counfellor was gone ; I was like a 
Ihip without a pilot, that could only run before the 
wind; my thoughts ran all away again into the old 
affair, my head was quite turned with the whimfies 
of foreign adventures ; and all the pleafing innocent 
amufements of my farm, and my garden, my cattle, 
and my family, which before entirely poffeft me, 
were nothing to me, had no relifh, and were like 
piufic to one that has no ear, or food to one that 
has no tafte: In a word, i refolved to leave off 
houfe-keeping, let my farm, and return to London; 
and in a few months after I did fo. 

When I came to London^ I was ftill as uneafy as 
before; I had no relifli to the place, no employment 
in it, nothing to do but to faunter about like an idle 
perfon, of whpipL it may be faid, he is pefedtly ufe- 

lefs 



lO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Ids in God's creation, and it is not one farthing 
matter to the reft of his kind, whether he be dead 
or alive. This alfo was the thing which of all cir- 
cumftances of life was the moft my averfion, who 
had been all my days ufed to an aftive life; and 
^ I would often fay to myfelf, Ajiate ofidlenefs is the 
^ery dregs of life ; and indeed I thought I was much 
more fuitably employed, when I was 26 days making 
me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom as I have obferved before I had 
brought up to the fea, and had made him commander 
of a fhip, was come home from a fhort voyage to Bil^ 
boa J being the firft he had made; he came to me, and 
told me, that fomc merchants of his acquaintance 
had been propofmg to him to go a voyage for them 
to the Eq/i Indies and to China^ as private traders : 
and now uncle, fays he, if you will go to fea with 
me, ni engage to land you upon your old habitation 
in the ifland, for we are to touch at the Brajils. 

Nothing can be a greater demonftration of a future 
ftate, and of the exiftence of an invifibje world, 
than the concurrence of fecond caufes with the ideas 
of things which we form in our minds, perfe£tly rer 
ferved, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my diftemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to fay, when 
that very morning before he came to me I had, in 
a great deal of confufion of thought, and revolving 
every part of my circumftances in my mind, come 
to this refolution, viz. That I would go to Lifbon^ 
and confult with my old fea captain ; and fo, if it was 

rational 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. IX 

tational and prafticable, I would go and fee the 
ifland again, and fee what was. become of my people 
there. I had pleafed myfelf alfo with the thoughts 
of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from 
hence, getting a patent for the poffeflion, and I know 
not what; when, in the middle of all this, in comes 
my nephew, as I have faid, with his projeft of carry- 
ing me thither, in his way to the Eaji Indies. 

I paufed a while at his words, and looking fteadily 
at him, What devil^ faid I, fent you on this unlucky 
errand? My nephew ftartled, as if he had been 
frighted at fir ft; but perceiving I was not much 
difpleafed with the propofal, he recovered himfelf. 
I hope it may not be an unlucky propofal, Sir, 
fays he; I dare fay you would be pleafed to fee 
your new colony there, where you once reigned 
with more felicity than moft of your brother mo- 
narchs in the world. 

In a word, the fcheme hit fo exaftly with my 
temper, that is to fay, with the prepoffeffion I was 
under, and of which I have faid fo much, that I told 
him, in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, 
I would go with him : but I told him, I would not 
promife to go any farther than my own ifland. Why 
Sir, fays he, you don't want to be left there again^ 
I hope ? Why, faid I, can you not take me up again 
on your return ? He told me it could not be poflible 
that the merchants would allow him to come that way 
with a loaded fliip of fuch value, it being a month's 
fail out of his way, and might be three or four : 
Befides, Sir, if I fhould mifcarry, faid he, and not 
return at all, then you would be juft reduced to the 
condition you were in before. 

This 



IZ LITE AND ADVENTURES 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed floop on 
board the fliip, which, being taken in pieces and 
fhipped on board the Ihip, might, by the help of 
fome carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us, 
be fet up again in the iflandj and finiflied, fit to go 
to fea in a few d^ys. 

I was not long refolving; for indeed the importu- 
nities of my nephew joined in fo eflFeftually with my 
inclination, that nothing could oppofe me : on the 
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con* 
cerned themfelves fo much for me, as to perfuade 
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend 
the widow, who earneftly ftruggled with me to con* 
fider my years, my eafy circumftances, and the need- 
lefs hazard of a long voyage ; and, above all, my 
young children: but it was all to no purpofe; I had 
an irrefiftible defire to the voyage ; and I told her 
I thought there was fomething fo uncommon in the 
impreffions I had upon my mind for the voyage, that 
it would be a kind of refifting Providence, if 1 fhouW 
attempt to flay at home ; after which Ihe ceafed her 
expoftulations, and joined with me, not only ia 
making provifion for my voyage, but alfo in fettling 
my family affairs in my abfence, and providing for 

. the education of my children. 

In order to this, I made my will, and fettled the 
eftate I had in fuch a manner for my children, and 
placed in fuch hands, that I was perfectly eafy ancj 

^ fatisfied they would have juftice done them, what^ 
ever might befal me ; and for their education, I left 
it wholly to my widow, with a fufficient maintenance 
to herfelf for her care ; all which fhe richly defelrved j 

for

for no mother could have taken more care in their 
education, or underftood it better ; and as fhe lived 
till Icame home, I alfo lived to thank her for it 

My nephew was ready to fail about the beginning 
of January 1694-5, and I with my man Friday went 
on board in the Downs the 8 th, having befides that 
Hoop which I mentioned above, a very confiderable 
cargo of all kinds of neceffary things for my colony, 
which, if I did not find in good condition, I refolved 
to leave fo. 

Firft, I carried with me fome fervants, whom I pur- 
pofed to place there, as inhabitants, or at leaft to fet 
on work there upon my own account, while I ftayed, 
and either to leave them there, or carry them forward, 
as they ihould appear willing; particularly I carried 
two carpenters, a fmith, and a very handy ingenious 
fellow who was a cooper by trade, but was alfo a 
general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at making 
wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was a good tur- 
ner, and a good pot-maker ; he alfo made any thing 
that was proper to make of earth, or of wood ; in a 
word, we called him our Jack of all trades. 

With thefe I carried a taylor, who had offered 
himfelf to go paffenger to the Eaji Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards confented to ftay on our new 
plantation, and proved a moft neceffary handy fellow 
as could be defired, in many other bufmeffes befides 
that of this trade ; for, as I obferved formerly, ne- 
ceflity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recolleft, for I have 

not kept an account of the particulars, confided of 

a fufficient quantity of linen, and fome thin Englijh

tion might comfortably fupply them for feven years ; 
if I remember right, the materials which I carried foy 
clothing them, with gloves, hats, fhoes, (lockings, 
and all fuch things as they could want for wearing, 
amounted to above 200 pounds, including fome beds, 
beddings -and houfhold-ftuff, particularly kitchen 
utenfils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brafs, &c. be- 
fides near a hundred pounds more in iron-work^ 
nails, tools of every kind, ftaples, hooks, hinges, 
and every neceffary thing I could think of. 

I carried alfo a hundred fpare arms, mulkets, and 
fuzees, befides fome piftols, a confiderable quantity 
of Ihot of all fizes, three or four tons of lead, and 
two pieces of brafs cannon ; and becaufe I knew not 
what time, and what extremities I was providing 
for, I carried an hundred barrels of powder, befides 
fwords, cutlafTes, and the iron part of fome pikes, 
and halberts ; fo that in fliort we had a large maga- 
zine of all. forts of ftores ; and I made my nephew 
carry two fmall quarter-deck guns more than he 
wanted for his fhip, to leave behind, if there was 
occafion; that when they came there, we might build 
a fort, and man it againft all forts of enemies: and in- 
deed, I at fir ft thought there would be need enough, 
of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain 
our poffeffion of the ifland, as Ihall be feen in the 
courfe of the ftory. 

I had not fuch bad luck in this voyage as I had 
been ufed to meet with ; and therefore Ihall have the 
lefs occafion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how matters went with 
my colony; yet fome odd accidents, crofs winds»

and bad weather happened, on this firft fettlng out, 
which made the voyage longer than I expeded it at 
firft ; and I, who had never made but one voyager 
{viz. J myjirji voyage to Guinea^ in which I might be 
faid to come back again as the voyage was at firft de- 
figned, began to think the fame ill fate ftill attended 
me ; and that I was born to be never contented with 
being on fhore, and yet to be always unfortunate at 
fea. 

Contrary winds firft put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland^ where 
we lay wind-bound two-and-thirty days ; but we had 
this fatisfaftion with the difafter, that provifions were 
here exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft plenty ; fo 
that while we lay here we never touched the fhip*s 
ftores, but rather added to them ; here alfo I took 
feveral hogs, and two cows, with their calves, which 
I refolved, if I had a good paffage, to put on fhore 
in my ifland ; but we found occafion to difpofe other- 
wife of them. 

We fet out the 5th of February from Ireland^ and 
had a very fair gale of v/ind for fome days. As I 
remember, it might be about the 20th of February in 
the evening late, when the mate having the watch, 
came into the round-houfe, and told us he faw a flafh 
of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and while he was tel- 
ling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatfwain 
heard another. This made us all run out upon the 
quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, 
but in a few minutes we faw a very great light, and 
found that there was fome very terrible fire at a dif- 
tance ; immediately we had recourfe to our reckon- 
ings, in which we all agreed that there could be no 

land 



l6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

land that way, in which the fire fhewed itfelf, no not 
for 500 leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. Upon 
this we concluded it mull be fome fhip on fire at fea ; 
and as by our hearing the noife of guns juft before, 
we concluded it could not be far off, we flood direSly 
towards it, and were prefently fatisfied we fhould dif- 
cover it, becaufe the farther we failed the greater the 
light appeared, tho* the weather being hazy we could 
not perceive any thing but the light for a while ; in 
about half an hour's failing, the wind being fair for 
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing 
up a little, we could plainly difcern that it was a great 
Ihip on fire in the middle of the fea. 

I was mofl: fenfibly touched with this difafter, 
though not at all acquainted with the perfons engaged 
in it ; I prefently recolleded my former circumftan- 
ces, in what condition I was in when taken up by the 
P(7r///^^/ Captain J and how much more deplorable 
the circumflances of the poor creatures belonging to 
this fnip muft be if they had no other fhip in 'com- 
pany with them: upon this I immediately ordered, 
that five guns fhould be fired, one foon after another, 
that, if poffible, we might give notice to them that 
there was help for them at hand, and that they might 
endeavour to fave themfelves in their boat ; for though 
we could fee the flame in the fhip, yet they, it being 
night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by fome time upon this, only driving as 
the burning fhip drove, waiting for day light ; when 
on a fudden, to our great terror, though we had 
reafon to expcQ: it, the fhip blew up in the air, and 
immediately funk : this was tenible, and indeed an 
affli£ting fight, for the fake of the poor men, who, I 

concluded.

concluded mud be either all deftroyed in the fhip, 
or be in the utmoft diftrefs in their boats in the mid- 
dle of the ocean, which at prefent^ by reafon it was 
dark, I could not fee : however to dired them as well 
as I could, I caufed lights to be hung out in all the 
parts of the fhip where we could, and which we had 
lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long J letting them know by this, that there W/is a 
fliip not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we difcovered 
the fhip's boats, by the help of our perfpedive-glaffes; 
and found there were two of them, both thronged 
with people, and deep in the water : we perceived 
they rowed, the wind being againfl them ; that they 
faw our fhip, and did the utmofl to make us fee 
them. 

We immediately fpread our ancient, to let them 
know we faw them ; and hung a waft out, as a fig- 
nal for them to come on board ; and then made more 
fail, flanding direftly to them. In a little more than 
half an hour, we came up with them, and, in a 
word, took them all in, being no lefs than fixty- 
four men, women, and children ; for there were a 
great many paffengers. 

Upon the whok, we found it was a French mer* 
chant-fhip of 300 tons, homeward-bound from 
^uebeckj in the river of Canada. The mafler gave 
us a long account of the diftrefs of his fhip, how the 
fire began in the fteerage by the negligence of the 
fleerfman ; but, on his crying out for help, was, as 
every body thought, entirely put out : but they foon 
found that fome fparks of the firft fire had gotten 
into fome part of the fhip, fo difficult to come at.

that they could not efFedually quench it ; and after- 
wards getting in between the timbers, and within 
the cieling of the fhip, it proceeded into the hold, 
and n^aftered all the Ikill and all the applicatioa 
they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their 
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty 
large ; being their long boat, and a great fhallop, 
befides a fmall IkifF, which was of no great fervice to 
them, other than to get fome frelh water and provi- 
fions into her, after they had fecured themfelves from 
the fire. They had indeed fmall hope of their lives 
by getting into thefe boats at that diftance from any 
land ; only, as they faid well, that they were efcaped 
from the fire, and had a poffibility, that fome fhip 
might happen to be at fea, and might take them in^ 
They had fails, oars, and a compafs ; and were pre- 
paring to make the beft of their way to 'Newfound-' 
land^ the wind blowing pretty fair; for it blew aa 
eafy gale at S. Ei. by E. They had as much provi-^ 
fion^ and water, as, with fparing it fo as to be next 
door to ftarving, might fupport them about 1 2 days j 
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con- 
trary winds, the captain faid, he hoped he might get 
to the banks of Newfoundland^ and might perhaps 
take fome fifh to fuftain them till they might go on 
fhore. But there were fo many chances againft them 
in all thefe cafes ; fuch as ftorms to overfec and foun-f 
der them \ rains and cold to benumb and perifli their 
limbs ; contrary winds to keep them out and ftarve 
them ; that it muft have been next to miraculous if 
they had efcaped. 

In the midft of their confultations, every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the captain with tears

ih his eyes told me, they were on a fudden furprifed 
\vith the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that 
four more ; thefe were the five guns which I caufed 
to be fired at firft feeing the Hght : this revived their 
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, 
I defigned it Ihould, viz. that there was a Ihip at 
hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe guns, that they took 
down their mafts and fails ; and the found coming 
from the windward, they refolved to lie by till 
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more 
guns, they fired three mufquets, one a confiderable 
while after another ; but thefe, the wind being con* 
trary, we never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were flill more 
agreeably furprifed with feeing our lights, and hear- 
ing the guns, which, as I have faid, I caufed to be 
fired all the refl of the night ; this fet them to work 
with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at leafl 
that we might the fooner come up with them; and 
at lafl, to their inexpreifible joy, they found we faw 
them. 

It is impoffible for me to exprefs the feveral geftures, 
the ftrange ecflafies, the variety of poflures, which 
thefe poor delivered people run into, to exprefs the 
joy of their fouls at fo unexpefted a deliverance j 
grief and fear are eafily defcribed ; fighs, tears, 
groans, and a very few motions of head and hands, 
make up the fum of its variety : but an excefs of joy, 
a furprife of joy, has a thoufand extravagancies in it ; 
there were fome in tears, fome raging and tearing 
themfelves, as if they had been in the greateft agonies 
of forrow j fome ftark raving and down-right luna.

tic; fome ran about the ihip ftamping with theii^ 
feet, others wringing their hands ; fome were 

'dancing,, feveral finging, fome laughing, more cry- 
ing ; many quite dumb, not able to fpeak a word ; 
others fick and vomiting, feveral fwooning, and 
ready to faint ; and a few were crofling> themfelves 
and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might be 
many that were thankful afterward j but the paffion 
was too ftrong for them at firft, and they were not 
able to mafter it ; they were thrown into ecftafies and 
a kind of frenzy, and fo there were but a very few 
who were compofed and ferious in their joy. 

Perhaps alfo the cafe may have fome addition to it, 
from the particular circumftance of the nation they 
belonged to ; I mean the French^ whofe temper is 
allowed to be more 'volatile, more paffionate, and 
more fprightly, and their fpirits more fluid, than of 
other nations. I amnotphilofopherenough to determine 
the caufe, but nothing I had ever feen before came 
up to it : the ecftafies poor Friday^ my trufty favage, 
was in, when he found his father in the boat, came 
the neareft to it ; and the furprife of the mafter, and 
his two companions, whom 1 delivered from the two 

. villains that fet them on fhore in the ifland, came a 
little way towards it ; but nothing was to compare 
to this, either that I fawin.i^r/V/^j', or any where elfe 
in my life. 

It is farther obfervable, that thefe extravagancies 
did not (hew themfelves in that different manner I 
have mentioned, in different perfons only : but all 
the variety would appear in a ihort fucceffion of mo- 
ments, in one and the fame perfon. A man that we 
I faw 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOH. 21 

faw this minute dumb, and, as it were, ftupid and 
confounded, fhould the next minute be dancing and 
hallooing like an antick ; and the next moment 
tearing his hair, or pulHng his clothes to pieces, and 
ftamping them under his feet like a madman ; a few 
minutes after that, we fhould have him all in tears, 
then fick, then fwooning ; and had not immediate 
help been had, would in a few moments more have 
been dead ; and thus it was,, not with one or two, 
or ten or twenty, but with the greateft part of them^ 
and, if I remember right, our furgeon was obliged to 
let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two priefts among them, one an old 
man, and the other a young man ; and that which 
was ftrangeft was, that the oldeft man was the 
worft. 

As foon as he fet his foot on board our fhip, and 
law himfelf fafe, he dropped down ftone-dead, to all 
appearance ; not the leafl fign of life could be per- 
ceived in him ; our furgeon immediately applied pro- 
per remedies to recover him ; and was the only man 
in the fhip that believed he was not dead : and at 
length he opened a vein in his arm, having firll 
chafed and rubbed the part, fo as to warm it as much 
as pofTible : upon this the blood, which only dropped 
at firfl, flowed fomething freely ; in three minutes 
after the man opened his' eyes; and about a quarter 
of an hour after that he fpoke, grew better, and, 
in a little time, quite well ; after the blood was flop- 
ped, he walked about, told us he was perfeftly well, 
took a dram of cordial which the furgeon gave him,, 
and was what we called, come to himfelf; about a 
quarter of ah hour after this, they came running 
C 3 into 



tJ2 L1F£ AND ADVENTURES 

into the cabin to the furgeon, who was bleeding a 
French wonian that had fainted j and told him, the 
priefl was gone ftark mad. It feems he had began 
to revolve the change of his circumftances in his 
mind, and this put him into an ecftafy of joy; his 
fpirits whirled about fafter than the veffels could con^ 
vey them ; the blood grew hot and feverifh ; and the 
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever 
was in it ; the furgeon would not bleed him again in 
that condition, but gave him fomething to doze and 
put him to fleep, which, aftqr fdme time, operated 
upon him, and he waked next morning perfedly 
compofed, and well, 

The younger priefl: behaved himfelf with great com-^ 
mand of his paffion, and was really an example of a 
ferious well-governed mind; at his firfl: coming on 
board the fliip, he threw himfelf flat on his face, 
proflirating* himfelf in thankfulnefs for his dehverancej 
in which I unhappily and unfeafonably difl:urbed him, 
really thinking he had been in a fwoon ; but he fpoke 
calmly ; thanked me ; told me, he was giving God 
thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave hinit 
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he 
would give me thanks alfo, 

I was heartily forry that I difl:urbed him ; and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
alfo ; he continued in that pofl:ure about three 
minutes, or a little more, after I left him ; then came 
to me, as he had faid he would, and, with a great 
deal of ferioufnefs and affeftion, but with tears in 
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given 
him and fo many miferable creatures their lives; 
I told him, J had no room to move him to thank 

God 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^3 

God {ot it, rather than me j for I had feen that he 
had done that already: but I added, that it was 
nothing but what reafon and humanity dictated to 
all men, and that we had as much reafon as he to 
give thanks to God, who had bleffed us fo far as to 
make us the inftruments of his mercy to fo many of 
his creatures. 

After this the young prieft applied himfelf to his 
country folks ; laboured to compofe them ; perfuaded, 
intreated, argued, reafoned vvith them, and did his 
utmoft to keep them within the exercife of their rea- 
fon ; and with fome he had fuccefs, though others 
were, for a time, out of all government of 
themfelves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per^ 
haps it may be ufeful to thofe into whofe hands it 
may fall, in the guiding themfelves in all the extrava- 
gancies of their paffions; for if an cxcefs of joy cart 
carry men out to fuch a length beyond the reach of 
their reafon, what v. ill not the extravagancies of 
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? 
And indeed, here I faw reafon for keeping an ex- 
ceeding wat^ch over our paflions of every kind, as 
well thufe of joy and fatisfadion, as thofe of forrow 
^nd anger. 

We were fomething difordered by thefe extrava- 
gancies among our new guefts for the firft day ; but 
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for 
them as well as our fhip would allow, and they had 
ilept heartily, as moft of them did, being fatigued 
and frightened, they were quite another fort of peo- 
ple the next day. 

C 4 Nothing 



24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowr 
ledgments for the kindnefs fhewn them was wanting ; 
the French^ it is known, are naturally apt enough 
to exceed th^it way. The captain, and one of the - 
priefts, came to me the next day ; and, defiring to 
fpeak with me and my nephew, the commander, 
began to confult with us what fhould be done with 
^hem ; and firft they told us, that, as we had faved 
their lives, fo all they had was little enough for a 
return to us for the kindnefs received. The captain 
faid, they had faved fome money, and fome things 
of value in their boats, catched haflily out of the 
flames ; and if we would accept it, they were ordered 
to make an offer of it all to us ; they only defired to 
be fet qn ftiore fpmewhere in our way, where, if 
poffible, they might get a paffage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at firft 
word, and to confider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I over-ruled him in that part ; for I knew 
what it was to be fet on fliore in a ftrange country ; 
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at fea 
had ferved me fo, and took all I had for my delive- 
rance, I muft have ftarved, or have been as much a 
flaye at the Brafils^ as I had been at Barbary^ the 
being fold to a Mahometan only excepted ; and per- 
haps a Portuguefe is not a much better mafter than a 
Turk^ if not, in fome cafes, a much worfe. 

I therefore told the French captain, that we had 
taken them up in their diftrefs, it was true ; but that 
it was our duty to do fo, as we were fellow-creatures, 
and as we would defire to be fo delivered, if we were 
in the like or any other extremity ; that we had donei 
jiothing. for them, but what we believed they would 

havg 



pF ROBINSQN CRUSOE. «5 

tave done for us if ive had been in their cafe, and 
they in our's ; but that we took them up to ferve them, 
not tp plunder them ; and that it would be a moft bar- 
barous thing, to take that little from them which they 
had faved out of the fire, and ttien fet them on fhore, 
and leave them j that this would be firft to fave 
them from death, and then kill them ourfelves ; fave 
them from drowning, and then abandon them to 
ftarving j and therefore 1 would not let the leaft 
thing bp taken from thjgm : as to fetting them on 
^ore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding 
difficulty to us, for that the Ihip was bound to the 
EaJiAndies ; and though we were driven out of our 
courfe to the weftward a very gr^at way, which per- 
haps was diredted by Heaven on purpofe for their de- 
liverance, yet it was impoflible for us wilfully to 
change our voyage on this particular account ; nor 
could my nephew, the captain, anfwer it to the 
ff eighter.s, with whom he was under charter-party to 
purfue his voyage by the way of Brajtl ; and all I 
knew he could do for them was, to put ourfelves in 
the way of meeting with other fhips homeward- 
bound from the Weji-Indies^ and get them paffage, 
if poflible, to England gr France. 

The firft part of the proppfal was fp generous and, 
kind, they could no^ but be very thankful for it : but 
they were in a great confternation, efpecially the paf- 
fengers, at the notion of being carried away to the 
EaJi'Indies : they then intreated me, that feeing I 
was driven fo far to the weftward .before I met with 
them, I would at leaft keep on the fame courfe to the 
banks of Newfoundland^ where it was poflible I might 
meet with fome fliip or floop that they might hire to 
carry them bacH to Canada^ from whence they came. 

I thought 



26 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES . 

I thought this was but a reafonable requeft on their 
part ; and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for in* 
deed I confidered, that to carry this whole company 
to the Eaji-lndies^ would* not only be an intolerable 
feverity to the poor people, but would be ruining our 
whole voyage by devouring all our provifions j fo I 
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an 
unforefeen accident made abfolutely neceffary to us } 
and in which no one could fay we were to blame ; 
for the laws of God and nature would have forbid, 
that we fhould refufe to take up two boats full of 
people in fuch a diftreffed condition ; and the nature 
of the thing as well refpefting ourfelves, as the poor 
people, obliged us to fee them on fhore fomewhere 
or other, for their deliyerance ; fo I confented that 
we would carry them to Newfoundland^ if wind and 
weather would permit ; and, if not, that I would 
carry them to Martinico in the Weft-Indies. » 

The wind continued frefh eafterly, but" the wear 
ther pretty good ; and as it had blowed continually 
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, 
we miffed feveral opportunities of fending them to 
Trance ; for we met feveral fliips bound to Europe^ 
whereof two were French^ from St. Chriftopher*s\ 
but they had been fo long beating up againfl the 
wind, that they durft take in no paffengers for fear 
of wanting provifions for the voyage, as well for 
themfelves as for thofe they fhould take in ; fo we 
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this, 
that we made the Banks of 'Newfoundland^ where, to 
fhorten my (lory, we put all our French people on 
board a bark, which they hired at fea there, to put 
them on fhore, and afterwards to carry them to 

France^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. tLJ 

France^ if they could get provifions to vidual them* 
felves with: when, I fay, all the French went on 
ihore, I fliould remember, that the young prieft I 
fpoke of, hearing we were bound to the EaJi^Indies^ 
delired to go the voyage with us, and to be fet on 
ihore on the coaft of Coromandel : I readily agreed to 
that ; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very 
good reafon, as will appear afterwards ; alfo four of 
the feamen entered themfelves in our ihip„ and 
proved very ufeful fellows. 

From hence we direfted our courfe for the Weji^ 
Indies^ fleering away S. and S. by £• for about 20 
days together, fometimes little or no wind at all, 
when we met with another fubjefl: for our humanity 
to work upon, almoft as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N. 
and the 1 9th day of M^zr^/6, 1684-5, >^hen we efpied 
a fail, our courfe S, E. and by S. We foon perceived 
it was a large veffel, and that (he bore up to us ; but 
could not at fir ft know what to make of her, till, after 
coming a little nearer, we found (he had loft her 
inain-top-maft, fore-maft, and bowfprit; and pre- 
fently (he fires a gun as a fignal of diftrefs ; the wea- 
ther was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a frefh gale, 
jand we foon came to fpeak with her. 

We found her a ftiip of Brijlol bound home from 
Barbadoes^ but had been blown out of the road at 
Barbadoes^ a few days before flie was ready to fail, by 
a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate 
were both gone on ftiore ; fo that befide the terror of 
the ftorm, they were but in an indifferent cafe for 
good artifts to bring the fhip home ; they had been 
alreadjr nine weeks at fea, and had met with another 

terrible 



i8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

terrible ftorm after the hurricane was over, which 
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the 
weftward, and in which they had loft their niafts, as 
above ; they told us, they expefted to have feen the 
Bahama iflands, but were then driven away ^gain to 
the fouth-eaft by a ftrong gale of wind at N. N. W. 
the fame that blew now, and having no fails to work 
the fhip with, but a main courfe, and a kind of 
fquare fail upon a jury fore-maft, which they had fet 
up, they Could not lie near the wind, but were en- 
deavouring to ftand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they 
were almoft ftarved for -want of provifions, befides 
the fatigues they had undergone ; their bread and 
flefh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in 
the fhip, and had had none for eleven days; the 
only relief they had, was, their water was not all 
fpent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left ; 
they had fugar enough ; fome fuccades or fweet-meats 
they had at firft, but they were devoured, and they 
had feven caflcs of rum. 

There was a youth afid his mother, and a maid-fer- 
Tant, on board, who were going paflengers, and 
thinking the fliip was ready to fail, unhappily came 
on board the evening before the hurricane began ; 
and, having no provifions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable condition than the reft ; 
for the feamen, being reduced to fuch an extreme 
neceflity themfelves, had no compaflion, we may be 
fure, for the poor paflTengers ; and they were indeed 
in a condition that their mifery is very hard to 
defcribe. 

I had

1 had perhaps not known this part, if my curiofity 
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind 
abated, to go on board the fhip : the fecond mate, 
who upon this occafion commanded the fhip, had 
been on board our fhip; arid he told me indeed, 
that they had three paffengers in the great cabin, that 
they were in a deplorable condition; nay, fays. he, I 
believe they are dead, for I have heard nothings of 
them for above two days ; and I waS afraid to en- 
quire after them, faid he, for I had nothing to relieve 
them with. 

We immediately applied ourfelves to givethem what 
relief we could .fpare ; and indeed I had fb far over- 
ruled things with my nephew, that I would have 
vidualled them, though we had gone away to Ver^ 
giniuj or any part of the coafl of America^ to have 
fupplied ourfelves ; but there was no neceffity for 
that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were 
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we 
gave them ; the mate or commander brought fix men 
with him in his boat ; but thefe poor wretches looked 
like fkeletons, and were fo weak, they could hardly 
fit to their oars : the mate himfelf was very ill, and 
half-ftarved ; for he declared he had referved nothing 
from the men, and went fhare and fhare alike with 
them in every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat fparingly, but fet meat be- 
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be fick, and out of 
order ; fo he ftopt awhile, and our furgeon mixed 
him up fomething with fome broth, which he faid 
would be to him both food and phyfick ; and after 

^ he

he had taken It, he grew better : in the mean time 
I forgot not the men ; I ordered vidluals to be given 
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than 
eat it ; they were fo exceeding hungry, that they 
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command 
of themfelves ; and two of them eat with fo much 
greedinefs, that they were in danger of their lives 
the next morning. 

The fight of thefe people's diftrefs was very moving 
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible 
profpedk of at my firft coming on fhore In my ifland, 
where I had not the leaft mouthful of food, or any 
hopes of procuring it j befides the hourly apprehen- 
fion I had of being made the food of other creatures. 
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me 
the miferable condition of the (hip's company, I 
could not put out of my thought the ftory he had 
told me of the three poor creatures In the great cabin; 
(viz.) the mother, her fon, and the m.aid fervant, 
whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days • 
and whom he feemed to confefs they had wholly neg* 
lefted, their own extremities being fo great; by 
wtfich I underftood, that they had really given them 
no food at all; and that therefore they mufl be 
perifhed, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor 
or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then cal- 
led captain, on board with his men to refrefh them, 
fo I alfo forgot not the ftarving crew that were left on 
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the 
Ihip, and with my mate and twelve men to carry 
them a fack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef 
to boIL Our furgeon charged the men to caufe the 
3 meat 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3! 

meat to be boiled while they flayed, and to keep 
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men*s taking 
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it 
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a 
little at a time ; and by this caution he preferved the 
men, who would otherwife have killed themfelves 
with that very food that was given them on purpofe 
to fave their lives. 

At the fame time, I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabin, and fee in what condition the poor 
paflengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com- 
fort them and give them what refrefliment was pro- 
per ; and the furgeon gave him a large pitcher with 
fbme of the prepared broth which he had given the 
mate that was on board, and which he did not quef- 
tion would reftore them gradually. 

I was not fatisfied with this ; but, as I faid above, 
having a great mind to fee the fcene of mifery, which 
I knew the Ihip itfelf would prefent me with, in a 
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I 
took the captain of the fhip, as we now called him^ 
with me, and went rnyfelf a little after in their 
boat. 

I found the poor men on board almofl in a tumult 
to get the vidtuals out of the boiler before it was 
leady : but my mate obferved his order, and kept a 
good guard at the cook-room door ; and the man he 
placed there, after ufing all poflible perfuafion to 
have patience, tept them off by force : however, he 
caufed fome bifcuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, 
and foftened them with the liquor of the meat, which 
they call brewis, and gave them every one one, to 
ftay their ftomachs, and told them it was for their 

own 



34 LIFE AND ADVENtUREi 

own fafcty, that he was obliged to give them but 
Kttle at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I 
not come on board, and their own commander and 
officers with me, and with good words, and fome 
threats alfo of giving them no more, I believe they 
would have broke into the cook room by force, and 
fore the meat out of the furnace ; for words indeed 
are of a very fmall force to an hungry belly : however 
we pacified them, and fed them gradually attid 
cautioufly for the firfl time, and the next time gave 
them more, and at laft filled their bellies, and the 
men did well enough. 

But the mifery of the poor paflengers in the cabin 
was of another nature, and far beyond the reft ; for 
as, firft, the fhip's company had fo little for them- 
felves, it was but too true, that they had at firft kept 
them very low, and at laft totally neglefted them ; 
fo that for fix or feven days, it might be faid, they 
had really had no food at all, and for feveral days; 
before very little. 

The poor mother, who^ as the firft mate reported, 
was a woman of good fenfe, and good breeding, had 
fpared all flie could get fo affeftionately for her fon, 
that at laft Ihe entirely funk under it : and when the 
mate of our (hip went in, flie fet upon the floor or 
deck, with her back up againft the fides, between 
two chairs, which were lalhed faft, and her head 
funk in between her ftioulders, like a corpfe, though 
not quite dead. My mate faid all he could to revive 
and encourage her, and with a fpoon put fome broth 
into her mouth ; ftie opened her lips, and lifted up 
one hand, but could not fpeak : yet flie underftood 
what he faid, and made figns to him, intimating, 

that 



q^ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

that it was too late for her ; but pointed to her child, 
as if fhe would have faid, they fhould take care of 
him. 

However the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the fight, endeavoured to get fome of the broth 
into her mouth ; and, as lie faid, got two or three 
fpoonfuls down, though I queftion whether he could 
be fure of it or not : but it was too late, and fhe 
died the fame night. 

The youth, who was preferved at the price of his 
mod affefl:ionate mother's life, was not fo far gone ; 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one ftretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him ; he had a piece of an old 
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the reft of it j 
however, being young, and having more ftrength 
than his mother, the mate got fomething down his 
throat, and he began fenfibly to revive, though, by 
giving him fome time after but two or three fpoon- 
fuls extraordinary, he was very fick, and brought 
it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; fhe lay all 
along upon the deck hard by her miftrefs, and juft 
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 
flruggled for life : her limbs were diftorted, one of her 
hands was clafped round the frame of one chair, and 
fhe griped it fo hard, that we could not eafily make 
her let it go ; her other arm lay over her head, and 
her feet lay both together, fet faft againft the frame 
of the cabin-table : in fhort, fhe lay juft like one in 
the laft agonies of death j and yet fhe was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only ftarved with 
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, 
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken- 

VoL. II. D , hearted 



34 ^IfE AND ADVENTURES 

hearted for her miftrefs, whom flie faw dying two 
or three days before, and whom fhe loved moft 
tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our furgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, and with great applica- 
tion recovered her as to life, he had her upon his 
hand as to her fenfes, for Ihe was little lefs than 
diftrafted for a confiderable time after ; as (hall ap- 
pear prefently. 

Whoever fhall read thefe memorandums, muft be 
defired to confider, that vifits at fea are not like a 
journey into the country, where fometimes people 
flay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our bufmefs' 
was to relieve this diftreffed (hip's crew, but not lie 
by for them ; and though they were wiUing to fteer 
the fame courfe with us for fome days, yet we could 
carry no fail to keep pace with a fliip that had no 
mafts : however, as their captain begged of us to 
help him to fet up a main top-maft, and a kind of 
top-maft to his jury fore-maft, we did, as it were, 
lie by him for three or four days ; and then having 
given him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogflieads 
of bifcuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what 
other things we could fpare; and taking three caflcs 
of fugar and fome rum, and fome pieces of eight of 
them for fatisfaftion, we left them, taking on board 
with us, at their own earneft requeft, the youth, and 
the maid, and all their goods. 

The young lad was about feventeen years of age ; 
a pretty, well-bred, modeft, and fenfible youth ; 
greatly dejefted with the lofs of his mother, and, as 
it feems, had loft his father but a few months before 

at 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

at Barbadoes. He begged of the furgeon to fpeak to 
me, to take him out of the fliip : for he faid, the 
cruel fellows had murdered his mother ; and indeed 
fo they had, that is to fay, paffively ; for they might 
have fpared a fmall fuftenance to the poor helplefs 
widow, that might have preferved her life, though 
it had been juft to keep her alive. But hunger knows 
no friend, no relation, no juftice, no right; and 
therefore is remorfelefs, and capable of no com- 
paffion. 

The furgeon told him how far we were going, and 
how it would carry him away from all his friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad circumftances, almoft 
as we found them in ; that is to fay, ftarving in the 
world. He faid he mattered not whither he went, 
if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that 
he was among : that the captain (by which he meant 
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had 
faved his life, and he was fure would not hurt him j 
and as for the maid, he was fure, if Ihe came to 
herfelf, fhe v/ould be very thankful for it, let us 
carry them whither we would. The furgeon repre- 
fented the cafe fo affedionately to me, that I yielded, 
and we took them both on board with all their goods, 
except eleven hogflieads of fugar, which could not 
be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a 
bill of lading for them, I made his commander fign 
a writing, obliging him to go, as foon as he came to 
Briftol^ to one Mr. Rogers^ a merchant there, to 
whom the youth faid he was related, and to deli- 
ver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods 
he had belonging to the deceafed widow : which I 
fuppofe was not done, for I could never learn that

the flilp came to Brijlol ; but was, as is mod proba- 
ble, loft at fea, being in fo difabled a condition, and 
fo far from any land, that I am of opinion, the firft 
ftorm (he met with afterwards, fhe might founder in 
the fea ; for flie was leaky, and had damage in her 
hold when I met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and 
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, 
though at firft the winds had been contrary. I ftiall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, 
weather, currents, &c. on the reft of our voyage ; 
but, fhortening my ftory for the fake of what is to 
follow, fhall obferve, that I came to, my old habitation, 
the ifland, on the loth oi Aprils ^^9S^ ^^ was with 
no fmall difficulty that I found the place ; for as I 
came to it, and went from it before, on the fouth 
and eaft fide of the ifland, as coming from the Brafils^ 
fo now coming in between the main and the ifland, 
and having no chart for the coaft, nor any land- 
mark, I did not know it when I faw it, or know 
whether I faw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on fliore 
on feveral iflands in the mouth of the great river 
Oroonoque^ but none for my purpofe; only this I 
learned by my coafting the fliore, that I was under 
one great miftake before, viz. that the continent 
which I thought I faw from the ifland I lived in, 
was really no continent, but a long ifland, or rather 
a ridge of iflands reaching from one to the other fide 
of the extended mouth of that great river ; and that 
the favages who came to my ifland, were not pro- 
perly thofe which we call Caribbees^ but iflanders, and 
other Barbarians of the fame kind, who inhabited 
fomething nearer to our fide than the reft. 

In 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

In (hort, I vifited feveral of the Iflands to no pur- 
pofe ; fome I found were inhabited, and fome were 
not. On one of them I found fome Spaniards^ and 
thought they had lived there ; but fpeaking with 
them, found they had a floop lay in a fmall creek 
hard by, and that they came thither to make fait, 
and catch fome pearl-mufcles, if they could ; but 
they belonged to the IJle de Trinidad^ which lay far- 
ther north, in the latitude of lo and ii degrees. 

Thus coafting from one iflaiid to another, fome- 
times with the ftiip, fometimes with the Frenchman's 
fhallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and 
therefore kept her with their very good will), at 
length I came fair on the fouth-fide of my ifland, and 
I prefently knew the very countenance of the place ; 
fo I brought the fliip fafe to an anchor, broadfide 
with the little creek where was my old habitation. 

As foon as I faw the place, I called for Friday^ 
and afked him, if he knew where he was ? He looked 
about a little, and prefently clapping his hands, cri- 
ed, O yes, O there, O yes, O there ! pointing to 
our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering 
like a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him 
from jumping into the fea, to fwim afliore to the 
place. 

Well, Fr'day^ faid I, do you think we fhall find 
any body here, or no ? and what do you tHink, Ihall 
we fee your father ? The fellow flood mute as a flock 
a good while ; but when I named his father, the 
poor affeftionate creature looked dejedled; and I 
could fee the tears run down his face very plentifully* 
What is the matter, Friday^ faid I ? are you troxibled 
becaufe you may fee your father ? No, no, fays he, 
D 3 fliaking 



38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Ihaking his head, no fee him more, no ever more 
fee again. Why fo, faid I, Friday? how do you 
know that ? O no, O* no, fays Friday^ he long ago 
die ; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, faid 
I, Friday^ you don't know: but Ihall we fee any 
one elfe then ? The fellow, it feems, had better eyes 
than I, and he points juft to the hill above my old 
.houfe ; and tho* we lay half a league off, he cries out. 
Me fee ! me fee ! yes, yes, me fee much man there, 
and there, and there. I looked, but I could fee no- 
body, no, not with a perfpedive glafs ; which was, 
I fuppofe, becaufe I could not hit the place ; for the 
fellow was right, as I found upon enquiry the next 
day, and there were five or fix men altogether flood 
to look at the fliip, not knowing what to think 
of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw people, I 
caufed the Englijh ancient to be fpread, and fired three 
guns, to give them notice we were friends ; and 
about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a 
fmoke rife from the fide of the creek ; fo I imme- 
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me j 
and, hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, I 
went diredtly on fhore, taking with me .the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
ftory of my living there, and the manner of it, and 
every particular, both of myfelf, and thofe that I 
left there ; and who was on that account extremely 
defirous to go with me. We had befides about fix- 
teen men very well armed, if we had found any new 
gueft there which we did not know of; but we hadr- 
no need of weapons. 

As we went on fhore upon the tide of flood, niear 
high water> we rowed direftly into the creek; and 

the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

the firft mail I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniardj 
whofe life' I had faved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfedly well; as to his habit, I fhall defcribe ij 
afterwards, I ordered nobody to go on fhore at firft 
but myfelf J but there was no keeping Friday in the 
boat: for the aflfeftionate creature had fpied hig 
lather at a diftance, a good way oflF of the Spaniards^ 
where indeed I faw nothing of him ; and if they had 
not let him go on fhore, he would have jumped into 
the fea. He was no fooner on fhore, but he flew 
away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It 
would hav^ made any m,an fhed tears, in fpite of the 
firmefl refolution, to have feen the firfl tranfports of 
this poor fellow's joy, when he came to his father ; 
how he embraced him, kiffed him, flroaked his face, 
took him up in his arms, fet him down upon a tree, 
and lay down by him ; then flood and looked at him 
as any one would look at a flrange pifture, for a 
quarter of an hour together ; then lay down upon 
the ground, and flroaked his legs and kiffed them, 
and then got up again, and flared at him ; one would 
have thought the fellow bewitched: but it would 
have made a dog laugh to fee how the next day his 
paffion run out another way : in the morning he 
walked along the fhore, to-and-again, with his father, 
feveral hours, always leading him by the hand, as if 
he had been a lady } and every now-and-then would 
come to fetch fomething or other for him from the 
boat, either a lump of fugar, or a dram, a bifcuit, or 
fomething or other that was good. In the afternoon his 
frolics ran another way ; for then he would fet the old 
m^n down upon the ground, and dance about him, 
and made a thoufand antic poflures and gueflures; and 
D 4 all 



40 LIFE AND ADVEKTURE8 

all the while he did this, he would be talking to him 
and telling him one ftory or another of his travels, 
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert 
him. In fliort, if the fame filial alFedtion was to be 
found in Chriftians to their parents, in our parts of 
the world, one would be tempted to fay, there hardly 
would have been any need of the fifth command- 
ment. 

But this is a digrefiion; I return to my landing. 
It would be endlefs to take notice of all the ceremo- 
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me with. 
The firft Spaniard^ whom, as I faid, I knew very well, 
was he whofe life I faved : he came towards the boat, 
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce alfo ; 
and he did not only not know me at firft, but he had 
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was 
come, till I fpoke to him : Seignior, faid I, in Portu- 
guefe^ do you not know me ? at which be fpoke not 
a word ; but giving his mufquet to the man that was 
with him, threw his arms abroad, and faying fome- 
thing in Spanijbj that I did not perfeftly hear, came 
forward and embraced me, telling me, he was inex- 
cufable not to know that face again that he had 
once feen, as of an angel from heaven fent to fave 
his life : he faid abundance of very handfome things, 
as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how; and 
then beckoning to the perfon that attended him, bade 
him go and call out his comrades. He then afked 
me, if I would walk to my old habitation, where 
he would give me poffeffion of my own houfe 
again, and where I fhould fee there had been but 
mean improvements : fo I walked along with him ; 
but, alas ! I could no more find the place again, than 

if

if I had never been there ; for they had planted fo 
many trees, and placed them in fuch a pofture, fo 
thick and clofe to one another, in ten years time 
they were grown fo big, that, in fhort, the place was 
inacceflible, except by fuch windings, and blind ways, 
as they themfelves only who made them could find. 

I afked them, what put them upon all thefe forti- 
fications ? He told nie, I would fay there was need 
enough of it, when they had given an account how 
they had paffed their time fince their arriving in the 
ifland, efpecially after they had the misfortune to find 
that I was gone : he told me he could not but have 
fome fatisfaftion in my good fortune, when he heard 
that I was gone in a good fhip, and to my fatisfadHon ; 
and that he had oftentimes a ftrong perfuafion, that 
one time or other he fhould fee me again : but no- 
thing that ever befel him in his life, he faid, was fo 
furprifing and afflifting to him at firft, as the difap- 
pointment he was under when he came back to the 
ifland, and found I was not there. 

As to the three Barbarians (fo he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long 
ftory to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought themfelves 
much better among the favages, only that their 
number was fo fmalL And, fays he, had they been 
ftrong enough, we had been all long ago in purga- 
tory ; and with that he crofTed himfelf upon the 
breaft. But, Sir, fays he, I hope you will not be 
difpleafed, when I fhall tell you how, forced by 
neceflity, we were obliged, for our own prefervation, 
to ciifarm them, and making them our fubjecls, who 
would not be content with being moderately our 
mafters, but would be our murderers. I anfwered, I

was heartily afraid of it when I left them there ; and 
nothing troubled me at my parting from the ifland, 
but that they were not come back, that I might have 
put them in poffeffion of every thing firft, and left the 
other in a ftate of fubjeftion, as they deferved : but 
if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and 
Ihould be very far from finding any fault with it ; 
for I knew they were a parcel of refradory ungo- 
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner of 
mifchlef* 

While I was faying this, came the man whom he 
had fent back, and with him eleven men more : in 
the drefs they were in, it was impoflible to guefs what 
nation they were of; but he made all clear both to 
them and to me. Firft he turned to me, and pointing 
to them, faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the gentlemen 
who owe their lives to you ; and then turning to 
them and pointing to me, he let them know who I 
Was ; upon which they all came up one by one, not 
as if they had been failors, and ordinary fellows, and 
I the like, but really, as if they had been ambaffa- 
dors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great con- 
queror: their behaviour was to the laft degree 
obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly 
majeftic gravity, which very well became them ; and 
in fhort, they had fo much more manners than I 
that I fcarce knew how to receive their civilities, 
much lefs how to return them in kind. 

The hiftory of their coming to, and condu6t in 
the ifland, after my going away, is fo remarkable 
and has fo many nicidents, which the former part of 
my ralation will help to underftand, and which will, 
in moft of the particulars, refer to that account I have

already given, that I cannot but commit them with 
great delight to the reading of thofe that come after 
me, 

I (hall no longer trouble the (lory with a relation 
in the firft perfon, which will put me to the expence 
of ten thoufand /aid /'s, and /aid he*Sy and he told 
me\^ and / told him\^ and the like ; but I fliall 
coUeQ: the fa£ks hiftorically, as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory, from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my converfing with 
them, and with the place. 

In order to 1do this fuccinftly, and as intelligibly as 
I can, I muft go back to the circumftance in which 
I left the ifland, and which the perfons were in, of 
whom I am to fpeak. At firft, it is neceffary to re- 
peat, that I had fent away Friday*^ father and the 
Spaniard^ the two whofe lives I had refcued from the 
favages ; I fay, I had fent them away in a large canoe 
to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch oyer 
the Spaniard's companions, whom he had left behind 
him, in order to fave them from the like calamity 
that he had been in; and in order to fuccour 
them for the prefent, and that, if poflible, we might 
together find fome way for our deliverance after- 
ward. 

When I fent them away, I had no vifible appear- 
ance of, or the leaft room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before • 
much lefs had I any foreknowledge of what after hap- 
pened, I mean of an Englijh fhip coming on fhore 
there to fetch them off; and it could not but be a 
very great furprife to them, when they came back, 
not only to find that I was gone, but to find three 

ftrangers 



44 J^-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

ftrangers left on the fpot, poffeffed of all that I had 
left behind me, which would otherwife have been 
their own. 

The firft thing, however, which I enquired into 
(that I might begin where I left off), was of their own 
part : and I defired he would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
tlxe boat, when I fent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little variety in that part ; for no- 
thing remarkable happened to them on the way, they 
having very calm weather, and a fmooth fea ; for his 
countrymen, it could not be doubted, he faid, but 
that they were overjoyed to fee him (It feems he 
was the principal man among them, the captain of 
the veffel they had been fhipwrecked in, having been 
dead fome time): they were, he faid, the more fur- 
prifed to fee him, becaufe they knew that he was fal- 
len into the hnnds of favages, who, they were fatisfied, 
would devour him,, as they did all the reft of their 
prifoners ; that when he told them the ftory of the 
deliverance, and in what manner he was furnifhed 
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them : 
and their aftonifhment, they faid, was fomething like 
that of Jofephh brethren, when he told them who he 
was, and told them the ftory of his exaltation in 
Pharaoh^^ court : but when he ftiewed them the arms, 
the powder, the ball, and the provifions that he 
brought them for their journey or voyage, they were 
reftored to themfelves, took a juft fliare of the joy of 
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come 
away with him. 

Their firft bufmefs was to get canoes ; and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the 

honeft 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

honeft part of it, but to trefpafs upon their friendly 
favages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periagud's 
on pretence of going out a-fifhing, or for pleafure. 

In thefe they came away the next morning ; it 
feems they wanted no time to get themfelves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi- 
fions, or any thing in the world, but what they had 
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they ufed 
to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks abfent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occafion offered 
for my efcape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the ifland ; leaving three of the moft 
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, difagreeable villains 
behind me, that any man could defire to meet with, 
to the poor Spaniards' great grief and difappointment, 
you may be fure. 

The only juft thing the rogues did, was, that when 
the Spaniards came on fhore, they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provifions, and other relief, as 
I had ordered them to do ; alfo they gave them the 
long paper of direftions, which I had left with them, 
containing the particular methods which I took for 
managing every part of my life there ; the way how I 
baked my bread, bred up my t?jne goats, and plant- 
ed my corn j how I cured my grapes, made my pots, 
and, in a word, every thing I did : all this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of 
whom underftood Englifh well enough ; nor did they 
refufe to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing 
elfe, for they agreed very well for fome time : they 
gave them an equal admiflion into the houfe, or cave, 
and they began to live very fociably j and the head

46 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Spaniard^ who had feen pretty much cf my method, 
and Friday^ father together, managed all their affairs; 
for, as for the Englijhmen^ they did nothing but ram- 
ble about the ifland, fhoot parrots, and catch tortoifes, 
and when they came home at night, the Spaniards 
provided their fuppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfied with this, 
would the other but have left them alone ; which, 
however, they could not find in their hearts to do 
long ; but, but like the dog in the manger, they would 
not eat themfelves, and would not let others eat 
either; the differences, neverthelefs, were at firfl 
but trivial, and fuch as are not worth relating; but 
at laft it broke out into open war, and it began with 
all the rudenefs and infolence that can be imagined, 
without reafon, without provocation, contrary to 
nature, and indeed to common fenfe ; and though 
it is true, the firft relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themfelves, v/hom I may call the accufers, 
yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could 
not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 
I muft fupply a defe£l in my former relation ; and 
this was, that I forgot to fet down among the reft^ 
that, juft^s we were weighing the anchor to fet failj^ 
there happened a little quarrel on board our fhip, 
which I was afraid once would turn to a fecond mu- 
tiny ; nor was it appeafed till the captain, roufing 
up his courage, and taking us all to his affiftance, 
parted them by force, and making two of the moft 
refradory fellows prifoners, he laid them in irons ; 
and as they had been adtive in the former diforders, 
»nd let fall fome ugly dangerous words the fecond

time, he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng^ 
land, and have them hanged there for mutiny and 
running away with the fliip. 

This, it feems, though the captain did not intend 
to do, it frighted fome other men in the fliip ; and 
fome of them had put it in the heads of the reft, that 
the captain oiily gave them good words for the pre- 
fent, till they fhould come to fome Englijh port ; and 
that then they fhould be all put into a goal, and tried 
for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it; upon which it was defired, that I, who 
ftill pafTed for a great man among them, fliould go 
down with the mate, and fatisfy the men, and tel! 
them, that they might be aflured, if they behaved 
well tTie reft of the voyage, all they had done for the 
time paft fliould be pardoned. So I werit, and after 
pafling my honour's word to them, they appeared 
eafy, and the more fo, when I caufed the two men 
who were in irons, to be releafed and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for 
that night, the wind alfo falling calm ; next morning 
we found, that our two 'men who had been laid in 
irons, had ftole each of them a mufl^et, and fome 
other weapons ; what powder or ftiot they had, we 
knew not ; and had taken the ftiip's pinnace, which 
was not yet haled up, and run away with her to their 
companions in roguery on fliore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat 
on fliore, with twelve men and the mate, and away 
they went to feek the rogues ; but they could neither 
find them, nor any of the reft ; for they all fled into 
the woods when they faw the boc^t coming on fliore. 

The 



48 LIFJE AND ADVENTURES 

The mate was once refolved, in juftlce to their 
roguery, to have deftroyed their plantations, burnt 
all their houfehold-ftuff and furniture, and left them 
to fhift without it ; but having no order, he let all 
alone, left every thing as they found it, and bringing 
the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

Thefe two men made their number five; but the 
other three villains were fo much wickeder than 
thefe, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 
doors to fliift for themfelves, and would have nothing 
to do with them ; nor could they for a good while 
be perfuaded to give them any food : as for the Spa* 
niards^ they were not yet come. 

"When the Spaniards came firft on ftiore, the bufi- 
nefs began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have 
perfuaded the three Englijh brutes to have taken in 
their two countrymen again, that, as they faid, they 
might be all one family ; but they would not hear of 
it : fo the two poor fellows lived by themfelves ; and 
finding nothing but induftry and application would 
make them live comfortable, they pitched their tents 
on the north fhore of the ifland, but a little more to 
the weft, tp be out of the danger of the favages, who 
always landed on the eaft parts of the' ifland. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and 
the other to lay up their magazines and ftores in; 
and the Spaniards having given them fome corn for 
feed, and efpecially fome of the peas which I had left 
them, they dug and planted, and inclofed, after the 
pattern I had fet for them all, and began to live pretty 
well : Their firft crop of corn was on the ground, 
and though it was but a little bit of land which 

they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

they had dug up at firft, having had but a little time, 
yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them 
with bread or other eatables ; and one of the fellows, 
being the cook's mate of the fliip, was very ready at 
making foup, puddings, and fuch other preparations, 
as the rice and the milk, and fuch little flelh as they 
got, furniflied him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving pofture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country- 
men too, in mere humour, and to infult them, came 
and bullied them, and told them the ifland was 
theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had given 
them poffeffion of it, and nobody elfe had any right 
to it ; and, damn them, they fhould build no houfes 
upon their ground, unlefs they would pay them rent 
for them. 

The two men thought they had jefted at firft ; and 
afked them to come and fit down, and fee what fine 
houfes they were that they had built, and tell them 
what rent they demanded : and one of them merrily 
told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped 
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im- 
provements, they would, according to the cuftom of 
all landlords, grant them a long leafe ; and bid them 
go fetch a fcrivener to draw the writings. One of 
the three, damning and raging, told them, they 
fliould fee they were not in jeft ; and going to a little 
place at a diftance, where the honeft men had made 
a fire to drefs their viftuals, he takes a fire-brand, 
and clap$-. it to the outfide of their hut, and very 
fairly fet it on fire ; and it would have been all burnt 
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not 
run to the fellgw, thruft him away, and trod the fire 

Vol, II. E out 



50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

out with his feet, and that not without fome difficuU 
ty too. 

The fellow was in fuch a rage at the honeft man^s 
thruiling him away, that he turned upon him with 
a pole he had in his hand ; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had end^d his days at once. His comrade, fee- 
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, 
and immediately they came both out with their muf- 
kets 'y and the man that was firft ftruck at with the 
pole, knocked the fellow down, who began the 
quarrel, with the (lock of his mufquet, and that 
before the other two could come to help him ; and 
then feeing the reft come at them, they ftood toge- 
ther, and prefenting the other ends of their pieces ta 
them, bade them ftand off. 

The others had fire-arms with them too ; but one 
of the two honeft men, bolder than his comrade, and 
made defperate by his danger, told them, if they 
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead men; 
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms,. 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but, fee- 
ing him refolute, it brought them to a parley, and 
they confented to take their wounded man with them, 
and be gone ; and indeed, it feems the fellow was 
wounded fufEciently with the blow ; however, they 
were much in the wrong, fince they had the advan- 
tage, that they did not difarm them effedually, as 
they might have done, and have gone immediately 
to the Spaniards^ and given them an account how 
the rogues had treated them ; for the three villains 
ftudied nothing but revenge, and every day gave 
them fome intimation that they did fo« 

But 



OF kOBlNSON CktJSOB» 5 1 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
leffer part of their rogueries, fuch as treading down 
their corn, (hooting three young kids, and a Ihe- 
goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame 
for their ftore ; and, in a word, plaguing them night 
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to 
fuch a defperation, that they refolved to fight them 
all three the firft time they had a fair opportunity. 
In order to this they refolved to go to the caftle, as 
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the 
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at 
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the 
Spaniards ftiould fland by to fee fair play. So they 
got up in the morning before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englijhmen by their names, tel- 
ling a Spaniard that anfwered, that they wanted to 
fpeak with them. 

It happened that the day before two of the Spa^ 
niardsj having been in the woods, had feen one of 
the two Englijhmen, whom, for diflinftion, I call the 
honefl men ; and he had made a fad complaint to 
the Spaniards, of the barbarous ufage they had met 
with from their three countrymen, and how they had 
ruined their plantation, and deftroyed their corn, 
that they had laboured fo hard to bring forward, and 
killed the milch-goat, and their three kids, which 
was all they had provided for their fuftenance ; and 
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, 
did not affift them again, they fhould be ftarved. 
When the Spaniards came home at night, and they 
were all at fupper, he took the freedom to reprove 
the three Englijhmen, though in gentle and mannerly 
terms, and afked them, how they could be fo cruel, 

E 2 they 



52 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they being harmlefs inofFenfive fellows, and that they 
were putting themfelves in a way to fubfift by theit* 
labour, and that it had coft them a great deal of pains 
to bring things to fuch perfeftion as they had ? 

One of the EngHJh?nen returned very brifkly, What 
had they to do there ? That they came on fhore with- 
out leave, and that they fhouldnot plant or build 
upon the ifland ; it was nqne of their ground. Why, 
fays the Spaniard^ very calmly, Seignior Inglefe^ they 
muft not ftarve. The Englijhman replied, like a true 
rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might ftarve and be damn- 
ed, they fhould not plant nor build in that place. 
But what muft they do then. Seignior? fays the Spa- 
niard. Another of the brutes returned. Do ! d — n 
them, they fhould be fervants, and work for them. 
But how can you expefl: that of them ? they are 
not bought with your money ; you have no right to 
make them fervants. The Englijhman anfwered. The 
ifland was theirs, the governor had given it to them, 
and no man had any thing to do there but themfelves; 
and with that fwore by his Maker, that he would go 
and burn all their new huts ; they fhould build none 
upon their land. 

Why Seignior, fays the Spaniard^ by the fame 
rule, we muft be your fervants too. Ay, fays th^ 
bold dog, and fo you fliall too, before we have done 
with you, mixing two or three G — d d — mme*s in 
the proper intervals of his fpeech. The Spaniard 
only fmiled at that, and made him no anfwer. How- 
ever, this little difcourfe had heated them; and 
ftarting up, one fays to the other, I think it was he 
they called Will Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and 
have the other brufh with them j we will demolifh.

their Caftle, I will warrant you ; they Ihall plant no 
colony in our dominions. 

Upon this they were all trooping away, with 
every man a gun, a piftol, and a fword, and mut- 
tered fome infolent things among themfelves, of 
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op- 
pottunity offered ; but the Spaniards^ it feems, did 
not fo perfeftly underftand them as to know all the 
particulars ; only that, in general, they threatened 
them hard for taking the two Englijhmen^s part. 

Whither they went, or how they beftowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards faid they did not 
know ; but it feems they wandered about the country 
part of the night ; and then lying down in the place 
which I ufed to call my bower, they were weary, and 
overflept themfelves. The cafe was this : they had 
refolved to ftay till midnight, and fo to take the 
poor men when they were aileep ; and they acknow- 
ledged it afterwards, intending to fet fire to their 
huts while they were in them, and either burn them 
in them, or murder them as they came out : and, 
as malice feldom fleeps very found, it was very ftrange 
they fhould not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had alfo a defign upon 
them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer one than 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and 
very luckily for them all, that they were up and 
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came 
to their huts. 

When they came thither and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who it feems was the forwarded man, called 
out to his comrades. Ha! Jack, here's the neft; but 
d — n them, the birds are flown : they mufed a while 

E 3 to 



54 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to think what fhould be the occafion of their being 
gone abroad fo foon, and fuggefted prefently, that 
the Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with 
that they fhook hands, and fwore to one another* 
that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As 
foon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell 
to work with the poor men's habitation ; they did 
not fet fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down 
both their houfes, and pulled them fo limb from limb 
that they left not the lead ftick Handing, or fcarce 
any fign on the ground where they ftood ; they tore 
all their little collected houfehold-ftuflf in pieces, and 
threw every thing about in fuch a manner, that the 
poor men found, afterwards, fome of their things 
a mile off from their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the 
young trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled 
up the inclofure they had made to fecure their cattle 
and their corn ; and, in a word, facked and plun- 
dered every thing, as completely as a herd of Tartars 
would have done. 

The two men were at this jundure gone to find 
them out, and had refolved to fight them wherever 
they had been, tho' they were but two to three : fa 
that, had they met, there certainly would have been 
bloodfhed among them ; for they were all very ftout^ 
refolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took mere care to keep thenx 
afunder, than they themfelves could do to meet : for, 
as they had dogged one another, when the three were; 
gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards, 
when the two went back to find them, the three were 
come to the old habitation again j we ihall fee their

differing condudt prefently. When the three came 
back, like furious creatures, flufhed with the r^ge 
which the work they had been about put them into, 
they came up to the Spaniards^ and told them what 
they had done, by way of feoff and bravado ; and 
one of them ftepping up to one of the Spaniards^ as 
if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold 
of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a 
twirl about, fleering in his face, fays he to him. And 
you. Seignior yack Spaniard^ fhall have the fame 
fauce, if you do not mend your manners. The Spa- 
niard who, though quite a civil man, was as brave 
as a man could defire to be, and withal a flrong 
well-made man, looked fteadily at him for a good 
while; and then, having no weapon in his hand, 
ftept gravely up to him, and with one blow of his 
fill, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a 
pole-axe, at which one of the rogues, infolent as the 
firfl, fired his piftol at the Spaniard immediately : 
he miffed his body indeed, for the bullets went 
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip 
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he 
really was, and that put him into fome heat, for be- 
fore he afted all in a perfeft calm ; but now re- 
folving to go through with his work, he ftooped and 
took the fellow's mufquet whom he had knocked 
down, and was juft going to fhoot the man who had 
fired at him ; when the reft of the Spaniards^ being 
in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to 
flioot, they ftept in, fecured the other two, and took 
their arms from them. 

E 4 When 



£6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

When they were thus difarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as 
their own countrymen, they began to cool ; and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their arms again ; but the Spaniards^ confidering the 
feud that was between them and the other two Englijh- 
menj and that it would be the beft method they could 
take to keep them from one another, told them they 
would do them no harm ; and if they would live 
peaceably they would be very willing to affift and 
affociate with them, as they did before; but that 
they could not think of giving them their arms 
again, while they appeared fo refolved to do mif- 
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had 
even threatened them all to make them their 
fervants. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear rea«% 
fon than to afl: reafon ; but being refufed their arms,, 
they went raving away, and raging like madmen, 
threatening what they would do, though they had 
no fire-arms : but the Spaniards defpifing their threat* 
ening, told them they fhould take care how they 
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle ; for 
if they did, they would fhoot them, as they would 
do ravenous beafts, wherever they found them ; and 
if they fell into their hands alive, they would cer* 
tainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool, 
ing them ; but away they went, fwearing and raging 
like furies of helL As foon as they were gone, came 
back the two men in paffion and rage enough alfo, 
though of another kind ; for, having been at their 
plantation, and finding it all demolifhed and deftroy- 
cd, as above, it mil eafily be fuppofed they had pro-» 

vocation 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

Vocation enough ; they could fcarce have room to 
tell their tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell 
them theirs ; and it was ftrange enough to find, , that 
three men Ihould thus bully nineteen, and receive no 
punifhment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpecially 
having thus difarmed them, made light of their 
threatenings ; but the two EngUjhmen refolved to have 
their remedy againft them, what pains foever it coil: 
to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interpofed here too, and told 
them, that they were already difarmed : they could 
not confent that they (the two) fhould purfue them 
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, faid the 
grave Spaniard^ who was their governor, we will 
endeavour to mak^ them do you juftice, if you will 
leave it to us, for, as there is no doubt but they will 
come to us again when their paffion is over, being not 
jible to fubfift without our afliftance, we prbmife you 
to make no peace with them, without having a full 
fatisfaftion for you .; and upon this condition we hope 
you will promife to ufe no violence with them, other 
than in your defence. 

The two EngUjhmen yielded to this very awkwardly, 
and with great reluftance ; but the Spaniards pro- 
tefted, they did it only to keep them from bloodfhed, 
and to make all eafy at laft; for, faid they, we are 
pot fo many of us ; here is room enough for us all, 
and it is great pity we fliould not be all good friends. 
At length they did confent, and waited for the iflue 
of the thing, living for fome days witfi the Spaniards ; 
for their own habitation was deftroyed. 

In 



58 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In about five days time the three vagrants, tired 
with wandering, and almoft ftarved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard^ 
who, as I have faid, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the fide of the creek j 
they came up in a very fubmiffive humble manner, 
and begged to be received again into" the family. The 
Spaniards ufed them civilly, but told them, they had 
aded fo unnaturally by their countrymen, and fa 
very grofsly by them (the Spaniards J ^ that they could 
not come to any conclufion without confulting the 
two EngUjhmen^ and the reft; but however they 
would go to them, and difcourfe about it, and they 
fliould know in half an hour. It may be gueffed 
that they were very hard put to it; for it feems, as 
they were to wait this half-hour for an anfwer, they 
begged he would fend them out fome bread in the 
mean time ; which he did, and fent them at the fame 
time a large piece of goat's flefli, and a broiled par- 
rot; which they eat very heartily, for they were 
hungry enough. 

After half an hour's confultation they were called 
' in, and a long debate had about them, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their 
labour, and a defign to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could- not deny now; 
upon the whole, the Spaniards adted the moderators 
between them; and as they had obliged the two 
EngUjhmen not to hurt the three, while they were 
naked and unarmed, fo they now obliged the three 
to go and rebuild their fellows two huts, one to be

of the fame dimenfions, and the other larger than 
they were before ; alfo to fence their ground again, 
where they had pulled up the fences, plant trees in 
the room of thofe pulled up, dig up the land again 
for planting corn, where they had fpoiled it ; and, 
in a word, to reftore every thing in the fame (late as 
they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it 
could not be, the feafon for the corn, and the growth 
of the trees and hedges, not being poflible to be 
recovered. 

Well, they all fubmitted to this ; and as they 
had plenty of provifions given them all the while, 
they grew very orderly, and the whole fociety began 
to live pleafantly and agreeably together again ; only 
that thefe three fellows could never be perfuaded to 
work ; I mean, not for themfelves, except now and 
then a little, juft as they pleafed ; however, the Spa^ 
niards told them plainly, that if they would but live 
fociably and friendly together, and ftudy in the whole 
the good of the plantation, they would be content to 
work for them, and let them walk about and be as 
idle as they pleafed; and thus having lived pretty 
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave 
them their arms again, and gave them liberty to go 
abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had thefe arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures be- 
gan to be as infolent and troublefome as before ; but 
however, an accident happened prefently upon this, 
which endangered the fafety of them all ; they were 
obliged to lay by all private refentments, and look 
tQ the prefervation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor^ 
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whofe 
life I had faved, who was now the capcain, or leader, 
or governor of the reft, found himfelf very uneafy 
in the night, and could by no means get any fleep : 
he was perfeftly well in body, as he told me the ftory, 
only found his thoughts tumultuous ; his mind ran 
upon men fighting, and killing one another, but 
was broad awake, and could not by any means get 
any fleep ; in fhort, he lay a great while ; but grow- 
ing more and more uneafy, he refolved to rife : as 
they lay, being fo many of them, upon goat-flvins, 
laid thick upon fuch couches and pads as they made 
for themfelves, and not in hammocks and fliip-beds„ 
as I did, who was but one, fo they had little to do„ 
when they were willing to rife, but to get up upon 
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, fuch as it was^ 
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any 
way that their thoughts guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out ; but, being 
dark, he could fee little or nothing ; and befides, 
the trees which I had planted, as in my former ac- 
count is defcribed, and which were now grown tall, 
intercepted his fight, fo that he could only look up, 
and fee that it was a clear ftar-light night ; and, hear- 
ing no noife, he returned and laid him down again ; 
but it was all one, he could not fleep, nor could he 
compofe himfelf to any thing like reft, but his 
thoughts were to the laft degree uneafy, arid yet he 
knew not for what.

about, going out and coming in, another of them

V^^aked, and, calling, afked who it was that was up ? 
The governor told him, how it had been with him. 
Say you fo ? fays the other Spaniard ; fuch things are 
not to be flighted, I aflure you ; there is certainly 
fome mifchief working, fays he, near us ; and pre- 
fently he alked him. Where are the Englijhmen ? They 
are all in their huts, fays he, fafe enough. It feems, 
the Spaniards had kept poflelTion of the main apart- 
ment, and had made a place, where the three Eng- 
lijhmen^ fince their laft mutiny, always quartered by 
themfelves, and could not come at the refl. Well, 
fays the Spaniard^ there is fomething in it, I am per- 
fuaded from my own experience ; I am fatisfied our 
fpirits embodied have converfe with, and receive in- 
telligence from, the fpirits unembodied, and inhabit- 
ing the invifible world ; and this friendly notice is 
given for our advantage, if we know how to make 
ufe of it. Come, fays he, let us go out and look 
abroa:d ; and if we find nothing at all in it to juftify 
our trouble. Til tell you a ftory to the purpofe, 
that fhall convince you of the juftice of my pro- 
pofmg it. 

In a word, they went out to go to the top of 
the hill, where I ufed to go ; but they, being ftrong, 
and in good company, nor alone, as I was, ufed 
none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and 
then pulling it up after them, to go up a fecond ftage 
to the top, but were going round through the grove 
unconcerned and unwary, when they were furprifed 
with feeing a light as of fire, a very little way off 
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of 
one, or two, but of a great number. 

In 



6^ JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In all the difcoveries I had made of the favage^ 
landing on the ifland, it was my conftant care to 
prevent them making the leaft difcovery of there be- 
ing any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any neceflity they came to kn6w it, they felt it fo 
effeftually, that they that got away, were fcarce able 
to give any account of it, for we difappeared as foon 
as poffible, nor did ever any that had feen me^ 
efcape to tell any one elfe, except it were the three 
favages in our laft encounter, who jumped into the 
boat, of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they 
fliould go home, and bring more help. 

Whether it was the confequence of the efcape of 
thofe men, th^t fo great a number came now to- 
gether; or whether they came ignorantly, and by 
accident, on their ufual bloody errand, the Spaniards 
could not it feems underfland : but whatever it was, 
it had been their bufinefs, either to have concealed 
themfelves, and not have feen them at all; much 
lefs to have let the favages have feen that there were 
any inhabitants in the place ; but to have fallen upon 
them fo effedually, as that not a man of them fliould 
haveefcaped, which could only have been by getting 
in between them and their boats ; but this prefence^ 
of mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of 
their tranquillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor, and 
the mail with him, furprifed with this fight, ran back 
immediately, and raifed their fellows, giving them 
an account of the imminent danger they were all in; 
and they again as readily took the alarm, but It was 
impoflible to perfuade them to ftay clofe within where 

they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOEt 63 

they were, but that they muft all run out to fee how 
things flood. 

While it was dark indeed, they w6re well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for fome hours, to 
view them by the light of thr.ee fires they had made 
at fome diftance from one another j what they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themfelves they 
knew not ; for, firfl, the enemy were too many ; 
and, fecondly, they did not keep together, but were 
divided into feveral parties, and were on fhore in 
feveral places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall conflemation at 
this fight ; and as they found that the fellows ran 
draggling all over the fhore, they made no doubt, 
but, firlt or lafl, fome of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon fome other place, where 
they would fee the tokens of inhabitants ; and they 
were in great perplexity alfo for fear of their flock of 
goats, which would have been little lefs than flarving 
them, if they fhould have been deflroyed ; fo the 
firfl thing they refolved upon, was to difpatch three 
men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and 
one Englijhman^ to drive all the goats away to the 
great valley where the cave was, and, if need were, 
to drive them into the very cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the favages altogether in 
one body, and at a diftance from their canoes, they 
refolved, if there had been an hundred of them, to 
have attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, 
for there were fome of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
difierent nations. 

After 



64 III^E AND ADVENTURJ^S 

After having mufed a great while on the courjfe 
they ftiould take, and beaten their brains in conli-* 
dering their prefent circumftances, they refolved at 
laft, while it was dark, to fend the old favage (-Fr/- 
daf^ father) out as a fpy, to learn, if poffible, fome* 
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and 
what they intended to do, and the like; the old 
man readily undertook it, and, ftripping himfelf 
quite naked, as moft of the favages were, away he 
went : after he had been gone an hour or two, he 
brings word, that he had been among them undifco- 
vered, that he found they were two parties, and of 
two feveral nations, who had war with one another 
and had had a great battle in their own country, and 
that both (ides having had feveral prifoners taken in 
the fight, they were by mere chance landed in the 
fame ifland, for the devouring their prifoners, and 
making merry ; but their coming fo by chance to 
the fame place, had fpoiled all their mirth ; that they 
were in a great rage at one another, and were fo near, 
that he believed they would fight again as foon as 
day-light began to appear ; but he did not perceive 
that they had any notion of any body's being on the 
ifland but themfelves. He had hardly made an end 
of telling the ftory, when they could perceive, by 
the unufual noife they made, that the two little 
armies were engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday^ % father ufed a,ll the arguments he could to 
perfuade our people to lie clofe, and not be feen \ he 
told them, their fafety confifted in it, and that they 
had nothing to do but to lie ftill, and the favages 
would kill one another to their hands, and the reft 

would 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6$ 

xrould go away ; and it was fo to a tittle. But it 
was impoflible to prevail, efpecially upon the Eng* 
Jijhmen; their curiofity was fo iiiiportunate upon 
their prudentials, that they muft run out and fee the 
battle: however, they ufcd fome caution, viz. they 
did not go openly juft by their own dwelling, but 
went farther into the woods, and placed themfelves 
to advantage, where they might fecurely fee them 
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not to be 
feen by themj but it feems the favages did fee 
them, as we ftiall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Engli/hmerij one of them faid, he could perceive, 
that fome of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible fpirits, and of great policy in guiding the 
fight. The battle, they faid, held two hours, before 
they could guefs which party would be beaten ; but 
then that party which was neareft our people's habita- 
tion began to appear weakeft, and after fome time 
more, fome of them began to fly ; and this put our 
men again into a great confternation, left any of 
thofe that fled fliould run into the grove, before their 
dwelling, for flicker, and thereby involuntarily dif- 
cover the place ; and that by confequence the pur- 
fuers fhould do the like in fearch for them. Upon 
this they refolved, that they would ftand armed with- 
in the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they 
flwuld fally out over the wall, and kill them ; fo 
that, if poffible, not one fliould return to give an 
account of it j they ordered alfo, that it fliould be 
done with their fwords, or by knocking them down

with the flock of the mufquet, not by fhooting theitlj 
for fear of raifing an alarm by the noife. 

As they expefted, It fell out ; three of the routed 
army fled for life, and crofling the creek, ran direftly 
into the place, not in the lead knowing whither 
they went, but running a^ into a thick wood for 
flielter; the fcout they kept to look abroad gave 
notice of this within, with this addition, to our 
men's great fatisfaftion, viz. That the conquerors 
had not purfued them, or feen which way they were 
gone* Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of 
humanity, would not fuffer them to kill the three 
fugitives } but, fending three men out by the top of 
the hill, ordered them to go round, and come in 
behind them, furprife and take them prifoners, which 
was done ; the refidue of the conquered people fled 
to their canoes, and got oflF to fea ; the viftors re^ 
tired, and made no purfuit, or very little ; but, draw- 
ing themfelves into a body together, gave two great 
fcreaming fliouts, which they fuppofed were by way 
of triumph, and fo the fight ended: and the fame 
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they alfo 
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards 
had their ifland again free to themfelves, their fright 
was over, and they faw no lavages in feveral years 
after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out 
of their den ; and, viewing the field of battle, they 
found about two-and-thirty dead men upon the fpot ; 
fome were killed with great long arrows, feveral of 
which were found ft:icking in their bodies ; but mofl; 
of them were killed with their great wooden fwords, 

fixteen 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

fixteen or feventeen of which they found in the field 
of battle, and as many bows, with a great many 
arrows : thefe fwords were great unwieldly things, 
and they muft be very ftrong men that ufed them : 
inoft of thofe men that were killed with them had 
their heads mafhed to pieces, as we may fay, or, as 
we call it in Englijh^ their brains knocked out, and 
feveral of their arms arid legs broken ; fo that it is 
evident they fight with inexpreffible rage and fury ; 
they found not one wounded man that was not ftone 
dead; for either they flay by their enemy till 
they have quite killed them, or they carry all the 
wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with 
them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englijhmen for a great 
\vhile: the fight had filled them with horror, and 
the confequence appeared terrible to the lafl degree, 
efpecially upon fuppofing that fome time or other 
they fhould fall into the hands of thofe creatures, 
who would not only kill them as enemies, but 
Idll them for food, as we kill our cattle. And 
they profefled to me, that the thoughts of being 
eaten up like beef or mutton, though it was fup. 
pofed it was not to be till they were dead, had fome- 
thing in it fo horrible, that it naufeated their very 
ftomachs, made them fick when they thought of it, 
and filled their minds with unufual terror, that 
they were not themfelves for fome weeks after. 

This, as I faid, tamed even the three EngliJJy 
brutes I have been fpeaking of; and, for a great 
while aftet, they were very tradable, and went about 
the common bufinefs of the whole fociety well 

F 2 enough J 



68 l-IFE AND- ADVENTURES 

enough; planted, fowed, reaped, and began to be 
5^11 naturalized to the country; but fome time after 
this, they fell all into fuch fimple meafures again as 
brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prifoners, as I had obferved J 
and thefe three being lufty flout young fellows, they 
made them fervants, and taught them to work 
for them; and, as flaves, they did well enough j 
but they did not take their meafures with them 
as I did by my man Frid09 '^^^^ to begin with them 
upon the principle cf^having faved their lives, and 
then inftructed thjjiii in the rational principles of 
life, much lefs of religion, civilizing and reducing, 
them by kind ufage, and affedionate arguings; 
but, as they gave them their food every day, fa 
they gave them their work too, and kept them fully 
employed in drudgery enough ; but they failed in 
this by it, that they never had them to aflift them 
and fight for them, as I had my man Friday^ wha 
was as true to me as the very flefh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part : Being all now 
good friends (for common danger, as I faid above^. 
had effedually reconciled them), they began to con- 
fider their general circumftances ; and the firft thing 
that came under their confideration was, whether,, 
feeing the favages particularly haunted that fide of the 
ifland, and that there were more remote and retired 
parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and 
. manifeftly to their advantage, they fhould not rather 
remove their habitation, and plant in fome more 
. proper place for their fafety, and efpecially for the 
fccurity of their cattle and corn.> 

Upon 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived, 
that they fhould not remove their habitation ; be- 
caufe that fome time or other they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, meaning 
me : and if I fhould fend any one to feek them, I 
would be fure to direO: them on that fide, where, if 
they fliould find the plac€ demolifhed, they would 
conclude the favages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and fo our fupply would go away too. 

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as proper to both, and where 
indeed there was land enough : however, upon fe- 
cond thoughts, they altered one part of that refolu- 
tion too, and refolved only to remove part of their 
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there ; 
and fo, if one part was deftroyed, the other might 
be faved : and one piece of prudence they ufed, 
which it was very well they did ; viz. That they 
never trufted thefe three favages, which they had 
taken prifoners, with knowing any thing of the 
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any 
cattle they had there ; much lefs of the cave there, 
which they kept in cafe of neceffity, as a fafe retreat; 
and thither they carried alfo the two barrels of pow- 
der which I had left them at my coming away. 

But, however, they refolved not to change their 
habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully 
covered it firft with a wall and fortification, and 
then with a grove of trees ; fo, feeing their fafety 
confifted entirely in their being concealed, of which 
they were now fully convinced, they fet to work to 
cover and conceal the place yet more eflfeftually than 

F 3 before; 



^o Life and adventures 

before : to this purpofe, as I had planted trees (or 
rather thruft in ftakes, which in time all grew to be 
trees) for fome good diftance before the entrance 
into my apartment, they went on in the fame man- 
ner, and filled up the reft of that whole fpace of 
ground, from the trees I had fet, quite down to the 
fide of the creek, where, ^ as I faid, I landed my 
floats, and even into the very ouze where the tide 
flowed, not fo much as leaving any place to land, or 
anyfign that there had been any landing thereabout: 
thefe fl:akes alfo, being of a wood very forward to 
grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to 
have generally very much larger and taller than thofe 
which I had planted, and placed them fo very thick 
and clofe, that when they had been three or four 
years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any 
confiderable way into tlie plantation : as for that part 
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick 
as a man's thigh ; and among them they placed fo 
many other fhort ones, and fo thick, that, in a word^ 
it fl:ood like a palifado a quarter of a mile thick, and 
it was next to impoflTible to penetrate it, but with a 
little army, to cut it all down ; for a little dog could 
hardly get between the trees, they ftood fo clofe. 

But this was not all ; for they did the fame by 
all the ground to the right hand, and to the left, 
and round even to the top of the hill ; leaving no 
way, not fo much as for themfelves to come out, 
but by the ladder placed up to the fide of the hill, 
and then lifted up, and placed again from the firft 
ftage up to the top ; which ladder, when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to 
^flift it, could come at them, 

This 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Jl 

This was excellently well contrived : nor was it 
lefs than what they afterwards found occafion for ; 
which ferved to convince me, that as human pru- 
dence has authority of Providence to juftify it, fo 
it has, doubtlefs, the direction of Providejice to fet 
it to- work ; and, would we Hften carefully to the 
voice of it, I am fully perfuaded we might prevent; 
many of the difafters which our lives are now, by 
our own negligence, fubjefted to. But this by the 
way. 

I return to the ftory : they lived two years after 
this in perfeft retirement, and had no more vifits 
from the favages ; they had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them in a great con- 
fternation; for, fome of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the weft fide, or rather end of 
the ifiand, which, by the way, was that end where 
I never went, for fear of being difcovered, they were 
furprifed with feeing above twenty canoes of Indians 
juft coming on fliore. 

They made the beft of their way home, in hurry 
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades, 
they kept clofe all that day and the next, going 
out only at night, to make obfervation : but they 
had the good luck to be miftaken ; for wherever 
the favages went, they did not land at that time 
on the ifland, but purfued fome other defign. 

And now they had another broil with the three 
EngUjhmen ; one of which, a moft turbulent fellow, 
being in a rage at one of the three flaves, which I 
mentioned they had taken, becaufe the fellow had 
not done fomething right which he bid him do, and 

F 4 feemcd 



72 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

feemed a little untradable in his fhewing him, drew 
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it by 
his fide, and fell upon him, the poor favage, not ta 
correft him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards^ 
who was by, feeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head,, 
but ftruck into his fhoulder, fo that he thought he 
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and 
intreating him not to murder the poor man, clapt 
in between him and the favage, to prevent the 
mifchief. 

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, ftrucfe 
at Xht Spaniard vfith. his hatchet, and fwore hewoulcj 
ferve him as he intended to ferve the favage ; which 
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, an4 
with a fhovel, which he had in his hand (for they 
were working in the field about the corn-land,) 
kn^ocked the brute down : another of the Englijhmeny^ 
running at the fame time to help his comrade^ 
knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards 
^ more came to help their man, and a third Engiijhman 
fell upon them. They had none of them any fire-* 
arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and other 
tools, except the third Engiijhman; he had one of 
my old rufty cutlafTes, with which he made at the 
laft Spaniards^ and wounded them both: this fray 
fet the whole family in an uproar, and more help 
coming in, they took the three Englijhmen prifoners* 
The next queftion was. What fhould be done with 
them ? They had been fo often mutinous, and were 
fo furious, fo defperate, and fo idle withal, that they 
knew not what courfe to take with them, for they

were nufchievous to the higheft degree, and valued 
not what hurt they did any man j fo that, in fliort, 
it was not fafe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor, told them in fo 
many words, that if they had been his own country- 
men, he would have hanged them all ; for all laws, 
and all governors, were to preferve fociety; and 
thofe who were dangerous to the fociety ought to be 
expelled out of it; .but as they were Englijhmen^ 
and that it was to the generous kindnefs of an Eng-^ 
lijhman that they all owed their prefervation and de- 
liverance, he would ufe them with all poffible lenity, 
and would leave them to the judgment of the other 
two Englijhmen^ who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honeft Englijhmcn flood up, and 
feid, they defired it might not be left to them : for, 
lays he, I am fure we ought to fentence them to the 
gallows ; and with that gives an account how Will 
/itkins^ one of the three, had propofed to have all 
the five Englijhmen join together, and murder all the 
Spaniards^ when they were in their fleep. 

When the Spanijh governor heard this, he calls to 
Will Atkins : How, Seignior Atkins^ fays he. Will 
you murder us all ? What have you to fay to that ? 
That hardened villain was fo far from denying it, 
that he faid it was true, and G — d d — mn him they 
would do it flill before they had done with them. 
Weil, but Seignior Atkins^ faid the Spaniard^ What 
have we done to you that you will kill us ? And 
f^hat would you get by killing us ? And what muft 
we do to prevent your killing us ? Mufl we kill you, 
or will you kill us ? Why will you put us to the ne* 

ceffity 



74 ^IPE AND ADVENTURES 

ceflity of this, Seignior Atkins? fays the Spaniard 
very calmly, and fmiUng. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a rage at the SpanianPs^ 
making a jeft of it, that, had he not been held by 
three men, and withal had no weapons with him, it 
was thought he would have attempted to have killed 
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

Tliis hare-brained carriage obliged them to confi- 
der ferioufly what was to be done. The two Englijb-- 
men and the Spaniard^ who faved the poor favage, 
were of the opinion, That they fhould hang one of 
the three for an example to the reft j and that par- 
ticularly it fhould be he that had twice attempted to 
commit murder with his hatchet ; and indeed there 
was fome reafon to believe he had done it, for the 
ppor favage was in fuch a miferable condition with 
the wound he had received, that it was thought he 
could not live. 

But the governor Spaniard ftill faid ; No, it waa 
an Englijhman that had faved all their lives, and he 
would never confent to put an Englijhman to death, 
though he had murdered half of them ; nay, he faid, 
if he had been killed himfelf by an Englijhman^ and 
had time left to fpeak, it fhould be, that they fhould 
pardon him. 

This was fo pofitively infifted on by the governor 
Spaniard^ that there was no gainfaying it ; and, as 
merciful counfels are moft apt to prevail, where they 
are fo earneftly prcffed, fo they all came into it ; but 
then it was to be confidered, what fhould be donfl 
to keep them from the mifchief they defigned j for 
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be 

ufed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Jg 

ufed for preferving the foclety from danger : After a 
long debate it was agreed, firft. That they fhould be 
difarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, or 
powder, or fhot, or fword, or any weapon, and 
(hould be turned out of the fociety, and left to live 
where they would, and how they could, by them- 
felves ; but that none of the reft, either Spaniards or 
Englijh^ fhould converfe with them, fpeak with them, 
or have any thing to do with them ; that they fhould 
be forbid to come within, a certain diftance of the 
place where the reft dwelt ; and that if they offered 
to commit any diforder, fo as to fpoil, burn, kill, or 
deftroy any of the corn, plantings,^ buildings, fences, 
or cattle belonging to the fociety, that they fhould 
die without mercy, and would fhoot them wherever 
they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, mufmg 
upon the fentence, confidered a little upon it ; and, 
turning to the two honeft Englijhmen, faid, Hold ; you 
muft refled, that it will be long ere they can raife 
corn and cattle of their own, and they muft not ftarve; 
we muft therefore allow them provifions. So he cau- 
fed to be added, That they fhould have a proportion 
of corn given them to laft them eight months, and for 
feed to fow, by which time they might be fuppofed 
to raife fome of their own ; that they fhould have 
fix milch-goats, four he-goats, and fix kids given 
them, as well for prefent fubfiftence, as for a ftore ; 
and that they fhould have tools given them for their 
work in the field ; fuch as, fix hatchets, an axe, a 
faw, and the like; But they fhould have none of 
thefe tools or provifions, unlefs they would fwear 

fblemnly 



76 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

folemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englijhmen. 

Thus they difmiffed them the fociety, and turned 
them out to fhift for themfelves. They went away 
fuUen and refradory, as neither contented to go 
away, or to ftay ; but, as there was no remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choofe a place where they 
fliould fettle themfelves, to plant and live by them- 
felves ; and feme provifions were given, but no wea- 
pons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for 
fome viduals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them- 
felves out an habitation or plantation ; it was a very 
convenient place indeed, on the remoteft part of the 
ifland, N. E. much about the place where I provi- 
dentially landed in my firft voyage, when I was dri- 
ven out to fea, the Lord alone knows whither, in 
my foolifli attempt to furround the ifland. 

Here they built themfelves two handfome huts, 
and contrived them in a manner like my firft habita- 
tion, being clofe under the fide of a hill, having 
fome trees growing already to the three fides of it ; 
fo that by planting others, it would be very eafily 
covered from the fight, unlefs narrowly fearched 
for ; they defired fome dry goat fliins for beds and 
covering, which were given them ; and upon their 
giving their words that they would not difturb the 
reft, or injure any of their plantations, they gave 
them hatchets, and what other tools they could 
fpare; fome peafe, barley, and rice, for fowing, 
and, in a word, any thing they wanted but arms and 
ammunition. 

They 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB# ^f 

They lived in this feparate condition about fix 
months, and had got in their firft harveft, though 
the quantity was but fipall, the parcel of land they 
had planted being but little ; for indeed, having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands ; and when they came to 
make boards, and pots, and fuch things, they were 
quite out of their element, and could make nothing 
of it } and when the rainy feafon came on, for want 
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their 
grain dry, and it was in great danger of fpoiling : 
and this humbled them much ; fo they came and beg-i 
ged the Spaniards to help them, which they very 
readily did ; and in four days worked a great hole 
in the fide of the hill for them, big enough to fecurc 
their corn, and other things from the rain; but it 
was but a poor place at beft, compared to mine ; and 
efpecially as mine was then ; for the Spaniards had 
greatly enlarged it, and made feveral new apartments 
in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this feparation, 
a new frolick took thefe rogues, which, together 
with the former villainy they had committed, brought 
mifchief enough upon them, and had very near -been 
the ruin of the whole colony : the three new affociates 
began, it feems, to be weary of the laborious life 
they led, and that without hope of bettering their 
circumftances ; and a whim took them, that they 
Vould make a voyage to the continent from whence 
the fcivages came, and would try if they could not 
feize upon fome prifoners among the natives there 
and bring them home, fo as^ to make them do the 
laborious part of the work for them^^ 

The 



^8 MI?E AKD ADVENtlJRES 

The projeft was not fo prepofterous, if they had gdne 
no farther ; but they did nothing, and propofed no- 
thing, but had either mifchief in the defign, or mif- 
chief in the event : and, if I may give my opinion, 
they feemed to be under a blaft from Heaven ; for if 
we will not allow a vifible curfe to purfue vifible 
crimes, how fhall we reconcile the events of things 
with divine juftice ? It was certainly an apparent ven- 
geance on their crime of mutiny and piracy, that 
brought them to the (late they were in ; and, as they 
fliewed not the leaft remorfe for the crime, but added 
new villainies to it, fuch as, particularly, that piece 
of monftrous cruelty of wounding a poor flave, be- 
caufe he did not, or perhaps could not, underftarid to 
do what he was direfled ; and to wound him in fuch 
a manner, as, no queftion, made him a cripple all his 
life, and in a place where no furgeon or medicine 
could be had for his cure : and, what was ftill worfe, 
the murderous intent 5 or, to do juftice to the crime, 
the intentional murder, for fuch to be fure it was, 
as was afterwards the formed defign they all laid, to 
murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
fleep. 

But I leave obferving, and return to the ftory : 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and, -in very humble terms, defired to be 
admitted to fpeak with them: the Spaniards ver/ 
readily heard what they had to fay, which was this : 
that they were tired of living in the manner they did ; 
that they were not handy enough to make the necef- 
faries they wanted ; and that, having no help, they 
found they Ihould be ftarved ; but if the Spaniards 
would give them leave to take one of the canoes which 

they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

they came over in, and give them arms and ammuni- 
tion, proportioned for their defence, they would go 
over to the main, and feek their fortune, and fo deli- 
ver them from the trouble of fupplying them with 
any other provifions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them ; 
but yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain 
deftruftion they were running into; told them, 
they had fuffered fuch hardfhips upon that very fpot, 
that they could, without any fpirit of prophecy, tell 
them, that they would be ftarved or murdered ; and 
bade them confider of it. 

The men replied audacioufly, they fhould be ftar- 
ved if they ftayed here, for they could not work, and 
would not work; and they could but be ftarved 
abroad; and if they were murdered, there was an 
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry 
after them ; and, in fliort, infifted importunately upon 
their demand, declaring that they would go, whether 
they would give them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindnefs, 
that if they were refolved to go, they fliould not go 
like naked men, and be in no condition to defend 
themfelves; and that though they could ill fpare 
their fire-arms, having not enough for themfelves, 
yet th^y would let them have two mufquets, a piftol^ 
and a cutlafs, and each man a hatchet, which they 
thought fufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer ; and having 
baked them bread enough to ferve them a month, 
and given them as much goat's flefli as they could 
cat while it was fweet, and a great bafket full of dried 
grapes, a pot full of frefti water, and a young kid

alive to kill, they boldly fet out in a canoe for ^ 
voyage over the fea, where it was at leaft forty miles 
broad* 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well carried 15 or 20 men; and therefore was 
rather too big for them to manage ; but as they had 
a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they did 
well enough : they had made a maft of a long pole, 
and a fail of four large goat-lkins dried, which they 
had fowed or laced together ; and away they went 
merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them, 
Bon Veajo ; and no man ever thought of feeing them 
any more. 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another, and 
the two honeft Englijhmen who remained behind, how 
quietly and comfortably they lived, now thofe three 
turbulent fellows were gone ; as for their ever coming 
again, that was the remoteft thing from their thoughts 
could be imagined ; when, behold, after twenty 
two days abfence, one of the Englijhmen being 
abroad upon his planting-work, fees three ftrange 
men coming towards him at a diftance, two of them 
with guns upon their flioulders. 

Away runs the Englijhmany as if he was bewitched, 
^nd became frighted and amazed, to the governor 
Spaniard^ and tells him they were all undone, for 
there were ftrangers landed upon the ifland, he could 
not tell who : the Spaniard paufmg a while, fays to _ 
him. How do you mean, you cannot tell who ? They 
are favages to be fure. No, no, fays the Englijbmany 
they are men in clothes, v/ith arms : Nay then, fays 
the Spaniard^ why are you concerned ? If they are 
not favages, they mull be friends j for there is no

Clhriftian nation upon earth, but will do us good ra- 
ther than harm. 

While they were debating thus, came the three 
Englijhmen^ and, (landing without the wood which 
was new planted, hallooed to them ; they prefently 
knew their voices, and fo all the wonder of that 
kind ceafed. But now the admiration was turned 
upon another queftion, viz. What could be the mat- 
ter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; 
and enquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing ? They gave them a full account 
of their voyage in a few words, viz. That they 
reached the land in two days, or fomething lefs ; but 
finding the people alarmed at their coming, and pre- 
paring with bows and arrows to fight them, they 
durll not go on fhore, but failed on to the northward 
fix or feven hours, till they came to a great opening, 
by which they perceived that the land they faw from 
our ifland was not the main, but an ifland : that 
entering that opening of the fea, they faw another 
ifland on the right hand north, and feveral more 
weft ; and being refolved to land fomewhere, they 
put over to one of the iflands which lay weft, and 
went boldly on ftiore ; that they found the people 
were courteous and friendly to them, and they gave 
them feveral roots, and fome dried fifli, and ap- 
'peared very fociable ; and the women, as well as 
the men, were very forward to fupply them with 
any thing they could get for them to eat, and 
brought it to them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and enquired, as 
yrell as they could of them by figns, what nations 

Vol. IL G were 



8J life and adventures 

were this way, and that way ; and were told of fe- 
Veral fierce and terrible people, that lived almoft 
every way ; who, as they made known by figns to 
them, ufed to eat men ; but as for themfelves, they 
faid, that they never eat men or women, except 
only fuch as they took in the wars J and then they 
owned, that they made a great feaft, and eat their 
prifoners. 

The Englifhmen enquired, when they had a feaft 
of that kind ; and they told them two moons ago, 
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; and 
that their great king had two hundred prifoners now, 
which he had taken in his war ; and they were 
feeding them to make them fat for the next feaft. 
The Englijhmen feemed mighty defirous to fee thofe 
prifoners j but the others miftaking them, thought 
they were defirous to have fome of them to carry 
away for their own eating. So they beckoiied to 
them, pointing to the fetting of the fun, and then 
to the rifing ; which was to fignify, that the' next 
morning, at fun-rifing, they would bring fome for 
them; and accordingly, the next morning, they 
brought down five women, and eleven men ; and 
gave them to the Englifhmen^ to carry with them 
on their voyage, juft as we would bring fo many 
cows and oxen down to a fea-port town, to viftual 
a fliip. 

As brutifli and barbarous as thefe fellows were 
at home, their ftomachs turned at this fight, and 
they did not know what to do ; to refufe the pri- 
foners would have been the higheft affront to the 
favage gentry that offered them ; and what to do 
with them they knew not : however, upon fome de- 
bate. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

bate, they refolved to accept of them ; and, in re- 
turn, they gave the favages that brought them one 
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or 
feven of their bullets, which, though they did not 
underftand, they feemed extremely pleafed with : 
and then, tying the poor creatures hands behind 
them, they (the people) dragged the prifoners into 
the boat for our men. 

The Englijhmen were obliged to come away as 
foon as they had them, or elfe they that gave them 
this noble prefent, would certainly have expefted 
that they fhould haVe gone to work with them, have 
killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 

But, having taken their leave with all the refped 
and thanks that could well pafs between people, w^here, 
on either fide, they underftood not one word they 
could fay, they put off with their boat, and came 
back towards the firft ifland, where, when they ar- 
rived, they fet eight of their prifoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occafion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have fome 
communication with their prifoners, but it was im- 
f offible to make them underftand any thing ; no- 
thing they could fay to them, or give them, or do 
for them, but was looked upon as going about to 
murder them : they firft of all unbound them ; but 
the poor creatures fcreamed at that, efpeclally the 
women, as if they had juft felt the knife at their 
throats ; for they immediately concluded they were 
unbound on purpofe to be killed, 

G2 If 



84 LI^E AND ADVENTURES 

If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the 
fame thing ; then they concluded it was for fear they 
fhould fink in flefh, and fo not be fat enough to kill : 
if they looked at one of them more particularly, 
the party prefently concluded, it was to fee whether 
he or fhe was fatteft and fitteft to kill firft ; nay, 
after they had brought them quite over, and began 
to ufe them kindly, and treat them well, flill they 
expefted every day to make a dinner or fupper for 
their new mafters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac- 
countable hiftory or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard afked them, where their new family was ? 
And being told that they had brought them on fliore, 
and put them into one of their huts, and were come 
to beg fome viftuals for them ; they (the Spaniards) 
and the other two Englijhmen^ that is to fay, the - 
whole colony, refolved to go all down to the place, 
and fee them, and did fo, and Friday^ father with 
them. 

When they came into the hut, there they fat all 
bound : for when they had brought them on fhore, 
they bound their hands, that they might not take 
the boat and make their efcape ; there, I fay, they 
fat, all of them ftark-naked : firft, there were three 
men, lufty, comely fellows, well fliaped, ftrait and 
fair limbs, about 30 or 35 years of age, and five 
women, whereof two might be from 30 to 40, two 
more not above 24 or 25, and the fifth, a tall, comely 
maiden, about 16 or 17 : the women were well fa- 
voured agreeable perfons, both in fliape and features, 
only tawny ; and two of them, had they been per- 

feft 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

fed white, would have paffed for handfome women, 
even in London itfelf, having very pleafant agreeable 
countenances, and of a very modeft behaviour, efpe- 
cially when they came afterv/ards to be clothed, and 
drefled, as they called it, though that drefs was very 
indifferent, it mud be confeifed ; of which here- 
after. 

The fight, you may be fure, was fomething un- 
couth to our Spaniards^ who were (to give them a 
juft charafter) men of the bed behaviour, of the mod 
calm, fedate tempers, and perfect good-humour that 
ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the moft 
modefty, as will prefently appear: I fay the fight 
was very uncouth, to fee three naked men, and five 
naked women, all together bound, and in the moft 
miferable circumftances that human nature could be 
fuppofed to be, vi'z,. to be expefting every moment 
to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked 
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed 
for a dainty. 

The firft thing they did was to caufe the old Indian, 
Fridayh father, to go in, and fee firft if he knevv 
any of them ; and then, if he underftood any of 
their fpeech : as foon as the old man came in, he 
looked fcrioufly at them, but knew none of them ; 
neither could any of them underftand a word he 
faid, or a fign he could make, except one of the 
women. 

However, this was enough to anfwer the end, 
which was to fatisfy them, that the men into whofe 
hands they were fallen, were Chriftians ; that they 
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they 
might be fure they would not be killed : as foon as 

G 3 they 



86 I.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

they were affured of this, they difcovered fuch 
a joy, and by fuch awkward and feveral ways, as is 
hard to defcribe ; for it feems they were of feveral 
nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, 
in the next place, to aik them if they were willing 
to be fervants, and to work for the men who had 
brought them away, to fave their lives ? At which 
they all fell a dancing ; and prefently one fell ta 
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay 
next, to carry on their fhoulders, to intimate, that 
they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women 
among them, would prefently be attended with fome 
inconveniency, and might occalion fome ftrife, and 
perhaps blood, afked the three men, what they in- 
tended to do with thefe women, and how they in- 
tended to ufe them, whether as fervants, or as wo- 
men ? One of the Englijhmen anfwered very boldly 
and readily, that they would ufe them as both. Ta 
■which the governor faid,* I am not going to reftrain 
you from it ; you are your own mafters as to that : 
but this 1 think is but juft, for avoiding diforders and 
quarrels among you, and I defire it of you for that 
reafon only, viz. that you will all engage, that if 
any of you take any of thefe women, as a woman, 
or Wife, he fliall take but one; and that, having 
taken one, none elfe fliould touch her ; for though 
•we cannot mairy any of you, yet it is but reafonable, 
that while you ftay here, the woman any of you 
takes fhould be maintained by the man that takes 
her, and fhould be his wife ; I mean fays he, while 
he continues here j and that nonq elfe Ihould have 

any 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOJZf 87 

siriy thing to do with her. All this appeared fo juft, 
that every one agreed to it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englijhmen afked the Spaniards^ if they 
defigned to take any of them ? But every one an- 
fwered. No : fome of them faid they had wives 
in Spain ; and the others did not like women 
that were not Chriftians ; and altogether declared, 
that they would not touch one of them ; which was 
an inftance of fuch virtue, as I have not met with 
in all my travels ; on the other hand, to be fliort, 
the five Englijhmen took them every one a wife ; 
that is to fay, a temporary wife ; and fo they fet 
up a new form of living ; for the Spaniards and 
Friday % father lived in my old habitation, which 
they had enlarged exceedingly within ; the three 
fervants, which they had taken in the late battle of 
the favages, lived with them ; and thefe carried on 
the main part of the colony, fupplying all the reft 
with food, and affifting them in any thing as they 
could, or as they found neceflity required. 

But the wonder of this flory was, how five fuch 
refraftory, ill-matched fellows fhould agree about 
thefe women, and that two of them Ihould not 
pitch upon the fame woman, efpecially feeing two 
or three of them were, without comparifon, more 
agreeable than the others : but they took a good 
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them* 
felves : for they fet the five women by themfelves 
in one of their huts, and they went all into the 
other hut, and drew lots among them who fhould 
choofe firft. 

He that drew to choofe firfl, went away by him-- 
fclf to the hut, where the poor naked creatures were, 

G 4 and 



88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and fetched out her he chofe ; and it was worth ob^ 
ferving, that he that chofe firft, took her that was 
reckoned the homelieft, and the oldeft of the five, 
which made mirth enough among the reft ; and even 
the Spaniards laughed at it ; but the fellow confi- 
dered better than any of them, that it was applin 
cation and bufmefs that they were to expeft aflift-. 
ance in, as much as any thing elfe ; and flie proved 
the beft wife in the parcel. 

When the poor women faw themfelves in a row 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of 
their condition returned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed, that they were now going to be de-^ 
voured : accordingly, when the Englijh failor came 
in and fetched out one of them, the reft fet up a 
moft lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took 
their leave of her with fuch agonies and fuch afFec^ 
tion, as would have grieved the hardeft heart in the 
world ; nor was it poffible for the Efiglijhmen to 
fatisfy them that they were not to be immediately 
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's 
father, who inftantly let them know, that the five 
men who had fetched them out one by one, had 
chofen them for their wives. 

When they had done this, and the fright the wo- 
men were in was a little over, the men went to 
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them j 
and, in a few hours, they had built them every one 
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; for thofe 
they had already were crowded with their tools, 
houfehold ftufF, and provifions : The three wicked 
ones had pitched fartheft off, and the two honeft 
ones nearer, but both on the north fhore of the 

ifland. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

ifland, fo that they continued feparate as before; 
and thus my ifland was peopled in three places^ 
and, as I might fay, three towns were begun to be 
planted. 

And here it is very w^ell worth obferving, that as 
it often happens in the world (what the wife ends 
of GoD*s providences are in fuch a difpofition of 
things, I cannot fay) the two honeft fellows had the 
two worft wives ; and the three reprobates, that 
were fcarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, 
and neither feemed born to do themfelves good, or 
any one elfe, had three clever, diligent, careful, and 
ingenious wives ; not that the two firft were ill 
wives as to their temper or humour ; for all the five 
were moft willing, quiet, paiSve, and fubjefted 
creatures, rather like flaves than wives ; but my 
meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, 
or induftrious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another obfervation I muft make, to the honour 
of a diligent application on the one hand, and to 
the difgrace of a flothful, negligent, idle temper on 
the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed 
the feveral improvements, planting, and manage- 
ment of the feveral little colonies ; the two men had 
fo far outgone the three, that there was no compa- 
rifon ; they had indeed both of them as much 
ground laid out for corn as they wanted ; and the 
reafon was, becaufe, according to my rule, nature 
diftated, that it was to no purpofe to fow more corn 
than they wanted ; but the difference of the culti- 
vation, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed 
jpvery thing elfe, was eafy to be feen at firft viev/. 

The 



90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
about their huts, that when you came to the place 
nothing was to be feen but a wood ; and though 
they had their plantation twice demolifhed, once by 
their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as 
fliall be fhewn in its place ; yet they had reftoied all 
again, and every thing was flourifhing and thriving 
about them : they had grapes planted in order, and 
managed like a vineyard, though they had theni- 
felves never feen any thing of that kind : and by 
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were 
as good again as any of the others. They had alfo 
formed themfelves a retreat in the thickeft part of 
the woods, where, though there was not a natural 
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with in- 
ceflant labour of their hands, and where, when the 
mifchief which followed happened, they fecured 
their wives and children, fo as they could never bft 
found ; they having, by flicking innumerable flakes 
and poles of the wood, which, as I faid, grew fa 
eafily, made a grove impaflable, except in one place, 
where they climbed up to get over the outfide party 
and then went in by ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I juftly call them, 
though they were much civilized by their new. fet- 
tlement, compared to what they were before, and 
were not fo quarrelfome, having not the fame oppor- 
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a pro- 
flio-ate mind never left them, and that was their idle- 
nefs : It is true, they planted corn, and made fences; 
but Solomon's w^ords v/ere never better verified than 
in them : " I v/ent by the vineyard of the f-othful,.

the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could 
not fee it in fome places for weeds ; the hedge had 
feveral gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten 
In, and eaten up the corn ; perhaps here and there 
a dead bufli was crammed in, to flop them out for 
the prefent, but it was only fhutting the ftable door 
after the fteed was ftolen ; whereas, when they 
looked on the colony of the other two, there was 
the very face of induftry and fuccefs upon all they 
did ; there was not a weed to be feen in all their 
corn, or a gap in any of their hedges ; and they, on 
the other hand, verified Solomon^s words in another 
place : " The diligent hand maketh rich ;'* for 
every thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty 
within and without ; they had more tame cattle than 
the others, more utenfils and neceffaries within doors, 
and yet more pleafure and diverfion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors ; and having learned the 
Englijh ways of drefEng and cooking from one of 
the other EngUjhmen^ who, as I faid, was a cook's 
mate on board the Ihip, they dreifed their hufbands 
viduals very nicely ; whereas the other could not be 
brought to underfland it ; but then the hufband, 
who, as I faid, had been cook's mate, did it him- 
felf ; but, as for the hufbands of the three wives, 
they loitered about, fetched turtles eggs, and caught 
fifli and birds : in a word, any thing but labour ; 
and they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well 
and comfortably ; and the flothful lived hard and 
beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it is 
ftll over the world* 



But 



92 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But now I come to a fcene different from all that 
had happened before, either to them or me ; and the 
origin of the ftory was this : 

Early one morning there came on fhore five or 
fix canoes of Ltdia?iSj or favages, call them which 
you pleafe ; and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 
flaves ; but that part was now fo familiar to the 
Spaniards^ and to our men too, that they did not 
concern themfelves about it, as I did ; but, having 
been made fenfible by their experience, that their 
only bufmefs was to lie concealed, and that, if 
they were not feen by any of the favages, they would 
go off again quietly, when their bufinefs was done, 
having as yet not the leaft notion of there being 
any inhabitants in the ifland ; I fay, having been 
made fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to 
give notice to all the three plantations to keep with- 
in doors, and not to fliew themfelves ; only placing a 
fcout in a proper place, to give notice when'th^ boat§ 
went off" to fea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a dif- 
after fpoiled all thefe meafures, and made it known 
among the favages, that there were inhabitants 
there'; which was, in the end, the defolation of 
almoft the whole colony. After the canoes with 
the favages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped 
abroad again, and fome of them had the curiofity 
to go to the place where they had been, to fee what 
they had been doing. Here, to their great furprife, 
they found three favages left behind, and lying faft 
afleep upon the ground ; it was fuppofed they had 
either been fo gorged with their inhuman feaft, that, 

likQ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

like beafts, they were afleep, and would not ftir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the 
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken 
in. 

The Spaniards v/ere greatly furprifed at this fight, 
and perfeftly at a lofs What do ; the Spaniard go- 
vernor, as it happened, was with them, and his ad- 
vice was afked ; but he profeffed he knew not what 
to do ; as for flaves, they had enough already ; and 
as to killing them, they were none of them inclined 
to that ; the Spaniard governor told me they could 
not think of fhedding innocent blood ; for as to 
them, the poor creatures had done no wrong, in- 
vaded none of cheir property ; and tbey thought 
they had no juft quarrel againft them to take away 
their lives. 

And here I muft, in juftice to thefe Spaniards ^ 
obferve, that let all the accounts of Spanijh cruelty 
in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met 
with feventeen men, of any nation whatfoever, in any 
foreign country, who were fo univerfally modeft, tem- 
perate, virtuous, fo very good-humoured, and fo 
courteous, as thefe Spaniards ; and, as to cruelty, 
they had nothing of it in their very nature ; no in- 
humanity, no barbarity, no outrageous paffions, and 
yet all of them men of great courage and fpirit. 

Their temper and calmnefs had appeared in their 
bearing the.infufFerable ufage of the three Englijh* 
men ; and their juftice and humanity appeared now 
in the cafe of the favages, as above : after fome con- 
fultation, they refolved upon this, that they would 
lie ftill, awhile longer, till, if poffible, thefe three 
men might be gone j but then the governor Spa-^

T^/^^r^/recolIefted, that the three favages had no boat } 
and that, if they were left to rove about the ifland, 
they would certainly difcover that there were inha- 
bitants in it, and fo they fhould be undone that 
way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fall afleep ftill; fo they refolved to 
awaken them, and take them prifoners ; and they did 
fo : the poor fellows were ftrangely frighted when 
they were feized upon and bound, and afraid, like 
the women^ that they Ihould be murdered and eaten ; 
for, it feems, thofe people think all the world do 
as they do, eating men's flefh ; but they were foon 
made eafy as to that ; and away they carried them. 

It was very happy for them, that they did not 
carry them home to their caftle ; I mean to my pa- 
lace under the hill j but they carried them firft to 
the bower, where was the chief of their country 
work ; fuch as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the corn, &c. and afterwards they carried them to 
the habitation of the two Englifhrnen. 

Here they were fet to work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do : and whether it was 
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought 
the fellows could not mend themfelves, I know not, 
but one of them ran away ; and, taking into the 
woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reafon to believe hfe got home 
again foon after in fome other boats or canoes of 
favages, who came on Ihore three or four weeks af- 
terwards, and who, carrying on their revels as ufual, 
went off again in two days time : this thought ter- 
rified them exceedingly j for they concluded, and 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. g^ 

that not without good caufe Indeed, that if this fel- 
low got fafe home among his comrades, he would 
certainly give them an account that there were peo- 
ple in the ifland, as alfo how weak and few they were j 
for this favage, as I obferved before, had never been 
told, as it was very happy he had not, how many 
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever feen 
or heard the fire of any of their guns, much lefs 
had they fhewn him any other of their retired 
places, fuch as the cave in the valley, or the new 
retreat which the two Englijhmen had made, and 
the like. 

The firft teftimony they had, that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that about two 
months after this, fix canoes of favages, with about 
feven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing 
along the north-fide of the ifland, where they never 
ufed to come before, and landed about an hour after 
fun-rife, at a convenient place, about a mile from 
the habitation of the two Englijhmen^ where this 
efcaped man had been kept : as the Spaniard go- 
vernor faid, had they been all there, the damage 
would not have been fo much, for not a man of 
them would have efcaped : but the.cafe differed now 
very much; for two men to fifty were too much 
odds : the two men had the happinefs to difcover 
them about a league off, fo that it was above an hour 
before they landed ; and as they landed about a mile 
itom their huts, it was fome time before they could 
come at them. Now having great reafon to believe 
that they were betrayed, the firft thing they did was 
to bind the flaves which Were left, and caufe two of 
die three men, whom they brought with the women, 

who. 



g6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

who, It feems, proved very faithful to them, to leacf 
them with their two uives, and whatever they could 
carry away with them, to their retired place in the 
woods, which! have fpoken of above, and there to 
bind' the two fellows hand and foot till they heard 
farther. 

In the next place, feeing the favages were all 
come on fhore, and .that they bent their courfe di- 
redly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav- 
ing their goats to draggle into the wood, whither 
they pleafed, that the favages might think they were 
all bred wild; but the rogue who camewhh thenx 
was too cunning for that, and gave them an ac* 
count of it all ; for they went direftly to the place. 
• When the poor frighted men had fecured their 
wives and goods, they fent the other flave they had 
of the three, who came with the women, and who 
v;as at their place by accident, away to the S/^- 
77 iards with all fpeed, to give them the alarm,, and 
defire fpeedy help ; and in the mean time they took 
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and 
retreated towards the place in the wood where their 
wives were fent, keeping at a diflance ; yet fo that 
they might fee, if poflible, which way the fevages 
took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing. 
ground, they could fee the little army of their ene- 
mies come on direftly to their habitation, and in a 
moment more could fee all their huts and houfehold- 
fluff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortiiication ; for they had a very great lofs, and 
to them irretrievable, at leaft for fome time. They

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9/ 

kept their ftation for awhile, till they found the fa- 
vages, like wild beafts, fpread themfelves all over the 
place, rummaging every way, and every place they 
could think of, in fearch for prey ; and, in particu- 
lar, for the people, of whom it plainly appeared they 
had intelligence. 

The twoEnglifhmen feeing this, thinking them- 
felves not fecure where they flood, as it was likely 
fome of the wild people might come that way, fo 
they might come too many together, thought it pro- 
per to make another retreat about half a mile far- 
ther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the 
farther they ftroUed, the fewer would be together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tree flood, which was hollow, and vaftly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their ftanding, 
refolving to fee what might oflFer. 

They had not flood there long, but two of the 
favages appeared running direftly that way, as if 
they had already notice where they flood, and were 
coming up to attack them ; and a little way farther 
they efpied three more coming after them, and five 
more beyond them, all coming the fame way ; be- 
fides which, they faw feven or eight more at a dif-, 
tance, running another way ; for, in a word, they 
ran every way, like fportfmen beating for their 
game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe- 
ther they fliould ftand, and keep their pofture, or 
fly ; but after a very fliort debate with themfelves, 
they confidered, that if the favages ranged the coun- 
try thus, before help came, they inight, perhaps. 

Vol. IL H find 



98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

find out their retreat in the woods, and then all 
would be loft ; fo they refolved to ftand them there ; 
and if there were too many to deal with, then they 
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they 
doubted not to defend themfelves, fire excepted, as 
long as their ammunition lafted, though all the fa- 
vages that were landed, which were near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having refolved upon this, they next confidered 
whether they fhould fire at the two firft, or wait for 
the three, and fo take the middle party ; by which 
the two and the five that followed would be fepa- 
rated ; at length they refolved to let the two firft 
pafs by, unlefs they fliould fpy them in the tree, and 
come to attack them. The two firft favages alfo 
confirmed them in this refolution, by turning a little 
from them towards another part of the wood ; but 
the three, and the five after them, came forwards 
direftly to the tree, as if they had known the Eng- 
lifhmen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftraight towards them, they 
refolved to take them in a line as they came ; and 
as they refolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps 
the firft fhot might hit them all three j to which 
purpofe, the man who was to fire, put three or 
four bullets into his piece, and having a fair loop- 
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he 
took a fure aim, without being feen, waiting till they 
were within about thirty yards of the tree, fo that 
he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waitiag, and the favages 
came on, they plainly faw, that one of the three 
was the run-away favage that had efcaped from 

them. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

them, and they both knew him diflin<9:ly, and re- 
folved, that, if poffible, he fhould not efcape, though 
they fhould both fire ; fo the other flood ready with 
his piece, that if he did not drop at the firfl fhot, he 
fliould be fure to have a fecond. 

But the firft was too good a markfman to mifs his 
aim; for, as the favages kept near one another, a 
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit 
two of them direftly: the foremofl was killed out- 
right, being fhot in the head ; the fecond, which 
was the run-away Indian, was fhot through the 
body, and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the 
third had a little fcratch in the fhoulder, perhaps by 
the fame ball that went through the body of the fe- 
cond j and being dreadfully frighted, though not 
much hurt, fat down upon the ground, fcreaming 
and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noife than fenfible of their danger, flood flill at 
firfl ; for the woods made the found a thoufand times 
bigger than it really was ; the echoes rattling from 
one fide to another, and the fowls rifing from all 
parts, fcreaming and making, every fort, a feveral 
kind of noife, according to their kind, jufl as it was 
when I fired the firfl gun that, perhaps, was ever 
fhot off in that place fince it was an ifland. 

However, all being filent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, 
till they came to that place where their companions 
lay, in a condition miferable enough ; and here the 
poor Ignorant creatures, not fenfible that they were 
within reach of the fame mifchief, flood all of a 
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may 

Ha be 



TOO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

be fuppofed, enquiring of him how he came to be 
hurt ; and who, 'tis very rational to believe, told 
them that a flafli of fire firft, and immediately after 
that, thunder from their gods, had killed thofe two, 
and wounded him : This, I fay, is rational ; for no- 
thing is more certain than that, as they faw no man 
near them, fo they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or fo much as heard of a gun ; neither knew 
they any thing of killing or wounding at a diftance, 
with jfare and bullets ; if they had, one might rea- 
fonably believe, that they would not have flood 
fo unconcerned, in viewing the fate of their fel- 
lows, without fome apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confeffed to me, 
it grieved them to be obliged to kill fo many poor 
creatures, who at the fame time had no notion of 
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their 
power, and the firft having loaded his piece again, 
refolved to let fly both together among them ; and 
fingling out by agreement which to aim at, they fhot 
together, and killed, or very much AVounded, four 
of them ; the fifth, frighted even to death, though 
not hurt, fell with the reft ; fo that our men, feeing 
them all fall together, thought they had killed them 
all. 

The belief that the favages were all killed, made 
our two men Come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong ftep; and they were under fome furprife, 
when they came to the place, and found no lefs than 
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little 
hurt, and one not at all : this obliged them to fall - 
upon them with the ftocks of their mufquets ; and 

firft. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOI 

firfl, they made fure of the run away favage, that 
had been the caufe of all the mifchief ; and of ano- 
ther that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of 
their pain ; then the man that was not hurt at all 
came and kneeled down to them, with his two hands 
held up, and made piteous moan to them by gef- 
tures and figns, for his life ; but could not fay one 
word to them that they could underftand. 

However, they fignified to him to fit down at the 
foot of a tree thereby j and one of the Englijhmeriy 
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his feet faft together, and 
his hands behind him, ^ and there they left him ; and, 
with what fpeed they could, made after the other 
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any 
more of them, fhould find the way to their covered 
place in the woods, "where their wives, and the few 
goods they had left lay : they came once in fight of 
the two men, but it was at a great diftance ; how- 
ever, they had the fatisfaftion to fee them crofs over 
a valley, towards the fea, the quite contrary way 
from that which led to' their retreat, which they were 
afraid of ; and, being fatisfied with that, they went 
back to the tree where they left their prifoner, who 
as they fuppofed, was delivered by his comrades ; for 
he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with 
which they had bound him, lay juft at the foot of 
the tree. 

They were now in as great a concern as before, 
not knowing what courfe to take, or how near the 
^nemy might be, or in what numbers j fo they re- 
folved to go away to the place where their wives 
were, to fee if all was well there, and to make them

eafy, who were in fright enough to be fure ; for 
though the favages were their own country folks, yet 
they were moft terribly afraid of them, and perhaps 
the more, for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came thither, they found the favages 
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but 
had not found it ; for indeed, it was inacceffible, by 
the trees (landing fo thick, as before, unlefs the per- 
fons feeking it had been direfted by thofe that knew 
it, which thefe were not ; they found, therefore^ 
every thing very fafe, only the women in a terrible 
fright ; while they were here, they had the comfort 
of feven of the Spaniards coming to their afliftance ; 
the other ten, with their fervants, and old Friday^ 
I mean Friday^ father, were gone in a body to de- 
fend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were 
kept there, 'in cafe the favages fhould have roved 
over to that fide of the country ; but they did not 
fpread fo far. With the feven Spaniards came one of 
the favages, who, as I faid, were their prifoners for- 
merly, and with them alfo came the favage whom 
the Englijhmen had left bound hand and foot at the 
tree ; for it feems they came that way, faw the 
ilaughter of the feven men, and unbound the eighth, 
and brought him along with them, where, however, 
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had 
done the two others, who were left when the third 
ran away. 

The prifoners began now to be a burden to them ; 
and they were fo afraid of their efcaping, that they 
thought they were under an abfolute neceffity to 
kill them for their own prefervation : however, the 
Spaniard governor would not confent to it j but or- 
dered, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOj 

dered, that they fhould be fent out of the way to 
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with 
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food : 
which was done ; and they were bound there hand 
and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englijhmen 
were fo encouraged, that they could not fatisfy 
themfelves to flay any longer there ; but taldng five 
of the Spaniards^ and themfelves, with four muf- 
quets and a piftol among them, and two flout quar- 
ter flaves, away they went in quefl of the favages ; 
and firfl, they came to the tree where the men lay 
that had been killed ; but it was eafy to fee, that 
Ibme more of the favages had been there ; for they 
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had 
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it 
over ; from thence they advanced to tlfc firfl rifing 
ground, where they had flood and feen their camp 
deflroyed, and where they had the mortification flill 
to fee fome of the fmoke ; but neither could they 
here fee any of the favages : they then refolved, 
though with all polFible caution, to go forward to- 
wards their ruined plantation: but a little before 
they came thither, coming in fight of the fea fhore, 
they faw plainly the favages all embarking again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They feemed forry at firfl that there was no way 
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but 
upon the whole, were very well fatisfied to be rid of 
them. 

The poor Englijhmen being now twice ruined, and 

all their improvements deflroyed, the refl all agreed 

H4 to 



104 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to come and help them to rebuild, and to affift them 
with needful fupplies. Their three countrymen, 
who were not yet noted for having the leaft inclina- 
tion to do any thing good, yet, as foon as they heard 
of it (for they, living remote,' knew nothing till all 
was over) came and offered their help and affiftance, 
and did very friendly work for feveral days, to reftore 
their habitations, and make neceffaries for them j and 
thus, in a little time, they were fet upon their legs 
again. 

About two days after this, they had the farther fa- 
tisfadtion of feeing three of the favages canoes come 
driving on fliore, and^ at fome diftance from them, 
with two drowned men ; by which they had reafon 
to believe, that they had met with a ftorm at fea, and 
had over-fet fome of them ; for it blew very hard 
the night after they went oflF. 

However, as fome might mifcarry, . fo on the 
other hand, enough of them efcaped to intbrm the 
reft, as well of what they had done, as of what hap- 
pened to them ; and to whet them on to another en- 
terprife of the fame nature, which they, it feems, 
refolved to attempt, with fufEcient force to carry all 
before them ; for, except what the firft man had told 
them of inhabitants, they could fay little to it of 
their own knowledge ; for they never faw one man, 
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they 
had no other witnefs to confirm it to them. 

It was five or fix months after this, before they 
heard any more of the favages, in which time our 
men were in hopes they had not forgot their former^ 
bad luck, or had given over the hopes of b|tter ; 
when, on a fudden, they were invaded with a moft 

formi- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I05 

formidable fleet, of no lefs than twenty-eight canoes, 
full of favages, armed with bows and arrov/s, great 
clubs, wooden fwords, and fuch like engines of 
war ; and they brought fuch numbers with them, 
that, in (hort, it put all our. people into the utmoft 
confternation. 

As they came on fhore in the evening, and at the 
eaftermoft fide of the ifland, our men had that night 
to confult and confider what to do ; and, in the firft 
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed 
was their only fafety before, and would much more 
be fo now, while the number of their enemies was 
fo great, they therefore refolved, firft of all, to take 
down the huts which were built for the two Englijh^ 
men^ and drive away their goats to the old cave ; 
becaufe they fuppofed the favages would go direftly 
thither, as foon as it was day, to play the old game 
over again, though they did not now land within 
two leagues of it. 

In the next place, they drove away all the flock of 
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which 
belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in fhort, left as 
little appearance of inhabitants any where as poflible ; 
and the next morning early they ported themfelves 
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, 
waiting for their coming. As they guefled, fo it 
happened ; thefe new invaders, leaving their canoes 
at the eaft end of the ifland, came ranging along the 
fhore, diredly towards the place, to the number of 
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but fmall indeed ; but, that 
which was worfe, they had not arms for all their

To their flaves they did not give either mufquet 
or fufil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long 
flafF, like a quarter flafF, with a great fpike of iron 
fattened into each end of it, and by his fide a hatchet ; 
alfo every one of our men had hatchets. Two of 
the women could not be prevailed upon, but they 
would come into the fight ; and they had bows and 
arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the fa- 
vages, when the firfl action happened, which I have 

fpokea 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

fpoken of, where the Indians fought with one ano- 
ther, and the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I have defcribed 
fo often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkins^ 
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickednefs, was a 
mod daring bold fellow, commanded under him. 
The favages came forward like lions, and our men, 
which was the worft of their fate, had no advan- 
tage in their fituation ; only that Will AikiiiSj who 
now proved a moft ufeful fellow, with fix men, was 
planted juft behind a fmall thicket of buflies, as an 
advanced guard, with orders to let the firft of them 
pafs by, and then fire into the middle of them ; and, 
as foon as he had fired, to make his retreat, as nim- 
bly as he could, round a part of the wood, and fo 
come in behind the Spaniards where they flood, 
.having a thicket of trees all before them. 

When the favages came on, they ran flraggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or- 
der ; and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by 
him ; then, feeing the refl come in a very thick 
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having 
loaded their mufquets with fix or feven bullets a- 
piece, about as big as large piftol bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded, they knew not ; but 
the conflernation and furprife was inexpreflible among 
the favages, who were frighted to the lafl degree, to 
hear fuch a dreadful noife, and fee their men killed, 
and others hurt, but fee nobody that did it ; when 
in the middle of their fright, William Atkins^ and 
his other three, let fly again among the thickefl of 
them ; and in lefs than a minute, the firfl three, 
being loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had 



Io8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Had William Atkins and his men retired immedr- 
ately, as foon as they had fired, as they were or- 
dered to dp ; or had the reft: of the body been at 
hand, to have poured in their fhot continually, the 
favages had been efFeftually routed ; for the terror 
that was among them came principally from this ; 
viz. That they were killed by the Gods with thun- 
der and lightning, and could fee nobody that hurt 
them ; but William Atkins^ ftaying to load again, 
difcovered the cheat ; fome of the favages, who were 
at a diftance, fpying'them, came upon them behind ; 
and though Atkins and his men fired at them alfo, 
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir- 
ing as faft as they could, yet they^r wounded Atkins 
himfelf, and killed one of his fellow Engllfhtnen with 
their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard^ 
and one of the Indian flaves who came with the wo- 
men ; this flave was a mofl: gallant fellow, and fought 
moll defperately, killing fi^e of them with his owa 
hand, having no weapon but one of the armed^* 
ftaves, and an hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound- 
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rifing 
ground in the wood ; and the Spafiiards^ after firing 
three vollies upon them, retreated alfo ; for their 
number was fo great, and they were fo defperate, 
that though above fifty of them were killed, and 
more than fo many wounded, yet they came on in 
the teeth of our men, fearlefs of danger, and fhot 
their arrows like a cloud ; and it was obferved, that 
their wounded men, who were not quite difabled, 
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought 
like madmen. 

When 



OF &OBIKSON CRUSOE. I09 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englijhmariy that were killed, behind them ; 
and the favages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs, and 
wooden fwords, like true favages : But, finding our 
men were gone, they did not feem inclined to purfue 
them,, but drew themfelves up in a kind of a ring, 
which is, it feems, their cuftom ; and fhouted twice, 
in token of their vidory ; after which, they had the 
mortification to fee feveral of their wounded men 
fall, dying with the mere lofs of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together, upon a rifing ground, Atkins^ 
though he was wounded, would have had him march- 
ed, and charged them again all together at once ; but 
the Spaniard replied. Seignior Atkins^ you fee how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morn- 
ing; all thefe wounded men will be ftiff and fore 
with their wounds, and faint with the lofs of blood ; 
and fo we fhall have the fewer to engage. 

The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied 
merrily. That's true. Seignior^ and fo fhall I too ; 
and that's the reafon I would go on, while I am 
warm. Well, Seignior Atkins^ fays the Spaniard^ 
you have behaved gallantly, and done your part ; we 
will fight for you, if you cannot come on; but I 
think it beft to (lay till morning : fo they waited. 

But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they 
found the favages in great diforder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noife 
among them where they lay, they afterwards refolved 
to fall upon them in the night, efpecially if they 

could

could come to give them but one volley before they 
were difcovered. This they had a fair opportunity 
to do J for one of the two EngUJhmen^ in whofe 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round 
between the woods and the fea-fide, weft ward, and 
turning fhort fouth, they came fo near where the 
thickeft of them lay, that before they were feen or 
heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did 
dreadful execution upon them ; in half a minute 
more eight others fired after them, pouring in their 
fmall (hot in fuch a quantity, that abundance were 
killed and wounded ; and all this while they were 
not able to fee who hurt them, or which way to 

The Spaniards charged again, v/ith the utmoft ex- 
pedition, and then divided themfelves into three 
bodies, and refolvcd to fall in among them all toge- 
ther : they had in each body eight perfons ; that is 
to fay, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men, 
and the two women, who, by the way, fought def- 
perately. 

They divided the fire-arms equally In each party, 
and fo of the halberts and ftaves. They would have 
had the women keep back ; but they faid, they were 
refolved to die with their hufbands. Having thus 
ormed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the 
enemy, fhouting and hallooing as loud as they could; 
the favages ftood all together, but were in the utmoft 
confufion, hearing the noife of our men ftiouting 
from three quarters together; they would have 
fought if they had feen us ; and, as foon as we 
came near enough to be feen, fome arrows were

fliot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not 
dangeroufly. But our men gave them no time ; 
but, running up to them, fired among them three 
ways, and then fell in with the but-ends of their 
mufquets, their fwords, armed ftaves, and hatchets ; 
and laid about them fo well, that, in a word, they 
fet up a difmal fcreaming and howling, flying to fave 
their lives which way foever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about 
1 80 of them J the reft, being frighted out of their 
wits, fcoured through the woods, and over the 
hills, with all the fpeed that fear and nimble feet 
could help them to do ; and as we did not trouble 
ourfelves much to purfue them, they got all together 
to the fea-fide, where they landed, and where their 
canoes lay. But their difafter was not at an end 
yet ; for it blew a terrible ftorm of wind that even- 
ing from the fea-ward ; fo that it was impolTiblc for 
them to put off; nay, the ftorm continuing all night, 
when the tide came up, their canoes were moft of 
them driven by the furge of the fea fo high upon the 
Ihore, that it required infinite toil to get them off ; 
and fome of them were even daflied to pieces againft 
the beach, or againft one another. 

Our men, though glad of their viftory, yet got 
little reft that night ; but having refreflied themfelves 
as well as they could, they reiblved to march to that 
part of the ifland where the favages were fled, and 
fee what pofture they were in. This neceffarily led 
them over the place where the fight had been, and 
where they found feveral of the poor creatures not 
quite dead, and yet paft recovering life ; a fight dif- 

agreeable 



112 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

agreeable enough to generous minds ; for a truly 
great man, though obliged by the law of battle to 
deftroy his enemy, takes no delight in his mifery. 

However, there was no need to give any order In 
this cafe ; for their own favages, who were their fer. 
vants, difpatched thofe poor creatures with their 
hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miferable remains of the favages* army lay, 
where there appeared about too ftill ; their pofture 
was generally fitting upon the ground, with their 
knees up towards their mouth, and the head put be- 
tween the hands, leaning down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two mufquet Ihot of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mufquets 
to be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, 
that by their countenance he might know what to ex- 
peft, viz. Whether they were ftill in heart to fight, 
or were fo heartily beaten, as to be difpirited and dif • 
couraged, and fo he might manage accordingly. 

This ftratagem took ; for, as foon as the favages 
heard the firft gun, and faw the flafh of the fecond, 
they ftarted up upon their feet in the greateft con- 
fternation imaginable ; and, as our men advanced 
fwiftly towards them, they all ran fcreaming and 
yav/ling away, with a kind of an howling noife, 
which our men did not underftand, and had never 
heard before ; and thus they ran up the hills into the 
country. 

At firft, our men had much rather the weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to fea ; but 
they did not then confider, that this might probably 
have been the occafion of their coming again in fuch

multitudes as not to be refifted j or, at leaft, td 
come fo many and fo often, as would quite defolate 
the ifland, and ftarve them : Will Atkins therefore^ 
who, notwithftanding his wound, kept always with 
them, proved the beft counfellor in this cafe : his 
kdvice was, to take the advantage that offered, and 
dap in bet^ireen them and their boats, and fo deprive 
themi of the capacity of eVer returning any more to 
plague the ifland, 

- They confulted long about this, and fome were 
ttgainft it, for fear of making the wretches fly into 
the woods, and live there defperate ; and fo they 
flibuld have them to hunt like wild beaflis, be afraid 
to {lir about their bufinefs, and have their plantation 
continually rifled, all their tame goats deflroyed, 
iand, in Ihortj be reduced to a life of continual 
diftrefs. 

.Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do 
IjHth ioo men, than with loo nations ; that as they 
miift. deftroy their boats, fo they muft deftroy the 
men, or be all of them deftroyed themfelves* In a 
trord, he fliewed them the neceflity of it fo plainly, 
that they all came into it ; fo they went t6 work im- 
mediately with the boats, and, getting fome dry 
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to kt 
fome of them on fire ; but they were fo wet, that 
they would fcarce burn. However, the fire fo burned 
the upper part, that it fooli made them unfit for 
fwimming in the fea as boats. When the Indians faw 
what they were about, fome of them came running 
out of the woods ; and coming as near as they could 
to our men, kneeled down and cried, 0^, 0^, Wa- 
Vol. II. I ramokoa^ 



114 Lll'E AND ADVENTURES 

ramokoa^ and fome other words of their language, 
which none of the others underftood any thing of j 
but as they made pitiful geftures, and ftrange noifes, 
it was eafy to underftand they begged to have their 
boats fpared, and that they would be gone, and ne- 
ver return thither again. 

But our men were now fatisfied, that they had no 
way to preferve themfelves, or to fave their colony, 
but eflfeaually to prevent any of thefe people from 
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that 
if ever fo much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the ftory, the colony was undone ; fo 
that, letting them know that they fhould not have 
any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and 
deftroyed them every one that the ftorm had not de- 
ftroyed before ; at the fight of which, the favages 
raifed a hideous cry in the woods, which our people 
heard plain enough ; after which they ran about the 
ifland like diftraOied men ; fo that, in a word, our 
men did not really know at firft what to do with 
them. 

Nor did the Spaniards^ with all their prudence, 
confider that while they made thofe people thus def- 
perate, they ought to have kept good guard at the 
fame time upon their plantations ; for though it is 
true they had driven away their cattle, and the i»- 
dians did not find their main retreat, I mean my old 
caftle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley ; yet 
they found out my plantation at the bower, and 
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant- 
ing about it J trod all the corn under foot ; tore up 
the vines and grapes, being juft then almoft ripe ; 
and did our men an ineftimable damage, though, 

to 



of ROBitisoNr dft^usoE. 115 

to themfelves, not one farthing's wortli bf fer- 
vice. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all 
occafions, yet they were in no condition to purfue 
them, or hunt them up and down ; for as they were 
two nimble of foot for our men when they found 
them fingle, fo our men durft not go about fingle, 
for fear of being furrounded with their numbers ; 
the bed was, they had no weapons ; for though they 
had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any mate- 
rials to make any, nor had they any edged tool or 
weapon among them. 

The extremity and diftrefs they were reduced to 
-was great, and indeed deplorable, but at l:he fame 
time our men were klfo brought to very hard cir- 
cumftances by them ; for though their retreats were 
preferved, yet their provifion was deftroyed, and 
their harveft fpoiled ; and what to do, or which way 
to turn themfelves, they knew not ; the only refuge 
they had now was, the flock of cattle they had in the 
valley by the cave, and fome little corn which grew 
there. The three Englijhmen^ William Atkins and 
his comrades, were now reduced to two, one of 
them being killed by an arrqwi'.ayhich ftruck him 
on the fide of his head*,'' juft under the temples, fo 
that he never fpoke more ; and it was very remark* 
abk, that this was the fame barbarous fellow who 
cut the poor favage i|a^ .with his hatchet, and who 
afterwards inten4itl* to have murdered the Sfa^ 
niards. 

I looked upon their cafe to have been worfe at this 
time than mine was at any time after I firft difco- 
vered the grains of barley and rice, and got into the - 

1 2 method

method of planting and raifing my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may fay, s^ 
hundred wolves upon the ifland, which would de- 
vour every thing they could come at, yet could be* 
very hardly come at themfelves. 

The firft thing they concluded, when they faw 
what their circumftances were, was, that they would^ 
if poffible, drive them up to the farther part of the 
ifland, fouth^eaft, that if any more favages came oi^ 
ihore, they might not find one another ; then, that 
they would daily hunt and harrafs them^ and kill a» 
many of them as they iould come at, till they had 
reduced their number ; and if they could at laft tame 
them, and bring them to any thing, they would 
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and 
live upon their daily labour. 

In order to this, they followed them, and fo ter^' 
rifled them with their guns, that in a few days, if 
any of them fired a gun at an Indian^ if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall clown for fear ; and fa 
dreadfully frighted they were,, that they kept out of 
fight farther and farther, till at laft our men follow- 
ing them, and every day almoft killing and wound- 
ing fome of them, they kept up in the woods and 
hollow places fo much, that it reduced them to the 
utmoft mifery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hurt, but merely ftarved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their heart??; 
relent, and pity moved them ; efpecially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the moft gentleman-like, gene- 
rous minded man that ever I met with in my life ; 
and he propofed, if poffible, to take one of them 

alive.

fo far as to be able to afl: as interpreter, and to go

fome conditions, that might be depended upon, to

It was fome time before any of them could be 
taken; but being weak, and half-ftaryed, one of 
them was at laft furprifed, and made a prifoner ; he 
was fuUen at firft, a^d would neither eat nor drink ; 
but finding himfelf kindly ufed, and viduals given 
him, and no violence offered him, he at laft grew 
jtraclable^ and came to himfelf. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked of- 
ten with him, and told him how kiiid the others 
would be to them all ; that they would not only fave 
their lives, but would give them apart of the ifland 
to live in^ provided they would give fatisfaftion ; 
4iiat they fhould keep in their own bounds, and not 
come beyond them, to injure or prejudice others ; 
and that they fhould have corn giv^nthem, to plant 
and make it grow for their br^ad, and Ibme bread 
given them for their prefent fubfiftence ; and old 
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the reft of 
his countrymen, and hear what they faid to it ; afr 
furing them, that if they did not agree immediately 
they fhould all be deftrpyed. 

The poor wretches^ thoroughly humbled^ and rcr 
duced in number to about thirty-feven, clofed with 
the propofal at the firft offer-, and begged to have 
jfome food given them ; upon which twelve Spaniards 
and two Englijhmenj well armed, and three Indian

large quantity of bread, and fome rice boiled up to 
cakes, and dried in the fun, and three live goats ; 
»nd they were ordered to go to the fide of an hill, 
where they fat down, eat the provifions very thank- 
fully, and were the moft faithful fellows to their 
words that could be thought of; for, except when 
they came to beg viduals and diredions, they never 
came out of their bounds ; and there they lived when 
I came to the ifland, and I went to fee them- 

They had taught them both to plant corn, make 
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they want- 
ed nothing but wives, and they foon would have 
been a nation : they were confined to a neck of land, 
furrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying 
plain towards the fea before theni, on the fouth-eaft 
corner of the ifland j they had land enough, a^nd it 
was very good and fruitful ; for they had a piece of 
land about a mile and a hg^lf broad, and three or 
four miles in length. 

Our men taught th^m to make wooden fpades, 
fuch as I made for myfelf ; and gave among them. 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives j and there 
they lived the moft fubjefted innocent creatuies that 
were ever heard of» » 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfefl: tranquillity, 
with refpeO: to the favages, till I came to re-vifit them, 
which was in about two year3 ; not but that now 
^nd then fome canons of favages came on fhore for 
their triumphal, unnatural feafts ; but as they w^re 
of fevers^l nations, and, perhaps, had never heard 
of thofe that came before, or the r^afon of it, they 
did npt inake any f(?arch or enquiry after their country-

men ; and if they had, it would have been very hard 
for them to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all 
that happened to them, to my return, at lead, that 
was worth notice. The Indians^ or favages, were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went amdng them; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any of the Indians coming to them, becaufe they 
would not have their fettlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they 
taught the favages to make wicker-work, or bafkets ; 
but they foon out-did their mafters ; for they made 
abundance of moft ingenious things in wicker-work j 
particularly, all forts of balkets, fieves, bird cages, 
cup-boards, &c. as alfo chairs to fit on, ftools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things, being very 
ingenious at fuch work, when they were once put in 
the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to thefe people, 
becaufe we furnifhed them with knives, fciffars, fpades, 
Ihovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which 
they could want. 

With the help of thefe tools they were fo very 
handy, that they came, at laft, to build up their huts, 
or houfes, very handfomely ; raddling, or working 
it up like bafket-work all the way round, which was 
a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd ; but was an exceeding good fence, as well 
againft heat, as againft all forts of vermin ; and our 
men were fo taken with it, that they got the wild fa- 
vages to come and do the like for them ; fo that when 
V came to fee the two EngHjhmen\ colonies, they 
looked, at a diflance, as if they lived all like bees in 
I 4 a hive j

a hive j and as for Will Atk'ms^ who was now be« 
come a very induftrious, neceffary, andfober fellow, 
he had made himfelf fuch a tent of baflvet-work, as 
I believe was never feen, It was 120 paces round on 
the outfi4e, as I meafured by my fteps j the walls 
were as clofe worked as a bafket, Jn pannels ox 
fquares, thirty-two in number, and very ftrong, Hand- 
ing about feven feet high : in the middle was ano- 
ther not above 22 paces round, but built ftronger^ 
being eight fquare in ity form, and in the eight cor- 
ners flood eight very ftrong pofts, round the top of 
which he laid ftrong pieces, joined together with 
wooden pins, from which h^ raifed a pyramid before 
the roof of eight rafters, very handfome, I aifure 
you, and joined together very well, though he had 
no nails, and only a few iron fpikes, which he had 
made himfelf too, out of the old iron that I had left 
there ; and, indeed, this fellow ihewed abundance 
of ingenuity in feveral things which he had no know^ 
ledge of; he niade himfelf a forge, with a pair of 
wooden bellows to blow the fire ; h»t made himfelf 
charcoal for his work, and he formed out of one of 
the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer up- 
on ; in this manner he made many things, but efpe- 
cially hooks, ftaples and fpikes, bolts and" hinges. 
But to return to the houfe ; after he pitched the roof 
of his innermoft tent, he worked it up between the 
rafters with balket-work, fo firm, and thatched that 
pver again fo ingenioufly with rice ftraw, and over: 
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, 
that his houfe was as dry as if it had been tiled or 
flated. Indeed he owned that the favages made the 
balket-work for him.

-The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all 
jround this inner apartment, and long rafters lay 
from the 32 angles to the top ports of the inner 
houfe^ being about twenty feet diftant ; fo that there 
was a fpace like a walk within the outer wicker- wall, 
and without the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned oflF with the fame 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided intofi>; 
apartments, for that he had fix rooms on a floor, 
^nd out of every one of thef^ there was a door ; firft^ 
into the entry, or coming into the main tent ; and 
another door into the fpace or walk that was round 
it ; fo that this walk was alfo divided into fix equal 
parts, v;hich ferved not only for a retreat, but to 
ftore up any neceflaries .which the family had occafion 
. for, Thefe fix fpaces not taking up the whole cir- 
cumference, what other apartments the outer circle 
had, were thus ordered : as foon as you were in at 
the door of the outer circle, you had a fliort paflage 
ftraight before you to the door of the inijier houfe; but 
on either fide was a wicker partition, and a door in 
it, by which you went, firft, into a large room or 
ftore-houfe, 20 feet wide, and about 30 feet long, 
and through that into another not quite fo long : fo 
that in the outer circle were ten handfome rooms, 
fix of which were only to be come at through the 
fipartments of the inner tent, and ferved as clofets or 
retired rooms to the refpedlive chambers of the inner 
circle ; and fqur large warehoufes or barns, or what 
you pleafe to call them, which went in through one 
another, two on either hand of the paflage chat led 
through the outer door td the inner tent. 

Such 



122 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

' Such a piece of balket-work, I believe, was never 
&en in the world ; nor an houfe or tent fo neatly 
contrived, much lefs fo built : in this great bee-hive 
lived the three families ; that is to fay. Will Atkins^ 
and his companions ; the third was killed, but his 
wife remained with three children ; for Ihe was, it 
feems, big with child when he died ; and the other 
two were not at all backward to give the widow her 
full fliare of every thing, I mean, as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or 
found a turtle on the Ihore j fo that they all lived well 
enough, though it was true, they were not fo induf- 
trious as the other two, as has been obferved already. 
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that, 
as for religion, I don't know that there was any 
thing of that kind among them ; they pretty often, 
hideed, put one another in mind, that there was a 
God, by the very common method of feamen, vi%. 
IVearing by his name ; nor were their poor, igno- 
rant favage wives much the better for having been 
married to Chrijiians^ as we muft cail them ; for as 
they knew very little of God themfelves, fo they 
were utterly incapable of entering into any difcourfe 
with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing 
tO'them concerning religion. 

J The utmoft of all the improvement which I can fay 
the wives had made from them, was, that they had 
taught them to fpeak En^lijh pretty well ; and all the 
children they had, which were near twenty in all, 
were taught to fpeak EngUJh too, from their firft 
learning to -fpeak, though they at firft fpoke it 
ift.a.very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
v^pVQ npne of ^thofe children above fix years old

feven 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 23 

feven years that they had fetched thefe five favage 
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for 
they had all children, more or lefs : I think the cook's 
mate's wife was big of her fixth child ; and the mo- 
thers were all a good fort of well governed, quiet, labo- 
rious women, modeft and decent, helpful to one an- 
other, mighty obfervant and fubjeft to their matters, 
I cannot call them hufbands ; and wanted nothing 
but to be well inftruflied in the Chrijiian religion, 
and to be legally married j both which were happily 
brought about afterwards by my means, or, at leaft, 
by the confequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five runagade Eng^ 
lijhmen^ I muft fay fomething of the Spaniards^ who 
were the main body of the family ; and in whofe 
ftory there are fome incidents alfo remarkable 
enough. 

I had a great many difcourfes with them about 
their circumftances, when they were among the fa- 
vages : they told me readily, that they had no in- 
ftances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country ; that they were a poor, miferable, de- 
jected handful of people ; that if means had been put 
into their hands, they had yet fo abandoned them- 
fclves to defpair, and fo fupk under the weight of 
their misfortunes^ that they thought of nothing but 
ftarving. One of them, a grave and very fenfible 
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the 
wrong ; that it was not the part of wife men to give 
up themfelves to their mifery, but always to take hold 
of the helps which reafon offered, as well for prefent 
fupport, as for future delivcrancej he told me, that 

grief 



124 i-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

grief was the moft ' feafekfs, infignificant paffion in 
the world ; for that it regarded only things paft, 
ifchich were generally impoffible to be recalled or to 
be remedied, but had no view to things to come, 
and had no fhare in any thing that loolced like deli- 
verance, but father added to the afflidion than pro- 
pofed a remedy ; and upon this, he repeated a Spa^ 
nijh proverb ; which, though I cannot rejpeat in juft 
tlie fame words that he fpoke it, yet I remember I 
ijjiade it into an EngUJlo proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled^ 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 
' He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im» 
provements I had made in my folitude ; my unwea- 
ried application, as he called it, and how I had made 
a condition, which, in its circumftances, was at firft 
much worfe than their's, a thoufand times more 
happy than their's was, even now, when they were 
altogether : he told me, it was remarkable, that 
Engl'rjhmen had a greater prefence of mind, in their 
diftrefs, than any people that ever he met with ; that 
their . unhappy nation, and the Portuguefe^ were the 
worft men in the world to ftruggle with misfortunes j. 
for that their firft ftep in dangers, after common 
efforts are over, was always to defpair, lie down un- 
der it and die, without roufing their thoughts up to 
proper remedies for efcape. 

I told him, their cafe and mine differed exceed-? 
ingly ; that they were caft upon the fhore without 
neceflaries, without fupply of food, or of prefent 
fuftenance, till they could provide it : that it is true, I 
had this difad vantage and difcomfoit, that I was 
alone j but then the fuppli^s I had providentially

thrown into my hands, by the uhexpefl:ed driving of 
the ihip on fliore, was fuch a help as would have en^ 
couraged any creature in the world to have appliiid 
himfelf as I had done : Seigniory fays the Spaniard; 
had we poor Spaniards been in your cafe, we fhoUld 
never have gotten half thofe things oiit of the fhip 
as you did : nay, fays he, we Ihould never have found 
means to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to 
have gotten a raft on ihore without boat or fail ; and 
how much lefs Ihould we have done, faid he, if any 
of us had been alone ! Well, I defired him to abate 
his compliment, and go on with the hiftory of 
their coming on fhore, where they landed : be told 
me, they unhappily landed at a place where there 
were people without provifions; whereas, had they had 
the common fenfe to have put off to fea again, and 
gone to another ifland a little farther, they had found 
provifions, though without people ; there being aa 
Ifland that way, as they had been told, where there 
were provifions, though no people ; that is to fay^ 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been 
there, and 'filled the ifland with goats and hogs at 
feveral times ; where they have bred in fuch multi* 
tudes, and where turtle and fea fowls were in fuch 
plenty, that they could have been in no want of 
flefli, though they had found no bread; whereas 
here they were only fuflained with a few roots and 
herbs, which they underftood not, and which had 
no fubfl:ance in them, and which the inhabitants gave 
them fparingly enough, and who could treat them 
no better, unlefs they would turn canibals, and eat 
men's flefli, which was the great dainty of the 
country. 

They 



126 LIVE AND ADVENTURES 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
ftrove to civilize the favages they were with, and to 
teach them rational cuftoms in the ordinary way of 
living ; but in vain : and how they retorted it upon 
them, as unjuft, that they, who came thithet for 
afliflance and fupport, fliould attempt to fet up for 
inftruclors of thofe that gave them bread ; intimat- 
ing, it feems, that none fliould fet up for the in- 
ftruftors of others, but thofe who could live without 
them. 

They gave me difmal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how fometimes they were ma- 
ny days without any food at all ; the ifland they were 
upon being inhabited by a fort of favages that lived 
more indolent, and, for that reafon, were lefs fup- 
plied with the neceffaries of life, than they had rea- 
fon to believe others were in the fame part of the 
world ; and yet they found that thefe favages were 
lefs ravenous and voracious, than thofe who had 
better fupplies of food. 

Alfo they added, that they could not but fee with 
what demonftrations of wifdom and goodnefs, the 
governing Providence of God direfts the event of 
things in the world ; which, they faid, appeared in 
their circumftances ; for if, preffed by the hardfliips- 
they were under, and the barrennefs of the country 
where they were, they had fearched after a better 
place to live in, they had then been out of the way 
of the relief that happened to them by my means. 

Then they gave me an account, how the favages, 
whom they lived among, expefted them to go out 
with them into their wars ; and it was true, that, as 
they h^d fire-arms with them, had they not had the 

difafter 



OF ROBINSON CEUSOE* 1^ 

difafter to lofe their ammunition, they fhould'not 
have been ferviceable only to their friends, but have 
made themfelves terrible both to friends and enemies ; 
but being without powder and (hot, and in a con- 
dition, that they could not in reafon deny to go out 
with their landlords to their wars ; when they camie 
in the field of battle, they were in a worfe condition 
than the favages themfelves ; for they neither had 
bows nor arrows, nor could they ufe thofe the fa- 
vages gave them ; fo that they could do nothing but 
ftand ftill, and be wounded with arrows, till they 
came up to the teeth of their enemy ; and then, in- 
deed, the thr^e halbcrts they had were of ufe to 
them J and they would often drive a whole little 
army before them, with thofe halberts and iharpened 
fticks put into the muzzles of their mulkets : but 
that for all this, they were fometimes furrounded 
with multitudes, and in great danger from their ar- 
rows ; till at laft they found the way to make them- 
felves large targets of wood, which they covered 
with fkins of wild beafts, whofe names they knew 
not ; and thefe covered them from the arrows of the 
favages ; that, notwithftanding thefe, they were 
fometimes in great danger, and were once five of 
them knocked down together, with the clubs of the 
favages, which was the time when one of them was 
taken prifoner, that is to fay, the Spaniard whom I 
had relieved : That at firft they thought he had been 
killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken 
prifoner, they were under the greateft grief imagi- 
nable, and would willingly have all ventured their 
lives to have refcued him. 

They

They told me, that when they were £o knocked 
down, the reft of their, company refcued them, and 
flood over them fighting, till they were come to them-i 
felves, all but he who they thought had been dead j 
and then they made their way with their halberts and 
pieces, ftanding clofe together in ^ line, through a 
body of above a thoufaild fayages, beating down all 
that came In their Ivay, got the vidory over their 
enemies, but to their great forrow, becaufe it wa& 
with the lofs of their friend ; whom the other party^ 
finding him alive, carried oflF with fome others, as^ 
I gave an account in my former. 

They defcribed nioft affeftionately, how they were 
lurprifed with joy at the return of their friend and ^ 
companion in mifery, who they thought had been de-- ' 
voured by wildbeafts of the worft of kind, viz. by 
wild men^ and, yet hoV^ more and more they were 
furprifed with the account he gave them of his er- 
. rand, and that there was a Cbrijilan in 2. place near, 
much more one that was able, arid had hmnanity 
erioughtpcontribtite to their deliverance. • • 

. They defcribed how they were aftonifhed at the 
fight of the relief I fent them, and at the appear- 
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not feen 
fince their eoiriiiig to that miferable place ; howoftejx,- 
they crofled it, and bleffed it as- bread fent from 
Heaven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to their 
fpirits to tafte it*; as alfo, of the .other things I had 
fent for their fupply. And, after all, they would 
have told me fomething of the joy they were in at 
the fight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to 
the perfon and phce, frqm whence all thefe new 
comforts came ; but they told me, it was impofTible 

to 



(5F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12^ 

to iexprefs it by words ; for their excefGve joy driv- 
ing them to unbecoming extravagancies, they had 
nd way to defcribe them, but by telling me, that 
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give 
vent to their pafEon, fuitable to the fehfe that was 
upon them ; that in fome it worked one way, and 
in fome another ; and that fome of them, through a 
furprife of joy, would burft out into tears ; others be 
half mad, and others immediately faint. This dif- 
courfe extremely afFeded me, and called to my mind 
Friday^s extacy, when he met his father, and the 
poor people's extacy, when I took them up /at fea, 
after their fhip \yas on. fire ; the mate of the fliip's^ 
joy, when he found himfelf delivered in the place 
where he expefted to perifh ; and my own joy, when 
after twenty-eight years captivity, 1 found a good 
fhip ready to carry me to my own country: All 
thefe things made -me morefenfible of the relation 
of thefe poor men, and more affeded with It. 

Having thus given a view of the ftate of things, 
as I found them, I muft relate tlie heads of what I 
did for thefe people, and the condition in which I 
left them; . It was their opinion, and mine top, that 
they would be troubled no more with the favages ; of 
that, if they were, they would be able to cut them 
off, if they were twice as many as before ; fo thdt 
they had no concern about that. Then L entered 
into a feripus difcOutfe with the Spaniard, whom I 
called governor, about their flay in the ifland ; for 
as -I was not- come to carry any of them off, fo it 
would not be juft to carry off fome, and leave others^ 
who perhaps would be unwilling to ft ay if their 
ftrength was diminiflied.

On the other hand, I told them, I came to efta* 
blifh them there, not to remove them; and then 
I let them know, that I had brought with me re- 
lief of fundry kinds for them : That I had been 
at a great charge to fupply them with all things ne- 
ceflary, as well for their convenience, as their de- 
fence ; and that I had fuch particular perfons with 
me, as well to increafe and recruit their number, as 
by the particular neceffary employments which they 
were bred to, being artificers, to affift them in thofe 
things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; 
and before I delivered to them the ftores I had 
brought, I afked them, one by one, if they had en- 
tirely forgot and buried the firft animofities that had 
been among them, and could fhake hands with one 
another, and engage in a ftri£t friendfliip, and union 
of intereft, fo that there might be no more mifun- 
derftandings or jealoufies. 

William Atkinf, with abundance of franknefs and 
good-humour, faid. They had met with aiHiftions 
enough to make them all fober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends : That, for his part, he 
would live and die with them ; and was fo far from 
defigning any thing againft the Spaniards^ that, he 
owned, they had done nothing to him but what his 
own bad humour made neceflary, and what he would 
have done, and, perhaps, much worfe, in their cafe ; 
and that he would alk them pardon, if I defired it, 
for the foolifli and brutifli things he had done to 
them ; and was very willing and defirous of living 
on terms of entire friendfhip and union with them j 
and would do any thing that lay in his power to con- 

vince 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, I3I 

vince them of it : and as for * going to England^ 
he cared not if he did not go thither thefe twenty 
years. 

The Spaniards faid, they had, indeed, at firft, 
difarmed and excluded William Atkins^ and his two 
countrymen, for their ill conduft, as they had let 
me know : And they appealed to me, for the ne« 
celEty they were under to do fo ; but that William 
Atkins had behaved himfelf fo bravely in the great 
fight they had with the favages, and on feveral occa- 
fions fince, and had fliewed himfelf fo faithful to, 
and concerned for the general intereft of them all, 
that they had forgotten all that was paft, and thought 
he merited as much to be trufted with, arms, and 
fupplied with neceflaries, as any of them ; and that 
they had teftified their fatisfaftion in him, by com- 
mitting the command to him, next to the governor 
himfelf J and as they had an entire confidence in 
him, and all his countrymen, fo they aclcnowledged, 
they had merited that confidence, by all the methods 
that honed men could merit to be valued and trufted : 
and they moft heartily embraced the occafion of 
giving me this aflurance, that they would never have 
any intereft feparate from one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open declarations of friend- 
fliip, we appointed the next day to dine all together; 
and indeed, we made a fplendid feaft : I caufed the 
fliip's cook and his mate to come on fhore, and drefs 
our dinner ; and the old cook's mate we had on 
fhore, affifted. We brought on fhore fix pieces of 
good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the 
ihip's provifion, with our punch bowl, and mate-

rials to fill it 5 and, in particular, I gave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of Englijh 
beer ; things that neither the Spaniards^ or the 
Englifhmeny had tafted for many years ; and which, 
it may be fuppofed, they were exceeding glad 
of. 

The Spaniards added to our feaft five whole kids^ 
which the cooks roafted ; and three of them were 
fent, covered up clofe, on board our fhip to the fea- 
men, that they might feaft on frefli meat from on 
Ihore, as we did with their fait meat from on 
board. 

After this feaft, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, 
that there might be no difpute about dividing, I 
fliewed them that there was fufEcient for them all j 
and defired, that they might all take an equal quan- 
tity of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to 
fay, equal when made up. As firft, I diftributed 
linen fufEcient to make every one of them four 
(hirts; and, at the Spaniard"^ requeft, afterwards 
made them up fix ; thefe were exceeding comforta- 
ble to them, having been what, as I may fay, they 
had long fince forgot the ufe of, or what it was to 
wear them. 

I allotted the thin Englijh ftufFs, which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock, 
which I judged fitteft for the heat of the feafon, cool 
and loofe ; and ordered, that whenever they de- 
cayed, they fhould make more,, as they thought 
fit : The like for pumps, Ihoes^ ftockings, and 
hats, Sff^, 

I cannot 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I33 

I cannot exprefs what pleafure, what fatisfadion, 
fat upon the countenances of all thefe poor men, 
when they faw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnifhed them : they told me, I was 
a father to them ; and that, having fuch a corref- 
pondent as I was, in fo remote a part of the world, 
it would make them forget that they were lelt in a 
defolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged 
to me, not to leave the place without my con- 
fent. 

Then I prefented to them the people I had brought 
with me ; particularly the taylor, the fmith, and the 
two carpenters, all of them mod neceffary people; 
but above all, my general artificer, than whom they 
could not name any thing that was more needful to 
them } and the taylor, to fhew his concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and with my leave, made 
them every one a fliirt the firft thing he did ; and, 
which was ftill more, he taught the women not only 
how to low and ftitch, and ufe the needle, but made 
them affift to make the fhirts for their hufbands, and 
for all the reft. 

As for the carpenters, I fcarce heed mention how 
ufeful they were, for they took in pieces all my clum- 
fy, unhandy things, and made them clever, conve- 
nient tables, ftools, bedfteads, cupboards, lockers, 
ihelves, and every thing they wanted of that kind. 

But, to let them fee how nature made artificers al 
firft, I carried the carpenters to fee WiUiarn Atkinses 
ba(ket-houfe, as I called it ; and they both owned, 
they never faw an inftance of fuch natural ingenuity 
Jpefore j nor any thing fo regular, and fo handjly

built, at leaft of Its kind : and one of them, when 
he faw It, after mufing a good while, turning about 
to me, I am fure, fays he, that man has no need of 
us ; you need do nothing but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out' all my (lore of tools, 
and gave every man a digging fpade, a fhovel, and 
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs j and, to 
every feparate place, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe^ 
and a faw ; always appointing, that as often as any 
were broken, or worn out, they fhould be fupplied^'. 
without grudging, out of the general (lores that I left ' 
behind. 

Nails, flaples, hinges, hammers, chiffels, knives, 
fciffars, and all forts of tools and iron-work, they 
had without tale, as they required ; for no man 
jv'ould care to take more than they wanted j and he 
muft be a fool that would wafte or fpoil them, on any 
account whatever : And for the ufe of the fmith, I 
left two tons of unwrought iron for a fupply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought 
them, was fuch even to profufion, that they could 
not but rejoice at them ; for now they could march 
as I ufed to do, with a mufket upon each fhoulder, 
if there was occafion ; and were able to fight looo 
favages, if they had but fome little advantages of 
fituation ; which alfo they could not mifs of, if they 
had occafion. 

I carried on fhore with me the young man whofe 
mother was ftarved to death, and the maid alfo ; fhe 
was a fober, well-educated, religious young woman, 
and behaved fo inofienfively, that every one gave her a 
good word : She had, indeed, an unhappy life with 
us, there being no woman in tlie Ihip but herfelf ;

but (he bore It with patience. After a while, feeing 
things fo well ordered, and in fo fine a way of thriv- 
ing upon my ifland, and confidering that they had 
neither bufinefs or acquaintance in the Eaji Indies^ 
or reafon for taking fo long a voyage ; I fay, con- 
fidering all this, both of them came to me, and de- 
fired I would give them leave to remain on the 
ifland, and be entered among my family, as they 
called it. 

I agreed' to it readily ; and they had a little plot 
of ground allotted to them, where they had three 
tents or houfes fet up, furrounded with a baiket- 
work, palifaded like Atkins^Sy and adjoining to his 
plantation ; their tents were contrived fo, that they 
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a 
middle tent, like a great ftore-houfe, to lay all their 
goods in, and to- eat and drink in : And now the 
other two Englijhmen moved their habitation to the 
fame place ; and fo the ifland was divided into three 
colonies, and no more ; viz. The Spaniards^ with 
old Friday^ and the firft fervants, at my old habita- 
tion under the hill, which was, in a word, the ca- 
pital city, and where they had fo enlarged and ex- 
tended their works, as well under as on the out-fide 
of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly conceal- 
ed, yet full at large. Never was there fuch a little 
city in a wood, and fo hid, I believe, in any part of 
the world : For, I verily believe, looo men might 
have ranged the ifland a month, and, if they had 
not known there was fuch a thing, and looked on 
purpofe for it, they would not have found it ; for 
the trees flood fo thick, and fo clofe, and grew fo 
fafl matted into one another, that nothing but cutting

them down firft, could difcover the place, except 
jhe two narrow entrances where they went in anc| 
out, could be found ; which was not very eafy : 
One of them was juft down at the water*s-edge, pQ 
the fide of the creek j and it was afterwards above 
aoo yards to the place j and the other was up the 
ladder at twice, as I have already formerly defcribed 
it ; and they had a large wood, thick planted, alfo 
on the top of the hill, which contained above an 
;jcre, which grew apace, and covered the place from 
Jill difcovery there, with only one narrow place be- 
tween two trees, not eafy to be difcovered, to enter 
on that fide. 

The other colony, was that of Will Aik'ms\^ where 
there were four families of Englijhmen^ I mean thofe 
J had left there, with their wives and children ; three 
lavages, that were flaves ; the widow and children 
of the EngliJJo?nan that was killed ; the young man 
and the maid ; and, by the way, we made a wife of 
her alfo, before we went away ; There were alfo the 
two carpenters and the taylor, who I brought with 
me for them; alfo the fmith, who vas a very ne- 
ceflary man to them, efpecially as the gunfmith, to 
take care of their arms ; and my other man, whom 
I called Jack of all trades ; who was himfelf as good 
almoft as twenty men, for he was not only a very 
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and, 
before I went away, we married him to the honeft 
maid that came with the youth in the fhip, whom! 
mentioned before. 

And now I fpeak of marrying, it brings me na- 
turally to fay fomething of the French ecclefiaftic 
that I had brought with me put of the fhip's crew, 

whon\

'V^tcHca I took at fea. It is true, this man was a Rot^ 
man^ and perhaps, it may give offence to fome here- 
after, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon record, 
of a man, whom, before I begin, I muft (to fet him 
put in juft colours) reprefent in terms very much to 
his difadvantage, in the account of Proteftants ; as 
firft, that he was a Papift ; fecondly, a Popifh prieft j 
and thirdly, a French Popifli prieft. 

But juftice demands of me to give him a dui? cha- 
1-aQ:er ; and I muft fay, he was a grave, fober, pious, 
and moft religious perfon ; exafl: in his life, extenfive 
in his charity, and exemplary in almoft every thing 
he did : What, then, can any one fay againft my 
being very fenfible of th.e value of fuch a man, not- 
withftanding his profeflion ? Though it may be my 
opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others^ 
who (hall read this, that he was miftaken. 

The firft hour that I began to converfe with him, 
after he had agreed to go with me to the Ea/i In^ 
diesj I found reafou to delight exceedingly in his 
converfation : And he firft began with me about re- 
ligion, in the moft obliging manner imaginable. 

Sir, fays he, you have not only, under God (and 
at that he croffed his breaft) faved my life, but you 
have admitted me to go this voyage in your fhip, 
and by your obliging civility, have taken me into 
your family, giving me an opportunity of free con- 
verfation : Now, Sir, fays he, you fee by my habit, 
what my profeffion is ; and I guefs by your nation, 
what your^s is : I may think it is my duty, and 
dpubtlefs it is fo, to ufe my utmoft endeavours, on 
all occafions, to bring all the fouls that I can to the 
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic

dodrine ; but, as I am here under your permiffion, 
and in your family, I am bound in juftice to your 
kindnefs, as well as in decency and good manners, 
to be under your government; and therefore I 
Ihall not, without your leave, enter into any debates 
on the points of religion, in which we may not 
agree, farther than you fhall give me leave. 

I told him, his carriage was fo modeft, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were 
fuch people as they call heretics ; but that he was 
not the firft Catholic that I had converfed with, with- 
out falling into any inconveniencies, or carrying the 
queftions to any height in debate ; that he fhould not 
find himfelf the worfe ufed for being of a different 
opinion from us ; and if we did not converfe with- 
out any diflike on either fide, upon that fcore, it 
would be his fault, nbt ours. 

He replied. That he thought our converfation 
might be eafily feparated from difputes ; that it was 
not his bufmefs to cap principles with every man he 
difcourfed with ; and that he rather defired me to 
converfe with him as ^ gent/e7?ian^ than as a religieux ; 
that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dif- 
courfe upon religious fubjefts, he would readily 
comply with it ; and that then he did not doubt but 
I would allow him alfo to defend his own opinions, 
as well as he could : but that, without my leave, he 
would not break in upon me with any fuch thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not ceafe to do 
all that became him in his office, as a prieft, as well 
as a private Chriftian, to procure the goods of the 
fhip, and the fafety of all that was in her ; and 
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and 

he

he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all occafions. In 
this manner we converfed ; and, as he was of a moft 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, fo he was, if I 
may be allowed to fay fo, a man of good fenfe, 
and, as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a moft diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of 
many adventures which had befallen him in the few 
years that he had been abroad in the world, and par- 
ticularly this was very remarkable ; viz. That during 
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the mis- 
fortune to be five times fhipped and unfhipped, and 
never to go to the place whither any of the fhips he 
was in were at firft defigned : That his firft intent 
was, to have gone to Martinico ; and that he went 
on board a fhip bound thither at Su Makes ; but 
being forced into Lijbon in bad weather, the fliip 
received fome damage, by running aground in the 
mouth of the river Tagus^ and was obliged to un- 
load her cargo there : That finding a Portuguefe fhip 
there, bound to the Madeiras y and ready to fail, and 
fuppofing he fhould eafily meet with a veflel there 
bound to Martinicoy he went on board, in order to

ffiefe fhip, being but an indifferent mariner, had 
been out in his reckoning, and they drove to Fial ; 
where, however, he happened to find a very good 
market for his cargo, which was corn ; and there- 
fore refolved not to go to the Madeiras^ but to load 
fait at the IJle of May^ to go away to Newfoundland: 
He had no remedy in the exigence, but to go with 
the fhip J and had a pretty good voyage as far as the 

Banks^ 



140 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

JBanksy (fo they call the place where they catch the 
fifli) where meeting with a French fhip bound from 
France to ^ebec^ in the river of Canada^ and from 
thence to M^r/m/V^, to carry ^provifions, he thought 
he fliould have an opportunity to complete his firft 
defign : But when he came to ^ebec^ the mafter of 
the fhip died, and the fhip proceeded no farther : So 
the next voyage he fhipped himfelf for France ^ in the 
fliip that was burnt, when we took them up at fea, 
and then fhipped them with us for the Ea/i Indies^ 
;is I have already faid. Thus he had been difap- 
pointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one 
voyage, befides what I fhall have occafion to men- 
tion farther of the fame perfon. 

But I fhall not make digreflions into other men's 
flories, which have no relation to my own. I return 
ta what concerns our affair in the ifland : He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
^hile we were upon the ifland ; and it happened ta 
be jufl when I was going to vifit the Englijhnien^ co- 
lony, at the fartheft part of the ifland ; I fay, he 
came to me, and told me, with a very grave coun- 
tenance, that he had, for two or three days, defired 
an opportunity of fome difcourfe with me, which, 
he hoped, would not be difpleafmg to me, becaufe 
he thought it might, in fome meafure, correfponi 
with my general defign, which was the profperity 
of my new colony ; and, perhaps, might put it, at 
leafl, more than he yet thought it was, in the way 
of God's blefling. 

I looked a little furprized at the lafl part of his 
difcourfe ; and turning a little fhort. How, Sir, faid 
I, can it be faid, that we are not in the way of God*s 

blefTmg, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I4I 

blefling, after fuch vifible afliftances, and wonderful 
deliverances, as we have feen here, and of which I 
have given you a large account ? 

If you had pleafed. Sir, faid he, (with a world 
of modefty, and yet with great readinefs) to have 
heard me, you would have found no room to have 
been difpleafed, much lefs to think fo hard of me 
that I fliould fuggeft, that you have not had won- 
derful affiftances s^nd deliverances : And, I hope, on 
your behalf, that you arc in the way of God's 
blefling, and your defign is exceeding good, and will 
profper. But, Sir, faid he, though it were more fo, 
than is even poflTible to you, yet there may be fome 
among you that are not equally right in their anions: 
And you know, that in the ftory of Jfrael^ one 
Acharij in the camp, removed God's blefling from 
them, and turned his hand fo againfl: them, that 
thirty-fix of them, though not concerned in the 
crime, were the objedts of divine vengeance, and 
bore the weight of that punifliment. 

I was fenfibly touched with this difcourfe ; and 
told him his* inference was fo jufl:, and the whole 
defign feemed fo fincere, and was really fo religious 
in its own nature, that I was very forry I had inter- 
rupted him ; and begged him to go on : And, in the 
mean time, becaufe it feemed, that what we had both 
to fay, might take up fome time, I told him I was 
going to the Englijhmaris plantation, and aflced him 
to go with me, and we might difcourfe of it by the 
way : He told me, he would more willingly wait on 
me thither, becaufe there, partly, the thing was 
afted, which he defired to fpeak to me about : So 

we 



142 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we walked on, and I preffed him to be free and 
plain with me, in what he had to fay. 

Why then. Sir, fays he, be pleafed to give me 
leave to lay down a few propofitions, as the founda- 
tion of what I have to fay, that we may not differ in 
the general principles, though we may be of fome 
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. Firft, 
Sir, though we differ in fome of the doftrinal articles 
of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is fo, ef- 
pecially in the cafe before u«, as I fhall fhew after- 
wards ; yet, there are fome general principles in 
which we both agree; viz. Firft, that there is a 
God; and that this God, having given us fomeftated 
general rules for our fervice and obedience, we ought 
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either 
by neglefting to do what he has commanded, or by 
doing what he has exprefsly forbidden ; and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all : That the blef- 
fing of God does not ordinarily follow a prefumptu- 
ous finning againft his command ; and every good 
Chriftan will be affe£lionately concerned to prevent 
any that are under his care, living in a total neglefl: 
of God and his commands. It is not your men be- 
ing Proteftants, whatever my opinion may be of 
fuch, that difcharges me from being concerned for 
their fouls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before 
me, that they fliould live in as little diftance from, 
and enmity with their Maker as poffible ; efpecially 
if you give me leave to meddle fo far in your cir- 
cuit, 

I could 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I43 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told 
him I granted all he had faid ; and thanked him, 
tjiat he would fo far concern himfelf for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what he 
had obferved, that, like Jofhua^ (to take his own 
parable) I might put away the accurfed thing from 
us. 

Why then, Sir, fays he, I will take the liberty 
you give me ; and there are three things, which, if 
I am right, muft ftand in the way of God's bleffing 
upon your endeavours here, and which I fliould re- 
joice, for your fake, and their own, to fee removed. 
And, Sir, fays he, I promife myfelf that you will 
fully agree with me in them all, as foon as I name 
them ; efpecially, becaufe I fhall convince you, that 
every one of them may, with great eafc, and very 
much to your fatisfaflion, be remedied. 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, 
but went on. Firft, Sir, fays he, you have here four 
Englijhmen^ who have fetched women from among 
the favages, and have taken them as their wives, and 
have had many children by them all, and yet are not 
married to them after any ftated legal manner, as 
the laws of God and man require ; and therefore 
are yet, in the fenfe of both, no lefs than adulterers, 
and living in adultery. To this. Sir, fays he, I 
know you will objeft, that there was no clergyman, 
or prieft of any kind, or of any profeflion, to per- 
form the ceremony j nor any pen and ink, or paper, 
to write down a contraft of marriage, and have it 
figned between them. And I know alfo. Sir, what 
the Spaniard governor has told you j I mean, of the 

agreement 



144 ^^^^ AND ADVENTURES 

agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
took thefe women, viz. That they fhould chufe them 
out by confent, and keep feparately to them ; 
which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no 
agreement with the women as wives, but only am 
agreement among themfelves, to keep them from 
quarrelling. 

But, Sir, the effence of the facrament of ihatri- 
mtony (fo he called it, being a Roman) confifts not 
only in the mutual confent of the parties ta take one 
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal 
obligation that there is in the contraft, to compel the 
man and woman, at all times, to own and acknow- 
ledge each other ; obliging the man to abftain from 
all other women, to engage in no other contra^ 
while thefe fubfift ; and on all occafions, as ability 
allows, to provide honeftly for them, and their chil* 
dren ; and to oblige the women to the fame, or like 
conditions, mutatis ?nutandis^ on their fide. 

Now, Sir, fays he, thefe men may, when they 
pleafe, or when occafion prefents, abandon thefe 
women, difown their children, leave them to perifh,^ 
and take other women, and marry them whilft thefe • 
are living. And here he added, with fome warmth, 
How, Sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty ? 
And how (hall a bleffing fucceed your endeavours in 
this place, however good in themfelves, and however 
fincere in your -defigh, while thefe men, who at pre- 
fent are your fubjefts, under your abfolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in 
open adultery ? 

I confefs, I was ftruck at the thing itfelf, but 
much more with the convincing arguments he fup- 

ported 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I45 

pfOtted it with : for it was certainly true, that though 
they had no clergyman on the fpot, yet a formal con- 
trad on both fides, made before witnefles, and con- 
firmed by any token, which they had all agreed to 
be bound by, though it had been but the breaking a 
ftick between them, engaging the men to own thefe 
women for their wives upon all occafions, and never 
to abandon them or their children, and the women 
to the fame with their hufbands, had been an effec- 
tual lawful marriage in the fight of God j and it 
was a great negleft that it was not done. 

But i thought to have gotten off with my young 
prieft, by telling him, that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived fo many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was 
paft remedy ; they could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he, alking your pardon for fuch freedom, 
you are right in this j that it being done in your ab- 
fence, you could not be charged with that part of the 
crime. But I befeech you, flatter not yourfelf, that 
you are not therefore under an obligation to do your 
uttermofl now to put an end to it : How can you 
think, but that, let the timepafl He on whom it will, 
all the guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon 
you ? Becaufe it is certainly in your power now to 
put an end to it ; and In nobody's power but your's. 

I was fo dull ftill, that I did not take him right ; 
but I imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he 
meant, that I fliould part them, and not fuffer them 
to live together any longer ; and I faid to him, I 
could not do that by any means, for that it would 
put the whole ifland in confufion. He feemed fur- 

VoL. II. L prifed 



14^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

prifed that I fhould fo far miftake hinou Nq, Sir^ 
fays he, I do not mean that you fhould feparate them, 
but legally and efFeftually marry them now : And, 
Sir, as my way of marrying may not be fo eafy to 
reconcile them to, though it will be as effeftual, even 
by your own laws ; fo your way may be as well be- 
fore God, and as valid among men j I mean, by a 
written contra6l, figned by both man and woman, 
and by all the witnefles prefent ; which all the law* 
of Europe would decree to be valid. 

I was amazed to fee fo much true piety, and fa 
much iincerity of zeal, befides the unufual impar- 
tiality in his difcourfe, as to his own party or church, 
and fuch a true warmth for the preferving people 
that' he had no knowledge of, or relation to; I fay, 
for preferving them from tranfgreffing the kiws of 
God ; the like of which, I had, indeed, not met 
with any where. But recoUeftlng what he had faid 
of marrying them by a written contract, which I 
knew would (land too, I returned it back upon him, 
and told him^ I granted all that he had faid to be 
juft, and, on his part, very kind; that I would dif- 
courfe with the n>en upon the point now, when I 
came to them. And I kjiew no reafon why they 
Ihould fcruple to let him marry them all ; which I 
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic 
and valid in En^land^ as if they were married by one 
of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done 
in this matter, I Ihall fpeak of by itfelf. 

I then prefled him to tell me, what was the fecond 

complaint which he had to make ; acknowledging, 

that I was very much his debtor for the firft ; and 

I thanked 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I47 

tbatiked him heartily for it* He told, me he would 
ufe the lame freedom, and pUimxefs in the fecond j 
and hoped I would take it as well : and this was, 
that nostwithftanding tbefe EngliJ} fubje^ls of aune,

^Inmft f&fcn yeara, s^d had taught them to fpeak

into the bofom of the true church, than they are 
now, in the public profeffion of idolatry, and devil- 
worfliip. 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excefs of paflion : How 
fer, faid I to him, have I been from underftanding 
the mofl effential part of a Chriftian, viz. to love 
the intereft of the Chriftian church, and the good of 
other men's fouls ! I fcarce have known what belongs 
to being a Chriftian. O, Sir, do not fay fo, replied 
he ; this thing is not your fault. No, faid I, but 
why did I never lay it to heart as well as you ? It is 
not too late yet, faid he ; be not too forward to con- 
denm yourfelf. But what can be done now ? faid I ; 
you fee I am going away. Will you give me leave, 
laid he, to talk with thefe poor men about it ? Yes^ 
with all my heart, faid I j and I will oblige them to 
give heed to what you fay too. As to that, faid he, we 
muft leave them to the mercy of Chrift ; but it is 
our bufmefs to aflift them, encourage them, and in* 
ftruft them ; and, if you will give me leave, and 
God his bleffing, I do not doubt but the poor ig- 
norant fouls fhall be brought home into the great 
circle of Chriftianity, if not into the particular faith 
that we all embrace ; and that even while you ftay 
here. Upon this I faid, I fhall not only give you 
leave, but give you a thoufand thanks for it. What 
followed on this account I fhall mention alfo again 
in its place. 

I now prefTed him for the third article in which we 
were to blame : Why really, fays he, it is of the 
fame nature, and I will proceed (alking your leave) 

- 4 with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I49 

With the fame plamnefs as before : It is about your poor 
favages yonder, who are (as I may fay) your conquered 
fubjefts. It is a maxim. Sir, that is, or ought to be re- 
ceived among all Chriftians, of what church, or pre- 
tended church foever, viz. that Chriftian knowledge 
ought to be propagated by all poflible means, and on 
all poffible occafions. It is on this principle that our 
church fends miffionaries into Pcrfta^ India^ and China; 
and that our clergy, even of the fuperior fort, wil- 
lingly engage in the moft hazardous voyages, and 
the mod dangerous refidence, among murderers and 
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true 
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chrif- 
tian faith. Now, Sir, you have an opportunity here, 
to have fix or feven-and-thirty poor favages brought 
over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their 
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you 
can pafs by fuch an occafion of doing good ; which 
is really worth the expence of a man's whole life. 

I was now ftruck dumb indeed, and had not one 
word to fay : I had here a fpirit of true Chriftian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular principles be of what kind foever : As for me, 
I had not fo much as entertained a thought of this in 
my heart before ; and, I believe, fliould not have 
thought of it ; for I looked upon thefe favages as 
flaves, and people, whom, had we any work for 
them to do, we would have ufed as fuch, or would 
have been glad to have tranfported them to any other 
part of the world j for our bufmefs was to get rid 
of them ; and we would all have been fatisfied, if 
they had been fent to any country, fo they had ne- 
ver feen their own. But, to the cafe : I fay, I was 
L 3 coitfounded 



150 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

confounded at his difcourfe, and knew not what^n 
fwer to make him. He looked earneftiy at me, feeing 
me in fome diforder : Sir, faid he, I fhall be very 
forry, if what I have faid gives you any offence. 
No, no, faid I, I am oiffended with nobody but my- 
felf ; but I am perfediy confounded, not only to 
think tliat I Ihould never take any notice of thi« be- 
fore, but with refleifting what notice I am able to 
take of it now. You know. Sir, faid I, what dr- 
cumftances I am in ; I am bound to the Eafi Indies^ 
in a fhip freighted by merchants, and to whom it 
would be an infuflferable piece of injufticc to detmii 
their fliip here, the men lying all this while at vic- 
tuals and wages upon the owner^s account : it is; 
true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here ; and 
if I flay more, I mud pay 3I. fterling per diem de- 
murrage ; nor can I ftay upon demurrage above 
eight days more; and I have been here thirteen 
days already : So that I am perfeftly unable to engage 
in this work, unlefs I would fuffer myfelf to be left 
behind here again ; in which cafe, if this fmgle fiiip 
Ihould mifcarry in any part of her voyage, I ihould 
be juft in the fame condition that I was left in here 
at firft ; and from which I have been fo wonderfully 
delivered. 

He owned the cafe was very hard upon me as to 
my voyage ; but laid it home upon my confcience^ 
whether the bleffing of faving feven-and-thirty fouls, 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world 
for ? I was not fo fenfible of that as he was : and I 
returned upon him thus : Why, Sir, it is a valuable 
thing indeed, to be an inftrument in God's hand, to 

convert

convert feven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of 
Chrift ; but as you are an ecclefiaftic, and are given 
over to that work, fo that it feems naturally to fall 
into the way of your profeffion, how is it then, that 
you do not rather offer yourfelf to undertake it, than 
prefs me to it ? 

Upon this he faced about, jufl: before me, as he 
walked along, and, putting me to a full ftop, made 
me a very low bow : I mod heartily thank God, and 
you. Sir, fays he, for giving me fo evident a call to 
fo bleffed a work j and if you think yourfelf dif- 
charged from it, and defire me to undertake it, I*' 
will moft readily do it, and think it a happy reward 
for all the hazards and difficulties of fuch a 
broken, difappointed voyage as I have met with, 
that I have dropped at laft into fo glorious a 
work. 

I difcovered a kind of rapture in his face, while 
he fpoke this to me ; his eyes fparkled like fire, his 
face glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he 
had been falling into fits : in a word, he was fired 
.with the joy of being embarked in fuch a work. I 
paufed a confiderable while before I could tell what 
to fay to him ; for I was really furprifed to find a 
man of fuch fincerity and zeal, and carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profeffion only, but even of any profeffion whatfo- 
ever : but, after I had confidered it a while, I afked 
him ferioufly,. if he was in earneft, and that he would 
venture on the fingle confideration of an attempt on 
thofe poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted ifland 
for, perhaps, his life ; and at laft, might not know 
L 4 whether 



152 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

whether he fhould be able to do them any good or 
not ? 

He turned fhort upon me, and alked me, what I 
called a venture ? Pray, Sir, faid he, what do you 
think I confented to go in your fhip to the Eaji In^ 
dies for ? Nay, faid I, that I know not, unlefs it was 
to preach to the Indians. Doubtlefs it was, faid he ; 
and do you think, if I can convert thefe feven-and- 
thirty men to the faith of Chrift, it is not worth 
my time, though I fhould never be fetched off the 
iliand again ? Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth 
to fave fo many fouls, than my Ufe is, or the life of 
twenty more of the fame profeffion ? Yes, Sir, fays 
he, I would give Chrifl and the BlefTed Virgin thanks 
all my days, if I could be made the leafl happy in- 
ftrument of faving the fouls of thefe poor men^ 
though I was never to fet my foot off this ifland, or 
fee my native country any more : But fmce you will 
honour me, fays he, with putting me into this work, 
(for which I will pray for you all the days of my life) 
I have one humble petition to you, faid he, befides. 
What is that? faid I. . Why, fays he, it is, that 
you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my 
interpreter to them, and to affifl me ; for, without 
fome help, I cannot fpeak to them, or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requefling Fridajy 
becaufe I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reafons : He had been the companion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
fmcerely affeftlonate to the lafl degree ; and I had 
ref©lved to do fomething cotifiderable for him, if he 
out-lived me, as it was probable he would: then \ 
knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be a Proteftant, 

it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

it would quite confound him, to bring him to em* 
brace another profeffion ; and he would never, while 
his eyes were open, believe that^ his old mafter was 
an heretic, and would be damned ; and this might 
in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and fo 
turn him back again to his firft idolatry. 

However, a fudden thought relieved me in this 
ftrait, and it was thi$ : I told him, I could not fay 
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account 
whatever ; though a work, that to him was of more 
value than his life, ought to me to be of much more 
value than the keeping or parting with a fervant. 
But, on the other hand, I was perfuaded, that 
Friday would by no means confent to part with me ; 
and then to force him to it, without his confent, 
would be manifefl injuftice ; becaufe I had promifed 
I would never put him away ; and he had promifed 
and engaged to me that he would never leave me, 
unlefs I put him away. 

He feemed very much concerned at it ; for he had 
no rational accefs to thefe poor people, feeing he did 
not underftand^ one word of their language, nor 
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I 
told him, Friday^ father had learned SpaniJJj^ which 
I found he alfo underftood ; and he fhould ferve him 
for an interpreter : fo he was much better fatisfied, 
and nothing could perfuade him but he would ftay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another and very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the firft part of his objedions. 
When we came to the Englijhmen^ I fent for them 
all together ; and after fome accounts given them of 

what 



154 ^1^2 AND ADVENTURES 

what I had done for them, viz. what neceflary thing« 
I had provided for them, and how they were diftri- 
buted, which they were fenfible of, and very thank- 
ful for ; I began to talk to them of the fcandalous life 
they led, and gave them a full account of the notice 
the clergyman had already taken of it; and, »- 
guing how unchriftian and irreligious a life it was, I 
firft afked them, if they were married men or bache- 
lors ? They foon explained their condition to me, 
and fliewed me that two of them were widowersj and 
the other three were fingle men or bachelors : I alkcd 
them, with what confcience they could take thefe 
women, and lie with them, as they had done. Call 
them their wives, and have fo many children by theiti, 
and not be married lawfully to them ? 

They all gave me the anfwer that I expefted, n)iz. 
that there was nobody to marry them ; that they 
agreed before the governor to keep them as their 
wives ; and to keep them, and own them, as their 
wives ; and they thought, as things flood with them, 
they were as legally married as if they had been 
married by a parfon, and with all the formalities in 
the world. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in 
the fight of God, and were bound in confcience to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being otherwife, they might pretend they were not 
married, and fo defert the poor women and children 
hereafter ; and that their wives, being poor defolate 
women, friendlefs and moneylefs, would have no way 
to help themfelves : I therefore told them, that unlefs 
I was aflured of their honeft intent, I could do no- 
thing 



OF RtmiKsoK cktrso^* 155 

^iftg for them ; but would take care, that ^»hat £ 
did ihould be for the 'v^'omen and children, without 
tbem; and that unlefs they would give fome affur- 
ances that they would marry the women, I could 
not think it was convenient they fhould continue to- 
gether as man and wife ; for that it was both fcan- 
daiouB to men, and oflSaifive to God, who they could 
not thitik would blefs them, if they went on thus. 

Ail this paffed as I expected ; and they told me, 
Specially Wiii jiikins, who feeitied now to fpeak for 
the reft, that they loved their wives as well as if they 
had been born in their own native country, and 
would not leave them upon any account whatever ; 
and they did verily believe their wives were as vir- 
tuous suid as modeft, and did, to the utmoft of their 
fldll, as much for them, and for their children, as 
any women could pollibly do ; and they would not 
part with them on any account : And Will Atkins^ 
for his own particular, added, if any man would 
take him away, and oiFer to carry him home to 
Englandy and to make him captain of the beft man 
of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if 
he might not carry his wife and children with him ; 
and if there was a clergyman in the fliip, he would 
be married to her now, with all his heart. 

This was juft as I would have it ; the prieft was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off: 
So, to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman 
with me, and, if he was fmcere, I would have him 
married the next morning ; and bade him confider 
of it, and talk with the reft : He faid, as for him- 

felf. 



156 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

felf, he need not confider of it at all ; for he was very 
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minifter with 
me ; and he believed they would be all willing alfo. 
I then told him, that my friend, the minifter, was 
a Frmchman^ and could not fpeak Englijh ; but that 
I would ad the clerk between them. He never fo 
much as afked me whether he was a Papift or Pro* 
teftant ; which was indeed what I was afraid of. 
But, I fay, they never enquired about it. So we 
parted : I went back to my clergyman ; and Will 
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de-* 
fired the French gentleman not to fay any thing to 
them, till the bufinefs was thorough ripe ; and I 
told him what anfwer the men had given me* 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me, they had been confidering what 
I had faid ; that they were very glad to hear I had 
a clergyman in my company ; and they were very 
willing to give me the fatisfaftion I defired, and ta 
be formally married as foon as I pleafed ; for they 
were far from defiring to part from their wives y and 
that they meant nothing but what was very honeft, 
when they chofe them : fo I appointed them to meet 
me the next morning ; and that, in the mean timcji. 
they fliould let their wives know the meaning of the 
marriage law ; and that it was not only to prevent 
any fcandal, but alfo to oblige them, that they 
fliould not forfake them, whatever might happen. 

The women were eafily made fenfible of the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well fatisfied with 
it, as, indeed, they had reafon to be j fo they failed 
not to attend all together, at my apartment, the

next morning, where I brought out my clergyman : 
and though he had not on a minifter's gown, after 
the manner of England^ or the habit of a prieft, 
after the manner of France ; yet having a black 
veft, fomething like a caffock, with a fa(h round it, 
he did not look very unlike a minifter ; and as for 
his language, I was interpreter. 

But the ferioufnefs of his behaviour to them, and 
the fcruples he made of marrying the women, be- 
caufe they were not baptized, and profefled Chrif- 
tians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his 
perfon j and there was no need after that to enquire 
whether he was a clergyman or no.. 

Indeed I was afraid his fcruple would have been 
carried fo far, as that he would not have married 
them at all: nay, notwithftanding all I was able to 
fay to him, he refifted me, though modeftly, yet 
very fteadily ; and at laft, refufed abfolutely to 
marry them, unlefs he had firft talked with the men, 
and the women too ; and though at firft I was a little 
backward to it, yet at laft I agreed to it with a 
good will, perceiving the fincerity of his defign. 

When he came to them, he let them know that 
I had acquainted him with their circumftances, and 
with the prefent defign ; that he was very willing to * 
perform that part of his funftion, and marry them, 
as I had defired ; but that, before he could do it, he 
muft take the liberty to talk with them ; he told 
them, that in the fight of all different men, and in 
the fenfe of the laws of fociety, they had lived all 
this while in an open adultery ; and that it was true, 
that nothing but the confenting to marry, or eflFec-

tually feparating them from one another now,^ could 
put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty in it Uoo^ 
with refpe£t to the laws of Chriftian matrimony, 
wtich he wa^ not fully fatisfie^ about, *viz» That o£ 
marrying one that is a profeffed Chriftian, to a la* 
vage, an idolater and an heathen, one that is not 
baptized ; and yet that he did not fee, that there 
was time left for it, to endeavour to perfuade the 
women to be baptized, or to profefe the name of 
Chrift, whom they had, he doubted, heard no« 
thing of, and without which they could not ba 
baptiz.ed. 

He told me, he doubted they were hut indifierent 
Chriftiang thcmfelves. ; that they had hut little i^aow- 
ledge of God, ox his ways ; and therefore he could 
not expeft, that they had laid much to their wives on 
that head yet; but that unlefs they would pro* 
mife him to ufe their endeavours with their wives^ 
to perfuade them to become Chriftians, and WQi|)4 
as well as they could inftruQ: them in the knowkdge 
and belief of Govt that made them, and tq worftup 
Jefus Chrift that redeemed them, he could not marrjr 
them ; for he would have no hand in joining Cbrif- 
tians with favages ; nor was it confiftent with the 
principles of the Chriftian religioii i. and was^ indeed, 
e^jprefsly forbidden in Gqd's law- 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deli* 
vered it very faithfully to them, from his mouth, as 
near his own words as I could, only fometimes adding 
fpmetbingof my own, to convince themhowjuftit 
was, and bow I was of bis mind r And I always v«ry 
faithfully diftinguiftied betwaen. what I faid from

aayfelf^ and what were the clergyman's words. They 
told me, it was very true what the gentleman had 
faid, that they were but very indifferent Chriftians 
themfelves, and that they had never talked to their 
wives about religion : Lord, Sir, fays Wili Atkins^ 
how (hould we teach them religion ? Why, we know 
nothing ourfelves ; and befides. Sir, faid he, fhauld 
we go to talk to them of God, and Jefus Chrift, ai^d 
heaven and hell, it would be to make them laugh at 
us, and aik us, what we believe ourfelves ? And if 
we fhould tell them, we believe all the things that 
we fpeak of to them, fuch as of good people going 
to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they 
would afk us, where we intended to go ourfelves, 
who believe all this, and yet are Aich wicked fel- 
lows, as we indeed are: Why, Sir, faid Willy 'tis 
fenough to give them a furfeit of religion, at firfl: 
hearing : folks muft have fome religion themfelves, 
before they pretend to teach other people.-^ff^/y/ 
Atkins J faid I to him, though I am afraid what you 
fey has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell 
your wife, that flie is in the wrong ? that there is a 
God, and a religion better than her own ; that her 
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear nor fpeak; 
that there is a great Being that madeajl things, and 
that can deftroy all that he has made; that he re- 
wards the good, and punifhes the bad ; that we are 
to be judged by him, at laft, for all we do here : ypu' 
are not fo ignorant, but even nature itfelf will t^adt 
you, that all this is true ; and I am fatisfied you know 
it all to be true, and believe it yourfelf* 

That's 



l6o LIFE AND ADVEKTURES 

V 

That's true. Sir, faid Jtkins ; but with what face 
can I fay any thing to my wife of all this, when flie 
will tell me immediately, it cannot be true ? 

Not true ! faid I, — ^what do you mean by that ? 
Why, Sir, faid he, fhe will tell me it cannot be true, 
that this God (I (hall tell her of) can be juft, or can 
punifli or reward, fince I am not punifhed, and fent 
to the devil, that have been fuch a wicked crea- 
ture as fhe knows I have been, even to her, and to 
every body elfe ; and that I fhould be fuflfered to 
Kve, that have been always a£l:ing fo contrary to what 
I muft tell her is good, and to what I ought to 
have done. 

Why truly, Atkins ^ faid I, I am afraid thou fpeakefi: 
too much truth : and with that I let the clergyman 
know what Atkins had faid ; for he was* impatient to 
know : O ! faid the prieft, tell him there is one 
thing will make him the beft minifter in the world 
to his wife, and that is repentance ; for none teach 
repentance like true penitents : He wants nothing 
but to repent, and then he will be fo much the bet- 
ter qualified to inftrudt his wife ; he will then be 
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and 
that he is the juft rewarder of good and evil j but 
that he is a merciful Being, and, with infinite good- 
nefs and long fuffering, forbears to punifli thofe that 
offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 
death of a finner, but rather that he fliould return 
and live ; that he often Tuffers wicked men to go on 
a long time, and even referves damnation to the ge- 
neral day of retribution : that it is a clear evidence 
of God, and of a future flate, that righteous men 

receive- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



i6i 



receive not their reward, or wicked men their pu- 
nifhment, till they come into another world ; and 
this will lead him to teach his wife the do£lrine of 
the refurredtion, and of the laft judgment : let him 
but repent for himfelf, he will be an excellent preacher 
of repentance to his wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins ^ who looked very fe- 
rious all the while, and who, we coi^ld eafily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affefted with it : 
when being eager, and hardly fufFering me to make 
an end — I knew, all tljis, mafter, fays he, and a 
great deal more ; but I han't the impudence to talk 
thus to my wife : when God, and my own con- 
fcience knows, and my wife will be an undeniable 
evidence againft me, that I have lived as if I had 
never heard of God, or a future ftate, or any thing 
about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and 
with that he fetched a deep figh ; and I could fee 
that tears ftood in his eyes) 'tis paft all that with me. 
Paftit! Atkins^ faid I: What doft thou mean by 
tha^ ? I know well enough what I mean. Sir, fays 
he ; I mean 'tis too late ; and that is too true. 

I told my clergyman word for word what he faid : 
the poor zealous prieft (I muft call him fo ; for be 
his opinion what it will, he had certainly a moft 
Angular afFeftion for the good of other men's fouls ; 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for 
his own ; I fay, this zealous, afFedionate man) could 
not refrain tears alfo : But recovering himfelf, he 
faid to me, Afk him but one queftion : Is he eafy 
that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wifhes it 
were not fo ? I put the queftion fairly to Atkins ; 

Vol. IL M and 



1 62 IIFE AND ADVENTURES^ 

and he anfwered with a great deal of paflion, How 
could any man be eafy in a condition that certainly 
muft end in eternal deftruftion ? That he was far 
from being eafy ; but that, on the contrary, he be-" 
lieved it would one time or the other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that ? faid I. Why, he 
faid, he believed he fhould, one time or another, 
cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror 
of it. 

The clergyman fhobk his head, with a great con^ 
cern in his face, when I told him all this; but, 
turning quick to me upon it, faid^ If that be his: 
cafe, you may aflure him it is not too late ; Chrift 
will give him repentance : But pray, fays he, ex- 
plain this to him. That as no man is faved but by 
Chrift, and the merit of his paflion, procuring dir- 
vine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any 
man to receive mercy ? Does he think he is able to 
fm beyond the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray 
tell him. There may be a time when provoked mercy 
will no longer ftrive, and when God may refufe ta 
hear ; but that 'tis never too late for men to a{k> 
mercy ; and we that are Chrift*s fervants are com- 
manded to preach mercy at all times, in* the name of 
Jefus Chrift, to all thofe that fincerely repent : fo 
that ^tis never too late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
earneftnefs ; but it feemed as if he turned oflf the 
difcourfe to the reft; for* he faid to me, he would 
go and have fome talk with his wife : fo he went out 
awhile, and we talked to the reft. I perceived they 
were all ftupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion ; 

much 



bF ROBINSON CRUSOE* t6^ 

Jhiicih as I was when I went rambling away from 
my father : and yet that there were none of them 
backward to hear what had been faid ; and all of 
them feribufly promifed, that they would talk with 
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to 
perfuade them to turn Chriftians. 

The clergyman fmiled upon nie, when I reported 
what anfwer they gaVe, but faid nothing a good while j 
but, at laft, fhaking his head, We that are Chrift's 
Servants, fays he, can go no farther than to exhort 
and inftrufl: ; and when men comply, fubmit to the 
reproof, and promife what we afk, *tis all we can do ; 
we are bound to accept their good words ; but, be- 
lieve me. Sir j faid he^ whatever you may have known 
of the life of that man you call William Atkins^ I 
believe he is the only fmcere Convert amotig them ; I 
tike that man to be a true penitent ; I won't defpair 
of the reft ; but that man is perfedtly ftruck with 
the fenfe of his paft life ; and I doubt not, but when 
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will 
talk himfelf effedtually into it; for attempting to 
teach others is fometimes the beft way of teaching 
ourfelves. I knew a man, added he, who, having 
nothing but a fummary notion of religion himfelf, 
and being wicked and profligate, to the laft degree, 
in' his life, made a thorough reformation in himfelf, 
by labouring to convert a Jew : And if that poor Au 
kins begins but once to talk ferioufly of Jefus Chrift 
to his wife, my life for it, he talks himfelf into a 
thorough convert, makes himfelf a penitent: and 
who knows what may follow ? 

Upon this difcourfe, however, and their promifing, 
as above, to endeavour to perfuade their wives to 

M 2 embrace 



164 I'IFE AND ADVENTURES 

embrace Chriftianity, he married the other three 
couple ; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while, 
was curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and, 
turning to me, fays he, I intreat you. Sir, let us 
walk out of your labyrinth here, and look ; I dare 
fay we fhall find this poor man fomewhere or other, 
talking ferioufly with his wife, and teaching her al- 
ready fomething of religion. I began to be of the 
fame mind ; fo we went out together ; and I carried 
him a way which none knew but myfelf, and where 
the trees were fo thick fet, as that it was not eafy to 
fee through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to 
fee in, than to fee out ; when coming to the edge of 
the wood, I faw Atkins^ and his tawny favage wife, 
fitting under the fhade of a bufli, very eager in dif- 
courfe : I ftpppped fhort, till my clergyman came up 
to me; and then, having (hewed him where they 
were, we flood and looked very fteadily at them a 
good while. 

We obferved him very earneft with her, pointing 
up to the fun, and to every quarter of the heavens ; 
then down to the earth, then out to the fea, then to 
himfelf, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
Now, fays my clergyman, you fee my words are 
made good ; the man preaches to her ; mark him; 
now he is telling her that our God has made him, 
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the fea, the 
woods, the trees, &c. I believe he is, faid I. Im- 
mediately we perceived Will Atkins ftart up upon his 
feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his hands; 
we fuppofed he faid fomething, but we could not 
hear him : it was too far off for that : he did not 

continue 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ID5 . 

continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and fits 
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We 
perceived then the woman very attentive ; but whe- 
ther fhe faid any thing or no, we could not tell. 
While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could 
fee the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's 
cheeks ; and I could hardly forbear myfelf ; but it 
was a great affliOiion to us both, that we were not 
near enough to hear any thing that paffed between 
them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for 
fear of difturbing them : fo we refolved to fee an end 
of this piece of ftill converfation ; and it fpoke loud 
enough to us, without the help of voice. He fat 
down again, as I have faid, clofe by her, and talked 
again earneftly to her ; and two or three times we 
could fee him embrace herpafEonately ; another time 
we faw him take out his handkerchief, and wipe her 
eyes, and then kifs her again, with a kind of tranf- 
port very unufual ; and after feveral of thefe things, 
we faw him on a fudden jump up again, and lend 
her his hand to help her up ; when immediately lead- 
ing her by the hand a ftep or two, they both kneeled 
down together, and continued fo about two mi- 
nutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out 
zlondj St. Pauly St. Paul / behold he prayeth ! — 
I was afraid Atkins would hear him ; therefore I in- 
treated him to withhold himfelf awhile, that we 
might fee an end of the fcene, which to me, I muft 
confefs, was the moll affeding, and yet the moft 
agreeable, that ever 1 faw in my life. Well, he 
ftrove with himfelf, and contained himfelf for a 

M 3 while.

begged that he would compofe himfelf, and let us 
more narrowly and fully obferve what was before uSj^ 
which he did for a time, and the fcene was not end-? 
f d there yet ; for, after the poor man and his wife 
were rifen again from their knees, we obferved he 
ftood talking ftill eagerly to her; and we obferved 
by her motion that (he was greatly affefted with what 
he faid, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying 
her hand to her breaft, and fuch other poftures, a$ 
ufually exprefs the greateft ferioufnefs and attention : 
This continued about half a quarter of an hour, and 
then they walked away tpo ; fo that we could £ee 
no more of them in that fituatjon. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman : 
and firft, I told him, I was glad to fee the particu- 
lars we had both been witneffes to ; that though I 
was hard enough of belief in fuch cafes, yet that I 
began to * think it was all very fmcere here, both in 
^he man and his wife, however ignorant they botl^ 
might be ; and I hoped fuch a beginning would have 
yet a more happy end : and who knows, faid I, 
but thefe two may in time, by inftrudlion and ex-

iSmple, work upon fome of the others ? Some of 
them ! faid he, turning quick upoti me, ay, upon 
all of thegi : depend upon it, if thofe two favages 
^fbr he ^m been but little better, as you relate it) 
Ihould embrace Jefus Chrift, they will never leave 
till tliey work upon all the reft ; fe>r' true religion is 
naturally communicative ; and he that is once made 
^ Chriftian will never leave a pagan behind him, tf 
he can help it. I owned it was a moft Chriftian 
principle to think fo, and a teftimony of a true zeal, 
jas well as a generous heart in him* But, my friend, 
faid I, will you give me liberty to ftart one difficulty 
here ? I cannot tell how to objeft the leaft thing 
againft that aifeftionate concern which you fhew for 
the turning the poor people from their paganifm to 
the Chriftian religion ; but how does this comfort 
you, while thefe people are, in your account, out 
of the pale of the Catholic church, without whkh, 
you believe, there is no falvation ; fo that you efteem 
thefe but heretics ftill ; and, for other reafons, as ef- 
feftually loft as the pagans themfelves .? 

To this he anfwered with abundance of candour 
and Chriftian charity, thus : Sir, I am a Catholic of 
the Roman churcb, and a prieft of the order of St. 
Benedi6l^ and I embrace all the principles of the Rq^ 
man faith : But yet, if you will believe me, and this 
\ do not fpeak in compliment to you, or jin refpefl:

verthelefs, I do notlook upon )'ou, who call yourfelves

tho' I know it is our opinion in general ; yet I dare 
not fay, that you cannot be faved ; I will by no means 
limit the mercy of Chrift, fo far as to think that he 
M 4 .cannot 



1 68 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

cannot receive you into the bofom of his church, in 
a manner, to us, imperceivable, and which, it is 
impoffible for us to know ; and I hope you have the 
fame charity for us : I pray daily for yo^fceing all 
reftored ro Chrift^s church, by whatfoever methods 
he, who is all wife, is pleafed to direft. In the 
mean time, fure, you will allow it to confift with 
me, as a Roman^ ito diftinguifli far between a Pro. 
teftant and a Pagan : between him that calls on Jefus 
Chrift, though in a way which I do not think is ac^ 
col^ding to the true faith ; and a^favage, a barbarian, 
that knows no God, no Chrift, no Redeemer at all : 
And if you are not within the pale of the Catholic 
church, we hope you are nearer being reftored to 
it, than thofe that know nothing at all of God, or 
his church. I rejoice, therefore, when I fee this poor 
man, who, you fay, has been a profligate, and al- 
moft a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jefus 
Chrift, as we fuppofe he did, though not fully en* 
lightened ; believing that God, from whom every 
fuch work proceeds, will fenfibly touch his heart, 
and bring him to the further knowledge of the truth 
in his own time : and if God fhall influence this 
poor man to convert and inftrufl: the ignorant fa- 
vage his wife, I can never believe that he ihall be 
caft away himfelf : and have I not reafon then to 
rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge 
of Chrift, though they may not be brought quite 
home into the bofom of the Catholic church, juft at 
the time* when I may defire it ; leaving it to the 
goodnefs of Chrift to perfeft his work in his own 
time, and his own way ? Certainly I would rejoice, 
if all the favages in America were brought, like this 

poor

poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to 
te all Proteftants at firft, rather than they fhould con- 
tinue pagans and heathens ; firmly believing, that 
he who ^ad beftowed that firft light upon them, 
would farther illuminate them with a beam of his 
heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of his 
church, when he fhould fee good. 

I was aftoniflied at the fincerity and temper of this 
trxily pious Papift, as much as I was oppreffed by the 
power of his reafoning : and it prefently occurred to 
my thoughts, that if fuch a temper was univerfal, 
we might be all Catholic Chriftians, whatever 
church or particular profeflion we joined to, or 
joined in ; that a fpirit of charity would foon work 
us all up^nto right principles ; and, in a word, as 
he thought that the like charity would make us all 
Catholics, fo I told him, I believed, had all the 
members of his church the like moderation, they 
would foon be all Proteftants : And there we left 
that part, for we never dilputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way; and, 
taking him by the hand. My friend, faid I, I wifh 
all the clergy of the Roman church were bleffed with 
fuch moderation, and an equal fhare of your cha- 
rity: lam entirely of your opinion; but I muft 
tell you, that if you ftiould preach fuch dodtrine 
in Spain or Italy ^ they would put you into the in- 
quifition. 

It may be fo, faid he ; I know not what they might 
do in Spain and Italy ; but I will not fay they would 
be the better Chriftians for that feverity; fori 
am fure there is no herefy in too much charity. 

Well,

we had feen him under the bufli, or no ; and it was 
his opinion we fhould not ; but that we ftiould talk 
to him firft, and hear what he would fay to us : fo 
we called him in alone, nobody being in the place 
but ourfelves ; and I began with him thus : 

Will Atkins^ faid I, prithee what education had 
you ? What was your father ? 

W. A. A better man than ever I fhall be. Sir, 
my father was a clergyman. 

R. C What education did he give you r 

W. A. He would have taught me well. Sir ; but 
I defpifed all education, inftruftion, or correftion, 
like a beaft as I was. 

R. C. It is true, Solomon fays " he that defpifeth 
^' reproof is brutifh." 

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifli indeed ; I mur- 
dered my father : for God's fake. Sir, talk no more 
about that. Sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Prieji. Ha ? a murderer ! 

[Here the priefl darted (for I interpreted every word 
as he fpoke it) and looked pale : It feems he believed 
that Will had really killed his own father.] 

R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not underftand him fo. 
Will Atkins y explain yourfelf : you did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own hands ? 

W. A. No, Sir ; I did not cut his throat ; but I 
cut the thread of all his comforts, and fhortened 

his

hi3 days ; I broke his heart by the moft ungrate- 
ful, unnatural return, for the moft tender, afFedion- 
ate treatment that ever father g^ve, or child could 
receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not aflc you about your father, to 
extort this confeffion ; I pray God give you repent- 
;^cefor it, and forgive you that, and all your other 
fins : but I afked you, becaufe I fee that though you 
have not much learning, yet you are not fo ignorant 
as fome are, in things that are good ; that you have 
known more of religion a great deal than you hs^vQ 
praftifed. 

W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the con* 
feffion that I make about my father, confcience does j 
^nd whenever we come to look back upon our lives, 
the fms againft our indulgent parents are certainly 
the firft that touch us ; the wounds they make lie 
deepeft ; and the weight they leave will lie heavieft 
upon the mind of all the fms we can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfible fpr me, 
Atkins ; I cannot bear it. 

W. A. Tou bear it, mafter ! I dare fay you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C, Yes, Atkins ; every fhore, every hill, nay, 
I may fay, every tree in this ifland, is witnefs to the 
anguifh of my foul, for my ingratitude, and bafe 
Vifage of a good tender father ; a father much like 
your's,^ by your defcription ; and I murdered my. 
father as well as you. Will Atki?7s ; .hut think, for 
all that, my repentance is fhort of your's too, by a 
great deal, 

fl would have faid more, if I could have reftrained my 
paffions 5 but I thought this poor man's repentance

was fo much fincercr than mine ; thit I was going to 
leave ofF the difcourfe, and retire^ for I was fur* 
prifed with what he faid j and thought that inftead 
of my going about to teach and inftrufl him, the 
man was made a teacher and inftruftor to me, in a 
• moft furprifing and unexpc£led manner.] 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who 
was greatly affefted with it, and faid to me. Did I 
not fay. Sir, that when this man was converted, he 
would preach to us all ? I tell you. Sir, if this one 
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need 
of me ; he will make Chriftians of all in the ifland^ 
But having a little compofed myfelf, I renewed my 
difcourfe with Will Atkins. 

But, Willj faid I, how comes the fenfe of this 
matter to touch you juft now ? 

W. A. Sir, you have fet me about a work that 
has ftruck a dart through my very foul ; I have been 
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order, 
as you dTrefted me, to make a Chriftian of her ; and 
flie has preached fuch a fermon to me as I fliall never 
forget while I live. / 

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached 
to you : but when you were moving religious argu- 
ments to her, confcience has flung them back upon 
you. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, with fuch a force as is not to 
be refifled. 

R. C. Pray, W7//, let us know what pafled be- 
tween you and your wife ; for I know fomething of 
it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impoflible to give you a full ac- 
count of it : I am too full to hold it, and yet have 

no 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

no tongue to exprefs it : but let her have faid what 
flie will, and though I cannot give you an account 
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I refolve to 
amend and reform my life. 

R. C. But tell us fome of it. How did you be- 
gin, Will? For this has been, an extraordinary cafe, 
that is certain ; fhe has preached a fermon, indeed, 
if Ihe has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I firft told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reafons were that 
men and women were obliged to enter into fucU 
compafts, as it was neither in the power of one or 
other to break ; that otherwife, order and juftice 
could not be maintained, and men would run from 
their wives, and abandon their children, mixcon- 
fufedly with one another, and neither families be 
kept entire, or inheritances be fettled by a legal de-' 
fcent. 

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you 
make her underftand what you meant by inheri- 
tance and families ? They know no fuch thing 
among the favages, but marry any how, without 
any regard to relation, confanguinity, or family ; 
brother and fifler, nay, as I have been told, even 
the father and daughter, and the fon and the mo- 
ther. 

W. A. I believe. Sir, you are mifmformed ;— • 
my wife affures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it. Perhaps, for any further relations, they 
may not be fo exaft as we are ; but fhe tells me they 
never touch one another in the near relations you 
fpeak of. 

i?. C. Well, 



174 ^^^^ -^N^ ADVENTURES 

R. C. Well, what did ihe fay to what you told 
her? 

W. A. She faid fhe Hked it very well j and it was 
much better than iii her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I 
affced her. If fhe would be married to me our way ? 
She alked me. What way that was ? I told her mar- 
riage was appointed of God ; and here we had a 
ftrange talk together indeed, as ever man and wifef 
had, I believe- 

[N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wife, 
as I took it down in writing, juft after he told it me, 
was as follows : 

Wife. Appointed by your God ! Why, have you 
a God in your country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country ? 

Wife. No your God in my country ; my country 
have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to fhew you who 
God is ; God is in heaven, and made the heavea 
and the earth, the fea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God makee 
de earth j no make my country. 

IW, A. laughed a little at her expreflion of God not 
making her country.] 

Wife. No laugh : Why laugh me ? This no ting 
to laugh. 

[He was juftly reproved by his wife; for fhe was more 
ferious than he at fir ft.] 

W. A. That's 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 75 

W. A. That's true indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 

Wife. Why you lay, you God make all ? 

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole 
Ivorld, and you, and me, and all things ; for he is 
the only true God j there is no God but he j he lives 
for ever in heaven. 

Wife: Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true indeed ; but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have, not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with any thing before, but have lived 
without God in the world myfelf* 

Wife* What have you de great God in your coun- 
try, you no know him ? No fay O to him ? No do 
good ting for him ? That no impoffible ! 

W. A. It is too true though, for all that : we live 
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no 
power on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do fo ? Why he no 
makee you good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

Wife, But you fay me, he is great, much great, 
have much great power ; can make kill when he 
will 2 why he no makee kill when you no ferve hini ? 
No fay O to him ? No be good mans ? 

W. A. That is true ; he might ftrike me dead, 
and I ought to expeft it ; for I have been a wicked 
wretch, that is true : but God is merciful, and does 
not deal with us as we deferve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for 
that too? 

W. A. No, indeed ; I have not thanked God for 
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for his 
power. 

Wife. 



176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Jflfe. Then you God no God ; me no think, be- 
lieve he be fuch one, great much power, ftrong; 
no makee kill you, though you makee him much 
angry ? 

W. A. What ! will my wicked life hinder you 
from believing in God ! What a dreadful creature 
am I ! And what a fad truth is it, that the horrid 
lives of Chriltians hinder the converfion of heathens! 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God up 
there, (jhe points up to heaven^) and yet no do well, 
no do good ting ? Can he tell ? Sure he no tell what 
you do. 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all things ; he 
hears us fpeak, fees what we do, knows what we 
think, though we do not fpeak. 

Wife. What ! he no hear you fwear, curfe, fpeak 
the great damn ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great power 
ftrong ? 

W. A. He is merciful ; that is all we can fay for 
it ; and this proves him to be the true God : He is 
God, and not man ; and therefore we are not con- 
fumed. 

[Here Will Athifjs told us, he was ftruck with horror 
to think how he could tell his wife fo clearly, that 
God fees, and hears, and knows the fecret thoughts 
of the heart, and all that we do j and yet that he 
had dared to do all the vile things he had done.] 

Wife. Merciful ! what you call dat ? 
W. A. He is our father and maker j and he pities 
and fpares us. 

I Wife.

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry 
When you do wicked ; then he no good himfelf, or 
iio great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear ; he is infinitely good, 
and infinitely great, and able to punifii too ; and 
fometimes to fhew his juftice and vengeance, he lets 
fly his anger to deftroy finners, and make examples j 
many are cut ofi" in their fins. 

Wifck But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell 
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, fo you 
make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he 
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other 
mans ? 

W. A. No, indeed, my fins are all prefiimptions 
upon his goodnefs ; and he would be infinitely juft, 
if he deftroyed me, as he has done other men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ! 
What you fay to him for that ? You no tell him 
tankee for all that too ! 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that 
IS true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better ? 
You fay he makee you. 

W. A. He made me as he made all the world ; 
*tis I have deformed myfelf, and abufed his goodnefs, 
and have made myfelf an abominable wretch. 

Wife. I wifh you makee God know me j I no 
makee him angry j I no do bad wicked ting. 

[Here Will Atkins faid his heart funk within him, to 
hear a poor, untaught creature, defire to be taught 
to know God ; and he fiich a wicked wretch, that 
he could not fay one word to her about God, but 
what the reproach of his own carriage would make

moft irrational to her to believe ; nay, that already 
(be could not believe in God, becaufe he that was fo 
wicked was not deftroyed.] 

JT. A. My dear, you mean you wifh I could teach 
you to know God> not God to know you ; for he. 
knows you already,- and every thought in your 
heart. 

Wife. Why then he know what I faw to you now ; 
he know me wifh to know him j how Ihall me know 
who makee me ? 

W. A. Poor creature, he muft teach thee, I can- 
not teach thee ; Til pray to him to teach thee to know 
him J and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to 
teach thee. 

[The poor fellow was in fuch an agony at her defiring 
him to make her know God, and her wifliing td 
know him, that, he faid, he fell down on his knees 
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her 
mind with the faving knowledge of Jefus Chrift, 
and to pardon his fins, and accept of his being the 
unworthy inftrument of inftrufting her in the prin- 
ciples of religion 5 after which he fat down by her 
again, aridriheir dialogue went on.] 
. N. B. This was the time when we faw him kneel down 
and lift up his hands. 

Wife. What you put down the knee for ? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you fay ? Who 
you fpeak to ? What is that ? 

W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my 
fubmiflion to him that made me : I faid O to him, 
as you call it, and as you fay your old men do to 
their idol Benamuckee ; that is, I prayed to him. 

Wife. 



OF ROBINSON CRtTSOS. 1 79 

Wife. What you fay O to him for ? 

W. A. I prayed to him to open yAar eyes and 
your underftanding, that you may know him, and 
be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too ? 

W. A. Yes, he can ; he can do all things* 

Wife. But he no hear what you fay ? 

W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him ; and pro- 
mifed to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How he 
bid you ? What you hear him fpeak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear him fpeak ; but he 
has revealed himfelf many ways to us. 

[Here he was at a great lofs to make her underftand 
that God had revealed himfelf to us by his word; 
and what his word was \ but at laft he told it her dius : 

W. A. God has fpoken to fome good men in for- 
mer days, even from heaven, by plain words ; and 
God has infpired good men, by his Spirit ; and they 
have written all his laws down in a book. 

Wife. Me no underftand that : where is book ? 

W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this 
book ; but I hope I fhall, one time or other, get it 
for you to read it. 

[Here he embraced her with great affeftion ; but with 
inexpreflible grief, that he had not a bible.] 

Wife. But how you makee me know, that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the fame rule that we know him to be 
God. 

Wife. What rule j what way you know ? 

N 2 W.A. Be- 



18*0 LIJFE AND Al)VENTU^ES 

W. A. Becatife he teaches and commands nothiilg; 
but what is good, righteous, and holy ; and tends 
to make us perfectly good, as well as perfe6lly happy j 
and becaufe he forbids, and commands us to avoid 
all that is wicked, that is evil in itfelf, or evil in its 
confeqiiences. 

Wife. That me would tinderftand, that me ftiin 
fee ; if he reward all good thing, punifh all wicked 
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked 
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing j he 
hear me when I fay O to him, as you go to do jufli 
now ; he makee me good, if I wife be good ; he 
fpare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good ; all 
this you fay he do ; yes, he be great God ; me take, 
think, believe, him be great God j me fay O to him 
too, with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man faid he could forbear no 
longer ; but raifing her up, made her kneel by him ; 
and he prayed to. God aloud, to inftru£t her in the 
knowledge of himfelf, by his Spirit ; and that by 
fome good providence, if poffible, flie might fome 
time or other come to have a bible, that fhe might 
read the word of God, and be taught by him to 
know him, 

[This was the time that we faw him lift her up by the • 
hand, and faw him kneel down by her, as above.] 

They had feveral other difcourfes, it feems, after 
this, too long to fet down here ; and particularly 
fhe made him promife, that fince he confeffed his 
own life had been a wicked, abominable courfe of 
provocation againft God, that he. would reform it, 
and not make God angry any more, left he ftiould

make him dead^ as (he called it, and then ihe Ihould 
ht left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and left he fliould be miferable, as he had 
told her Wicked men fliould be after death. 

This was a ftraiige account, and very afFcfting to 
us both j but particularly the young clergyman : he 
wai ihdeed wotiderFuily furprifed with it , but under 
the gteateft affli^ion Imaginable, that he could not 
talk to her ; that he could not fpeak Englijh to make 
her underftand him ; and as (he fpoke but very 
broken Englijh^ he could not underftqind her* How- 
ever^ he turned himfelf to me, and told me, that 
he believed there muft be more to do with this wo- 
man than to marry her ; I did not underftand him 
at fijft } but at length he e2?:plained himfelf j viz^ 
That flie ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for 
going about it prefently : No, no ; hold. Sir, faid 
he, though I would have her baptized by all means, 
yet I muft obferve, that Will Atkins l^^r huft)and, has 
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be 
willing to embrace a religious life i and has giyen 
her juft ideas of the being of a God, of his power, 
juftice, and mercy ; yet I defire to know of him, if 
he has faid any thing to her of Jefus Chrift, and of 
• the falvation of fmners ; of the nature of faith in 
him ; and the redemption by him j of the holy Spi- 
rit, the refurreftion, the laft judgment, ai^d a fu- 
ture ftate. 

I called Will Atkins again, and afked him ; but the 

poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us, 

^e had faid fomething to her of all thofe things, but 

jtbat he was himfelf fo wicked a creature, and his 

N 3 own

own confcience fo reproached him with his horrid^ 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the appreheniioBS, 
that her knowledge of him fliould leffen tiie attention 
flie fliould give to thofe things, and make her rather 
contemn religion, than receive it: but. he was af- 
fured, he faid, that her mind was fo difpofed to re- 
ceive due impreffions of all thofe things, that if I 
would but difcourfe with her, flie would make it 
appear to my fatisfaftion, that my labour woiJd not 
be loft upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf 
as interpreter, between my religious prieft and the 
woman, I entreated him to begin with her : but fure 
fuch a fermon was never preached by a popifli prieft 
in thefe latter ages of the world ; and, as I told him, 
I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all 
the fmcerity of a Chriftian, without the errors of a 
Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be fuch a 
clergyman as the Roman bifliops were, before the 
church of Rome afTumed fpiritual fovereignty over 
the confciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-^ 
brace the knowledge of Ghrift, and of redemption 
by him, not witli wonder and aftonifliment only, as 
Ihe did the firft notions of a God, but with joy and 
faith, with an affedtion, and a (urprifmg degree of 
under ftanding, fcarce to be imagined, .much lefs to 
be expreffed ; and at her own requeft flie was bap- 
tized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I en- 
treated him, that he would perform that office with 
fome caution, Ithat the man might not perceive he 
was of the Roman church, if poffible j becaufe of 

other 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

Other ill confequences which might attend a difference 
among us in that very religion which we were in- 
ftrufting the other in. He told me, that as he had 
no confecrated chapel, nor proper things for the 
office, I fhould fee he would do it in a manner, that 
I fhould not know by it that he was a Roman Ca- 
tholic myfelf, if I had not known it before : and 
fo he did ; for faying only fome words over to him- 
felf in L^fm, which I could not underftand,he poured 
a whole difli full of waiter upon the woman's head, 
pronouncing in French very loud, Mary ; which was 
the name her hufband defired me to give her, for I 
was her god-father, / baptize thee in the name of 
the Father J and of the Son^ and of the Holy Ghoji ; 
fo that none could know any thing by it, what reli- 
gion he was of : he gave the benediftion afterwards 
in Latin ; but either Will Atkins did not know but it 
was in French^ or elfe did not take notice of it at 
that time. 

As foon as this was over, he married them ; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned himfelf to 
Will Atkins^ and in a very affeftionate manner ex- 
horted him not only to perfevere in that good difpo- 
lition he was in, but to fupport the conviftions that 
were upon him, by a refolution to reform his life : 
told him, it was in vain to fay he repented, if he 
did not forfake his crimes j reprefented to him, how 
God had honoured him with being the inftrument 
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chrif- 
tian religion ; and that he fhould be careful he did 
not difhonour the grace of God; and that, if he 
did, he would fee the heathen a better Chriftian than

H^ faid a great many good things to them both, 
and then recommended them, in a few words, to 
God's goodpefs; g^ve them the benediftion again, 
I reputing every thing to them in Englijh : And thua 
ended the ceremony. \ think it was the moft.plea-. 
fant, agreeable day to me^ that ever I paffed in my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the eonverfion of the 37 fa^ 
vages ? and fain he would have flaid upon the iflancl 
to have undertaken it : but I. convinced hina, Firft, 
that his undertaking was imptafticable in itfelf } and 
fecoi^dly, that, perhaps, I could put it into a way o£ 
being done, in his abfence, to his fatisfaftion ; of- 
which by and by. 

Having thus brought the affair of the ifland to a 
narrow compaft, I was preps^ring to go on board the 
ihip, when the young man, whom I had taken out 
of the faniiflied fliip's company, came to me, and 
told me, he underftood I had a clergyman with me, 
and that I had caufed the Englijhmen to be married to 
the fa vages, whom they called wives ; that he had a 
match too, which hq defired might be finiflied before 
I went, between two Chriftians j which he hoped 
w^ould not be difagreeable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young woman who was 
his mother's fervant, for there was no other Chriftian 
woman on the ifland ; fq I began to perfuade him 
not to do any thing of that kind rafhly, or becaufq 
he found himfelf in this folitary circumftance : I rc- 
prefented, that he had fome confiderable fubftance in

the world* and good friends, as I underftood by him* 
felf, and by his maid alfo ; that the maid was not only 
poor, and a fervant, but was unequal to him, flie 
being twenty-fix or twenty-fevcn years old, and he 
not above fev^nteen or eighteen; that he might very 
probably, with my afliftance, make a remove from 
this wildernefs, and come into his own country again; 
arid that then it would be a thoufand to one but he 
would repent his choice; and the diflike of that cir- 
cumftance might be difadvantageous to both. I was 
gping to fay more, but he interrupted me, fmiling ; 
and told me, with a great deal of modefty, that I 
miftgok in my gueffes ; that he had nothing of 
that kind in his thoughts, his prefent circum- 
ftances being melancholy and difconfolate enough ; 
and he was very glad to hear, that I had fome 
thoughts of putting them in a way to fee their 
own country again;, and that nothing Ihould have 
fet him upon flaying there, but that the voyage I 
was going was fo exceeding long and hazardous, and 
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his 
friends ; that he had nothing to defire of me, but 
that I would fettle him in fome little property in the

fome few neceffaries, and he would fettle himfelf 
here like a planter, waiting the good time .when, if 
ever I returned to England ^ I would redeem him,

His difcourfe was very prettily delivered, confi- 
dering his youth ; and was the more agreeable to 
me, becaufe he told me pofitively the match was not 
for himfelf. I gave him all pofSble aflurances, that 
if I lived- to come fafe to England j I would deliver 
his letters, and do his bufinefs effedlually ; and that 
he might depend I would never forget the circum- 
ftances I left him in ; but flill I was impatient to. 
know who was the perfon to be married : Upon 
which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades, and 
his maid Sufan. 

I was moft agreeably furprifed when he named 
the match ; for indeed I had thought it very fuita- 
ble. The character of that man I have given al« 
ready ; and as for the maid, fhe was a very honeft, 
modeft, fober, and religious young woman ; had a 
very good (hare of fenfe ; was agreeable enough in 
her perfon ; fpoke very handfomely, and to the pur- 
pofe ; always with decency and good manners, and 
not backward to fpeak when any thing required it, 
or impertinently forward to fpeak when it was not 
her bufinefs; very handy and houfewifely in any 
thing that was before her ; an excellent manager, . 
and fit indeed to have been governefs to the whole 
ifland ; fhe knew very well how to behave herfelf to 
all kind of folks Ihe had about her, and to better, if 
fhe had found any there. 

The match being propofed in this manner, we 
married them the fame day ; and, as I was father 
at the altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, fo I 

gave

gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her huf- 
band a handfome large fpace of ground for their 
plantation ; and, indeed, this match, and the pro- 
pofal the young gentleman made to me, to give him 
afmall property in the ifland, put me upon parcel- 
ling it out among them, that they might not quarrel 
afterwards about their fituation. 

This fharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins J who, indeed, was now grown a moft fober, 
grave, managing fellow ; perfeftly reformed, exceed- 
ing pious and religious ; and,- as far as I may be al- 
lowed to fpeak pofitively in fuch a cafe, I verily be- 
lieve, was a true fincere penitent. 

He divided things fo juftly, and fo much to every 
one's fatisfaflion, that they only defired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole j which I caufed 
to be drawn up, and figned and fealed to them, fet- 
ting out the bounds and fituation of every man's 
plantation, and teftifying, that I gave them thereby, 
feverally, a right to the whole poffefEon and inhe- 
ritance of the refpeftive plantations or farms, with 
their improvements, to them and their heirs; re- 
ferving all the reft of the ifland as my own property, 
and a certain rent for every particular plantation, 
after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in 
my name, came to demand it, producing an attefted 
copy of the fame writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them, I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themfelves ; only 
made them promife me, to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another ; And fo I prepared 
to leave them* 

One 



i88 LIFK AND ADVENTURES 

One thing I muft not omit ; and that is> that bang 
now fettled in a kind of commonwealth among them^ 
felves, and having much bufinefs a in hand, it was 
but odd to have feveni^nd-thirty Indians live in a 
nook of the ifland, independent, and, indeed, un<^ 
employed ; for, excepting the providing themfelves 
food, which they had difficulty enough in doing fome* 
times, they had no manner of bufinefs or property 
to manage: I propofed therefore to the governor 
Spaniard^ that he fhould go to them yrith Fridaft 
father, and propofe to them to remove, and either 
plant for themfelves, or take them into their feveral 
families as fervants, to be maintained for their la^ 
bour, but without being abfolute flaves ; for I would 
not admit them to msie them flaves by force, by 
any means, becaufe they had their liberty given by 
capitulation, and, as it were, articles of furrender^ 
which they ought not to break. 

They mod willingly embraced the propofal, and 
came all very chearfuUy along with him ; fo we al- 
lotted them land and plantations, which three or 
four accepted of, but all the reft chofe to be em- 
ployed as fervants in the feveral families we had fet- 
tled ; and thus my colony was in a^manner fettled, 
as follows : The Spaniards poflefled my original hai« 
bitation, which was the capital city, and extended 
their plantation all along the fide of the brook, 
which made the creek that I have fo often defcribed, 
as far as my bower ; and as they increafed their cul- 
ture, it went always eaftward ; the Englijh lived in 
the north-eaft part, where Will Atkins and his com- 
rades began, and came on fouthward and fouth^ 
weft, towards the back part of the Spaniard^ ; and 

every 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. iSg 

every plantation had a great addition of land to take 
in, if they found occafion ; fo that they need not 
joftle one another for want of room. 

All the weft end of the ifland was left uninhabited, 
that if any of the favages fhould come on fhore there, 
only for their ufual cuftomary barbarities, they might 
come and go ; if they difturbed nobody, nobody 
would difturb them ; and no doubt but they were 
often afliore, and went away again ; for I never heard 
that the planters were ever attacked and difturbed any 
more. 

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted 
to my friend the clergyman, that the work of con- 
verting the favages might, perhaps, be fet on foot in 
his abfence, to his fatisfaftion ; and I told him, that 
now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for the fa- 
vages being thus divided among the Chriftians, if 
they would but every one of them do their part with 
thofe which came under their hands, I hoped it might 
have a very good effefl:. 

He agreed prefently in that : If, faid he, they will 
do their part ; but how, fays he, fhall we obtain that 
of them ? I told him, we would call them all together, 
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one 
by one, which he thought beft ; fo we divided it ; 
he to fpeak to the Spaniards^ who were all Papifts ; 
and I to the Englijhj who were all Proteftants ; and 
we recommended it earneftly to them, and made 
them promiie, that they would never make any dif- 
tinOtion of Papift or Proteftant, in their exhorting 
the favages to turn Chriftians ; but teach them the 
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa- 
viour 



tgo LiFE AND ADVENTURES 

viour Jefus Chrift; and they like wife promifed u$) 
that they would never have any diflferences or dit 
putes, one with another, about religion. 

When I came to Will Atkinses houfe (I may call it 
fo ; for fuch a houfe, or fuch a piece of balket-work, 
I believe was not {landing in the world again !) I fay, 
when I came thither, I found the young woman I 
have mentioned above, and William Atkins*^ wife, 
were become intimates ; and this prudent, religious 
young woman, had perfedled the work Will Atkins 
had begun ; and though it was not above four' days 
after what I have related, yet the new-baptized fa- 
vage woman was made fuch a Chriftian, as I have 
feldom heard of any like her, in all my obfervation 
or converfation in the world. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning, be- 
fore I went to them, that among all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a 
bible ; in which I Ihewed myfelf lefs confidering for 
them, than my good friend the widow was for me, 
when flie fent me the cargo of lool. from Lijborij 
where flie packed up three bibles and a prayer-book* 
However, the good woman's charity had a greater 
extent than ever flie imagined ; for they were re- 
ferved for the comfort and inftruftion of thofe that 
made much better ufe of them than I had done. 

I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when 
I came to William Atkins* % tent, or houfe, I found the 
young woman, and Atkins*^ baptized wife, had been 
difcourfmg of religion together ; ^for William Atkins 
told it me, with a greal deal of joy.) I alked, if they 
were together now ? And he faid yes ; fo I went 
into the houfe, and he with me, and we found them 

together,

OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. I^I 

together, very earneft in difcourfe : O, Sir, fays WiU 
liam Atkins^ when God has finners to reconcile 
to himfelf, and aliens to bring home, he ne- 
ver wants a meffenger: My wife has got a new 
inftruftor ; I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapa- 
ble of that work ; that young woman has been fent 
hither from Heaven ; fhe is enough to convert a 
whole ifland of favages. The young woman bluflied, 
and rofe up to go away, but I defired her to fit ftill j 
I told her flie had a good work upon her hands, and 
I hoped God would blefs her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though I did not alk ; 
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my 
bible ; Here, faid I to Atkins^ I have brought you 
an affiftant, that, perhaps, you had not before. The 
man was fo confounded, that he was not able to 
fpeak for fome time; but recovering himfelf, he 
takes it with both hands, and, turning to his wife. 
Here, my dear, fays he, did not I tell you, our 
God, though he lives above, could hear what we 
faid ? Here is the book I prayed for, when you and 
I kneeled down under the bufli ; now God has heard 
us and fent it. When he had faid thus, the man 
fell into fuch tranfports of a paflionate joy, that be- 
tween the joy of having it, and giving God thanks 
for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that 
was crying. 

The woman was furprized, and was like to have 
run into a miftake, that none of us were aware of; 
for fhe firmly believed God had fent the book upon 
her hufband's petition : It is true, that providentially 
it was fo, and might be taken fo in a confequent 

fenfe J 



192 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fenfe ; but I believed it would have been no difficttit 
matter, at that time, to have perfuaded the poof 
woman to have believed, that an exprefs meflengef 
came from heaven, on purpofe to bring that indivi- 
dual book ; but it was too ferious a matter to fufFef 
any delufion to take place : So I turned to the 
young woman, and told her, we did not defire ta 
irapofe upon the i^ew convert, in her firft and more 
ignorant underftanding of things j and begged Ixer 
to explain to her, that God may be very properly 
faid to anfwer our petitions, when in the courfe of 
his Providence, fuch things are, in a particular 
manner, brought to pafs, as we petitioned for ; but 
we do not expeft returns from Heaven, in a miracu- 
lous and particular manner ; and that it is our mercy 
it is not fo. 

This the young woman did afterwards effeftually ; 
fo that there was, I affure you, no prieftcraft ufed 
here ; and I fhould have thought it one of the moft 
unjuftifiable frauds in the world, to have had it fo : 
but the furprize of joy upon Will Atkins^ is really 
not to be exprefled ; and there, we may be ftlre, wa^ 
no delufion. Sure no man was ever more thankful 
in the world for any thing of its kind, than he was 
for this bible ; and I believe, never any man was 
glad of a bible from a better principle ; and though 
he had been a moft profligate creature, defperate, 
headftrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a 
great degree ; yet this man is a ftanding rule to us 
all, for the well inftrufting children ; viz. That pa- 
rents Ihould never give over to teach and inftruft, or 
ever defpair of the fuccefs of their endeavours, let 
the children be ever fo obftinate, refraftory, or, to 

appear- 



QF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I93, 

iaippearance, infenfible of inftrudion ; for if ever 
God in his Providence touches the confciences of 
fuch, the force of their education returns upon them, 
and the early inftruftion of parents is not loft, 
though it may have been many years laid afleep ; 
but, fome time or other, they may find the benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man. However igno- 
rant he was, or diverted of religion and Chriftiaa 
knowledge, he found he had fome to do with now more 
ignorant than himfelf ; and that the leaft part of the 
inftriiftion of his good father, that could now come 
to his mind, was of ufe to him. 

Among the reft it occurred to him, he faid, how 
his father ufed to infift much upon the inexpreffible 
value of the bible ; the privilege and blefling of it 
to nations, families, and perfons ; but he never en- 
tertained the leaft notion of the worth of it till now j 
when, being to talk to heathens, favages, and bar- 
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for 
his affiftance. 

The young woman was very glad of it alfo, for 
the prefent occafion, though fhe had one ; and fo 
had the youth on board our ftiip, among the goods 
which were not yet brought on Ihore. And now, 
having faid fo many things of this young woman, I 
cannot omit telling one ftory more of her and my- 
felf, which has fomething in it very informing and 
remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young 
woman was reduced ; how her miftrefs was 
ftarv^ to death, and did die, on board that un- 
happy fiiip we met at fea ; and how the whole fhip's 

Vol. II. O company 



194 ^I^E AND At)VENTt^kl2/ 

company being reduced to the laft extremitf, (he 
gentlewoman, and her fon, and this maid, were firft 
hardly ufed, as to provifions j and, at laft, totally 
negleded and ftarved ; that h to fay, brought to 
the laft extremity of hunger. 

One day, being difcourfing with het upon the ex- 
tremities they fufFered, I alked her, if ftie could de-» 
fcribe, by what fhe felf, what it was to ftarve, and 
how it appeared? She told me^ Ihe believed flie 
could ; and ftie told her tale very diftindly thus : 

Firft, Sir, faid (he, we had for fome days fared 
exceeding hard, and fufFered very great hunger ; but 
now, at laft, we were wholly without food of any 
kind, except fugar, and a little wine, and a little 
water. The firft day after I had received no food 
at all, I found myfelf, towards evening, firft empty 
and fickifli at my ftomach j and nearer night, migh- 
tily inclined to yawning, and fleepy ; I laid down 
on a couch in the great cabin, to fleep ; and flept 
about three hours, and awaked a little refreflied, 
having taken a glafs of wine when I lay down : after 
being about three hours awake, it being about five 
o'clock in the morning, I found myfelf empty, and 
my ftomach fickifli again, and laid down again ;. but 
could not fleep at all, being very faint and ill : and 
thus I continued all the fecond day, with a ftrange 
variety ; firft hungry, then fick again, with reachings: 
to vomit : the fecond night, being obliged to go tor 
bed again, without any food more than a draught 6f 
fair water, and being afleep, I dreamed I was at 
Barbadoesj and that the market was mightily flocked 
with provifions ; that I bought fome for my miftrefs, 
and went and dined very heartily. 

2 ' I thought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE^ tgS 

I thought my ftomach was full after this, as it 
would have been after, or at, a good dinner ; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly funk in my fpirits 
to find myfelf in the extremity of famine : the laft 
glafs of wine we had, I drank, and put fugar into 
it, becaufe of its having fome fpirit to fupply nou- 
riftiment ; but there being no fubftance in the fto- 
mach for the digefting office to work upon, I found 
the only effeO: of the wine was, to raife difagreeable 
fumes from the ftomach into the head ; and I lay, 
as they told me, ftupid and fenfelefs, as one drunk, 
for fome time. 

The third day in the morning, after a night of 
ftrange and confufed inconfiftent dreams, and rather 
dozing than fleeping, I awaked, ravenous and fu- 
rious with hunger ; and I queftion, had not my un- 
derftanding returned, and conquered it ; 1 fay, I 
queftion whether, if I had been a mother, and had 
had a little child with me, its life would have been 
fafe or no. 

This lafted about three hours ; during which time 
I was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam^ 
as my young mafter told me, and as he can now in- 
form you. 

In one of thefe fits of lunacy, or diftraftion, whe*- 
ther by the motion of the (hip, or fome flip of my 
foot, I know not; I fell down, and ftruck my face 
againft the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mif- 
trefe lay ; and with the blow the blood guflied out 
of my nofe ; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little 
bafon, I fat down and bled into it a great deal ; and 
as the blood ran from me, I came to myfelf ; and the 

O 2 violence 



ig6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

violence of the flame, or the fever I was In, abatcdj^ 
and fo did the ravenous part of the hunger. 

Then I grew fick, and reached to vomit, but could 
not ; for I had nothing in my ftomach to bring iip z 
after I had bled fome time, I fwooned, and they alt 
believed I was dead ; but I came to myfelf foon af- 
ter, and then had a moft dreadful pain in my fto* 
mach, not to be defcribed ; not like the cholic, but m 
gnawing eager pain for food ; and, towards night, 
it went oflf with a kind of earneft wifhing or longing 
for food ; fomething like, as I fuppofe, the long- 
ing of a woman with child. I took another draught 
of water, with fugar in it, but my ftomach loathed 
the fugar, and brought it all up again : Then I took 
a draught of water, without fugar, and that ftayed 
with me ; and I laid me down upon the bed, pray- 
ing moft heartily, that it would pleafe God to take 
me away ; and compofing my mind in hopes of it, I 
flumbered awhile; and then waking, thought my» 
felf dying, being light with vapours from an empty 
ftomach : I recommended my foul to God, and ear- 
neftly wilhed that fomebody would throw me into 
the fea. 

All this while my miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
thought, expiring ; but bore it with much more pa- 
tience than I, and gave the laft bit of bread ihe had 
to her child, my young mafter, who would not have 
taken it, but flie obliged him to eat it j and, I bdieve, 
it faved his life. 

Towards the morning, I flept again ; and firft, 
when I awaked, I fell into a violent pafTion of cry- 
ing ; and after that, had a fecond fit of violent hun- 
ger, fo that I got up ravenous, and in a moft dread- 
I ful 



.OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. tgj^ 

ful conditioti t Had my miftrefs been dead, as much 
as I loved her, I am certain I fliould have eaten a 
piece of her flefh with as much relifti, and as uncon-.- 
cemed, as ever I did the flefli of any creature ap* 
pointed for food ; and once or twice I was going to 
bite my own arm. At lafl:, I faw the bafon, in 
which wsts the blood I had bled at my nofe the day 
before ; I ran to it, and fwallowed it with fuch hafte, 
and fuch a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered 
nobody had taken it before, and afraid it Ihould be 
taken from me now. 

Though after it was down the thoughts of it filled 
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger j 
smd I draiak a draught of fair water, and was compofed 
and refrefhed for fome hours after it. This was the 
fourth day ; and thus I held it till towards night, 
when, within the compafs of three hours, I had all 
thefe feveral drcumftances over again, one after ano- 
ther ; viz. fick, fleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the 
ftomach, then ravenous again, then fick again, then 
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and fo 
every quarter of an hour; and my ftrength wafted 
exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no 
comfort, but in the hope that I ihould die before 
morning. 

All this night I had no fleep, but the hunger was 
now turned into a difeafe ; and I had a terrible cho- 
lic and griping ; wind, inftead of food, having found 
its way into the bowels ; and in this condition I lay 
till morning, when I was furprized a little with 
the cries and lamentations of my young mafter, who 
called out to me, that his mother was dead. I lifted 

O 3 • myfelf 



198 MFE AND ADVENTURES 

myfelf up ^ little, for I had not ftrength to rife, but 
found (he was not dead,: though flie was able to give 
very little figns of life. 

I had then fuch convulfions in my (lomach, for 
want of fome fuftenance, that I cannot defcribe them; 
with fuch frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that 
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and 
this condition I was in, when I heard the feamen 
above cry out, A fail! a fail 1 and halloo and jump' 
about as if they were diftraded. 

I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
miftrefs much lefs ; and my mafter was fo fick, that 
I thought he had been expiring ; fo we could not 
open the cabin door, or get any account what it 
was that occafioned fuch a combuftion ; nor had we 
any converfation with the fhip's company for two 
days, they having told us they had not a mouthful 
of any thing to ^at in the fhip ; and they told us 
afterwards, they thought we had been dead. 

It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were fent to fave our lives ; and how you found 
us. Sir, you know as well as I, and better too. 

This was her own relation, and is fuch a diftinft 
account of ftarving to death, as, I confefs^ I never 
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, 
becaufe the youth gave me an account of a good part 
of it ; though I muft own, not fo diftinfl:, and fo 
feelingly as his maid ; and the rather, becaufe, it 
feems, his mother fed him at the price of her own 
life : but the poor maid, though her conftitution 
being ftronger than that of her miftrefs, who was in 

years. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 99 

years, and a weakly woman too, (he might ftruggle 
harder with it; I fay, the poor maid might be fup- 
pofed to feel the extremity fomething fooner than 
her miftrefs, who might be allowed to keep the laft 
bits fomething longer than Ihe parted with any to 
relieve the maid. No queftion, as the cafe is here 
related, if our (hip, or fome other, had not fo provi^ 
dentially met them, a few days more would have 
ended' all their lives, unlefs they had prevented it by 
eating one another ; and even that, as their cafe 
ftood, would have ferved them but a little while, 
they being 500 leagues from any land, or any poffi-p 
bility of relief, other than in the miraculous manner 
it happened. — But this is by the way ; I return to my 
difpofition of things among the people. 

And firft, it is to be obferved here, that for many 
reafons, I did not think fit to let them know any 
thing of the floop I had framed, and which I thought of 
fetting up among them ; for 1 found, at leaft at my 
firft coming, fuch feeds of divifion among them, 
that I faw it plainly, had I fet up the floop, and left 
it among them, they would, upon very light difguft, 
have feparated, and gone away from one another; 
or perhaps have turned pirates, and fo made the 
ifland a den of thieves, inftead of a plantation of fo- 
ber and religious people, as I intended it to be ; nor 
did I leave the two pieces of brafs cannon that I had 
on board, or the two quarter deck guns, that my 
nephew took extraordinary, for the fame reafon : I 
thought they had enough to qualify them for a de- 
fenfive war, againft any that fliould invade them ; but 
I was not to fet them up for an offenfive war, or to 

O 4 encourage 



*J06 LIFE AND ADVENTURrS' 

encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which,^ 
in the end, would only bring ruin and deftrudiou 
upon themfelves and all their undertakings: I re« 
ferved the floop, therefore, and the guns, for their 
fervice another way, as I fliall obferve in its pbce. 

I have now done with the ifland : I left them all 
in good circumflances, and in a flourifhing condi^ 
tion, and went on board my fhip again the fifth day 
of May^ having been five-and-twenty days among 
them ; and, as they were all relolved to flay upoa 
the ifland till I came to remove them, I promifed to 
fend fome further , relief from the Brqfils, if I could 
poflibly find an opportunity ; and particularly I pro^ 
mifed to fend them fome cattle ; fuch as fheep, hogs, 
and <:ows ; for as to the two cows and calves which 
I brought from England^ we had been obliged, by 
the length of our voyage, to kill them at fea, for 
want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a falute of five gunj^ 
at parting, we fet fail, and arrived at the bay of All 
Saints^ in the Brafils^ in about twenty-two days}, 
meeting nothing remarkable in our paffage but this,. 
That about three days after we failed, being becalmed, 
and the current fetting ftrong to the N. N. E. run- 
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulph,, on the land- 
' fide, we were driven fomething out of our couiie ; 
and once or twice our men cried Land, to the weft^ 
ward ; but whether it was the continentj or iflands, 
we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the fea fmooth 
and the weather calm, we faw the fea^ as it were, 
covered, towards the land, with fomething very 

black. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Soi 

black, not being able to difcover what it was ; butj 
after fome time, our chief mate going up the main 
flirouds a little way, and looking at them with a per- 
fpeftive, cried out, it was an army. I could not 
imagine what he meant by an army, and fpoke a little 
haftily, calling the fellow a fool, or fome fuch word ; 
Naty, Sir, fays he, don*t be angry, for it is an army, 
and a fleet too ; for I believe there are a thoufand 
canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, and 
they are coming towards us too apace, and full o£ 
men, 

1 was u little furprifed then, indeed, and fo was 
my nephew the captain; for he had heard fucji ter- 
rible ftories of them in the ifland, and having never 
been in thofe feas before, that he could not tell what 
to think of it, but faid two or three times, we fliould 
all be devoured. I muft confefs, confidering wc 
were becalmed, and the current fet ftrong towards the 
Ihore, I liked it the worfe ; however, I bade him not 
be afraid, but bring the (hip to an anchor, as foon 
as we came fo near as to know that we muft engage 
them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us ; fo I gave orders to come to an an- 
chor, and furl all our fails. As for the favages, 
I told them they had nothing to fear from them but 
fire ; and therefore they fhould get their boats out, 
and faften them, one clofe by the head, and the other 
by the ftern, and man them both well, and wait the 
iffue in that pofture: this I did, that the men in the 
boats might be ready, with fheet and buckets, to put 

out

out any fire thefe favages might endeavour to fix upoil 
the outfide of the fhip. 

In this pofture we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us, but never was fuch a 
horrid fight feen by Chriftians : My mate was much 
miftaken in his calculation of their number, I mean 
of a thoufand canoes ; the moft we could make of 
them when they came up, being about 126; and a 
great many of them too ; for fome of them had fix- 
teen orfeventeen men in them, fome more, and the 
leaft fix or feven. 

When they came nearer to us, they feemed to be 
ftruck with wonder and aftonifliment, as at a fight 
which they had, doubtlefs, never feen before ; nor 
coujd they, at firft, as we afterwards underftood, 
know what to make of us. They came boldly up 
•however, very near to us, and feemed to go about 
to row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats, not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with 
them, without our defigning it ; for five or fix of 
their large canoes came fo near our long-boat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
-back ; which they underftood very well, and went- 
back ; but at their retreat about 500 arrows came on 
board us from thofe boats ; and one of our men in 
the long-boat was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any means; 
but we handed down fome deal boards into the boat, 
and the carpenter prefently fet up a kind of a fence, 
like wafte boards, to cover them from the arrows of 
the favages, if they ihould fhoot again. 

About 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 20^ 

About half an hour afterwards they came all up In a 
body afternof us, and pretty near, fo near that we 
could eafily difcern what they were, though we could 
not tell their defign. I eafily found they were fome 
of my old friends, the fame fort of favages that I 
had been ufed to engage with ; and in a little time 
more they rowed fomewhat farther out to fea, till 
they came diredly broadfide with us, and then rowed 
down ftraight upon us, till they came fo near, 
that they could hear us fpeak : Upon this, I ordered 
all my men to keep clofe, left they fhould fhoot any 
more arrows, and make all our guns ready; but 
being fo near as to be within hearing, I made Friday 
go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them 
in his language, to know what they meant ; which 
accordingly he did : whether they underftood him 
or not, that I know not ; but, as foon as he had 
called to them, fix of them, who were in the fore- 
moft, or nigheft boat to us, turned their canoes from 
us ; and, ftooping down, fhewed us their naked 
backfides* ; j^ft as if, in Englijhj (faving your pre- 

fence) they had bid us kifs . Whether 

this was a defiance or' challenge, we know not ; or 
whether it was done in mere contempt, or a fignal 
to the reft ; but immediately ir/^^;^ cried out. They 
wer€ going to fhoot ; and unhappily for him ("poor 
fellow) they let fly about 300 of their arrows ; and, 
to my inexpreflible grief, killed poor Friday^ no other 
man being in their fight. The poor fellow was fhot 
with no lefs than three arrows, and aboift three more 
fell very nigh him ; fuqh unlucky markfmen they 



were ! 



I was 



204 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was fo enraged with the lofs of my old fervant, 
the companion of all my forrows and folitudes, tha* 
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 
fmall fhot, and four with great ; and gave them fuch 
a broadfide as they had never had in thek lives be* 
fore, to be fiire. 

They were not above half a cable's length off 
when we fired j and om- gunners took their aim fo 
well, that three or four of their canoes were over-? 
fet, as we had reafon to believe, by one Ihot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backfides 
to us, gave us no great offence ; neither did I know 
for certain whether that, which would pafs for the 
greateft contempt among us, might be underftood fa 
by them or not ; therefore in return, I had only rer 
folved to have fired four or five guns with powder, 
only, which I knew would fright them fufficiently : 
but when they ihot at us direftly with all the fury they 
were capable of, and efpecially as they had killed my 
poor Friday^ whom I fo entirely loved and valued, 
and who, indeed, fo well deferved it ; I not only had 
been juftified before God and man, but would have 
been yery glad, if I could, to have overfet every 
canoe there, and drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or hovf 
many we wounded, at this broadfide ; but fure fuch 
a fright and hurry never was feen among fuch a 
multitude : there were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes fplit, and overfet, in all ; and the men all fet 
a fwimminff ; the reft, frighted out of their wits, 
fcoured away as faft as they could, taking but little 
care to fave thofe whofe boats were fplit or §>oile4

them loft; and our men took up one poor fellow 
fwimmiii?g for his life, above an hour after they wefe 
all gone. 

Our fmall fhot from our cannon muft needs kill 
and wound a great many; but, in fligrt, we never 
knew any thing how it went with them; for they 
fled fo faft, that, in three hours* or thereabouts, wq 
could not fee above three or four ftraggling canoes ; 
nor did we ever fee the reft any more ; for a breezy 
of wind fpringing up the fame evening, we weighed 
and fet fail for the Brajils. 

We had a prifoner indeed, but the creature was 
fo fuUen, that he would neither eat or fpeak ; and 
we all fancied he would ftarve himfelf to death ; but 
I took a way to cure him ; for I made them take 
him, and turn him into the long-boat, and make him 
believe they would tofs him into the fea again, and 
fo leave him where they found him, if he would not 
• fpeak: nor would that do, but they really did throw 
him into the fea, and came away from him ; and then 
he followed them, for he fwam like a cork, and 
called to them in his tongue, though they knew not 
one word of what he faid. However, at laft, they 
took him in again, and then he began to be mor^ 
tradable ; nor did I ever, defign they fhould drown 
him. 

We were now under fail again ; but I was the moft 
difconfolate creature alive, for want of my man 
Friday^ and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the illand, to have taken one of the reft 
from thence for my occafion, but it could not be ; 
fo we went on. We had one prifoner, as I have faid ; 
and it was a long while before we could make him

underftand any thing ; but, in time, our men taught 
him fome Englijh^ and he began to be a little trada- 
ble : Afterwards we enquired what country he came 
from, but could make nothing of what he faid ; for 
his fpeech was fo odd, all gutturals, and fpoken in 
the throat, in fuch an hollow and odd manner, that 
we could never form a word from him ; and we were^ 
all of opinion that they might fpeak that language 
as well, if they were gagged, as otherwife ; nor 
could we perceive that they had any occafion either 
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate ; but formed their 
words jufl: as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an 
open throat : He told us, however, fome time after, 
when we had taught him to fpeak a little Englijh^ 
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a 
great battle. When he faid kings, we afked him, 
how many kings ? He faid, there were five nation, 
(we could not make him underftand the plural s.') 
and that they all joined to go againft two nation. 
We afked him, What made them come up to us ? 
He faid. To makee te great wonder look — Where it 
is to be obferved, that all thofe natives, as alfo thofe 
of Africa, when they learn Englijh, they always add 
two ^*s at the end of the words where we ufe one, 
and place the accent upon the laft of them ; as 
makee, takee, and the like ; and we could not break 
them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave 
it off, thought at laft he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
muft take my laft leave of him ; poor honeft Friday! 
We buried him with all decency and folemnity pofli- 
ble, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him 
into the fea j and I caufed them to fire eleven guns

faithful, honefl, and moft affeftionate fervant that 
ever man had. 

We now went away with a fair wind for Brqfilj 
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the 
latitude of five degrees fouth of the line, being the 
Horth-eaftermoft land of all that part of America. 
We kept on S. by E, in fight of the fhore four days, 
when we made the Cape St. Auguftine^ and in three 
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints^ 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never did a (hip come to this part that had lefs 
bufinefs than I had ; and yet it was with great diffi- 
culty that we were admitted to hold the leaft corref- 
pondence on fhore. Not my partner himfelf, who 
was alive, and made a great figure among them, 
not my two merchant truftees, nor the fame of my 
wonderful prefervation in the ifland, could obtain 
me that favour : but my partner, remembering that 
I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of 
the monaftery of the Aiigujiinesj and three hundred 
and feventy-two to the poor, went to the monaftery, 
and obliged the prior that then v/as, to go to the go- 
vernor, and beg leave for me prefentiy, with the 
captain, and one more, befides eight feamen, to come 
on fhore, and no more ; and this upon condition 
abfolutely capitulated for, that we fhould not offer 
to land any goods out of the fhip, or to carry any 
perfon away without licence. 

They were fo ftrift with us, as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on fhore three bales of Englijh goods, fuch as fine 

broad 



208 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

broad cloths, fluffs, and fome linen, which I had 
brought for a prefent to my partner^ 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, 
though (like me) he came from little at firft ; and 
though he knew not that I had the leaft defign of 
giving him any thing, he fent me on board 51 pre* 
fent of frefh provifions, wine, and fweetmeats, worth 
above thirty moidores, including fome tobacco, and 
three or four fine medals in gold. But I was even 
with him In my prefent, which, as I have faid, con- 
fifted of fine broad cloth, Englijh fluffs, lace, and fine 
Hollands. Alfo, I delivered him about the value of 
lool. fterling, in the fame g9ods, for other ufes; 
and I obliged him to fet up the floop which I had 
brought with me from England^ as I have faid, for 
the ufe of my colony, in order to fend the refrefh* 
ments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands, and finiflied the floop 
in a very few days, for flie was already framed ; and 
I gave the matter of her fuch inftrudlions as he could 
not mifs the place ; nor did he mifs it, as I had an 
account from my partner afterwards. I got him 
foon loaded with the fmall cargo I had fent them j 
and one of our feamen, that had been on fhore with 
me there, offered to go with the floop, and fettle 
there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard^ to 
allot him a fufEcient quantity of land for a planta-i 
tion ; and giving him foiWe clothes, and tools for his 
planting work, which he faid he underftood, having 
been an old planter in Maryland^ and a buccaneer 
into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he de- 
fired j and, as an addition, I gave him the favage

and ordet-ed the governor Spaniard to give him his 
fliare df eVery thing he wanted, with the reft, 

"When wie came to fit this man out, my old part* 
ner told me, there was a certain very honeft fellow, 
A Brafil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the difpleafure of the church : I know not what 
the matter is with him, fays he, but, on my con- 
fcience, I think he is an heretic in his heart ; and he 
has been obliged to conceal himfelf for fear of the 
Inquifition ; that he would be very glad of fuch an 
opportunity to make his efcape, with his wife and 
two daughters ; and if I would let them go to the 
ifland, and allot them a plantation, he would give 
them a fmall ftock to begin with ; for the officers 
of the inquifition had feized all his efFefts and eftate, 
and he had nothing left but a little houfliold ftuff, 
and two flaves; and, adds he, though I hate his 
principles, yet I would not have him fall into their 
'hands, for he will affuredly be burnt alive if he 
does. 

I granted this prefently, and joined my Englijh* 
man with them. \ and we concealed the man, and his 
wife and daughters, on board our (hip, till the floop 
put out to go to fea ; and then (having put all their 
goods on board the floop fome time before) we put 
them onboard the floop,after flie was got out of thebay. 

Our feaman was mightily pleafed with this new 
partner; and their ftock, indeed, was much alike 
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a farm ; but 
nothing to begin with, but as above. Hbwever, they 
■carried over with them (which was worth all the reft) 
fpme materials for planting fugar canes, with fome

plants of canes ; which he (I mean the Portugal 
man) underftood very well. 

AnwDng the reft of the fupplies fent my tenants 
in the ifland, I fent them, by this (loop, three milch 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among 
them, three fows big with pig, two mares, and a 
ftone-horfe. ^ 

For my Spaniards^ according to my promife, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go ; and recom- 
mended it to them to marry them, and ufe them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I 
remembered that the poor perfecuted man had two 
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted ; the reft had wives of their own, tho* 
in another country. 

All this cargo arrived fafe, and as you may eafily 
fuppofe, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who 
were now (with this addition) between fixty and fe- 
venty people, befides little children ; of which there 
were a great many : I found letters at London from 
them all, by way of Lijbony when I came back to Eng-^ 
land^ being fent back to the Braftls by this floop ; of 
which I fhall take fome notice iji its place. 

I have now done v/ith my ifland, and all manner 
of difcourfe about it ; and whoever reads the reft 
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his 
thoughts entirely from it, and expe£t to read only of 
the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, 
much lefs by thofe of other men, to beware of the like j

214 ^^^E AND ADVENTURES 

From the Brajih we made direftly away over the 
Atlantic fea, to the Cape de Bonne Efperance^ or, as 
■we call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tole- 
rable good voyage, our courfe generally fouth-eaft ; 
now and then a ftorm, and fome contrary winds. 
But my difafters at fea were at an end ; my future 
rubs and crofs events were to befal me on fhore ; that 
it might appear, the land was as well prepared to be 
our fcourge as the fea, when Heaven, who direfts 
the circumftances of things, pleafes to appoint it to 
be fo. 

Our fhip was on a trading voyage, and had a fu- 
per-cargo on board, who was to diredt all her mo- 
tions, after fhe arrived at the Cape ; only being li- 
mitted to a certain number of days for ftay, by char- 
ter-party, at the feveral ports fhe was to go to : this 
was none of my bufinefs, neither did I meddle with 
it at all ; my nephew, the captain, and the fiiper- 
cargo, adjufting all thofe things between them as 
they thought fit. 

We made no ftay at the Cape^ longer than was 
needful to take in frefli water, but made the beft of 
our way for the coaft of Coromande ; we were 
indeed informed that a French nlan of war of 
fifty guns, and two large merchant fliips, were gone 
for the Indies ; and, as I knew we were at war with 
France^ I had fome apprehenfions of them ; but they 
went their own way, and we heard no more of 
them. 

I fhall not pefter my account, or the reader, with 
defcriptions of places, journals of our voyages, va- 
riations of the compafs, latitudes, meridian diftances, 
trade winds, fituation of ports, and the like j fuch

as almoft all the hiftories of long navigation are full 
of, and which make the reading tirefome enough ; 
and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read, ex- 
cept only to thofe who are to go to thofe places 
themfelves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at ; and what occurred to us upon our 
pafling from one to another. We touched firft at 
the ifland of Madagafcar^ where, though the peo- 
ple are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, 
very well armed with lances and bows, which they 
\ife with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very 
well with them awhile ; they treated us very civilly ; 
and for fome trifles which we gave them, fuch as 
knives, fciflars, &c. they brought us eleven good fat 
bullocks, middling in fize, but very good in flefh ; 
which we took in, partly for frefh provifions for our 
prefent fpending, and the reft to fait for the fhip's 
ufe. 

We were obliged to ftay here for fome time, after 
we had furniflied ourfelves with provifions; and I, 
that was always too curious to look into every nook 
of the world wherever I came, was for going on fhore 
as often as I could. It was on the eaft fide of the 
ifland that we went on ftiore one evening ; and the 
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came 
thronging about us, and flood gazing at us at a dif- 
tance ; as we had traded freely with them, and had 
been kindly ufed, we thought ourfelves in no dan- 
ger : but when we faw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree, and ftuck them up at a diftance 
from us, which, it feems, is a mark in the*country., 
not only of truce and friendfliip, but when it is ac- 
• P 4 cepted.

cepted, the other fide fet up three poles, or boughas^ 
^Ifo ; which is a fignal that they accept the truce tooy 
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that 
you are not to pafs beyond their three poles towards 
them, nor they come pad your three poles or bough$ 
towards you ; fo that you are perfe^ly fecure within 
the three poles ; and all the fpace between your polet 
and their's, is allowed like a market, for free cob^ 
verfe, trafEck, and commerce. When you go thi« 
ther, you mult not carry your weapons with you ; 
and if they come into that fpace, they flick up their 
javelins and launces, all at the firft poles, and come 
on unarmed j but if any violence is offered them, 
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the 
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the 
truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on fhore, 
that a greater number of their people came down 
than ufual, but was all very friendly and civiL They 
brought with them feveral kinds of provifions, for 
which we fatisfied them with fuch toys as we had ; 
their women alfo brought us milk and roots, and 
feveral things very acceptably to us, and all was^ 
quiet ; and we made us a little tent, or hut, of fomc 
boughs of trees, and lay on fhore all that night. 

I know not what was the occafion, but I was not 
fo well fatisfied to lie on fhore as the reft ; and the 
boat lying at an anchor about a flone's cafl: from the 
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I 
made one of them come on fhore ; and getting fome 
boughs of trees to cover us alfo in the boat, I fpread 
the fail on the bottom of the boat, and lay on board,

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of 
our men make a terrible noife on the fhore, calling 
out for God's fake to bring the boat in, and come and 
help them, for they were all like to be murdered ; 
at the fame time I heard the firing of five mufquets, 
which was the number of the guns they had, and 
that three times over ; for, it feems, the natives here 
were not fo eafily frighted with guns as the favages 
were in America, where I had to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; 
but roufing immediately from fleep with the noife, I 
caufed the boat to be thruft in, and refolved, with 
three fufils we had on board, to land and aflift our 
men. 

We got the boat foon to the Ihore ; but our men 
were in too much hafte ; for, being come to the 
fhore, they plunged into the water, to get to the 
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur^ 
fued by between three ^nd four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had 
fufils with them ; the reft, indeed, had piftols and 
fwords, but they were of fihall ufe to them. 

We tookup feven of our men, and with difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and that which was ftill worfe, was, that while we 
flood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on fhore ; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us fo thick, that we 
were fain to barricade the fide of the boat up with 
the benches, and two or three loofe boards, which, 

to 



21 8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to our great fatisfaftion, we had, by mere accident, 
or providence rather, in the boat. 

And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it feems, 
fuch exadt markfmen, that if they could have feen 
but the leaft part of any of us, they would have 
been fure of us : we had, by the light of the moon, 
a little fight of them, as they flood pelting us from 
the fliore with darts and arrows ; and, having got 
ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley j and 
we could hear by the cries of fome of them, that we 
had wounded feveral ; however they flood thus in 
battle array on the fliore till break of day, which 
we fuppofe was, that they might fee the better to 
take their aim at us. 

jbi this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our anchor, or fet up our fail, becaufe we 
muft needs ftand up in the boat, and they were as 
fure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with 
fmall fliot : we made fignals of diftrefs to the fliip, 
which though flie rode a league off, yet my nephew, 
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glaffes per- 
ceiving the pofture we lay in, and that we fired to. 
wards the fliore, pretty well underflood us ; and, 
weighing anchor with all fpeed, he flood as near the 
fliore as He durft with the fliip, and then fent another 
boat, with ten hands in her, to affift us ; but we 
called to them not to come too near, telling them 
what condition we were in : however, they flood in 
nearer to us ; and one of the men, taking the end 
of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat be- 
tween him and the enemy, fo that they could not ^ 
perfeftly fee him, fwam on board us, and made the line 
faft to the boat j upon which we flipt our little cable, 
I and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out 
of the reach of the arrows j we all the while lying 
clofe behind the barricade we had made. 

As foon as we were got from between the fhip and 
the fliore, that flie could lay her fide to the fhore, we 
ran along juft by them, and we poured in a broad- 
fide among them, loaded with pieces of iron and 
lead, fmall bullets, and fuch fluff, befides the great 
fliot, which made a terrible havock among them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occafion of this 
fray ; and, indeed, our fupercargo, who had been 
often in thofe parts, put me upon it ; for he faid he 
was fure the inhabitants would not have touched us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not done fome- 
thing to provoke them to it : At length it came out, 
viz. That an old woman, who had come to fell us 
fome milk, had brought it within our poles, with a 
young woman with her, who alfo brought fome 
roots or herbs ; and while the old woman (whether 
flie was mother to the young woman or no, they 
could not tell) was felling us the milk, one of our 
men offered fome rudenefs to the wench that was 
with her ; at which the old woman made a great 
noife. However, the feaman would not quit his 
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's fight, 
among the trees, it being almoft dark ; the old wo- 
man went away without her ; and, as we fuppofe, 
made an outcry among the people fhe came from ; 
who, upon notice, raifed this great army upon us in 
three or four hours ; and id was great odds but we 
had been all deftroyed. 

One 



t2<y- lilFE AND ADVENTURX8 

One of our men was killed with a lance that wa$ 
thrown at him, juft at the beginning of the attack, 
as he fallied out of the tent we had made ; the reft 
came oflF free, all but the fellow who was the occafioix 
of all the mifchief, who paid dear enough for his 
black miftrefs, for we could not hear what became 
of him a great while. We lay upon the Ihore two 
days after, though the wind prefented, and made fig- 
nals for him ; made our boat fail up fhore, and down 
fhore, feveral leagues, but in vain ; fo we were 
obliged to give him over ; and if he alone had fuf. 
fered for it, the lofs had been the lefs. , 

I could not fatisfy myfelf, however, without ven^ 
turing on fhore once more, to try if I could learn any 
thing of him or them ; it was the third night after the 
aftion, that I had a great mind to learn, if I could 
by any means, what mifchief we had done, and how 
the game ftood on the Indian fide : I was careful to 
do it in the dark, left we fhould be attacked again ; 
but I ought indeed to have been fure, that the men 
I went with had been under my command, before I 
engaged in a thing fo hazardous and mifchievous, 
as I was brought into it without my knowledge or 
defire. 

We took twenty ftout fellows with us as any in 
the (hip, befides the fupercargo and myfelf ; and we 
landed two hours before midnight, at the fame place 
where the Indians ftood drawn up the evening before : 
I landed here, becaufe my defign, as I have faid, was 
chiefly to fee if they had quitted the field, and if they 
had left any marks behind them, or of the mifchief 
we had done them j and I thought, if we could fur- 

prifc 



dF ROBIKSOK CECUSOE. Hi 

ptife oiie or two of them> perhaps we might get our 
man again, by way of exchange^ 

We landed without any noife, and divided oik 
men into two companies, whereof the boatfwain cortk 
manded one, and I the other : We neither could hear 
nor fee any body ftir when we landed ; fo we marched 
up, one body at a diftance from the other, to the 
field of battle : At firft we could fee nothing, it be- 
ing very dark ; but by and by, our boatfwain, that 
ied the firft party, ftumbled and fell over a dead bo- 
dy : This made them halt there awhile y for knowing 
by the circumftanceSj that they were at the place 
where the Indians had ftoodj they waited for my 
coming up r Here we concluded to halt till the moon 
began to rife^ which we knew would be in lefs than 
an hour ; and then we could eafily difcern the havock 
we had made among them : We told two-and-thirty 
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite 
dead. Some had an arm, and fome a leg, (hot off; 
and one his^ head : Thofe that were wounded, we 
fuppofed they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full difcovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for 
going on board again ; but the boatfwain and hi^ 
party often fent me word, that they were refolded to 
make a vifit to the Indian town, where thefe dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt; and dcfired me to go* 
along with them ; and if they could find them, as 
they ftill fancied they Ihould, they did not doubt, 
they faid, getting a good booty ; and it might be, 
they might find Thomas Jeffrys there : that was the 
man's name we had loftv 

Had 



222 LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

Had they fent to afk my leave to go, I knew well 
enough what anfwer to have given them ; for I would 
have commanded them inftantly on board, knowing 
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a 
Ihip, and a {hip's loading in our charge, and a voyage 
to make, which depended very much upon the lives 
of the men ; but as they fent me word they were 
refolved to go, and only afked me and my com- 
pany to go along with them, I pofitively refufed it, 
and rofe up (for I was fitting on the ground) in or- 
der to go to the boat. One or two of the men began 
to importune me to go ; and, when I ftill refufed 
pofitively, began to grumble, and fay they were not 
under my command, and they would go. Come, 
Jack, fays one of the men, will you go with me? 
I will go for one. Jack faid he would ; and ano- 
ther followed, and then another ; and, in a word, 
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty 
too, I perfuaded to flay : fo the fupercargo and I, 
with one man, went back to the boat, where, I told 
them, we would flay for them, and take care to take 
in as many of them as fhould be left ; for I told 
them, it was a mad thing they were going about, 
and fuppofed moft of them would run the fate of 
Thcmas ^effrys. 

They told me, like feamen, they'd warrant it they 
would come off again ; and they would take care, 
&c. So away they went. I intreated them to con- 
fider the fhip, and the voyage ; that their lives were 
not their own ; and that they were intrufted with 
the voyage, in fome meafure ; that if they mifcar- 
ried, the ihip might be loft for want of their help ; 

and 



OF. ROBINSON CRUSOE# 223 

5tnd that they could not anfwer it to God and man* 
I faid a great deal more to them on that head, but I 
naight as well have talked to the main-maft of the 
Ihip ; they were mad upon their journey j only they 
gave me good words, and begged I would not be 
angry ; faid they would be very cautious, and they 
did not doubt but they would be back again in 
about an hour, at fartheft ; for the Indian town, they 
faid, was not above half a mile off; though they 
found it above two miles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above j and though 
the attempt was defperate, and fugh as none but mad- 
men would have gone about, yet, to give them their 
due, they went about it warily, as well as boldly. 
They were gallantly armed, that is true j for they 
had every man a fufil or mufquet, a bayonet, and 
every man a piftol ; fome of them had broad cut- 
laffes, fome of them hangers ; and the boatfwain, 
and two more, had pole-axes : befides all which, they 
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder 
fellows, and better provided, never went about any 
wicked work in the world. 

When they went out, their chief defign was 
plunder ; and they were in mighty hopes of finding 
gold there j but a circumftance, which none of them 
were aware of, fet them on fire with revenge, and 
made devils of them all : When they came to the 
few Indian houfes, which they thought had been the 
town, which were not above half a mile off, they 
were under a great difappdintment j for there were 
not above twelve or thirteen houfes j and where, the 
town was, or hQW big, they knew not : They con- 

fulted 



414 ^^^^ -^ND ADVEKtURE3 

luhed therefore what to do, and were fome time bc^ 
fore they could refolve : for if they fell tipdn thefe^ 
they rauft cut all their throats ; and it was ten to 
one but fome of them might efcape, it being in the 
night, though the moon waa up ; arid if one efeaped, 
he would run away, and raife all the town, fo they 
fhould have a whole army upon them. Again, cm 
the other hand, if they went away, and left thofe 
untouched (for the people were all afleep) they could 
not tell which way to look for the town. 

However, the laft was the bed advice j fo they re- 
folved to leave thofe houfes, and look for the town a$ 
well as they could : They went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree : this they prefently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them ; fot they 
faid the cow certainly belonged lo the town before 
them, or the town behind them ; and if they untied 
her, they fhould fee which way Ihe went : if fhe went 
back, they had nothing to fay to her 5 but if (he 
went forward, they had nothing to do but to fol^ 
low her ; fo they cut the card, which was made of 
twified flags, and the cow v(rent on before them : In 
a word, the cow led them diretlly to the town, which, 
as they reported, confifted of above 200 houfes, ot 
huts ; and in fome of thefe they found feveral fa- 
milies living together. 

Here they found all filent ; as profoundly fecure, 
as fleep and a country that had never feen an enemy 
of that kind, could make them. Upon this they 
called another council, to confider what they had to 
do ; and, in a word, they refolved to divide them- 
felves into three bodies, and to fet three houfes oa 

fire 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, I25 

fire in three parts of the town ; and as the men came 
out, to feize them, and bind them j if any refifted, 
they need not be alked what to do then ; and fo to 
fearch the reft of the houfes for plunder ; but re- 
folved to march filently firft through the town, and 
fee what dimenfions it was of, and confider if they 
might venture upon it, or no. 

They did fo, and defperately refolved that they 
would venture upon them ; but while they were ani- 
mating one another to the work, three of them, that 
were a little before the reft, called out aloud, and 
told them they had found Thomas Jeffrys ; they all 
ran up to the place, and fo it was indeed, for there 
they found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one 
arm, and his throat cut : There w^s an Indian houfe 
juft by the tree, where they found fixteen or feven- 
teen of the principal Indians^ who had been con- 
cerned in the fray with us before, and two or three 
of them wounded with our fhot j and our men found 
they were awake, and talking one to another in that 
houfe, but knew not their number. 

The fight of their poor mangled comrade fo en- 
raged them, as before, that they fwore to one ano- 
ther they would be revenged, and that not an Indian 
who came into their hands Ihould have quarter j and 
to work they went immediately; and yet not fo madly 
as by the rage and fury they were in might be expeded. 
Their firft care was to get fomething that would foon 
take fire ; but after a little fearch, they found that 
would be to no purpofe, for moft of the houfes were 
low, and thatched with flags or rufhes, of which the 
country is full ; fo they prefently made fome wild 

Vol. II. (^ fire. 



226 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fire, as we call it, by wetting a tittle powder in the 
palms of their hands ; and, in a quarter of an hour, 
they fet the town on fire in four or five places ; and 
particularly that houfc where the Indians were not 
gone to bed. As foon as the fire began to blaze, 
the poor frighted creatures began to rufh out to fave 
their lives ; but met with their fate in the attempt, 
and efpecially at the door, where they drove them 
back, the boatfwairi himfelf killing one or two with 
his pole-axe ; the houfe being large, and many in it, 
he did not care to go in, but called for an hand gre- 
nado, and threw it among them, which, at firft, 
frighted them ; but when it burft, made fuch havock 
among them, that they cried out in a hideous 
manner. 

In fhort, moft of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the houfe, were killed or hurt with the gre^ 
nado, except two or three more, who preffed to the 
door, which the boatfwain and two more kept with 
the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dif- 
patched all who came that way. But there was ano- 
ther apartment in the houfe, where the prince, or 
king, or whatfdever he was, and feveral other's, were j 
and they kept in, till the houfe, which was by this 
time all of a light flame, fell in upon them, and they 
were fmothered, or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, becaufe they 
would not waken the people fafler than they could 
mafter them ; but the fire began to waken them 
faft enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a 
little together in bodies ; for the fire grew fo raging, 
all the houfes being made of light combuftible fluflf, 
. that they could hardly bear the ftreet between them ; 

and 



M koBii^sdisr CRUSOE* 227 

, and their bufinefs wa^ to follow the fire fbt the furer 
execution : As faft as the fire either forced the peo^ 
pie out of thofe. hoiifes which were burning, of 
frighted them out of othersj, our people were ready 
at their doors to knock them on the head, ftill calling 
and hallooing to oi;ie another to remember Thomas 
yefrys. 

While this was doiiig, 1 mufl confefs I was very 
uneafy, and efpecially, when I faw the flames of the 
town, which, it being night, feeihed to be juft by 
me. 

My nephew, the captain, who 'v^ras roufed by his 
tolen too, feeing fiich a fire, was very lineafy, tiot 
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
Was in ; efpecially hearing the guns too ; for by this 
time they began to Ufe their fire-arms : A thoufaiid 
thoughts opprefled his mind concerning me and the 
fupercal'go, what IhoUld become of lis : and at laft, 
though he could ill fpare any more men^ yet, not 
knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes 
another boat, and with thirteen men and himfelf 
comes on (hore to me. 

He was fiirprifed to fee me and the fupercargo in 
the boat, with no more than two men, for one had 
been left to keep the boat ; and though he was glad 
that we were well ; yet he was in the fame impa- 
tience with us to know what was doing ; for the noife 
continued, and the flame increafed : I confefs it wa$ 
next to an impoflibility for any men in the world to 
teftrain their curiofity of knowing what had happen- 
ed, or their concern for the fafety of the men. In a 
word, the captain told me, he would go and help his 

0^2 men^ 



228 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

men, let what would come. I argued with him, as 
I did before with the men, the faiety of the fliip, and 
the danger of the voyage, the intereft of the owners 
and merchants, &c, and told him I would go, and the 
two men, and only fee if we could, at a diftance, 
learn what was like to be the event, and come back 
and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephev/, as it was to 
talk to the reft before ; he would go, he faid, and 
he only wifhed he had left but ten men in the fhip ; 
for he could not think of having his men loft for 
want of help : he had rather, he faid, lofe the fhip, 
the voyage, and his life, and all : And fo away 
went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ftay behind no w^ than 
I was to perfuade them not to go before ; fo, iii 
fliort, the captain ordered two men to row back the 
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the fhip^ 
leaving the long-boat at an anchor ; and that when 
they came back, fix men fhould keep the twoboats,^ 
and fix more come after us ; fo that he left only fix- 
teen men in the fhip ; for the whole fhip's company 
confifted of 65 men, whereof two were loft in the firfl 
quarrel which brought this mifchief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be fure we 
felt little of the ground we trod on; and being 
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di*. 
re£tly to the place of the flame. If the noife of the 
guns were furprifing to us before, the cries of the poor 
people were now quite of another nature, and fill, d us 
with horror. I mufl confefs I never was at the facking 
of a city, or at the taking of a town by ftorm j I have 

heard 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

heard of Oliver Cromwell tdklng Drogheda^ in Ireland^ 
and killing man, woman, and child ; and I had read of 
Count Tilly facking the city of Magdebourg^ and 
cutting the throats of 22000 of both fexes j but I 
never had an idea of the thing itfelf before ; nor is 
it poffible to defcribe it, or the horror which was up- 
on our minds at hearing it. 

However we went on, and, at length, came to the 
town, though there was no entering the ftreets of it 
for the fire. The firft objefl: we met with was the 
ruins of a hut or houfe, or rather the afhes of it, 
for the houfe was confumed; and juft before it, 
plain now to be feen by the light of the fire, lay four 
men and three women killed ; and, as we thought, 
one or two more lay in the heap among the fire. In 
fliort, thefe were fuch inftances of a rage altogether 
barbarous, and of a fury fomething beyond what 
was human, that we thought it impoffible our men 
could be guilty of it ; or, if they were the authors 
of it, we thought that every one of them ought to 
be put to the worft of deaths: But this was not all; 
we faw the fire increafed forward, and the cry went 
on juft as the fire went on, fo that we were in the 
utmoft confufion. We advanced a little way far- 
ther ; and beheld, to our aftonifliment, three women 
naked, crying in a moft dreadful manner, and flying 
as if they had, indeed, had wings, and after them 
fixteen or feventeen men, natives, in the fame terror 
and confternation, with three of our Englijh butchers 
(for I can call them no better) in the rear ; who, 
when they could not overtake them, fired in among 
them, and one that was killed by their fhot, fell 
down in our fight ; when the reft faw us, believing 

Q.3 us 



230 lif:e and adventures 

us to be their enemies, and that we would murder 
them, as well as thofe that purfued them, they fet 
up a moft dreadful fhriek, ^fpecially the wo^len; 
and two of them fell down as if already dead with 
the fright. 

My very foul flirunk within me, and rpy blood 
ran chill in my veins when I faw this ; and I believCj^ 
had the three Englijh failors that purfued them come 
on, I had made our men kill them all. However j^ 
we took fome way3 to let the poor flying creatures 
know that we would not hurt them ; and immedi- 
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with 
their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to 
us to fave them, which we let them know we would 
do ; whereupon they kept all together in a huddle, 
clofe behind us, for protedion. I left my men drawn 
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but, 
if poflible, to get at fome of our people, and fee 
what devil it was poffefled them, and what they in- 
tended to do ; and, in a word, to command them 
ofl:'; affuring them, that if they ftaid till day-light, 
they would have a hundred thoufand men about their 
ears j I fay, I left them, and went among thofe fly- 
ing people, taking only two of our men with me : 
and there was, indeed, a piteous fpeftacle among 
them : Some of them had their feet terribly burnt 
with trampling and running through the fire ; others 
their hands burnt ; one of the women had falleu 
down in the fire, and was almofl: burnt to death be- 
fore fhe could get out again ; two or three of the 
men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our 
men purfuing j and another was dot through the 
body, and died while I was ther^. 

I would 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 1 

I would fain have learned what the occafion of all 
this was, but I could not underftand one word they 
faid, though by figns I perceived that fome of them 
knew not what was the occafion themfelves. I was 
fo terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt, 
that I could not ftay there, but went back to my 
own men : I told them my refolution, and command- 
ed them to follow me, when in the very moment 
came four of our men, with the boatfwain at their 
head, running over the heaps of bodies they had 
killed, all covered with blood and duft, as if they 
wanted more people to maffacre ; when our men 
hallooed to thenj as loud as they could halloo ; and, 
with much ado, one of them made them hear; 
fp that they knew who we were, and came up to 
us. 

As foon as the boatfwain fa^y us, he fet up a hal- 
loo, like a fhout of Jriumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come ; and without bearing to 
hear me. Captain, fays he, noble captain, I am glad 
you are come ; we have not half done yet : Vil* 
lains ! hell-hound dogs ! I will kill as many of them 
as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have 
fworn to fpare none of them ; we will root out the 
very name of them from the earth : and thus he ran 
on, out of breath too with aftion, and would not 
give us leave to fpeak a word. 

At laft, raifing my voice that I might filence him 
a little : Barbarous dog ! faid I, what are you doing ? 
I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain 
of death. I charge you, upon your life, to ftop 
your hands, and (land ftill h^re,- or you are a dead 
man this minute,

S32 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Why, Sir, fays he, do you know what you da, 
or what they have done ? If you want a reafon for 
what we have done, come hither ; and with that he 
fhewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with 
his throat cut. 

I confefs I was urged then myfelf, and at ano* 
ther time fhould have been forward enough ; but I 
thought they had carried their rage too far, and 
thought of Jacobh words to his fons Simeon and Leviy 
*^ Curfed be their anger ^ for it was fierce ; and their 
*' wrath^ for it was cruelJ* But I had now a new 
tafk upon my hands ; for when the men I carried 
with me faw the fight, as I had done, I had as much 
to do to reftrain them, as I fliould have had with the 
Others ; nay, my nephew himfelf fell in with them, 
and told me, in their hearing, that he was only con- 
cerned for fear of the men being overpowered ; for, 
as to the people, he thought not one of them ought 
to live ; for they had all glutted themfelves with the 
murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be 
ufed like murderers : upon thefe words, away ran 
eight of my men with the boatfwain and his crew, 
to complete their bloody work : and I, feeing it quite 
out of my power to reftrain them, came away pen- 
five and fad ; for I could not bear the fight, much 
lefs the horrible noife and cries of the poor wretches 
that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the fuper- 
cargo and two men, and with thefe I walked back to 
the boats. It was a* very great piece of folly in me» 
I confefs, to venture back as it were alone ; for as 
it began now to be almoft day, and the alarm had 
run over the country, there ftood about forty men, 

4 armed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

armed with lances and bows, at the little place where 
the twelve or thirteen houfes flood, mentioned be- 
fore ; but by accident I miffed the place, and came 
direOily to the fea-fide ; and by that time I got to 
'the fea-fide, it was broad day: immediately I took 
the pinnace, and went aboard, and fent her back to 
aflift the men in what might happen. 

I obferved, that about the time I came to the boat- 
fide, the fire was pretty well out, and the noife abated; 
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I 
heard a volley of our men's fire arms, and faw a 
great fmoke ; this, as I underftood afterwards, was 
our men falling upon the forty men, who, as I faid, 
flood at the few houfes on the way ; of whom they 
killed fixteen or feventeen, and fet all thofe houfes 
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or 
children. 

By that time the men got to the fhore again with 
the pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came 
dropping in, fome and fome ; not in two bodies, and 
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, flraggling 
here and there in fuch manner, that a /mall force 
of refolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole coun- 
try : The people were amazed and furprifed, and fo 
frighted, that, I believe, an hundred of them would 
have fled at the fight of but five of our men. Nor 
in all this terrible a£lion was there a man who made 
any confiderable defence ; they were fo furprized be- 
tween the terror of the fire, and the fudden attack 
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which 
way to turn themfelves ; for if they fled one way, 
they were met by one party ; if back again, by ano- 
ther J 



234 ^IPE AND ADVENTURES 

ther ; fo that they were every where knocked down. 
Nor did any of our men receive the lead hurt, ex- 
cept one who drained his foot, and another had one 
of his hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain? 
and, indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular ; as well for his afting fo out of 
his duty, as commander of the Ihip, and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his proiripting, 
rather than cooling, the rage of his men, in fo bloody 
and cruel an enterprife : My nephew anfwered me 
very refpedtfuUy ; but told me that when he faw the 
body of the poor feaman, whom they had murdered in 
fuch a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not mafter 
of himfelf, neither could he govern his paflion ; he 
owned, he fliould not have donefo, as he was comman- 
der of the Ihip ; but, as he was a man, and nature moved 
him, he could not bear it. As for the reft of the 
men, they were not fubjeQ: to meat all; and they, 
knew it well enough, fo they took no notice of ?ny 
diflike. 

The next day we fet fail ; fo we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed; fome faid one thing, fome 
another : But, according to the beft of their ac- 
counts put all together, they killed, or deftroyed, 
about 150 people, men, women, and children, and 
left not a houfe ftanding in the town. 

As for the poor fellow Thomas Jeffrys^ as he was 
quite dfead, for his throat was fo cut that his head 
was half off, it would do him no fervice to bring 
him away ; fo they left him where-they found hini^

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2^^ 

only took him down from the tree where he was 
hanged by one hand. 

However juft our men thought this aftiou to be, I 
was againfl: them in it ; and I always, after that time, 
told them God would blaft the voyage ; for I looked 
upon the blood they (hed that night to be murder in 
them : for though it is true that they killed Thomas 
yeffrysj yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggr^flbr, 
had broken th^ truce, and had violated or debauched 
a young woma^i of their's, who came to our camp 
innocently, and on the faith of their capitulation. 

The boatfwain defended this quarrel when we were 
,afterwards on board. He faid, it was true that wc 
feemisd to break the truce, but really had not ; and 
that the war was begun the night before by the na- 
tives themfelves, who had fhot at us, and killed one 
of our men without any juft provocation ; fo that, 
as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might alfo 
be in a capacity to do ourfelves juftice upon them in 
an extraordinary mariner } that though the poor 
man had taken liberty with a wench, he ought not to 
have been murdered, and that in fuch a villainous 
manner ; and that they did nothing but what was 
juft, and that the laws pf God allowed to be done to 
murderers. 

One would think this fhould have been enough 
to have warned us againft going on fhore among 
heathens and barbarians ; but it is impoffible to 
make mankind >yife, but at their own experience ; 
and their experience feems to be always of moft ufe 
to them, when it is deareft bought. 

We were now bound to the gulph .of Perfta^ and 
from thence to the coaft of Coromandely only to touch 

at 



2^6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

at Surat; but the chief of the fupercargo's defign 
lay at the bay of Bengal^ where, if he miffed of the 
bufinefs outward-bound, he was to go up to China y 
and return to the coaft as he came home. 

The firft difafter that befel us was in the gulph of 
Perfia^ where five of our men, venturing on Ihore on 
the Arabian fide of the gulph, were furrounded by 
the Arabs ^ and either all killed, or carried away into 
llavery ; the reft of the boat's crew were not able to 
refcue them, and had but juft time to get off their 
boat : I began to upbraid them with the juft retribu- 
tion of Heaven in this cafe ; but the boatfwain very 
warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my 
cenfures than I could fliew any warrant for in fcrip- 
ture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke^ ver. 4. 
where our Saviour intimates, that thofe men, on 
whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not finners 
above all the Galileans ; but that which, indeed, put 
me to filence in this cafe, was, that none of thefe 
five men, who were now loft, were of the number of 
thofe who went on fhore to the maffacre of Madagaf^ 
car (fo I always called it, though our men could not 
bear the v/ord majfacre with any patience) : and, in- 
deed, this laft circumftance, as I have faid, put me 
to filence for the prefent. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this fubjed 
had worfe confequences than I expeded; and the 
boatfwain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me, he 
found that I continually brought that affair upon the 
ftage ; that I made unjuft reaeclions upon it, and had 

ufed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

ufed the men very ill on that account, and himfelf in 
particular ; that as I was but a paffenger, and had no 
command in the Ihip, or concern in the voyage, they 
were not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know 
but I might have fome ill defign in my head, and> 
perhaps, call them to an account for it, when they 
came to England ; and that therefore, unlefs I would 
refolve to have done v^ith it, and alfo not to concern 
myfelf farther with him, or any of his affairs, he 
would leave the fhip ; for he did not think it was fafe 
to fail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and 
then told him, that I did confefs I had all along op- 
pofed the maflacre of Madagafcar^ for fuch I would 
always call it ; and that I had on all occafions fpoken 
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him 
than any of the reft ; that as to my having no com- 
mand in the fhip, that was true, nor did I exercife 
any authority, only took the liberty of fpeaking my 
mind in things which publickly concerned us all ; as 
to what concern I had in the voyage, that was none 
of his bufmefs ; I was a confiderable owner of the 
fhip, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to 
fpeak, even farther than I had yet done, and would 
not be accountable to him, or any one elfe ; and be- 
gan to be a little warm with him : he made but little 
reply to me at that time, and I thought that affair had 
been over. We were at this time in the road to Ben- 
gal ; and, being willing to fee the place, I went on 
fhore with the fupercargo, in, the fhip's boat, to di- 
vert myfelf; and towards evening was preparing to 
go on board, when one of the men came to me, and 

told 



^38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

told me, he would not have me trouble myfelf t9 
come down to the boat, for they had orders not to 
carry me on board. Any one may guefs what a fur- 
prife I was in at fo infolent a meflage ; and I afked the 
man, who bade him deliver that errand to me ? He 
told me the cockfwain. I faid no more to the fel- 
low, but bid him let them know he had delivered 
his meflage, and that I had given him no anfwer 
to it. 

I immediately went, and found out the fupercargo, 
and told him the ftory, adding, what I prefently fore* 
faw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in 
the fliip ; and intteat^d him to gO/ immediately on 
board the flilp in an Indian boat, and acquaint the 
captain of it : but I might have fpared this intelli* 
gence, for, before I had fpoken to him on fhore, the 
matter was effected on board: the boatfwain, the 
gunner, the carpenter, and in a word, all the inferior 
officers, as foon as I was gone off in the boat, came 
up to the quarter-deck, and defired to fpeak with the 
captain ; and there the boatfwain, making a long 
harangue (for the fellow talked very well), and re- 
peating all he had faid to me, told the captain in a 
few words^ that as I was now gone peaceably on 
fliore, they were loth to ufe any violence with me ; 
which, if I had not gone on fliore, they would other- 
wife have done, to oblige me to have gone. They 
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they fliipped 
themfelves to ferve in the fliip under his command, 
they would perform it faithfully : but if I would not 
quit the fliip, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they 
would all leave the fliip, and fail no farther with him : 
and at that word ALL, he turned his face about 

towards 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 639 

towards the main-maft, which was, it feems, the fig. 
nal agreed on between them ; at which all the fea- 
men being got together, they cried out, One and 
ALL, One and ALL ! 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of fpirit, and 
of great prefence of mind, and though he was fur- 
prifed, you may be fure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly he would confider of the matter ; but 
that he could do nothing in it' till he had fpoken to 
me about it : he ufed fome arguments with them, to 
fliew them the unreafonablenefs and injuftice of the 
thing J but it was all in vain ; they fwore, and fliook 
hands round, before his face, that they would go all 
on fhore, unlefs he would engage to them not to fuffer 
me to come on board the fhip. 

This was an hard article upon him, who knew his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; fo he began to talk cavalierly to them ; 
told them that I was a very confiderable owner of the 
ftip, and that in juftice he could not put me out of 
my own houfe ; that this was next door to ferving 
me as the famous pirate Kid had done, who made 
the mutiny in the Ihip, fet the captain on (hore in an 
uninhabited ifland, and ran away with the fhip j that 
let them go into what Ihip they would, if ever they 
came to England zgdin^ it would coft them dear; that 
the fhip was mine, and that he would not put me out 
of it ; and that he would rather lofe the fhip, and 
the voyage too, than difoblige me fo much ; fo they 
might do as they pleafed. However, he would go on 
fliore, and talk with me theie ; and invited the boat- 
fwain to go with him, and perhaps they might ac- 
commodate the matter with me. 

2 But 



240 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But they alt rejefted the propofal ; and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither 
onboard, or on fhore ; and if I came on board, they 
would go on fhore. Well, faid the captain, if you 
are all of this mind, let me go on fhore, and talk with 
him : fo away he came to me with this account, a 
little after the mefTage had been brought to me from 
the cockfwain. 

I was very glad to fee my nephew, I muft confefs ; 
for I was not without apprehenfions that they would 
confine him by violence, fet fail, and run away with 
thefhip ; and then I had been flript naked, in a remote 
country, and nothing to help myfelf : in fhort, I had 
been in a worfe cafe than when I was all alone in the 
ifland. 

But they had not come to that length, it feems, to 
my great fatisfa£tion ; and when my nephew told me 
what they had faid to him, and how they had fworn, 
and fhook hands, that they would one and all leave 
- the fhip, if I was fuffered to come on board, I told 
him, he fhould not be concerned at it at all, for I 
would flay on fhore : I only defired he would take 
care and fend me all my neceffary things on fhore, 
and leave me a fufficient fum of money, and I would 
find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news toTny nephew ; but 
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it. 
♦ So in fhort, he went on board the fhip again, and fa- 
tisfied the men, that his uncle had yielded to their 
importunity, and had fent for his goods from on 
board the fhip. So the matter was over in a very few 
hours : the men returned to their duty, and I begun 
to confider what courfe I fhould fleer. < 

I was 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 24I 

I was now alone in the remoteft part of the world 
as I think I may call it ; for 1 was near three thou- 
fand leagues, by fea, farther oflF from England than 
I was at my ifland ; only, it is true, I might travel 
here by land, over the Great Mogul's country to 
Suraty might go from thence to Baffora by fea, up 
the gulph of Perfiay and from thence might take the 
way of the caravans, over the deferts of Arabia to 
Aleppo and Scanderoon ; and from thence by fea again 
to Italy J and fo over land into France ; and this, put 
together, might be, at leaft, a full diameter of the 
globe ; but, if it were to be meafured, I fuppofe it 
would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait 
for fome EngliJIj fhips, which were coming to Bengal, 
from Achin, on the ifland of Sumatra, and get paf- 
fage on board them for England : but as I came 
hither without any concern with the Englijh Eq/i- 
India Company, fo it would be difficult to go from 
hence without their licence, unlefs with great fevour 
of the captains of the Ihips, or of the company's fac- 
tors ; and to both I was an utter ftranger. 

Here I had the particular pleafure, fpeaking by 
contrarieties, to fee the fliip fet fail without me ; a 
treatment, I think, a man in my circumjftances fcarce 
ever met with, except from pirates running away with 
a (hip, and fetting thofe that would not agree with 
their villainy on fliore : indeed, this was the next 
door to it, both ways. However, my nephew left 
me twofervants, or rather, one companion, andon^ 
fervant : the firft was clerk to the purfer, whom he 
engaged to go with me ; and the other was his own 
fervant. I took me alfo a good lodging in the houfe

upon any thing, T flayed here above nine months^ 
confidering what courfe to take, and how to maha^ 
ihyfelf. I had fome Englijh gdods with rite of valuer

nifhing me with a thoufand pieces of ei^ht, and a 
letter of credit for more, if I had occafion, that I 
'might not be ftraitened, whatever riiight happen. 

I quickly difpofed of my goods, and to advan- 
tage too J and, as I originally intended, I bought 
here fome very good diariionds, which, of all other 
things, was the moft proper for trie, in my drcum- 
fiances, becaufe I might always carry my whok eft^fc 
about me. 

After a long flay here, and many propofals riiacfe 
for my return to England^ but none falling to niy 
Itiind, the Englijh merchant, who lodged with rii«, 
and with whom I had contrafted an intimate io.

I know, fuit with your*s alfo, when you fhall haVc

but that I might, %y my loofe and unhinged cir-

give a long account of the places we went to, and the 
people who inhabit there : thofe things I leave to 
others, and refer the reader to thofe journals and 
travels of En^lijhmen^ niany of which, I find, are 
publifhed, and more .promifed every day. It is 
enough for me to tell you, that we made the voyage 
to Achiriy in the ifland of Sumatra^ firft ; and from 
thence to Sia^iiy where we exchanged fome of our 
wares for opium, and for fome arrack ; the firft, a 
commodity which bears a great price among the 
Chinefej and which, at that time, was very much 
wanted there : in a word, we went up to Sujhani; 
made a very great voyage ; were eight months oufj 
and returned to Bengal : and I was very well fatisfied 
with my adventure. 1 obferve, that our people In 
England^ often admire how the officers, which the 
Company fend into India, and the merchants which 
generally ftay there, get fuch very good eftates as 
they do, arid fometimes come home worth fixty, 
feventy, and an hundred thoufand pounds at a 
time. 

But it is po wonder, or, at leaft, we ihall fee fo 
much farther into it, when we confider the innume- 
rable ports and places where they have a free com- 
merce, that it will then be no wonder ; and much lefs 
will it be fo, when we confider, that all thofe places and 
ports where the Englijh fhipscome, there is. fo much, 
and fuch conftant demand for the growth of all other 
countries, that there is a certain vent for the re- 
turn, as well as a market abroad for the goods car- 
ried out. 

In fhort, we made a very good voyage, and I got 
fo much money by the firft adventure, and fuch, an 

infight 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

infight into the method of getting more, that, had I 
been twenty years younger, I fliould have been 
tempted to have flayed here, and fought no farther 
for making my fortune : but what was all this to a 
man on the wrong fide of threefcore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a 
reftlefs defire of feeing the world, than a covetous 
defire of getting in it ? And, indeed, I think, it is 
with great juftice that I now call it a reftlefs defire ; 
for it was fo : when I was at home, I was reftlefe to 
go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was reftlefs to 
be at home, I fay, what was this gain to me ? I 
was rich enough already ; nor had I any uneafy de- 
fires about getting more money ; and therefore, the 
profits of the voyage to me, were things of no great 
force to me, for the prompting me forward to far- 
ther undertakings : hence I thought, that by this 
voyage I had made no progrefs at all ; becaufe I was 
come back, as I might call it, to the place from 
whence I came, as to an home ; whereas my eye, 
^vhich, like that which Solomon fpeaks of, was 
never fatisfied with feeing, was ftill more defirous of 
wandering and feeing. I was come into a part of the 
world which I never was in before j and that part in 
particular, which I had heard much of; and was 
refolved to fee as much of it as I could ; and then I 
thought, I might fay, I had feen all the world that 
Vas worth feeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions : 
I do not name this to infift upon my own, for I ac- 
knowledge his was moft juft, and the moft fuited to 
the end of a merchant's life ; who, when he is 
R 3 abroad 



24^ LIFE AND ABVBNTU^RJ^a^ 

abroad upon adventures, it is his wifdom to fticj;: td 
that, as the bed thing for him, which he i& like t9 
get the mod money by. My new friend kept himfelf 
to the nature of the thing, and would have beea con-* 
tent to have gone, like a carrier's borfe, alwaysf to 
the fame iim, backward and forward, provided be 
could, as he called it, find his account in k : on the 
therhand, mine, as old as I wa^, was the notion of 
a mad rambUng boy, that never cares to fee a thii]|g 
twice over. 

But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the moft ua- 
fettled refolution imaginable, which way to go. la 
the interval of thefe confultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the fearch for bufinefs, propofed 
another voyage to me, vi%. among the Spice -Iflands j 
and to bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas ^ 
or thereabouts j places where, indeed, the Dutch do 
trade, but the iflands belong partly to the Spaniards ; 
though we went not fo far, but to fome other, where 
they have not the whole power as they have at Baia-- 
via, Ceylon^ &c. We were not long in preparing for 
this voyage ; the chief difficulty was in bringing me 
to come into it ; however, at laft, nothing elfe offering, 
and finding that really ftirring about and trading, the 
profit being fo great, and, as I may fay, certain, 
bad more pleafure in it, and more fatisfaftion to the 
mind, than fitting ftill j which, to me efpecially 
was the unhappieft part of life, I refolved on this 
voyage too : which we made very fuccefsfully, touch* 
ing at Borneo^ and feveral iflands, whofe names I do 
not remember, and came home in about five month?^

ftime nutmegs, to the Per/tan merchants, who car- 
i^?d them away for the Gulph ; and, making near five 
qf pne, w^ really got a great deal of money. 
; My friend, when we made up this a,ccQunt, fmile4 
a^ nxe : Well now, faid he, with a fort of an agreeable 
iufult upon my indolent temper, is not this better 
than walking about here, like a man of nothing to 
^o, and fpending our time in flaring at the nonfenfe 
and ignorance of the Pagans ? Why truly, faid l^ 
iny friend, I think it is ; and I begin to be a convert 
to the principles of merchandizing. But I muft tell 
you, faid I, by the way, you do not know what I 
am doing ; for if once I conquer my backwardnefs, 
^nd embark heartily, as old as I am, I fhall harrafs 
you up and down the world till I tire you j for 
1 fhall purfue it fo eagerly, I fhall nev^r let you 
iieftill. 

But to be fhort with my fpeculations : a little while 
after this, there came in a Dutch fhip from Batavia ; 
fhe was a coafter, not an European trader, and oiF 
about two hundred tons burden : the men, as they 
pretended, having been fo fickly, that the captain 
had not men enough to go to fea with, he lay by at 
Bengal ; and, as if having got money enough, or 
being willing, for other reafons, to go for Europe^ 
he gave public notice, that he would fell his fhip : 
this came to my ears before my new partner heard of 
it ; and I had a great mind to buy it. So I went 
l^ome to him, and told him of it : he confidered 
awhile, for he was no rafh man neither ; but mufing 
fon^e time, he replied. She is a little too big ; but, 
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought 
the fhip; and, agreeing >yitl^ the niafter, we pai^

for her, and took poffeffion ; when we had done fo, 
we refblved to entertain the men, if we could, to 
join them with thofe we had, for the purfuing our 
bufinefs ; but on a fudden, they not having received 
their wages, but their Ihare of the money, as we af- 
terwards lear^t, not one of them was to be found; 
We enquired much about them, and at length were 
told, that they were all gone together, by land, to 
Agra^ the great city of the Mogul^s refidence ; and 
from thence were to travel to Surat, and fo by fea to- 
the gulph of Per/ia. 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good while^v 
as that I miffed the opportunity of going with them ; 
for fuch a ramble, I thought, and in fuch company 
as would both have guarded me, and diverted me, 
would have fuited mightily with my great defign ; 
and I fliould both have feen the world, and gon6 
homewards too ; but I was much better fatisfied a 
few days after, when I came to know what fort of 
fellows they were ; for, in fhort, their hiftory was, 
that this man they called captain was the gunner only, 
not the commander ; that they had been a trading ' 
voyage, in which they were attacked on fhore by 
fome of the Malaccans^ who had killed the captain 
and three of his men; and that after the captain 
was killed, thefe men, eleven in number, had re- 
folved to run away with the fhip, which they didj 
and had brought her in at the bay of Bengal^ leav- 
ing the mate and five men more on fliore ; of whom 
we fhall hear farther. 

Well ; let them come by the (hip how they would, 
we. came honeftly by her, as we thought; though 
we did not, I confefs, examine into things fo ex- 

aaiy

a6lly as we ought; for we never enquired any 
thing of the feamen, who, if we had examined, 
would certainly have faultered in their accounts, 
contradifted one another, and perhaps have contra- 
dided themfelves; or, one how or other, we 
fhould have feen reafon to have fufpefted them : but 
the man fliewed us a bill of fale for the fhip, to one 
J£manuel Clojierjhoven^ or fome fuch name (for I fup- 
pofe it was all a forgery) and called himfelf by that 
name ; and we could not contradidt him ; and being 
withal a little too unwary, or at leaft, having no 
fufpiclon of the thing, we went through with our 
bargain. 

However we picked up fome Englijh feamen here 
after this, and fome Dutch ; and we now refolved 
for a fecond voyage to the fouth-eaft, for cloves, &c. 
that is to fay, among the Philippine and Malacca 
illes ; and, in fliort, not to fill this part of my ftory 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is fo remark- 
able, .1 fpent, from firft to laft, fix years in this coun- 
try, trading from port to port, backward and for- 
ward, and with very good fuccefs ; and • was 
now the laft year with my partner, going in the 
ihip above-mentioned, on a voyage to China; but 
defigning firft to go to Siam^ to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the ftraits of 
Malacca^ and among the iflands, we were no fooner 
got clear of thofe difficult feas, but we found our 
Ihip had fprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our induftry, to find out where it was. This forced 
us to make for fome port ; and my partner, who 
knew the country better than I did, direded the 
captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for I 

had

hftdi in^a^s the. Englijh, mate, one Mr. Thonipfony c^^ , 
tain, Bot being willing to take the charge of the 
ftiip i,i|>on myJfelf : This river lies on the north fiwje 
of the great bay or gulph, which goes up to Sianu 

While we wer^ here, and going often on ihore 
for re&elhment, there comes to me one da,y an En^^ 
lijhmany 3ittd he was, it feems, a gunner's ^a^te oa 
board an Englijh Eaji India fliip, which rode ^n the 
feme river, tip at, or near the city of Cambodia^: 
what brouglit him hither we knew not ; but he comes 
up to me, and, fpeaking Englijb^ Sir, fays he, you 
are a ftranger to me, and I to you; but I hav^ 
fomething to tell you, that very nearly concerns 
you. 

I looked ftedfaftly at him a good while, and ha 
thought at firft I had known him, but I did not : If 
it very nearly concerns me, faid I, and not your- 
felf, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved,^ 
fays he, by the imminent danger you are in ; and for 
aught I fee, you have no knowledge of it. I kno\ir 
no danger I am in, faid I, but that my fhip is leaky, 
and I cannot find it out ; but I propofe to lay her 
aground to-morrow, to fee if I can find it. But, Sir, 
flaiy^ he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, 
you will be wifer than to lay your fhip on ihore 
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to fay to you : 
Do you know, Sir, faid he, the town of Canibodiq 
lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? A^d ther? 
are two large Englijh fhips about five leagues on this 
fide, and three Dutch. Well faid I, and what is 
that to me ? Why, Sir, fays he, is it for a man that 
is upon fuch adventures as you are, to come into a 
port, and not examine firft what fhips there are there, 

and

jmd whether he is able to deal ^ith them ? I fuf^pofe 
y<m do tiQt thiiik you^e a match for thein? I^H^as 
Ittfiufed very much at his difcourfe, but not aimazsed 
«t it; for I could not conceive what he meant; and 
I turned fhprt upon him, and faid. Sir, I wilhyou 
ijKould explain yourfelf ; I cannot imagine what rea- 
feh I have to be afraid ofiuiyof the Company's 
ftips, or Dutch fliips ; I am Bo interloper j what can 
jthey have to fey to me ? 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleafed ; 
and, paufing awhile, but Ctniling, Well, Sir, fjiys 
^e, if you think yourfelf fecure, you muft ts^eyour 
chance j I am forry your fate fhould blind you againil 
gOfHl ?^yice ; but affure yourfelf, if you do not put 
to fea immediately, you will the very next tide be 
attacked by five long-boats full of men ; and, per- 
haps if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pi- 
yate, and the particulars be examined into after- 
wards: I thought. Sir, added he, I Ihould have 
met with a better reception than this, for doing you 
a piece of fervice of fuch importance. I can never 
be ungrateful, faid I, for any fervice, or to any man 
that offers me any kindnefs ; but it is paft my com- 
prehenfion, faid I, what they fhould have fuch a de- 
fign upon me for : However, fmce you fay there is 
no time to be loft, and that there is fome villainous 
defign in hand againft me, I will go on board this 
minute, and put to fea immediately, if my men can 
ftop the leak, or if we can fwim without flopping it ; 
But, Sir, faid I, (hall I go away ignorant of the rea- 
fon of all this ? Can you ^ive me no farther light 
into it? 

I can 



2$2 LITE AND ADVENTURES 

I can tell you but part of the ftory. Sir, fays he ; "but 
I have a Dutch feaman here with me, and^ I believe, 
I could perfuade him to tell you the reft ; but th^e 
is fcarce time for it : But the fliort of the ftory is 
this, the firft part of which, I fuppofe, you know 
v/ell enough, viz. That you were with this fliip ztSu^ 
mafra ; that there your captain was murdered by 
the Malaccans, with three of his men ; and that 
you, or fome of thoffe that were on board with you, ran ' 
away with the fhip, and are fince turned PIR AXES* 
This is thefum of the ftory, and you will all be feized 
as pirates, I can affure you, and executed with very 
little ceremony ; for you know merchant fhips fliew 
but little law to pirates, if they get them in their 
power. 

Now you fpeak plain Englijh^ faid I, and I thank 
you ; and though I know nothing that we have done, 
like what you talk of, but I am fure we came honeft- 
ly and fairly by the fliip ; yet feeing fuch work is a 
doing, as you fay, and that you feem to mean ho- 
neftly, I will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, fays 
he, do not talk of being upon your guard ; the beft 
defence is to be out of the danger : if you have any 
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men, 
put out to fea without fail at high- water ; and as 
you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out before they can come down ; for they will 
come away at high- water ; and as they have tweiity 
miles to come, you^U get near two hours of them 
by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length 
of the way : Befides, as they are only boats, and 
not fliips, they will not venture to follow you far out 

to fea, efpecially if it blows. 

Well, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

Well, faid I, you have been very kind In this : 
What fhall I do for you to make you amends ? Sir, 
fays he, you may not be fo willing to make me 
amends, becaufe you may not be convinced of the 
truth of it : I will make an offer to you ; I have 
nineteen months pay due to me on board the fhip 
■ ■ , which I came out of England in ; and the 
Dutchman^ that is with me, has feven months pay 
due to him ; if you will make good our pay to us, 
we will go along with you : If you find nothing 
more in it, we will defire no more ; but if we do 
convince you, that we have faved your life, and the 
fliip, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave 
the reft to you.' 

I confented to this readily ; and went immediately 
on board, and the two men with me. As foon as I 
came to the fliip's fide, my partner, who was on 
Board, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me 
with a great deal of joy, O ho ! O ho ! we have 
ftopped the leak ! Say you fo, faid I, thank God ; 
but weigh the anchor then immediately : Weigh ! 
fays he, what do you mean by that ? What is the 
matter ? fays he. Afk no queftions, faid I, but all 
hands to work, and weigh without lofing a minute. 
He was furprifed : But, however, he called the cap- 
tain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be 
got up ; and though the tide was not quite done, yet 
a little land-breeze blowing, we ftood out to fea ; 
then I called him into the cabin, and told him the 
ftory at large ; and we called in the men, and they 
told us the reft of it : but as it took us up a great 
deal of time, fo before we had done, a feaman 
comes to the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that 

the 



&l^4 ^I^ AND ADV£NTUk£S 

the captsun bade him tell us, we were chafed: 
Chafed, faid I, by whom, and by what ? By five 
ilobps, or boats, faid the fellow, full of men. Very, 
well, faid I ; then it is apparent there is foraethiiig 
in it. In the next place, I ordered all our men to 
be called up : and told them, that there was a de^ 
fign to feize the fhip, and to take us for pirates $ 
and afked them, if they would (land by us, and by 
dne another ? The men anfwered, chearfully, one 
and all, that they would live and die with us. Then 
I aflced the captain, what way he thought' beft for 
us to manage a fight with them : For refift them I 
refolved we would, and that to the laft drop. He 
faid, readily, that the way was to keep them oflF 
with our great fhot, as long as we could, and then 
to fire at them with our fmall arms, to keep them 
from boarding us ; but when neither of thefe would 
do any longer, we fhould retire to our clofe quar- 
ters ; perhaps they had not materials to break opett 
our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. ' - 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring 
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the fteerage, to 
clear the deck, and load them with mufquet-buUets, 
and fmall pieces of old iron, and what next came to 
liand; and thus we made ready for fight; but all 
this while kept out to fea, with wind enough, an5 
could fee the boats at a diftance, being five large- 
long-boats following us, with all the fail they could 
make. 

Two of thefe boats, which, by oui glaffes, Vre 
could fee were Englijh, had out-failed the reft, were 
near two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon 
us confiderably j fo that we found they would coine 

up

upVith us : iipdh tvhich we fired a gtift witTiout a 
fiidt, to intimate that ^hey ihould Wmg -to •; attid ^e 
jptft 'oat a flag df truce, as a fighal for pttrley ; tut 
they kept crowding after us, till they came vithih 
ft6t : ttpdn this we took in our white flag, they 
hkSriilg made 'no anfwerto it, hung out the red flag, 
»nd fired at them with ihot : Notwithftanding this, 
they camie on till they Were near enough to call tp 
them with a fpeakmg trumpet, which we had on 
board ; fo wc called to them, and bade them keep 
oflF at their peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and eit- 
deavoiirdd to come under our fl:ern, fo to board us 
on our quarter : Upon which, feeing they were rc- 
foliite for mifchief, and depended upon the ftrength 
that followed them, I ordered to bring the fhip to, 
fo that they lay upon our broadfide, when immedi- 
ately tve fired five guns at them ; one of them had 
-beeh levelled fo true, as to carry away the ftern of 
the Tiindermdft boat, and bring them to the necefEty 
of taking down their fail, and running all to tht 
head of the boat to keep her from finking ; fo (hfe 
lay by, and had enough of it j but feeing the fore- 
nioft boat flill crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in piarticular. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had difabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take out 
the men: we called again to the foremoft boat, and 
oflfered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her bufinefs with us ; but had no anfwer : only 
'^flie crowded clofe under our flern. Upon this our 

gunner

gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run out 
his two chace guns, and fired at her j but the ihot 
miffing, the men in the .boat fhouted, waved their 
caps, and came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly 
ready again, fired among theni a fecond time ; one 
Ihot of which, though it miffed the boat itfelf, yet 
fell in among the men, and we could eafily fee had 
done a great deal of mifchief among them ; but we, 
taking no notice of that, weared the fhip again, and 
brought OUT quarter to bear upon them ; and, firing 
three guns more, we found the boat was fplit almoft 
to pieces j in particular, her rudder, and a piece of 
her ftern, were (hot quite away ; fo they handed 
their fail immediately, and were in great diforder : 
but, ta compleat their misfortune, our gunner let 
fly two guns at them again ; where he hit them we 
could not tell, but we found the boat was finking, 
and fome of the men already in the water :— 
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, 
which we had kept clofe by our fide, with orders to 
pick up fome of the men, if they, could, and fave 
them from drowning, and imediately to come on 
board with them ; becaufe we faw the reft of the 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace 
followed their orders, and took up three -men ; one 
of \vhich was jufl: drowning, and it was a good while 
before we could recover him. As foon as they were 
on board, we crowded all the fail we could make, 
and ftood farther out to fea;and we found, that** 
when the other three boats came up to the firft two^ 
they gave over their chacc. 

Being 



OF ROBmsoK CRtJSOE. H^J 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which tho* 
I knew not the reafon. of it, yet feemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I took care that wc fhould 
change our courfe, and/not let any one imagine whi- 
Jther we were going ; fo we ftood out to fea eaftward, 
quite out of the courfe of all European, fhips, whe- 
ther they, were bound to Chiiia^ or' any where elfe, 
within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at fea, we began, to confult 
with the two feamen,; and enquire firft, what the 
m:eaning of all this Ihould he i Tho. Dutchman let us 
into the fecret of it at once ; telling us, that the fel- 
low that fold us the ihip, as^we. :faid>;v/a$ .]0Lo ir^ore 
than a thiefithat had^ run away with, her* . Then he 
told us: how the. captain, whofe.nanje too he men- 
tioned, though I do not renlen^ber it now, was 
treacheroufly murdered by the natives on the coaft of 
Malacca^ with three of his men; and that he, this 
Dutchman^ and fpur more, got into the woods, where 
they wanderjpd atiput a great while ; till at length, he, 
in particular;, ;in a mir^iculous manner, mad^ his 
cfcape, .ajpid ^wj^pi .off to : a, I)ui(:b fhip? which failing 
near the fhore, in its way from China j hacj fent their 
boat M' fhore for frefll water*; that -he durft pot 
come to that part of the fhore where the boat was^ 
but made fhift in the liight to. take; in* the water 
farther off, and fwimming a. great while, at lafl the 
. ffiip'sboat tobkhina up* 
. He. then told us, that he went to Bafavih, v/hcre 
two of the feanien belonging to the fhip had arrived, 
having deferted the refl in their travels ; and gave 
an account, that the. fellow who. had run away with 
the fhip, fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, which 

Vol. II. S were 



^5' I-^FE AND ADVENTURES 

were gone a cruifing In her; and that they had al- 
ready taken an Englijh fhip, and two Dutch fliips, 
very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us direftly ; 
and though we knew it to be falfe, yet, as my part- 
ner faid very well, if we had fallen into their hands, 
and they had fuch a prepoffeffion againft us before- 
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended 
ourfelves, or to hope for any good quarters at their ' 
hands j efpecially confidering that our accufers had 
been our judges, and that we could have expefted 
nothing from them but what rage would have die* 
tated, and ungoverned paffion have executed j and 
therefore it was his opinion, we fliould go direfUy 
back to Bengal^ from whence we came, without put- 
ting in at any port whatever ; becaufe there we could 
give an account of ourfelves, and could prove where 
we were when the fhip put in, whom we bought her 
of, and the like ; and, which was more than all the 
reft, if we were put to the neceflity of bringing it 
before the proper judges, we fhould be fure to have 
fome jufticej and not be hanged firft, and judged 
afterwards. 

I was fome time of my partner's opinion; but 
after a little more ferious thinking, I told him, I 
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt 
returning to Bengal^ for that we were on the wrong 
fide of the ft raits of Malacca; and that if the^ 
alarm was given, we fhould be fure to be way-laid on 
every fide, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the 
Englijh elfewhere ; that if we fhould be taken, as it 
were, running away, we fhould even condemn our- 
felves, and there would want no more evidence to 

deftroy 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I59 

deftroy us. I alfo alked the Englijh failor's opinion, 
who faid, he was of my mind, and that we ihould 
certainly be taken. 

This danger a little ftartled my partner, and all 
the fliip's compiany ; and we immediately refolved to 
go away to the coaft of Tonquirij and fo on to China ; 
and from thence purfuing the firft defign, as to trade, 
find fome way or other to difpofe of the (hip, and 
come back in fome of the velfels of the country, 
fuch as we could get. This was approved of as the 
beft method for our fecurity j and accordingly we 
fleered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty leagues off 
from the ufual courfe to the eaftward. 

This, however, put us to fome 'inconveniencies j 
for firft the winds, when we came to that diftance 
from the fhore, feemed to be more fteadily againft 
us, blowing almoft trade, as we call it, from the eafl 
and E. N. E. fo that we were a long while upon our 
voyage ; and we were but ill provided with vidtuals 
for fo long a run j and, which was ftill worfe, there 
was fome danger, that thofe Englijh and Dutch fhips, 
whofe boats purfued us, whereof fome were bound 
that way, might be ^ot in before us; and if not, 
fome other fhip, bound to China^ might have infor- 
mation of us from them, and purfue us with the 
fame vigour. 

I muft confefs, I was now very uneafy, arid thought 
myfelf, including the late efcape from the long-boats, 
•to have been in the moft dangerous condition that 
ever I was in through all my paft life ; for, whatever 
ill circumftances I had been in, I was never purfued 
for a thief before j nor had I ever done any thing 

S 2 that 



260 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that merited the name of dilhoneft or fraudulent, 
much lefs thievifh. I had chiefly been mine own 
enemy j or, as I may rightly fay, I had been no- 
body's enemy but my own. But now I was embar- 
taffed in the worft condition imaginable ; for though 
I was perfeftiy innocent, I was in no condition to . 
make that innocence appear. And if I had been 
taken, it had been under a fuppofed guilt of the 
worft kind ; at leaft, a crime efteemed fo among the 
people I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an efcape, 
though which way to do it, I knew not ; or what 
port or place we fliould go to. My partner, feeing 
me thus dejefted, though he was the moft con- 
cerned at firft, began to encourage me ; aiid de- 
fcribing to me the feveral ports of that coaft, told 
me, he would put in on the coaft of Cochinchina^ or 
the bay of Tonquin ; intending to go afterwards to 
Macao^ a town once in the poffeflion of the Poriu^ 
guefe^ and where ftill a great many European families 
refided, and particularly the miffionary prieft ufualjy 
went thither, in order to their going forward to 
China. ^ 

Hither we then refolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular courfe, and very 
much ftraitened for provifions, we came within fight 
of the coaft very early in the morning ; and, upon 
refledion upon the paft circumftances we were in^ 
and the danger, if we had not efcaped, we refolved 
to put into a fmall river, which, however, had depth 
enough of water for us, and to fee if we could, ei- 
ther over land or by the ihip's pinnace, come ta 
I know 



OF ROBINSOK CRUSOE. ^6% 

know what (hips were in any port thereabouts. ' This 
happy ftep was, indeed, our deliverance ; for tho* 
we did not immediately fee any European fhips in the 
bay of Tonquirij yet, the next morning, there came 
into the bay two Dutch fhips, and a third without 
any colours fpread out, but which we believed to be 
a Dutchman^ pafTed by at about two leagues diftance, 
fteering for the coaft of China ; and in the after- 
noon went by two Englijh fliips, fteering the fame^ 
courfe ; and thus, we thought, we faw ourfelves 
befet with enemies, both one way and the other. 
The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the 
people thieves, even by occupation or profeffion; 
and though, it is true, we had not much to feek of 
them, and except getting a few provifions, cared not 
how little we had to do with them ; yet it was with 
much difficulty that we kept ourfelves from being in- 
fulted by them feveral ways. 

We were in a fmall river of this country, within 
a few leagues of its utmoft limits northward ; and by 
our boat we coafted north-eaft to the point of land 
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin ; and it 
was in this beating up along the fhore, that we dif- 
covered as above, that in a word, we were furrounded 
with enemies. The people we were among were 
the moft barbarous of all the inhabitants of the 
coaft ; having no correfpondence with 2lny other na* 
tion, and dealing only in fifli and oil, and fuch grols 
commodities ; and it may be particularly feen, that 
they are, as 1 faid, the moft barbarous of any of 
the inhabitants, viz. that among other cuftoms they 
have this one, that if any veffd had the misfortune 

S3 to 



^6Z LITE AND ADVENTURES 

to be fliipwrecked upon their coaft, they prefently 
make the men all prifoners ; that is to fay, flaves j 
and it was not long before we found a fpice of their 
kindnefs this way, on the occafion following : 

I have obferved above, that our fhip fprung a 
leak at fea, and that we could not find it out ; and 
however it happened, that, as I have faid, it was 
flopped unexpeftedly, in the happy minute of our 
being to be feized by the Dutch and Englijh (hips, 
near the bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the 
jQiip fo perfectly tight aud found as we defired, we 
refolved, while we were in this place, to lay her 
on fhore, take out what heavy things we had on 
board, which were not many, and to wafli and clean 
her bottom ; and if poffible, to find out where the 
leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the fhip, and brought 
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one 
fide, "we tried to' bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; for, on fecond thoughts, we 
did not care to lay her dry a-ground, neither could 
we find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with fuch a fight, came wondering down to the 
fliore to look at us ; and feeing the Ihip lie down on 
one fide in fuch a manner, and heeling towards tho 
fhore, and not feeing our men, who were at worfc 
on her bottom, with flages, and with their boats on, 
the off fide, they prefently concluded that the fhip 
was caft away, and lay fo very fafl on the ground. 

On this fuppofition they came all about us in two 

QT three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats^

or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 263 

having fome of them eight, fome ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the fhip ; and if they had found us there, 
to have carried us away for flaves to their king, or 
whatever they call him, for we knew not who was 
their governor. 

When they came up to the fhip, and began to row 
round her, they difcovered us all hard at word, on 
thQ outfide of the Ihip's bottom and fide, wafhing 
and graving, and flopping, as every feafaring man 
knows how. 

They flood for a while gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little furprized, could not imagine what their 
defign was ; but, being willing to be fure, we took 
this opportunity to get fome of us into the fhip, and 
others to hand down arms and ammunition, to thofe 
that were at work to defend themfelves with, if there 
fliould be occafiori ; and it was no more than need : 
for, in lefs than a quarter of an hour's confultation, 
they agreed, it feems, that the fhip was really a 
wreck ; that we were all at work, endeavouring to 
fave her, or to fave our lives by the help of our 
boats ; and when we handed our arms into the boats, 
they concluded,, by t^at motion, that we were endea- 
vouring to fave fome of our goods. Upon this they 
took it for granted they all belonged to them ; 
and away they came diredly upon our men, as if it 
had been in a line of battle. 

Our men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted ; for we lay but in an ill poflure to fight, and 
crif d out to us to know what they fhould do ? I im- 
mediately called to the men who worked upon the 

S 4 flages.

ftages, to flip them down, and get up the fide into 
the fliip ; and bade thofe in the boat to row round 
and come on board : and thofe few of us who were 
on board, worked with all the ftrength and hands 
we had, to bring the fliip to rights j but however, 
neither the men upon the ftage, nor thofe in the 
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cochinchinefe were upon them ; and, with two of 
their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay- 
hold of the men as their prifoners. 

The firft man they laid hold of was an Englijh 
feaman, a flout ftrong fellow, who having a muf- 
quet in his hand, never oflfered to fire it, but laid it 
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he 
underftood his bufinefs better than I could teach him; 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by main 
force out of their own boat into ours ; where, tak- 
ing him by the two ears, he beat his head fo againft 
the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died inftantly in 
his hands ; and in the mean time, a Dutchman^ who 
flood next, took up the mufquet, and with the butt- 
end of it, fo laid about him, that he knocked down 
five of them, who attempted to enter the boat : but 
this was little towards refifting thirty or forty men, 
who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their danger, be- 
gan to throw themfelves into the long-boat, where 
we had but five men to defend it : but one accident 
gave our men a complete vidory, which deferved 
our laughter rather than any thing elfe j and that 
was this : — 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out- 
fide of the ihip, as well as to pay the feams where 

he 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^6^ 

he had caulked her, to ftop the leaks, had got two 
kettles juft let down into the boat ; one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rofin, tallow, and 
oil, and fuch ftufF as the fhipwrights ufed for that 
work ; and the man that tended the carpenter had 
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he fup- 
plied the men that were at work with that hot fluff: 
two of the enemy's men entered the boat juft where 
this fellow ftood, being in the fore-fheets ; he imme- 
diately faluted them with a ladleful of the ftuff, boil- 
ing hot, which fo burnt and fcalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the fca. The 
carpenter faw it, and cried out. Well done. Jack, 
give them fome more of it ; when ftepping forward 
himfelf, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it 
in the pitch pot, he and his man threw it among ^ 
them fo plentifully, that, in fhort, of all the men 
in three boats, there was not one that was not 
fcalded and burnt with it in a moft frightful pi- 
tiful manner, and made fuch an howling and crying, 
that I never heard a worfe noife, and, indeed, no- 
thing like it: for it was worth obferving, that tho' 
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every 
nation have a particular way of exclamation, and 
jnake noifes as different from one another as their 
f peech, I cannot give the noife thefe creatures made 
a better name than howling, nor a name more pro- 
per to the tone of it j for I never heard any thing 
more like the noife of the wolves, which, as I have 
faid, I heard howl in the foreft on the frontiers of 
l^anguedoc. 

I was 



S66 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was never, pleafed with a viftory better in my life; 
not only as it was a perfeft furprife to me, and that 
our danger was imminent before ; but as we got this 
vidory without any bloodfhed, except of that man 
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I 
was very much concerned at ; for I was fick of killing 
fuch poor favage wretches, even though it was in my 
own defence, "knowing they came on errands which 
they thought juft, and knew no better : and that 
though it may be a juft thing, becaufe necefTary,. for 
there is no neceffary wickednefs in nature ; yet I 
thought it was a fad life, when we muft be always 
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to prefervc 
ourfelves ; and, indeed, Ithinkfoftill; and I would, 
even now, fufFer a great deal, rather than I would 
take away the life even of the worft perfon injuring 
me. I believe alfo, all confidering people, who know 
the value of life, would be of my opinion^ if they en* 
tered ferioufly into the confideration of it. 

But to return to my ftory : All the while this was do- 
ing, my partner and I, who managed the reft of the 
men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought 
the Ihip almoft to rights j and, having gotten the guns 
into their places again, the gunner called to me, to 
bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly 
among them. I called back again to him, and bid 
him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the 
work without him ; but bade him heat another pitch 
kettle ; which our cook, who was on board, took 
care of* But the enemy was fo terrified with what 
they met with in their firft attack, that they would 
not come on again ; and fome of them, that were 
fartheft oflF, feeing the fhip fwim, as it were, upright, 

began 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

began, as we fuppofed, to fee their miftake, and 
gave over the enterprife, finding it was not as they 
expefted. Thus we got clear of this merry fight ; 
and, having gotten fome rice, and fome roots and 
bread, with about fixteen good big hogs, on board, 
two days before, we refolved to flay here no longer, 
but go forward, whatever came of it ; for we made 
no doubt but we (hould be furrounded the next day 
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch- 
kettle would difpofe ©f for us. 

We, therefore, got all our things on board the 
fame evening, and the next morning were ready to 
f?iil. In the mean time, lying* at an anchor fome 
diftance from the Ihore, we were not fo much con- 
cerned, being now in a fighting pofture, as well as 
in a failing pofture, if any enemy had prefented. The 
next day, having finifhed our work within board, 
and finding our Ihip was perfeftly healed of all her 
kaks, we fet fail : we would have gone into the bay 
of Tonquin^ for we wanted to inform ourfelves of what 
was to be known concerning the Dutch Ihips that 
had been there ; but we durft not ftand in there> be- 
caufe we had feen feveral ihips go in, as we fuppofed, 
but a little»before ; fo we kept on N. E. towards the 
ifle of Formofa^ as much afraid of being feen by ^ 
Dutch or Englijh merchant fliip, as a Dutch or BngHjk 
merchant fhip in the Mediterranean is of an JIgerm 
man of war. 

When we were thus got to fea, we kept on N. E^ 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 
iflands, Imd this we did, that we might not fall into 
the way of any of the European fhips; and then we 
fleered north again, till we came to the latitude 

of 



268 I.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

of 22 deg. 2a min. by which means we made the 
ifland of Formofa direftly, where we came to an an- 
chor, in order to get water and frelh provifions, 
which the people there, who are very courteous and 
civil in their manners, fupplied" us with willingly, 
and dealt very fairly and punftually with us in all 
their agreements and bargains ; which is what we 
did not find among other people j and may be owing 
to the remains of Chriftianity, which was once 
planted here by a Dutch miffionary of proteftants, 
and is a teftimony of what I have often obferved, viz^ 
That the Chriflian religion always civilizes the peo- 
ple, and reforms their manners, where it is received, 
'irfiether it works faving effefts upon them or not. 

From hence we failed ftill north, keeping the coaft 
of China at an equal diftance, till we knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China^ where our European 
Ihips ufually come ; but being refolved, if poflible, 
not to fall into any of their hands, efpedally in this 
coimtry, where, as our circumftances were, we could 
not fail of being entirely ruined ; nay, fo great was 
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them, 
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chofen 
to fall into the hands of the Spanijh inqulfition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 

refolved to put into the firft trading port we fhould 

come at ; and ilanding in for the fhore, a boat came 

off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguefe pilot on 

board,^ who, knowing us to be an European fhip, 

came to offer his fervice, which, indeed, we were 

very glad of, and took him on board ; upon which, 

without afking us whither we would go, he difmiflfed 

the boat he came in, and fent it back, 

I thought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

I thought it was now fo much in our choice to make 
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began 
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulph of 
Nafiquin^ which is the njoft northern part of the 
coaft of China. The old man faid he knew the 
Gulph of Nanquin very well j but fmiling, alked us 
what we would do there ? 

I told him we would fell our cargo, and purchafe 
China wares, callicoes, raw filks, tea, wrought filks, 
&c. and fo would return by the fame courfe we came. 
He told us our bejS: port had been to have put in at 
Macaoy where we could not fail of a market for our 
opium, to our fatisfadion, and might, for our money, 
have purchafed all forts of China goods, as cheap as 
we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told 
him, we were gentlemen as well as merchants ; and 
that we had a mind to go and fee the great city of 
Pekin^ and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. Why then, fays the old man, you fhould 
go to NingpOy where, by the river that runs into the 
fea there, you may go iip within five leagues of the 
great canal. This canal is a navigable made ftream, 
which goes through the heart of all that vaft empire 
of China^ croffes all the rivers, paffes fome confide- 
rable hills by the help of fluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of Peking being in length near 270 
leagues. 

Well, faid I, Seignior Portuguefe^ but that is not 
our bufmefs now : the great queftion is. If you can 
carry us up to the city of Nanquin^ from whence we 
can travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he faid, he 

Could 



(^7^ ^'^JB AND ADVENTURES 

could do fo very well, and there was a great Dutch 
fhip gone up that way juil before. This gave me a 
little fhock ; a Dutch Ihip was now our terror, and 
we had much rather have met the devil, at leaft if he 
had not come in too frightful a figure : we depended 
upon it, that a Dutch ihip would be our deftruftion, 
for we were in no condition to fight them ; all the 
Aips they trade with in thofe parts being of great 
burden, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confufed, and under 
fome concern, when he named a Dutch fhip ; and 
faid to me. Sir, you need be under no apprehenfion 
of the Dutch^ I fuppofe they are not now at war with 
your nation. No, faid I, that's true j but I know 
not what liberties men may take, when they are 
out of the reach of the laws of their country. Why, 
fsdd he, you are no pirates, what need you fear ? 
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, 
fure. 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up 
into my face at that word, it was hindered by fome 
ftop in the veffels appointed by nature to circulate it ; 
for it put me into the greateft diforder and confu- 
fion imaginable ; nor was it poffible for me to con* 
ceal it fo, but that the old man eafily perceived it. 

Sir, faid he, I find you are in fome diforder in 
your thoughts at my talk : pray be pleafed to go 
which way you think fit ; and depend upon it, V\\ 
do you all the fervice I can. Why, Seignior, faid 
I, it is true, I am a little unfettled in my refolution 
at this time, whither to go in particular ; and I am 
fomething more fo, for what you faid about pirates ; 
I hope there are no pirates in thefe feas j we are but 

in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271 

in an ill condition to meet with them ; for you fee we 
have but a fmall force, and but very weakly manned. 

O, Sir, faid he, do not be concerned; I do not 
know that there have been any pirates in thefe feas 
thefe fifteen years, except one, which was feen, as I 
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month fmce; but 
you may be affured fhe is gone to the fouthward } 
nor was fhe a fhip of any great force, or fit for the 
work : Ihe was not built for a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board, 
after the captain and fome of his men had been 
murdered by the Malaccans^ at or near the ifland of 
Sumatra* 

What ! faid I, fceming to know nothing of the 
matter, did they murder the captain ? No, faid he, 
I do not underftand that they murdered him ; but, as 
they afterwards ran away with the Ihip, it is gene- 
rally believed they betrayed him into the hands of 
the Malaccans^ who did murder him ; and, perhaps, 
they procured them to do it. Why then, faid I, 
they deferved death, as much as if they had done it 
themfelves. Nay, faid the old man, they do deferve 
it ; and they will certainly have it if they light upon 
any EngUlh or Dutch Ihip ; for they have all agreed 
together, that if they meet that rogue, they will 
give him no quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the pirate is gone out 
of thefe feas; how can they meet with him then? 
Why, that is true, faid he, they do fay fo ; but he was, 
as I tell you, in the bay of Siam^ in the river Cambodia^ 
and was difcovered there by fome Dutchmen^ who 
belonged to the Ihip, and who were left on fhore 

when 



^yt LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

when they run away with her; and fome Englijb 
and Dutch traders being in the river, they were with- 
in a little of taking him. Nay, faid he, if the fore- 
moft boats had been well feconded by the reft, they 
had certainly taken him ; but he, finding only two 
boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at 
thefe two, and difabled them before the others came 
up ; and then ftanding off to fea, the others were 
not able to follow him, and fo he got away. But 
they have all fo exaO: a defcription of the fhip, that 
they will be fure to know him ; and wherever they 
find him, they have vowed to give no quarter to 
either the captain or the feamen, but to hang them 
all up at the yard-arm. 

What! faid I, will they execute them right or 
wrong ; hang them firft, and judge them afterwards ? 
O, Sir I faid the old pilot, there is no need to make 
a formal bufmefs of it with fuch rogues as thofe ; 
let them tie them back to back, and fet them a div- 
ing ; it is no more than they rightly deferve. 

I knew I had my old man faft aboard, and that 
he could do me no harm ; fo I turned fhort upon 
him: Well, Seignior, faid I, and this is the very 
reafon why I would have you carry us to Nanquin^ 
and not to put back to Macaoj or to any other part 
of the country, where the Englijh or Dutch fhips 
came ; for, be it known to you. Seignior, thofe cap- 
tains of the Englijh and Dutch fhips, are a parcel of 
rafh, proud, infolent fellows, that neither know 
what belongs to juflice, or how to behave them- 
felves, as the laws of God and nature direft ; but 
being proud of their offices, and not underflanding 
their power, they would a£t the murderers to punifh 

robbers j

robbers ; would take upon theni to infult men falfe^ 
ly accufed, and determine then! guilty without due 
enquiry ; alid perhaps I may live to call fome of them 
to an account for it, wTiere they may be taught how 
juftice is td be executed ; and that no man ought tp 
be treated as a cHminal till fome evidence jiiay b^l 
had of the crime, and that he is the man* 

With this I told him, that this was the very fhip 
they had attacked j and gave him a full account o( 
the ikirmifh we had with their boats, and how fool- 
ifhly and coward^like thdy had behaVed. I told 
him all the ftory of our buying the fhip, and how 
the Dutchmen ferved us^ I told him the.reafons I 
had to believe that this ftory of killing the mafter 
by the Malaccdns was not true ; as alfo the running 
away with the fhip } but that it was all a fidion of 
their own, to fuggeft that the men were turned pi- 
tates ; and they ought to have been fure it was fo^ 
before they had ventured to attack us by furprife^ 
jind oblige us to refift them ; adding, that they 
would have the blood of thofe men, who were killed 
there, in our juft defence, to anfwer fon 

The old man was amazed at this relation ; arid tdld 
lis, we were very much in the right to go away to the 
north ; and that if he might advife us, it fhould be to 
fell the fhip in Cbina^ which we thfght very well dof 
and buy or build another in the country : and, faid 
he, though you will not get fo good a fhip, yet you 
may get one able enough to carry you and all your 
goods back again to Bengal^ or any where elfe* 

I told him I would take his advice, when I cam? to 
any port where I could find a ihip for my turn, or get 
liny cuftomer to buy this. He replied, 1 fhould

mieet with cuftom^rs enough for the Ihip at Nanquirii. 
and that a Chinefe'ywk. would ferve me very well tc go 
back again ; and that he would procure me people 
both to buy one, and fell the other. 

Well, but, Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know 
the Ihip fo well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your 
meafures, be inftrumental to bring fome honeft inno- 
cent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be mur- 
dered in cold blood; for wherever they find the 
Clip they will prove the guilt upon the men, by prov- 
ing this was the (hip ; and fo innocent men may pro- 
bably be overpowered and murdered. Why, faid - 
the old man. Til find out a way to prevent that alfo j 
for as 1 know all thofe commanders you fpeak of very 
well, and fhall fee them all as they pafs by, 1 will be 
fure to fet them to rights in the thing, and let them 
know that they had been fo much in the wrong ; that 
though the people who were on board at firfl might 
run away with the fhip, yet it was not true that they 
had turned pirates ; and that in particular thofe were 
not the men that firfl went off with the fhip, but inno- 
cently bought her for their trade : and I am per- 
fuaded they will fo far believe me, as, at leaft, to a6t 
more cautioufly for the time to come. Well, faid I, 
and will you deliver one meffage to them from me ? 
Yes, I will, fays he, if you will give it under your 
hand, in writing, that I may be able to prove it came 
from you, and not out of my own head. I anfwered^ 
that I would readily give it him under my hand. So 
I took a pen and ink, and paper, and wrote at large 
the (lory of aflaulting me v/ith the long-boats, &c. 
the pretended reafon of it, and the unjuft cruel defign 
of it J and concluded to the commanders, that they

had done what they not only fhould have been 
afllamed of, but alfo^ that . if ever they came to 
England^ and I liv^d to fee them there, they (hould 
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were 
not grown out of ufe before I arrived there. 

My old pilot read this over and over agaiilj aiid 
alked me feveral times, if I would ftand to it* I 
anfwered, I would ftand to it as long as I had any 
thing left in the world ; being lenfible that I fliould, 
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it home 
to them. But we had no occafion ever to let the 
pilot carry this letter ; for he never went back again. 
While thofe things were pafling between us, by way 
of difcourfe, we went forward direftly for Ndnquin^ 
and, in about thirteen days fail, canie to anchor at 
the fouth-weft point of the great gulph of Nanquin ; 
•^here, by the way, I came by accident to under- 
ftand, that the two Dutch fhips were gone that length 
before me, and that I fliould certainly fall into their 
hands* I confulted my partner again in this exi- 
gency^ and he was as much at a lofs ias I was, and 
would very gladly have been fiafe on Ihore al- 
moft any where. However, I was not in fuch per- 
plexity neither, but I afked the old pilot if there was 
no creek, or harbour, which I might put ^into^ and 
purfue my bufmefs with the Chinefe privately, and be 
in no danger of the enemy ? He told nre, if I would 
fail to the fouthward about two arid forty leagues, 
there was a little port called ^incbangy where the 
fathers of the miflion ufually landed from Macaoy on 
their progrefs to teach the Chriftiari religion to the 
Chine/ey and where no European Ihips ever put in; 
and, if I thought proper to put in there, I might con-

kind of a fair there, when the merchants from 
Japan came over thither to buy the Chinefe mcr* 
ehahdizes^ 

We all agreed to go back to this place : the haftie 
of the port, as he called it, I may;, perhaps fpell 
Ivrong ; for I do not particulaJrly remeniber it, having; 
ioft this, together with the names of miany other 
J)laces fet down in a little pocket-book, which ^sf 
fpcnled by the water, oft an accident which I fhall 
relate in its order ; but this I remember, that thfe 
Chinefe or Japanefe merchants We correfpbhd ^th 
call it by a different nanite from that which oVrt* Por^

As we were unanimous in our fefolutions to g6 tdF 
this plaice, we weighed the next day, having only 
gone twice on fhore, where we Were to get frefh water; 
On both which occafions the people of the country 
were very civil to us, and brought us abundai^e of

We came to the other port (the wind being coft*

convince any man that ^e were no pirates. The 
opium, and other goods we had on board, wpuld 
inake it appear the Ibip had been at Bengal ; the 
Dutchmerij who, it was fgiid, had the names of all the 
men that were in the fhip, might e^^ifily fee that we 
l»ere a mixture of Engiijhj Portugtiefe^ and hidiansy

whofe hands we might fall into, that we were UQ 
pirates. 

But fear, that blind ufelefs paflion, worked another 
way, and threw us into the vapours ; it bewildered 
our underftandings, and fet the imagination at work, 
to form a thoufand terrible things, that, perhap?, 
might aever happen. We firft fuppofed, as indeed 
every body had related to us, that the feamen on board 
the Englijh and Dutch fhips, but efpecially the Dutch^ 
were fo enraged at the name of a pirate, and efpecially 
at our beating off their boats, and efcaping, that they 
would not give themfelves leave to enquire whether we 
were pirates or no ; but would execute us off-hand, 
as we call it, without giving us any room for a de^ 
fence, We reflefted that there was really fo much 
apparent evidence before them, that they would fcarce 
enquire after any more: as, firft, ths^t the fliip was 
certainly the fame, and that fome of the feamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her j 
and, fecondly, that when we had intelligence at the 
river Cambodia^ that they were coniing down to ex- 
amine us, we fought their boats, and fled: So that wet 
made no doubt but they were as fully fatisfied of our 
\>dng pirates, as we were fatisfied of the contrary • 
and I often faid, I knew not but I Ihould have beeA 
apt to have takers the little circumftances for evidence^^ 
if the tables were turned, and my cafe was theirs j 
and have made no fcruple of cutting all the crew 
to pieces, without believing, or perhaps confider- 
ing, what they might have to offef . in their de«, 

fence. 

But let that be how it will, thofe were our appre- 
henfions ; and both my partner and I too, fc?irce flep^ 

a nigh^

a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms j 
that is to fay, gibbets ; of fighting, and being taken ; 
of killing, and being killed ; and one night I was in 
filch a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had , 
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their Teamen 
down, that I ftruck my double fid againft the lide of 
the cabin I lay in, with fuch a force as wounded my 
hand moft grievoufly, broke my knuckles, and cut 
and bruifed the flefli, fo that it not only waked me out 
of my fleep, but 1 was once afraid I fliould have loft 
twoof my fingers. 

Another apprehenfion I had, was, of the cruel 
ufage we Ihould meet with from them, if we fell into 
their hands: then the ftory of Atnboyna came into my 
head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, 
as they did our countrymen there ; and make fome 
of our men, by extremity of torture, confefs thofe 
crimes they never were guilty of ; own themfelves, 
^nd all of us, to be pirates j and fo they would put us 
to death, with a formal appearance of juftice ; and 
that they might be tempted to do this, for the gain of 
our fhip an4 cargo, which was worth four or five 
thoufand pounds, put all together. 

Thefe things tormented me, and my partner too, 
night and day j nor did we confider that the captains 
of fhips have »o authority to aft thus ; and if we had 
furrendered prifoner^ to them, they could not anfwer 
the deftroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac- 
countable for it when they c^me into their own coun- 
try. This, I fay, gave me no fat|sfa£tion ; for, if 
tl|ey will aft thus with us, what advantage would it 
|)e to us that they would be called to an account for 
it J or/ if we were firft to be murdered, what fatif- 

T 4 fadion 



480 LIFE AND ADVBKTUREfi 

fadion wbuld it be to us to have them punifhed whea 
they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what refleftions 
1 now had upon the paft variety of my particular cir- 
cumftances ; how hard I thought it was, that I, who 
had fpent forty years in a life qf continued difficulties, 
and was, at laft, come, as it were, at the port or 
haven which all men drive at, viz. to have reft and 
plenty, fhould be a volunteer in new forrows, by my 
own unhappy choice j and that I, who had efcaped fo 
many dangers in my youth, fhould now come to be 
hanged in my old age, and in fo remote a place, for 
a crime I was not in the leaft inclined to, much lefs 
guilty of; and in a place and circumftance, where 
innocence was not like to be any proteftion at all to 
me. 

After thefe thoughts, fomething of religion woul(| 
come in ; and I would be confideiing that this feemed 
to me to be a difpofition of immediate Providence j and 
I ought to look upon it, and fubmit to it, as fuch ; 
that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from 
being innocent as to my Maker j and I ought to look 
in, and examine what othef crimes in my life were 
moft obvious tp me, and for which Providence might 
juftly infli^ this punifhment as a retributipn ; and 
that I ought to fubmit to this, juft as I would to a fhip- 
wreck, if it had pleafed Qod to have brought fuch a 
difafter upon me. 

In its turn, natural qourag^ would foinetimes take 
its pla(;e j and then I would be talking myfelf up tp 
vigorous refolutiqn, that I would not be taken to be 
barb^roufly ufed by a parcel of mercilefs wretches in 
cold blood ; that it w^s much better to have fallen 
2 into 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 2$ I 

inito the hands of the favages, who were men-eaters, 
and who, I was fure, would feaft upon me, when they 
had taken me, than by thofe, who would, perhaps, 
glut their rage upQj:^ me by inhuinan tortures and 
barbarities : that, in the €afe of the favages, I always 
refolved to die fightings to the laft gafp ; and why 
fliould I not da fo now, feeing it was much more 
dreadful, to me at leaft, to think of falling into thefe 
menV hands, than ever it was to thiijk of being eaten 
by men : for the favages, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was dead; and killed him firfti 
as we do a bullock ; but that thefe men had many 
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever thefe 
thoughts prevailed, I was fure to put myfelf into a 
]kind of fever, with the agitations of a fiippofed fight ; 
my blood would boil, and my eyes fparkle, as if I 
was engaged ; and I always refolved that I would take 
.no quarter at their hands ; but even at laft, if I 
could refift no longer, I would blow up the fhip, and 
^all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to 
boaft of- 

Butbyhow muchthegreaterweighttheanxieties and 
perplexities of thofe things were to our thoughts while 
we were at lea, by fo much the greater was our fatif- 
;fa6lion, when we faw ourfelves on fliore j and my 
partner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very heavy 
load, upon his back, which he was tp carry up ah hill, 
and found that he was not able to ftand long under it ; 
but the Poriu^efe pilot came, and took it off his 
jback, and the hill difappeared, the ground before him 
Shewing all fmooth and plain : And truly it was fo ; 
we were all like men who had a load taken p^ their 
^ack^» /. 

For 



a82 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

For my part, I had a weight taken ofF from my 
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as 
J faid above, we refolved to go no more to fea in that 
fhip. When we came on fhore, the old pilot, who 
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware- 
houfe for our goods, which, by the way, was much 
the fame : it was a little houfe or hut, with a large 
houfe joining to it, all built with canes, and palifadoed 
round with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, 
of which it feems there were not a few in the country. 
However, the magiftrates allowed us all a little guard, 
and we had a foldier with a kind of halbert, or half 
pike, who flood fentinel at our door ; to whom we 
allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, 
about the value of three-pence per day : fo that our 
goods were kept very fafe. 

The fair or mart, ufually kept in this place, had 
been over fome time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two Japan* 
tiers J I mean, fliips from Japan^ with goods which 
they had bought in China^ and were not gone away^ 
having Japanefe merchants on fhore. 
. The firfl thing our old Poriuguefe pilot did for^usf 
was, to bring us acquainted, with three miflionary 
Romijh priefls, who were in the town, and who had 
been there fome time, converting the people to 
Chriflianity ; but we thought they made, but poor 
work of it ; and made them but forry Chrlflians 
when they had done. However, that was not our 
bufinefs. One of thefe was a Frenchman^ whom they 
called father Simon ;- he was a jolly well-conditioned 
man, very free in his converfation, not feeming vfo 
ferious juid grave as the other two did, one of whom 

was. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

was a Portuguefej and the other a Genoefe ; but father 
Simon was courteous, eafy in his manner, and very 
agreeable company ; the other two were more re- 
ferved, feemed rigid and auftere, and applied ferioufly 
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, and 
infinuate themfelves among the inhabitants, where- 
cver they had opportunity : we often eat and drank 
with thofe men : and though I muft confefs, the con- 
verfion, as they call it, of the CA/Vz^/^toChriftianity, 
is fo far from the true converfion required to bring 
heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it feems 
to amount to little more than letting them know the 
name of CiIRIst, fay fome prayers to the Virgin Mary^ 
?md her Son, in z tongue which they underftand 
not, and to crofs themfelves, and the like; yet it muft 
be confefTed, that thefe religious, whom we call Mit 
fionaries, have a firm belief that thefe people fliould 
be fayed, and that they are the inftrument of it; and, 
on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue of 
the voyage, ^d hazards of living in fuch places, but 
oftentimes death itfelf, with the moft violent tortures, 
for the fake of this work : and it would be a great 
want of charity in us, whatever opinion we have of 
the work itfelf, and the manner of their doing it, if 
we fhpuldnot have a good opinion of their zeal, who 
^indertake it with fo many hazards, and who have 
no profpeft of the leaft temporal advantage to them- 
selves. 

But, to return to my ftory : This French prieft, 
father Simon^ was appointed, it feems, by order of 
the chief of the miffion, to go up to Pekin, the royal 
feat of the Chinefe emperor ; and waited only for ano- 
tjier prieft, who was ordered to come to him from 

Macao^ 



284 ^li'E AND ADVENTURES 

Macao J to go along with him ; and we fcarce eve^f 
met together, but he was inviting me to go that jour- 
ney with him, telling i|ie, how he would |hew me all 
the glorious things of that mighty empire; and among 
the reft, the greateft city in the world ; a city, faid he, 
that your London^ and our Paris j put together, can^ 
not be equal to. This was the city of Pekirij which, 
I confefs, is very great, and infinitely full of people ; 
but, as I looked on thofe things with different eye«i 
from othermen, fo I fliall give my opinion of them ia 
few words, when I come, in the cQurfe qf my travels, 
to fpeak more particularly of them. 

But firft, I come to my friar or miffionary : Dining 
with him 01^^ day, and being very merry together^^ 
I fhewed fome little inclination to go with him j and 
he preffed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many perfuafions to confent. Why, father 
Simon^ fays my partner, why fhould you defire our 
company fo much ? You know we are heretics, and 
you do not love us, nor can keep us company with 
any pleafure. ! fays J^e, you may, perhaps, be 
good catholics in time j my bufinefs here is to eon- 
vert heathens ; and who knows but I may convert you 
too ? Very well, father, faid I, fp you will preach to 
us all the way. I won't be trqublefpme to you, faid 
he ; our religion does not diyeft lis of good manners} 
befides, faid he, we are all here like coufitrymen; 
and fo we are, compared to the place we are in ; and 
if you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we may be all 
Chriltians at laft ; at leaft, faid he, we are allgentlc-* 
men, and we may converfe fo, without being uneafy 
to one another. I liked that part of his difcourfe 
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my 

prieft

jljtieit that I had left in the Bra/ils ; but thii fattiet 
Sifnon did not come up to his charafter by a great 
deal ; for though father Simon had ho appearance of 
a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that 
fund of Ghrillian zeal, ftrift piety, and fmcerfe af* 
Fettion to religion, that my other gobd ecclefiaftic 
ha!d, of whom I have faid fo much* 

But to leave him a little, though he never left ti$, 
iior folicitihg us to go with him, but we had fome- 
thing elfe before us at that time ; for we had, all this 
While, our fhip and our merchandize to difpofe of j 
and we began to be very doubtful what we fhould do^ 
for we were now in a place of very little bufinefs \ 
and once 1 ^as abdur to venture to fail for the river 
of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin : But Providence 
ifeemed nOw more vifibly, ^s I thought, than ever, to 
fconcem itfelf in our afiFairs ; arid I was encouraged 
firotti this vety time to think I fhould, one way of 
dther, get out of this entangled circumftance, and be 
brought home to my own country again ; though I 
had hot the leaft view of the manner ; and when I 
begto fometimes to think of it, could not imagine by 
what method it was to be done. Providence^ I fay^ 
began here to clear up our way a little ; and the firft 
thing that offered was, that our old PortugUefe pilot 
brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to en- 
quire what goods we had ; and, in the firft place, he 
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price 
for it, paying us in gold by weight, fome in fmall 
pieces of their own coin, and fome in fmall wedges, 
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head 
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the fhip 

too : 



tZ6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

too ; and I ordered the interpreter to propofe it to 
him* He flirunk up his flioulders at itj when it waai 
firft propofed to him j but, in a few days after, he 
came to me, with one of the miffionary priefts for his 
interpreter, and told me, he had a^propofal to make 
to me, and that was this : He had bought a great 
quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts (or 
.propofals made to him) of buying the fhip ; and that, 
therefore, he had not money enough to pay for the 
Ihip ; but if I would let the fame men who were in the 
fliip navigate her, he would hire the fhip to go tQ 
jfapan^ and would fend them from thence to the 
Philippine iflands with another loading, which .Jie 
would pay the freight of, before they went from 
yapan ; and that, at their return, he would buy the 
Ihip. I began to liften to this propofal ; and fo eager 
did my head ftill run upon rambling, that I could not 
but begin to entertain a notion myfelf of going with 
him, and fo to fail from the Philippine iflands away 
to the ^outh Seas; and accordingly I alked the 
yapanefa merchant, if he would not hire us to the 
Philippine iflands, and difcharge us there. He faid^ 
no, he could not do that j for then he could not have 
the return of his cargo ; but he would difcharge us iit 
jfapan^ he faid, at the ftiip's return* Well, ftill I 
was for taking him at that propofal> and going my* 
felf ; but my partner, wifer than myfelf, perXuaded 
me from it, reprefenting the dangers, as well of the 
feas, as of the Japajiefe^ who are a falfe, cruel, an4 
treacherous people ; and then of the Spaniards at the 
Philippines ; more falfe, more cruel, more treacherous 
than they. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

But, to bring this long turn of our affairs to a con- 
clufion : the firfl: thing we had to do, was to confuk 
with the captain of the fliip, and with the men, and 
know if they were willing to go to Japan; and,; while 
I was doing this, the young man, whom, as I faid^ 
my nephew had left with me as my companion for my 
trav.els, came to me and told me, that he thought that 
voyage promifed very fair, and that there was a great 
profpeQ: of advantage, and he would be very glad if I 
undertook it ; but that if I would not, and would give 
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I 
pleafed to order him ; that if ever he came to England^ 
and I was there, and alive, he would render me a 
faithful account of his fuccefs, and it Ihould be as 
much mine as I pleafed. 

I was really loth to part with him j but, confidering 
the profpefl: of advantage, which was really confider- 
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do 
well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; 
but firfl I told him I would confult my partner, and 
give him an anfwer the next day. My partner and I 
difcourfed about it; and my partner made a mod 
generous offer : he told me, you know it has been an 
unlucky Ihip, and we both refolve not to go to fea in 
it again ; if your fteward (fo he called my man) will 
venture the voyage, Pll leave my fhare of the veffel 
to him, and let him make the beft of it ; and if we 
live to meet in England^ and he meets with fuccefs 
abroad, he fhall account for one half of the pro- 
fits of the fhip^s freight to us, the other fhall be 
his own. 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my 

young man, made him fuch an offer, I could do no

Ids than ofFet' him the fame ; and all the fliip^s cbtnA 
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half 
Ihe ftnp to him in property, and tocfc a writing froni 
him, obliging him to account for the other ; and away 
he went to Japdm The yafan merchant proved a 
very piinaual honeft man to him, proteded him at 
yapan^ and got him a licence to come on fliore, which 
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained j 
paid him his freight very pundually, fent him to the 
Philippines^ loaded him with y apart and China ware^, 
and a fupercargo of their own, who trafficking with 
the Spaniards^ brought back European goods again, 
tod a great quantity bf cloves, and other fpice; a2ki 
there he was not only paid his freight very well, and 
at a very good price, but being not willing to fell the 
fhip then, the merchant fumifhed him with goods on 
his own account ; that, for fome money^ and fome 
fpices of his own, which he brought with him, he 
went back to the Manillas^ to the Spaniards^ where 
he fold his. cargo veiy well. Here, having gotten a 
good acquaintance at Manilla^ he got his ftiip made a 
free fliip ; and the governor of Manilla hired him to 
go to Acapulco in America^ on the coaft of Mexico- 
and gave him a licence to hnd there, and travel to 
Mexico; and to pafs in any Spanijh fhip to Europe^ 
with all his men- 
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, aiid

it$ place ; in the mean time, I return to our particular 
afiairs. 

Being now to part with the ihip, and fliip's com- 
pany, it came before usj of courfe, to confider what 
recompence we fhould give to the two men, that 
gave us fuch timely notice of the defign againft us in 
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done 
us a confiderable fervice, and deferved well at our 
hands ; though, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues too : for, as they believed the ftory of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the ftiip, they came down to us, not only to betray the 
defign that was formed againft us, but to go to fea 
with us as pirates j and one of them confelTed after- 
wards, that nothing elfe but the hopes of going a 
roguing brought him to do it. However, the fer. 
vice they did us was not the lefs ; and therefore, as I 
had promifed to be grateful to them, I firft ordered 
the money to be paid to them, which they faid was 
due to them on board their refpeftive fhips j that is 
to fay, the Englijhman nineteen months pay, and to 
the Dutthman fevenj and, over and above that, I 
gave each of them a fmall fum of money in gold, 
which contented them very well : then I made the 
EngliJBman gunner of the ihip, the gunner being now 
made fecond mate and purfer j the Dutchman I made 
boatfwain : fo they were both very well pleafed, and 
proved very ferviceable, being both able feamen, and 
very ftout fellows. 

We were now on ihore in China. If I thought 
myfelf banifhed, and remote from my own country 
at Bengal^ where I had many ways to get home for 
lay money, what could I think of myfelf now, when 

Vol. II, U I was 



-•t* 



40^ LIFE AND ADVENTURE^ 

I was gotten about a thoufand leagues farther off 
from home, and perfeftly deftitute of all manner of 
j>rofpeft of return ! 

All we had for it was this ; that in about four 
months time there wus to be another fair at that 
place where we were, and then we might be able 
to purchafe all forts of the matofaftures of the couuj 
try, and withal might poffibly find fome Chinefe 
junks or veffels from Nanquin^ that would be to be 
fold, and would carry us and our goods whither we 
pleafed. This I liked very well^ and rcfolved tO' 
wait ; befides, as our particular perfons were not 
obnoxious, fo if any Englijh or Dutch fhips came 
thithef, perhaps we might feave ain opportunity to* 
load our goods, and get paffage to fome other place 
in India nearer home. 

Upon thefe hopes we f efolved to contmue here j 
but, to divert ourfelves, we took two or three jour-- 
nies into the country ; firft, we went itn days jour- 
ney to fee the city of Nafiqmrij a city well worth 
feeing indeed : they fay it has a mitlion of people in 
it ; which, however, I do not believe : It is regularly 
built, the jftreets all exactly ftrait, and crofs one 
another in direO: lines^ which gives the figure of it* 
great advantage. 

But when I came to compare the miferable people 
of thefe countries with our's ; their fabrics, their 
manner of living, their government, their religion, 
their wealth, and their glory (as fome call it), I mud 
confefs, I do not fo much as think it worth naming^ 
or worth my while to write of, or any that fhall come 
after me to read%. 

It 



0# ROBINSON CRUSOEt 2gi. 

It IS very obfervable, that we wonder at the gran* 
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go# 
vernment, the manufaftures, the commerce, and the 
conduct of thefe people ; not that they are to be won- 
dered at, or, indeed, in the lead to be regarded ; 
but becaufe, having firft a notion of the barbarity of 
thofe countries, the rudenefs, and the ignorance that 
prevail there, we do not exped to find ahy fuch 
things fo far off. 

Otherwife, what are their builings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe ? What their trade to 
the univerfal commerce of England^ Holland ^ France^ 
and Spain ? What their cities to our's, for wealth, 
ftrength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an 
infinite variety ? What are their ports, fupplied with a 
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer« 
chants fleets, our large and powerful navies ? Our 
city of London has more trade than all their mighty 
empire. One Englijh^ or Dutch^ or French man of 
war of 80 guns, would fight with and deftroyall 
the {hipping of China. But the greatnefs of their 
wealth, their trade, the power of their government, 
and ftrenglh of their armies are furprizing to us, 
becaufe, as I have faid, confidering them as a bar* 
barous nation of pagans, little better than favages, 
we did not expeO: fuch things among them ; and 
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their 
greatnefs and power is reprefented to us : otherwife, 
it is in itfelf nothing at all; for, as I have faid of 
their fliips, fo it may be faid of their armies and 
troops ; all the forces of their empire^ though they 
were to bring two millions of men into the field to#

gether, would be able to do nothing but ruin the 
country, and ftarve themfelves. If they were to 
befiege a ftrong town in Flanders^ or to fight a dif- 
ciplined army, one line of German cuiraffiers, or of 
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horfe of 
China ; a million of their foot could not (land be- 
fore one embattled body of our infantry, pofted fo 
as not to be furrounded, though they were not to be 
one to twenty in number : nay, I do not boaftif Ifay, 
that 30,000 German or Englijh foot, and 10,000 
French horfe, would fairly beat all the forces of 
China. And fo of our fortified towns, and of the 
art of our engineers, in aflaulting and defending 
towns ; there is not a fortified town in China could 
hold out one month againft the batteries and attacks 
of an European army ; and at the fame time, all the 
armies of China could never take fuch a town as 
Dunkirk^ provided it was not ftarved ; no, not in ten 
years fiege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but 
they are awkward, clumfy, and uncertain in going 
off"; they have powder, but it is of no ftrength ; 
they have neither difcipline in the field, exercife in 
their arms, fluU to attack, or temper to retreat : 
and therefore I niuft confefs it feemed ftrange to me

conquer them in one campaign ; and had the czar, 
who I fince hear is a growing prince, and begins to 
appear formidable in the world, fallen this way, in- 
ftead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in which at- 
tempt none of the powers of Europe would have 
envied or interrupted him ; he might, by this time, 
have been emperor of China, inftead of being beaten 
by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter 
was not ohe to fix in number. As their ftrength an4

few have heard the like of, I fliall fay nothing of the 
mighty places, defart countries, and numerous peo- 
pie, I have yet to pafs through, more than relates 
to my own ftory, and which my concern among 
them will make neceffary. I was now, as near as I 
can compute, in the heart of China^ about the lati- 
tude of thirty degrees north of the line, for we 
were returned from Nanquin ; I had indeed a mind 
to fee the city of Pekin^ which I had heard fo much 
of, and father Simon importuned me daily to do it ; 
^t length his time of going away being fet, and the 
other miffionary, who was to go with him, being ar- 
rived from Macao J it was neceffary that we fliould re^ 
folve either to go, or not to go ; fo I referred him to 
my partner, and left it wholly to his choice ; who, 
at length, refolved it in the affirmative ; ^nd we pre- 
pared for our journey, We fet out with veiy good 
advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got leave 
to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, 
a kind of viceroy, or principal niagiftrate, in the 
province where they refide, and who take great ftate 
upon them, travelling with great attendance, and 
with gre^t homage from the people, who are fome- 
times greatly impoveriflied by them, becaufe all the 
countries they pafs through are obliged to furnifb 
provifions for them, and all their attendants. That 
which I particularly obferved, as to our travelling 
with his baggage, was thi$ ; that though we received 
fufficlent provifions, both for ourfelves and our horfes, 
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we 
were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the 
market-price of the country, and the mandarin's 
fteward, or commiffary of the provifions, collefted 

it 



dF ROBINSON CRUSOE, Qgg 

it duly from us ; fo that our travelling in the retinue 
of the mandarin, though it was a very great kind- 
nefs to us, wa§ not fuch a mighty favour in him, but 
was, indeed, a great advantage to him, confidering 
there were about thirty other people travelling in the 
feme manner befides u§, under the protection of his 
retinue, or, as we may call it, under his convoy. 
7his, I fay, was a great advantage to him ; for the 
country furniflied all the provifions for nQthing, and 
he took all our money for them. 

We were five-and-twenty d^ys travelling to Pekin^ 
through a country infinitely populous, but niiferably 
cultivated j the hufbandry, oeconomy, and the way 
of living, all very miferable, though they boaft fo 
inuch of the induftry pf the people : I fay mifera*- 
ble; and fo it is ; if we, who underftand how to 
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our 
own ; but not fo to thefe poor wretches, who kno\y 
no other. The pride pf thefe people is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, 
which adds to that which I call their mifery. I muft 
needs think the naked fay^ges of America Aivq much 
more happy, becaufe, as they haye nothing, fo they 
defire nothing j whereas thefe are proiid and info- 
lent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and drudges ; 
their oftentation is inexpreffible, and is chiefly fliewed 
in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping 
multitudes pf fervants or flaves, and, which is to 
the laft degree ridiculous, their contempt of all tl>e 
world but themfelyes. 

I muft confefs, I travelled more pleafantly after- 
wards, in the defarts and vaft wildernefles of Grand 
Tartaryy than here ; and yet the roads here pe well 
ij 4 " paved, 



^g6 LIFE AND ADV£KTU.R£« 

paved, and >vell kept, and very convenient for tra« 
vellers : but nothing was more awkward to me, than 
to fee fuch an haughty, imperious, infolent people, 
in the midft of the grolteft fimplicity and ignorance ; 
for all their famed ingenuity is no more. My friend, 
father Simon, and I, ufed to be very merry upon thefe 
pccafions, to fee the beggarly pride of thofe people: 
for example, coming by the houfe of a country gen?- 
tleman, as father Simon called him* about tep leagues 
oflF from the city of Nanquin, we had,.firfl;of all, 
the honour to ride with the matter of the houfe about 
two miles ; the ftate he rode in was a perfed Dpn 
^ixotifnij being a mixture of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greafy Don was very proper for 
a fcaramouch, or merry-andrew ; being a dirty ca- 
lico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, 
fuch as hanging fleeves, taffety, and cuts and flafhes 
almoft on every fide : it covered a rich taflfety veft, 
as greafy as a butcher, and which teftified, that his 
honour muft needs be a moft exquifite floven. 

His horfe was a poor, lean, ftarved, hobbling crea- 
ture, fuch as in England might fell for about 
thirty or forty fhillings ; and he had two Haves 
followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature 
^long : he had a whip in his hand, and he bela- 
boured the beaft as faft about the head as his flaves 
did about the tail} and thus he rode by us with 
^^bout ten or twelve fervants; and we were told he 
was going from the city to his country feat, about 
half a league before us. We travelled on gently, 
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; 
^nd as we flopped at a village about an hour to re- 
fr?fh us, when we Cfinie by the country feat of this

great man, we faw him in a little place before his 
door, eating his repaft ; it was a kind of a garden, 
but he was eafy to be feen ; and we were given to 
underftand, that the more we looked on him, the 
better he would be pleafed* 

He fat under a tree, fomething like the palmetto- 
tree, which effeftually fliaded him over the head,^ 
and on the fouth fide ; but under the tree alfo was 
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look 
well enough : he fat lolling back in a great elbow- 
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat 
being brought him by two women flaves, he had two 
more, whofe office, I think, few gentlemen in Etu 
rope would accept of their fervice in, viz. one fed 
the *fquire with a fpoon, and the other held the dilh 
with one hand, and fcraped off what he let fall upon 
his worfhip*s beard and tafFety veft, with the other ; 
while the great fat brute thought it below him to ehi-. 
ploy his own hands in any of thofe familiar offices, 
which kings and monarchs yould rather do than be 
troubled with the clumfy find^ers of their fervants. 

1 took this time to thinlj^ what pain men's pride 
puts them to, and how troublefome a haughty tern- " 
per, thus ill-managed, muft be to a man of common 
fenfe ; and, leaving the poor wretch to pleafe him- 
felf with our looking at him, as if we admired his 
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him^ 
we purfued our journey ; only father Simon had the 
curiofity to ftay to inform himfelf what dainties the 
country juftice had to feed on, in all his (late ; which 
he faid he had the honour to tafte of, and which was, 
I think, a dofe that an Englijh hound would fcarce 
Jjiave eaten, if it had been offered him, viz. a mefs

of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlick In it, 
and a little bag filled with green pepper, and ano^^ 
ther plant which they have there, fomething like 
our ginger, but fmelling like mufk, and tailing like 
muftard ; all this was put together, and a fmall lump 
or piece of lean mutton boiled in it ; and this was 
his worlhip's repaft, four or five fervants more at- 
tending at a diftance. If he fed them meaner than 
he was fed himfelf, the fpice e;cceptcd, they muft far^ 
verycoarfely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was refpefted like a king ; furrounded always with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with fuch pomp, that I faw little of him but at a difr 
tance; but this I obferved, that there was not a 
horle in his retinue, but that our carriers pack-horfe? 
in England feem to me to look much better ; but they 
were fo covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, 
and fuch like trumpery, that you cannot fee whether 
they are fat or lean. In a word, we could fcarce fee 
any thing but their feet and their heads, 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being over, 
I had no anxious thoughts about me ; which made 
this journey much the pleafanter to me; nor had I. 
any ill accident attended me, only in the pafling or 
fording a fmall river, my horfe fell, and made me 
free of the country, as they call it ; that is to fay, 
threw me in ; the place was not deep, but it wetted 
me all over : I mention it, becaufe it fpoiled my 
pocket-book, pvherein I had fet down the names of 
fcveral people and places which J had occafion to re-^.

member, and which not taking due care of, the 
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be 
read, to my great lofs, as to the names of fome 
places which I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Pekin ; I had nobody 
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the cap- 
tain had given me to attend me as a fervant, and 
who proved very trufty and diligent ; and my part- 
ner had nobody with him but one fervant, who was 
a kinfman. As for the Portuguefe pilot, he being 
defirous to fee the court, we gave him his paflage, 
that is to fay, bore his charges for his company ; and 
to ufe him as an interpreter, for he underftood the 
language of the country, and fpoke good Trench 
Igtnd a little Englijh ; and, indeed, this old man was a 
moft ufeful implement to us^every where ; for we had 
not been above a week at Pekin^ when he came laugh- 
ing : Ah, Seignior Inglefe^ faid he, I have fomething 
to tell you, will make your heart glad. My heart 
glad ! faid I : What can that be ? I don't know any 
thing in this country can either give me joy or grief, 
to any great degree. Yes, yes, faid the old man, in 
broken Englijh^ make you glad, me forrow ; forry he 
would have faid. This made me more inquifitive. 
Why, faid I, will it make you forry ? Becaufe, faid 
he, you have brought me here twenty-five days 
journey, and will leave me to go back alone ; and 
which way (hall I get to my port afterwards, without 
a fhip, without a horfe, without pecune ? So he called 
money ; being his broken Latin^ of which he had 
abundance to make us merry with. 

In fhort, he told us there was a great caravan of 
^ufcovy and Polijh merchants in the city, and that they 

were 



300 l/IFE AND ADVENTURES 

were preparing to fet out on their journey, by Iznd, 
to Mu/covy, within four or five weeks, and he was 
fure we would take the opportunity to go with then^, 
and leave him behind to go back alone. I confcfs I 
was furprifed with this news : a fecret joy fpread it- 
felf over my whole foul, which I cannot defcribe, 
and never felt before, or fince ; and I had no power, 
for a good while, to fpeak a word to the old man ; 
but at laft I turned to him : How do you know this ? 
faid I : are you fure it is true ? Yes, he faid, I met 
this morning, in the ftreet, an old acquaintance of 
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who 
is among them ; he came laft from Aftracariy and 
was defigning to go to Tonquiny where I formerly 
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re- 
folved to go back with the caravan to Mo/cow, and 
fo down the river of Wolga to Ajiracan. Well, Seig. 
nior, faid I, do not be uneafy about being left to go 
back alone ; if this be a method for my return to 
England, it fhall be your fault if you go back to 
Macao at all. "We then went to confult together 
what was to be done, and afked my partner what he 
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would 
fuit with his affairs : he told me he would do juft as 
I would ; for he had fettled all his affairs fo well at 
Bengal, and left his effefts in fuch good hands, that 
as we made a good voyage here, if he could veft it 
in China filks, wrought and raw, fuch as might be 
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to 
England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal^ 
by the company*s fhips. 

Having refolved upon this, we agreed, that if our 

Portu^iiefe pilot would go with us, we would bear his 

3 charges 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 30I 

charges to Mo/cow^ or to England^ if he pleafed • 
nor, indeed, were we to be efteemed over generous 
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther ; for the fervice he had done us was really worth 
all that, and more ; for he had not only been a pilot 
to us at fea, but he had been alfo like a broker for us 
on fliore ; and his procuring for us the Japan mer- 
chant, was fome hundreds of pounds in our pockets. 
So we confulted together about it ; and, being 
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing 
him juftice, and very willing alfo to have him with us 
befides, for he was a mod neceffary man on all oc- 
cafions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined 
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175 
pounds fterling between us, and to bear his charges 
both for himfelf and horfe, except only a horfe to 
carry his goods. 

Having fettled this among ourfelves, we called 
him to let him know what we had refolved : I told 
him, he had complained of our being like to let him 
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were 
refolved he fhould not go back at all : that as we had 
refolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we re- 
folved alfo he fliould go with us, and that we called 
him to know his mind. He fliook his head, and 
faid it was a long journey, and he had no pecune to 
carry him thither, nor to fubfift himfelf when he 
came thither. We told him, we believed it was fo, 
and therefore we had refolved to do fomething for 
him, that fliould let him fee how fenfible we were of 
the fervice he had done us ; and alfo how agreeable 
he was to us : and then I told him what we had 
refolved to give him here, which he might lay out as 

we 



30a LIFE AND ADVEKTU|tE» 

we would do our own ; and that as for his charges^ li 
he would go with us, we would fet him fafe afhore^ 
(life and cafualties excepted) either in Mu/cavy or in 
England J which he would, at our own charge, except 
only the carriage of his goods. 

He received the propofisd like a man tranfported^ 
and told us, he would go with us over the whole 
world ; and fo, in ihort, we all prepared ourfelvesf 
for the journey. However, as it was with us, fo it 
was with the other merchants, they had many things 
to do ; and inftead of being ready in five weeks, it 
was four months and fome odd days before all things 
were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our ffyle, when 
we fet out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot 
had gone exprefs back to the port where we had firft 
put in, to difpofe of fome goods which we had left 
there ; and I, with a Chinefe merchant, whom I had 
fome knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to 
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I 
bought ninety pieces of fine damafks, with about two 
hundred pieces of other very fine filks, of feverai 
forts, fome mixed with gold, and. had all thefe brought 
to Pekin againft my partner's return : befides this, we 
bought a very large quantity of raw filk, and fome 
other goods ; our cargo amounting, in thefe goods 
only, to about three thoufand five hundred pounds 
fterling, which, together with tea, and fome fine 
callicoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves^ 
loaded in all eighteen camels for our fliare, befides 
thofe we rode upon ; which, with two or three fpare 
horfes, and two horfes loaded with provifions, made 
X us. 



OF SLOBIKSON CRUSOfi. 30J 

Us, in fhort, twenty-fix camels and hotfes in out 
retinue. 

The company was vety great, and, as near as I cart 
remember, made between three and four hundred, 
horfes and camels, and upward of an hundred and 
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all 
events. For, as the eaftern caravans are fubjed to 
be attacked by the Arabs^ fo are thefe by the Tar^ 
tars; but they are not altdgether fo dangerous as the 
Arabsy nor fo barbarous when they prevail. 

The company confifted of people of feveral nations, 
fuch as Mufcovites chiefly ; for there were about fixty 
of them who wete merchants or inhabitants of Muf^ 
towy though of them fome were Livonians ; and to 
our particular fatidfadion, five of them were Scots^ 
who appeared alfo to be men of great experieiM:e in 
bufinefs, and very good fubftailce^ 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen- 
tlemen and merchants; that is to fay, all the paffen- 
gers, except the fervants, to a great council, as they 
termed it. At this great council every one depofited 
a certain quantity of money to a common flock, for 
the neceffary expence of buying forage on the way, 
where it was not otherwife to be had, and for fatif- 
fying the guides, getting horfes, and the like. And 
here they conftituted the journey, as they called it, 
viz. They named captains and officers to draw us all 
up, and give the command in cafe of an attack, and 
gave every one their turn of command. Nor was 
this forming us into order any more than what we 
found needful upon the way, aa ihall be obferved in 
its place. 

The 



304 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The road all on this fide of the country is very po- 
pulous, and is full of potters and earth-makers ; that 
is to fay, people that tempered the earth for the China 
^vare; and, as I was going along, our Portuguefe 
pilot, who had always fomething or other to fay ta 
make us merry, came fneermg to me, and told me, 
he would fhew the greateft rarity in all the country . 
and that I fhould have this to fay of China^ after all 
the ill-humoured things I had faid of it, that I had 
feen one thing which was not to be feen in all the 
world befide. I was very importunate to know what 
it was ; at laft he told me, it was a gentleman's houfcy 
built all with China ware. Well, faid I, are not the 
materials of their building the produdl of their own 
country ; and fo it is all China ware, is. it not ? No* 
no, fays he, I mean, it is a houfe all made of China^ 
ware, fuch as you call fo in England; or, as it i» 
called in our country, porcelain* Well, faid I, fuch 
a thing may be : How big is it ; Can we carry it in 
a box upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it. 
tJpon a camel ! faid the old pilot, holding up both 
his hands, why there is a family of thirty people * 
lives in it. 

I was then curious, indeed, to fee it j and when I 
came to it, it was nothing but this : it was a timber 
houfe, or a houfe built, as we call it in Efigland^ with 
lath and plaifter, but all the plaiftering was really 
China v/are, that is to fay, it was plaiftered with the 
earth that makes China ware. 

The outfide, which the fun flione hot upon. Was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfeftly white, and 
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 

burntt 



OF ROBINSON GRUSOE#l .305 

i)urnt. As to the infide, all the walls, inftead of 
wainfcot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, 
like the little fquare. tiles we call gaily tiles in England^ 
all made of the fineft China^ and the figures exceed- 
ing fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of co* 
lours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one 
figure, but joined fo artificially with mortar, being 
made of the fame earth, that it was very hard to fee 
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were 
of the fame compdfition, and as hard as the earthen 
floors we have in ufe in feveral parts of England^ 
efpecially Lihcolnjbire^ Nottingham/hire j Leicejierjhire^ 
&c. as hard as flione, and fmooth, but not burnt 
and painted, except fome fmaller rooms, like clofets j 
which were all, as it were, paved with the fame tile ; 
the cielings, and in a word, all the plaiftering-work 
in the whole houfe, were of the fame earth ; and^ 
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the 
fame, but of a deep ftiihing black* 

This was a China warehoufe indeed, truly and li* 
terally to be called fo ; and, had I not been upon the 
journey, I could have ftaid fome days to fee and ex- 
amine the particulars of it. They told me there 
were fountains and fifti-ponds in the garden, all 
paved at the bottom and fides with the fame, and 
fine ftatues fet up in rows on the walks, entirely 
formed of the porcelain eajth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the fingularities of Ghina^ fo 
they may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very 
fure, they excel in their accounts of it; for they 
told me fuch incredible things of their perform- 
ance in crockery-ware, for fuch it isj that I care 
not to l-elate, as knowing it could not be ' true : — 
One told me, in particular, of a workman that made 

Vol. IL X a fhip. 



306 LIFE AND ADVENTURSS 

a ihip, with all its tackle, and mads, and fsdls, ill 
earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty meiu If he 
had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to 
Japan in it, I might have faid fomething to it indeed ; 
but as it was, I knew the whole ftory, which was, 
in fhort, alking pardon for the word, that the fellow 
lied ; fo I fmiled, and faid nothing to it* 

This odd fight Jkept me two hours behind the ca- 
ravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three fliillings ; and told me, 
if it had been three days journey without the wall, 
as it was three days within, he muft have fined me 
four times as much, and made me alk pardon the 
next council day : fo I promifed to be more orderly ; 
for, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for 
keeping all together were abfolutely necelTary for our 
common fafety. 

In two days more we paffed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification againft thd Tartars ; and a 
very great work it is, going over hills and moun- 
tains in an endlefs track, where the rocks are impaffa- 
ble, and the precipices fuch as no enemy could pof- 
fibly enter, or, indeed, climb up, or where, if they 
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us, its 
length is near a thoufand Englijh miles, but that the 
country is five hundred, in a ftraight meafured line, 
which the wall bounds, without meafuring the 
windings and turnings it takes : 'tis about four fa- 
thom high, and as many thick in fome places. 

I flood flill an hour, or thereabouts, without 
trefpafling on our orders, for fo long the caravan 
was in pafTing the gate ; I fay, I flood flill an hour 
to look at it, on every fide, near, and far off, I 

mean.

lAeaii, what was within my view ; and the guide of 
our caravan, who had been extolling it for the won- 
der of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opi- 
nion of it. I told him it was a mod excellent thing 
to keep oflF the Tartars^ which he happened not to 
underftand as I meant it, and fo took it for a com- 
pliment : but the old pilot laughed : Q Seignior Inglefej 
faid he, you fpeak in cglours. In colours ! faid I^ 
what do you mean by that ? Why you fpeak what 
looks white this way, and black that way ; gay one 
way, and dull another way : you tell him it is a 
good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me, by that, 
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars ; or, 
will keep out none but Tartars : I underftand you. 
Seignior Inglefe^ I underftand you, faid he, joking ; 
but Seignior Chinefe underftand you his own way. 

Well faid I, Seignior, do you think it would ftand 
out an army of our country people, with a good 
train of artillery ; or our engineers, with two com- 
panies of miners ? Would they not batter it down 
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or 
blow it up into the air, foundation and all, that there 
ihould be no fign of it left ? Ay, ay, faid he, I know 
that. The Chinefe wanted mightily to know what I 
faid, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, 
for we were then almoft out of their/ country, and 
he was to leave us in a little time afterwards ; but 
when he knew what I had faid, he was dumb all 
the reft of the way, and we heard no more of his 
fine ftory of the Chinefe power and greatnefs while 
he ftaid. 

After we had pafled this mighty Nothing, called 
a wall, fomething like the Pi£ls wall, fo famous in 
Northumberland^ and built; by the Romans^ we began 

X 2 to 



308 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people 
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, 
as being fubjedt to the inroads and depredations of 
the Tartars^ who rob in great armies, and there- 
fore are not to be refifted by the naked inhabitants 
of an open country. 

And here I began to find the neceflity of keeping 
together in a caravan, as we travelled ; for we faw 
feveral troops of Tartars roving about j but when I 
came to fee them diftinftly, I wondered how that the 
Chinefe empire could be conquered by fuch contempti- 
ble fellows ; for they are a mere herd or crowd of 
wild fellows, keeping no order, and underftanding 
no difcipline, or manner of fight. 

Their horfes are poor, lean, ftarved creatures, 
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this 
we found the firft day we faw them, which was after 
we entered the wilder part of the country. Our 
leader for the day gave leave for about fixteen of us 
to go a hunting, as they call it ; and what was this 
but hunting of fheep ! However, it may be called 
hunting too ; for the creatures are the wildeft, and 
fwifteft of foot, that ever I faw of their kind ; only 
they will not run a great way, and you are fure of 
fport when you begin the chace ; for they appear ge- 
nerally by thirty or forty in- a flock, and, like true 
flieep, always keep together when they fly. 

In purfuit of this odd fort of game, it was our 
hap to meet with about forty Tartars : Whether they 
were hunting mutton as we were, or whether they 
looked for another kind of prey, I know not ; but 
as foon as they faw us, one of them blew a kind of 
horn very loud, but with a barbarous found that I 

had

had never heard before ; and, by the way, never 
care to hear again. We all fuppofed this was to call 
their friends about them ; and fo it was ; for in lefs 
than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or 
fifty more appeared at about a mile diftance ; but 
our work was over firft, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Mo/cow happened 
to be amongft us ; and as foon as he heard the horn, 
he told us, in fhort, that we had nothing to do but 
to charge them immediately, without lofs of time ; 
and, drawing us up in a line, he afked. If we were 
refolved ? We told him, We were ready to follow 
him : So he rode diredtly up to them. They flood 
gazing at us, like a mere crowd, drawn up in no 
order, nor (hewing the face of any order at all ; but 
as foon as they faw us advance, they let fly their ar- 
rows ; which, however, mifled us very happily : It 
feems they miftook not their aim, but their diftance ; 
for their arrows all fell a little Ihort of us, but with 
fo true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards 
nearer, we mufl have had feveral men wounded, if 
not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great diftance, we fired, and fent them leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows, following our fhot full gallop, 
refolving to fall in among them fword in hand ; for 
fo our bold Scot that led us, direfted. He was, in- 
deed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vi- 
gour and bravery on this occafion, and yet with fuch 
a cool courage too, that I never faw any man in aftion 
fitter for command. As foon as we came up to them, 
we fired our piftols in their faces, and then drew ; but 
they fled in the greateft confufion imaginable ; the

only Hand any of them made was on our right, where 
three of them flood, and, by figns, called the reft 
to come back to them, having a kind of fcymitar in 
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs 
Our brave commander, without afking any body to 
follow him, galloped up clofe to them, and with his 
fufil knocked one of them off his horfe, killed the 
fecond with his piftol, and the third ran away ; and 
thus ended our fight ; but we had this misfortune 
attending it, viz. That all our mutton that we had 
m chace got away. We had not a man killed or 
hurt ; but, as for the Tartars^ there were about five 
of them killed ; how many were wounded, we knew 
not ; but this we knew, that the other party was fa 
frighted with the noife of our guns, that they fled, 
and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinefe dominions, 
and therefore the Tartars were not fo bold as after- 
wards ; but in about five days we entered a vafl 
gre^t \vild d^fart, which held us three days and 
nights march; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leather bottles, and to encamp 
all night, jufl as I have heard they do in the defarts 
of Arabia. 

I afked our guides, whofe dominion this was in ? 
and they told me this was a kind of border that 
might be called No MatCs Land ; being part of the 
Great Karakathy^ or Grand Tartary ; but that, how- 
ever, it was reckoned to China ; that there was no 
care taken here to preferve it from the inroads of 
thieves ; and therefore it was reckoned the worfl defart 
in the whole march, though we were to go over fomc 
much larger* 

I In 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3II 

In pafling this wildernefs, which, I confefs, was 
at the firft view very frightful to me, we faw two 
or three times little parties of the Tartars^ but they 
feemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no 
defign upon us ; and fo, like the man who met the 
devil, if they had nothing to fay to us, we had no- 
thing to fay to them j we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came fo near as 
to (land and gaze at us ; whether it was to confider 
what they fliould do, viz. to attack us, or not at- 
tack us, we knew not ; but when we were paffed at 
fome diftance by them, we made a rear guard of forty 
men, and flood ready for them, 'letting the caravan 
pafs half a mile, or thereabouts, before us : After a 
while they marched off, only we found they affaulted 
us with five arlrows at their parting ; one of which 
wounded a horfe, fo that it difabled him; and we 
left him the next day, poor creature, in great need 
of a good farrier. We fuppofe they might fhoot more 
arrows, which might fall (hort of us ; but we ftw no 
more arrows, or Tartars^ at that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not fo good as at firft, though 'ftill in the do- 
minions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the 
moft part, in villages, fome of which were fortified, 
becaufe of the incurfions of the Tartars. When 
we came to one of thefe towns (it was about two 
days and a halPs journey before we were to come to 
the city of Naum^) I wanted to buy a camel, of 
which there are plenty to be fold all the way upon 
that road, and of horfes alfo, fuch as they are, be- 
caufe fo many caravans coming that way, they are 
X 4 very 



312 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

very often wanted. The perfon that I fpoke to 
to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched it 
for me ; but I, like a fool, muft be officious, and 
go myfelf along with him. The place was about 
two miles out of the village, where, it feems, they 
kept the camels and horfes feeding under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company, 
and a Chinefe^ being defirous, forfooth, of a little va- 
riety. When we came to this place, it was a low 
marfhy ground, walled round with a ftone wall, piled 
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a 
park, with a little guard of Chinefe foldiers at the 
doors : Having bought a camel, and agreed for the 
price, I came away ; and the Chinefe man, that went 
with me, led the camel, when on a fudden came up 
five Tartars oh horfeback ; two of them feized the 
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the 
other three ftepped up to me and my old pilot ; feeing 
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about 
me but my fword, which could but ill defend me 
againft three horfemen. The firfl: that came up 
flopped fhort ^pon my drawing my fword (for they 
are arrant cowards;) but a fecond coming upon 
my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never 
felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to 
myfelf, what was the matter with me, and where I 
was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; but my ne- 
ver-failing old pilot, the Portugueje (fo providence, 
unlooked for, direfts deliverances from dangers, which 
to us are unforefeen,) had a piftol in his pocket, 
which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither ; 
if they had, I fuppofe they would not have attacked 



9, 



OF. ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

US ; but cowards are always boldeft when. there is no 
.danger. 

The old man, feeing me down, with a bold heart 
ftepped up to the fellow that had ftruck me, and lay- 
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him 
down by main force a little towards him with the 
other, he fhot him into the head, and laid him dead 
on the fpot ; he then immediately ftepped up to him 
who had flopped us, as I faid, and before he could 
come forward again (for it was all done as it were iu 
a moment) made a blow at him with a fcymitar, 
which he always wore, but, miffing the man, cut 
his horfe into the fide of his head, cut one of his 
ears off by the root, and a great flice down the fide 
of his face* The poor beaft, enraged with the 
wounds, was no more to be governed by his rider, 
though the fellow fat well enough too ; but away he 
jflew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach ; 
and, at fome diftance, rifing upon his hind legs, threw 
down the Tartar^ and fell upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinefe came in, who had 
loft the camel, but he had no weapon ; however, fee- 
ing the Tartar down, and his horfe fallen upon him, 
he runs to him, and feizing upon an ugly ill-favoured 
weapon he had by his fide, fomething like a pole- 
axe, but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from 
him, and made fhift to knock his Tartarian brains 
cut with it. But my old man had the third Tartar 
to deal with ftill ; and, feeing he did not fly as he 
expefted, nor come on to fight him, as he appre- 
hended, but ftood ftock ftill, the old man ftood ftill 
too, and falls to work with his tackle to charge his 
piftol again: but as foon as the Tartar faw the

314 LIFE AND ADVENTURJES 

piftol, whether he fuppofed it to be the fame or ana. 
ther, I know not; but away he fcoured, and left 
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a 
complete viftory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought^ 
when I firft began to awake, that I had been in a 
fweet fleep ; but, as I faid above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was 
the matter : in a word, a few minutes after, as fenfe 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where j 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody; then I felt my head ache; and then, in 
another moment, memory returned, and every thing 
was prefent to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet inftantly, and got hold 
of my fword, but no enemies in view, I found a 
Tartar lie dead, and his horfe ftanding very quietly 
by him ; and looking farther, I faw my champion 
and deliverer, who had been to fee what the Chinefe 
had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. 
The old man, feeing me on my feet, came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and feeing me 
bloody, would fee how I was hurt ; but it was not 
much, only what we call a broken head ; neither 
did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from 
the blow, other than the place which was hurt, and 
which was well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this vidory ; 
for we loft a camel, and gained a horfe : but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village, the man demanded to be paid for the ca- 
mel; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 3I5 

mel ; I difputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
before the Cbine/e]\idge of the place ; that is to fay, 
in Englijhy we went before a juftice of the peace. 
Give him his due, he adled with a great deal of pru- 
dence and impartiality ; and having heard both fides, 
he gravely alked the Chinefe man that went with me 
to buy the camel, whdfe fervant he was ? 1 am no 
fervant faid he, but went with the ftranger* At 
whofe requeft ? faid the juftice. At the' ftranger's 
requeft, faid he. Why then, faid the juftice, you 
were the ftranger's fervant for the time ; and the 
camel being delivered to his fervant, it was delivered 
to him, and he muft pay for it. 

I confefs the thing was fo clear, that I had 
not a word to fay ; but admiring to fee fuch juft 
reafoning upon the confequence, and fo accurate 
ftating the cafe, I paid willingly for the camel, and 
fent for another ; but you may obferve, Ifent for it j 
I did not go to fetch it myfelf any more ; I had 
enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe em- 
pire : they call it fortified, and fo it is, as fortifica- 
tions go there ; for this I will venture to affirm, that 
all the Tartars in Karakathayj which, I believe, are 
fome milUons, could not batter down the walls with 
their bows and arrows ; but to call it ftrong, if it 
were attacked with cannon, would be to make thofe 
who underftand it laugSfet you. 

We wanted, as I have faid, above two days jour- 
ney of this city, when meflengers were fent exprefs 
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt, till they had a guard fent to them ; 

for 



3l6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for that an unufual body of Tartars ^ making ten 
thoufand in all, had appeared in the way, about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, 
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were 
very glad to hear we fliould have a guard. Accord- 
ingly, two days after, we had 200 foldiers fent us 
from a garrifon of the Chinefe on our left, and three 
hundred more from the city of Naum^ and with thofe 
we advanced boldly : the three hundred foldiers from 
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred ia our 
rear, and our men on each fide of our camels with 
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre: 
in this order, aijid well prepared for battle, we thought 
ourfelves a match for the whole ten thoufand Mogul 
Tartars J if they had appeared ; but the next day, 
when they did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when marching from 
a little well-fituated town, called Changu^ we had a 
river to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry ; and 
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been 
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan 
being over, the rear guard was behind: but they 
did not appear there* 

About three hours after, when we were entered upon 
a defart of about fifteen or fixteen miles over, be* 
hold, by a cloud of dufl: they raifed, we faw an 
enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand indeed, 
for they came on upon the fpur. 

The Chinefe^ our guard on the front, who had 
talked fo big the day before, began to dagger, and 
the foldiers frequently looked behind them ; which is 
a certain fign in a foldier, that he is juft ready to run 

away. 



o:^ ROBINSON ckusoE. 317 

Eway. My old pilot was of my mind ; and being 
near me, he called out: Seignior Inglefe^ faid he, 
thofe fellows muft be encouraged, or they will ruin 
us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never 
ftand it. I am of your mind, faid I : But what 
courfe muft be done ? Done, faid he ; let fifty of our 
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and 
encourage them, and they will fight like brave fel- 
lows in brave company ; but without it, they will 
every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to 
our leader, and told him, who was exadtly of our 
mind ; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the 
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the reft made a 
line of referve ; for fo we marched, leaving the laft 
two hundred men to make another body to them- 
felves, and to guard the camels ; only that, if need 
were, they (hould fend an hundred men to affift the 
laft fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innume- 
rable company they were ; how many, we could not 
tell, but ten thoufand we thought was the leaft. A 
party of them came on firft, and viewed our pofture, 
traverfing the ground in the front of our line ; and as 
we found them within gun-fhot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance fwiftly, and give them a 
falvo on each wing with their fliot, which was done ; 
but they went off, and I fuppofe went back to give 
an account of the reception they were like to meet 
with; and, indeed, that falute clogged their fto- 
ihachs J for they immediately halted, ftood awhile 
to confider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, they 
gave over the defign, and faid no more to us for 
that time ; which was very agreeable to our circum- 

ftances.

fiances,, which were but very indiflferent for a battle 
with fuch a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum^ 
or Naunm : We thanked the governor for his care for" 
us, and coUeded to the value of loo crowns, or 
thereabouts, which we gave to the foldiers fent to 
guard us ; and here we refted one day. This is a 
garrifon indeed, and there were nine hundred fol- 
diers kept here ; but the reafon of it wasy that for- 
merly the Mufcovite frontiers lay nearer to them than 
they do now, the Mufcovites having abandoned that 
part of the country (which lies from the city'weftji 
for about two hundred miles) as defolate and unfit 
for ufe ; and more efpecially, being fo very remote* 
and fo difficult to fend troops hither for its defence 5 
for we had yet above two thoufand miles to Mufcovy^ 
properly f5 called. 

After this we paff^d feveral great rivers, and two 
dreadful defarts, one of which we were fixteen days 
paffing over, and which, as I faid, was to be called 
No Man*s Land ; and on the 13th of Aprils we came 
to the. frontiers of the Mufcovite dominions. I think 
the firft city, or town, or fortrefs, whatever it might be 
called, that belonged to the Czar of Mufcovy^ was 
called Argu7iy being on the weft fide of the river 
Argun-. 

I could not but difcover an infinite fatisfattlon^ 
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Chriftiafi 
country; or, at leaft, in a country governed by 
Chriftians : for though the Mufcovites do, in my opi- 
nion, but juft deferve the name of Chriftians ; (yet 
fuch they pretend to be, and are very devout in their 

way) J

wzy); it would certainly occur to any man who 
travek the world as I have done, and who had any 
power of refledion ; I fay, it would occur to him, 
to refleft, what a bleffing it is to be brought into the 
world where the name of God, and of a Redeemer, 
is known, worlhipped, and adored — ^and not where 
the people, given up by Heaven to ftrong delufibns, 
worfliip the devil, and proftrate themfelves to ftocks 
and ftones; worfliip monfliers, elements, horrible 
ihaped animals, and ftatues, or images of monfters. 
Not a town or city we pafled through but had their 
pagods, their idols, and their temples; and ignorant 
people worfliipping even the works of their ownhands ! 

Now we cam^ where, at leafl:, a face of the 
Chrift:ian worfliip appeared, where the knee was 
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not, 
yet the Chrifl:ian religion was owned, and the name 
of the true God was called upon and adored ; and 
it made the very recefles of my foul rejoice to fee it. 
I faluted the br2ive Scotch merchant I mentioned 
above, with my firfl: acknowledgment of this ; and, 
taking him by the hand, I faid to him, Blefled be 
God, we are once again come among Chrifl:ians ! 
He fmiled, and anfwered. Do not rejoice too foon, 
countryman ; thefe Mufcovites are but an odd fort of 
Chrifl:ians ; and but for the name of it, you may fee 
very little of the fubftance for fome months far- 
ther of our journey.

3^0 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

all the reft of this country, for above a thoufand 
miles farther, is inhabited by the word and moft 
ignorant of pagans : and fo indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greateft piece of 
folid earth, if I underftand any thing of the furfece 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
world : we had at leaft twelve hundred miles to the 
fea, eaftward ; we had at leaft two thoufand to the 
bottom of the Balic fea, weftward j and almoft three 
thoufand miles, if we left that fea, and went on weft 
to the Britijh and French channels ; we had fiill five 
thoufand miles to the Indian or Perjtan fea, fouth; and 
about eight hundred miles to the frozen fea, north i 
nay, if fome people may be believed, there might be 
no fea north-eaft till we came round the pole, and 
confequently into the north-weft, and fo had a con* 
tinent of land into America^ no mortal knows where j 
though I could give fome reafons why I believe that 
to be a miftake too. 

As we entered into the Mufcovite dominions, a 
good while before we came to any confiderable town, 
we had nothing to obferve there but this : firft, that 
all the rivers run to the eaft. As I underftood by tfie 
charts which fome of our caravans had with them^ 
it was plain that all thofe rivers ran into the great 
river Tamour^ or Gammour. This river, by the 
natural courfe of it, muft run into the eaft fea, or 
Chinefe ocean. The ftory they tell us, that the 
mouth of this river is choaked up with bulrulhes of a 
monftrous growth, vi%. three feet about, and twenty 
or thirty feet high, I muft be allowed to fay, I be- 
lieve nothing of; but as its navigation is of no ufe^ 

becaufe 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 32 1 

becaufe there is no trade that way, the Tartars^ to 
whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle; 
fo nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious 
Enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats* 
or to come up from the mouth of it in (hips j but 
this is certain, that this river running due eaft, in 
the latitude of 60 degrees, carries a vaft concourfe 
of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty 
itfelf in that latitude ; fo we are fure of fea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
feveral confiderable rivers, whofe ftreams run as due 
north as the Tamour runs eaft ; and thefe are all found' 
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus^ 
named fo from the northermoft nations of the Mogul 
Tartars^ who, the Chinefe fay, were the firft Tartars 
in the world ; and who, as our geographers alledge, 
are. the Gog and Magog mentioned in facred ftory. 

Thefe rivers running all northward, as well as all 
the other rivers I am yet to fpeak of, made it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land alfo on that 
fide ; fo that it does not feem rational in the leaft to 
think that the land can extend itfelf to join with 
America on that fide, or that there is not a commu- 
nication between the northern and the eaftern ocean ; 
but of this I Ihall fay no more ; it was my obfervation 
at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this 
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by 
eafy and moderate journeys, and were very vifibly 
obliged to the care the czar of Mufcovy has taken 
to have cities and towns built in as many places as arc 
poffible to place them, where his foldiers keep garri- 
fon, fomething like the ftationary foldiers placed

by the Romans in the remoteft countries of theif 
empire, fome of which I had read were particularly 
placed in Britain for the fecurity of commerce, and 
for the lodging of travellets ; and thus it was here } 
for wherever we came, though at thefe towns and 
ftations, the garrifons and governor were Ruffians 
and profeffed mere pagans, facrificing to idols, and 
worfhipping the fun, moon, and ftars, or all the 
hoft of heaven ; and not only fo, but were, of all 
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the 
moll barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man's flefh, as our favages of America did^ 

Some inftances of this we met with in the 
country between Arguna, where we enter the Mtif* 
covite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Ruffians 
together, called Nertzirijkay ; in which fpace is a 
continued defart or foreft, which coft us twenty 
days to travel over it. In a village, near the laft 
of tht)fe places, I had the curiofity to go and fe^ 
their way of living ; which is moft brutifli and un- 
fufferable : they had, I fuppofe, a great facrifice that 
day ; for there flood out upon an old flump of a 
tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil ; 
at leaft as any thing we can think of to reprefent the 
devH that can be made : It had an head certainly not 
fo much as refembling any creature that the world 
ever faw ; ears as big as goats horns, and as high j 
eyes as big as a crown piece ; and a nofe like a 
crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended four- 
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, 
hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was drefled up 
in the fiithieft manner that you can fuppofe j its up-

If they had been logs of woods like their idol ; et

came a little nearer, they flart^d up upon their feet ; 
ind raifed an howling cry, as if it had been fo

little way off from this monfter, and at the door of 
a tent or hut, made all of flieep-fkins and cow-fkins, 
dried, ftood three butchers : I thought they were 
fuch ; for when I came nearer to them, I found they 
had long knives in their hands, and in the middle 
of the tent appeared three flieep killed, and one 
young bullock, or fteer. Thefe, it feems, were fa- 
crifices to that fenfelefs log of an idol ; and thefe 
three men priefts belonging to it ; and the feventeen 
proftrated wretches were the people who brought 
the offering, and were making their prayers to that

was at any thing in my life : to fee God's moft glo- 
rious and beft creature, to whom he had granted fo 
many advantages, even by creation, above the reft 
of the works of his hands, vefted with a reafonable 
foul, and that foul adorned with faculties and capa- 
cities adapted both to honour his Maker and be ho- 
noured by him ; I fay, to fee it funk and degenerated 
to a degree fo more than ftupid, as to proftrate itfelf 
to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary objeft drefTed 
up by themfelves, and made terrible to themfelves 
by their own contrivrjice, adorned only with clouts 
and rags ; and that this Ihould be the eflfeft of mere 
igilorance, wrought up into hellifh devotion by the 
devil himfelf; who, envyinghisMaker the homage and 
adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into 
fuch grofs, furfeiting, fordid, and bruitifh things, as 
one would think Ihould fhock nature itfelf. 

But what fignified all the aftonifhment and reflec- 
tion of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I faw it before 
my eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, 
or think it impoflible. All my admiration turned to 
rage ; and I rode up to the image or monfter, call 
it what you will, and with my fword cut the bonnet 
that was on its head in two in the middle, fo that it 
hung down by one of the horns ; and one of our 
men that was with me, took hold of the fheep-fldn 
that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a moft 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, 
and two or three hundred people came about my 
ears, fo that I was glad to fcour for it ; for we faw 
fome had bows and arrows ; but I refolved from 
that moment to vifit them again. 

Our 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

Our caravan refte^ three nights at the town, 
^hich was about four miles off, in order to provide 
fome horfes, which they wanted, feveral of the 
horfes having been lamed and jaded with the badnefs 
of the way, and our long march over the laft de- 
fart ; fo we had fome leifure here to put my deftgn 
in execution. I communicated my projed to the 
Scots merchant, of Mo/cow, of whofe courage I had 
afufEcient teftimony, as above, I told hipi what I 
had feen, and with what indignation I had fince 
thought, that human nature could be fo degenerate. 
I told him, I was refolvied, if I could get but four 
or five mei^* well armed to go witlf- me, to go and 
deftroy that vile, abominable idol ; to^ let them fee, 
that it had no power to help i'tfelf, and confequently 
could not be an objeQ: of worfhip, pr tojbe prayed 
to, much lefs help them that offered Tacrinces to it. 

He laughed at me : faid he, Your zeal may be 
good ; but what do you^ropofe J^ yourfelf by it ? 
Propofe! faid I; to vindicate the honour of God, 
which is infulted by this devil-worfhip. But how 
will it vindicate the honour of God ? faid he, while 
the people will not be able to know what you mean 
by it, unlefs you could fpeak to them too, and 
tell them Jo ; and then they will fight you too, I will 
affure you j for they are defperate fellows, and that 
efpecially in defence of their idolatry. Can we not, 
faid I, do it in the night, and then leave them the 
reafons in writing, in their own language ? Writing! 
faid he, why there is not in five nations of them, 
one man that knows any thing of a letter, or how 
to read a word in any language, or in their own. 
Y3 Wretched 



326 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Wretched ignorance ! faid I to him ; however, I 
have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to kt them fee how 
brutifli they are to worfhip fuch horrid things. Look 
you, Sir, faid he, if your zeal prompts you to it fo 
warmly, you mull do it ; but, in the next place, I 
would have you confider thefe wild nations of people 
are fubjefted by force to the czar of Mufcovf^ do- 
minions ; and if you do this, it is ten to one but 
they will come by thoufands to thfe governor of 
Nertzinjk^y and complain, and demand fatisfeftion ; 
and if he cannot give them fatisfaftion, it is ten to 
one but they revolt ; and it will occafion a new 
war with all the Tartars in the country. 

This, I confefs, put new thoughts into my head 
for a while ; but I harped upon the fame firing ftill ; 
and all that day I was uneafy to put my projed in 
execution. Towards the evening, the Scots merchant 
met me by acc^ent in our walk about the town, 
and defired to fpeak with me : I believe, faid he, 
I have put you off your good defign ; I have been 
a little concerned about it fince ; for 1 abhor the 
idol and idolatry as much as you can do. Truly, 
laid I, you have put it off a little as to the execution 
of it, but you have not put it all out of my thoughts ; 

. and, I believe, I fhall do it ftill before I quit this 
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for 

jKtisfaftion. No, no, faid he; God forbid they 
Ihould deliver you up to fuch a crew of monfters ! 
they fhall not do that neither ; that would be mur- 
dering you indeed. Why, faid I, how would they 
ufe me ? Ufe you ! faid he ; V\\ tell you how they 
ferved a poor Ruffian ^ who affronted them in their 

worihip 



PF ROBINSON CRUSOEt 327 

worlhip juft as you did, and whom they took pri- 
foner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that 
he could not run away ; they took him and ftripped 
him ftark naked, and fet him upon the top of the 
idol monfter, and flood all round him, and fhot as 
many arrows into him as would ftick over his ^hole 
body ; and then they burnt him and all the arrows 
flicking in him, as a facrifice to rfie idol. And was 
this the fame idol ? faid I. Yes, faid he, the very 
fame. Well, faid I, I will tell you a flory : Sp I 
related the flory of our nien at Madagafcar^ and how 
jthey burnt and facked the village there, and killed 
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of 
our men, jufl as it is related before ; and when I 
had done, I added, that I thojight we ought to dp 
fo to this village. 

He liflened very attentively to the flory ; but when 
I talked of doing fo to that village, faid he, you mif- 
t^e very much ; it was not thi^^^village, it was al- 
mofl an hundred miles from this place ; but it was 
the fame i^ol, for they carry him about in proceffion 
all over the country. W^^^ faid I, then that idol 
ought to be punifhed for it ; and it fhall, faid I, if I 
live this night out. 

In a word, finding me refolute, he liked the de- 
fign, and tojd me, I fholild not go alone, but he 
would go with me ; but he would go firll, and bring 
a (lout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go alfo 
with us ; and one, faid he, as famous for his zeal 
as you can defire any one to be againft fuch devilifh 
things as thefe. In a word, he brought me his com- 
rade, a Scot/man^ whom he called Captain Richard^ 
Jon ; and I gave him a full account of what I had 

Y 4 feen. 



328 LIFE AND APVENTURES 

feen, and alfe of what I intended ; and he told me 
readily, he would go with me, if it coft him his life. 
So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed, 
propofed it to my partner ; but he declined it. He 
faid, he was ready to aflift me to the utmoft, and 
upon all occafions, for my defence ; but that this 
was an adventure quite out of his way : fo, I fay, 
wie refolved upon our work, only we three, and my 
man-fervant, and to put it in execution that night 
about midnight, with all the fecrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond thoughts, we were willing 
to delay it till the next night, becaufe the caravan 
being to fet forward in the morning, we fuppofed the 
governor could not pretend to give them any fatis- 
fadtion upon us when we were out of his power. — 5 
The Scots merchant, as fteady in his refolution to en- 
terprize it as bold in executing, brought me a Tar^ 
tar's robe or gown of fheep-lkins, and a bonnet, 
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the fame 
for himfelf and his countryman, that the people, if 
they faw us, fliould not be able to determine who we 
were. 

All the firft night we fpent in mixing up fome 
combuftible matter with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, and 
fuch other materials as we could get ; and, having 
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour 
after night we fet out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people had not the leaft 
jealoufy of danger attending their idol ; the night 
was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to 
fee that the idol ftood juft in the fame pofture and 
place that it did before.' The people .feemed to be- 
1 all 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 329 

all at their reft; only, that in the great hut, or tent 
as we called it, where we faw the three priefts, whom 
we miftook for butchers, we faw a light, and, go- 
ing up clbfe to the door, we heard people talking, 
as if there were five or fix of them ; we concluded 
therefore, that if we fet wild-fire to the idol, thefe 
men would come out immediately, and run up to the 
place to refcue it from the deftrudion that we intended 
for it ; and what to do with them we knew not. Once 
we thought of carrying it away, and fetting fire to it 
fit a diftance ; but when we came to handle it, we 
found it too bulky for our carriage ; fo we were at 
a lofs again. The fecond Scotfman was for fetting 
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures 
that were there on the head, when they came out ; 
but I could not join with that ; I was againft killing 
them, if it was poflible to be avoided. Well then, 
faid the Scots merchant, I will tell you what we will 
do ; we will try to make them prifoners, tie their 
hands, and make them ftand and fee their idol 
deftroyed. 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
enough about us, which we ufed to tie our fire- 
works together with ; fo we refolved to attack thefe 
people fir ft, and with as little noife as we could. 
The firft thing we did, we knocked at the door, 
when one of the priefts coming to it, we immediate- 
ly feized upon him, flopped his mouth, and tied his 
hands behind him and led him to the idol, where we 
gagged him that he might not make a noife ; tied 
his feet alfo together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expeding that 
another would come out to fee what the matter 

was ; 



33^ LIFJE AND ADVENTURES 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow 
travellers, exceeding bufy in getting ready for our 
journey j nor could any man fuggeft that we had been 
anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might be 
fuppofed to be, to fit themfelves for the fatigues of 
that day's journey. 

But it did not end fo ; for the next day came a 
great multitude of the country people, not only of 
this villagie, but of an hundred more, for aught I 
know, to the town gates ; and, in a mod outrageous 
manner^ demanded fatisfaftion of the Ruffian gowtr^ 
nor, for the infulting their priefts, and burning their 
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu ; fuch an hard name they 
gave the monftrous creature they worlhipped: the 
people of Nertzinjkay were at firft in a great confter- 
nation ; for, they faid, the Tartars were no lefs than 
thirty thoufand, and that in a few days more, they 
would be one hundred thoufand ftronger. 

The Ruffian governor fent out meffengers to ap- 
peafe them, and gave them all the good words ima- 
ginable. He affured them he knew nothing of it, 
and that there had not a foul of his garrifon been 
abroad ; that it could not be from any body there ; 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
fhould be exemplarily puniflied. They returned 
haughtily. That all the country reverenced the 
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu^ who dwelt in the fun, and 
no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his 
image, but fome Chrijlian mifcreant j fo they called 
them, it feems, and they therefore denounced war 
againft him, and all the Ruffians^ who, they faid, 
were mifcreants and Cbrijiians. 

The 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi. 333 

The governot, ftill patient, and unwilling to 
make a breach, or to have any caufe of war alledged 
to be given by him, the czar having ftraightly charged 
him to treat the conquered country with gentlenefs 
and civility, gave them ftill all the good words he 
could; at laft he told them, there was a caravan 
gone towards Rujfta that morning, and perhaps it 
was fome of them who had done them this injury ; 
and that, if -they would be fatisfied with that, he 
would fend after them, Jo enquire into it. This 
feemed to appeafe them a little j and accordingly 
the governor fent after us, and gave us a particular 
account how the thing was ; intimating, withal, that 
if any in our caravan had done it, they fhould make 
their efcape ; but that, whether they had done it or 
no, we fhould make all the hafte forward that 
was poffible ; and that in the mean time, he would 
keep them in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. How- 
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was no- 
body knew any thing of the matter ; and, as for us 
that were guilty, we were the leaft of all fufpefted ; 
none fo much as aflced us the queftion ; however, the 
captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint 
that the governor gave us, and we marched or tra- 
velled two days and two nights without any confide- 
rable ftop, and then we lay at a village called 
Flothus ; nor did we make any long ftop here, but 
haftened on towards Jarawena^ another of the czar 
of Mufcovf^ colonies, and where we expefted we 
Ihould be fafe; but it is to be obferved, that here 
we began, for two or three days march, to enter 
upon a vaft namelefs defart, of which I fhall fay more 

in

in its place ; and which if we had now been upon it^ 
is more than probable, we had been all deftroyed^. 
It was the fecond day's march from Plothus^ that by 
the clouds of duft behind us at a great diflance^ fome 
of our people began to be fenfible wei were purfued ; 
we had entered the defart, and had paffed by a great 
lake, called Schanh Ofter^ when we perceived a very 
great body of horfe appear on the other fide of the 
lake to the north, we travelling weft,^ We ob- 
fcrvcd they went away weft, as we did ; but had fup- 
pofed we fhould have taken that fide of the lake, 
whereas we very happily took the fouth fide ; and ia 
two days more we faw them not, for they, believing 
we were ftill before them, pufhed on, till they came 
to the river Udda : This is a very great river when it 
pafles farther north ; but when we came to it, we 
found it narrow and fordable, 

The third day they either found their miftake, ox 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon 
us, towards the dufk of the evening. We had, to 
our great fatisfaftion, juft pitched upon a place for 
our camp, which was very convenient for the night ; 
for as we were upon a defart, though l^ut at the be- 
ginning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, 
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expedted 
none but the city Jarawenuj which we had yet two 
days march to ; the defart, however, had fome few 
woods in it on this fide, and little rivers, which ran 
all into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow 
ftrait between two fmall, but very thick woods, 
that we pitched our little camp for that night, ex- 
peding to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody 



OF ROBIKSON^ CRUSOE. 335 

Nobody knew but ourfelves what we were purfued 
for ; but as it was ufual for the Mogul Tartars to go 
about in troops in that defart, fo the caravans al- 
ways fortify therafelves every night againft them, as 
againft armies of robbers j and it was therefore no 
new thing to be purfued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our tra- 
vels, a moft advantageous camp ; for we lay between 
two woods, with a little rivulet running juft before 
our front ; fo that we could not be furrounded or 
attacked any way, but in our front or rear : we took 
care alfo to^ake our front as ftrong as we could, by 
placing our packs, with our camels and horfes, all 
in a line on the fide of the river, and we felled fome 
trees iii our rear. 

In this pofture we endamped for the night ; but 
the enemy was upon us before we had finifhed our 
fituation : they did not come on us like thieves, as 
we expedted, but fent three meffengers to us, to 
demand the men to be delivered to them, that had 
abufed their pfiefts, and burnt their god Cham-Chi- 
ThaungUj that they might burn them with fire ; and, 
upon this, they faid, they would go away, and do 
us no farther harm, otherwife they would burn us 
all with fire. Our men looked very blank at this 
meflage, arid began to flare at one another, to fee 
who looked with moft guilt in their faces, but, no^ 
body was the word, nobody did it. The leader of 
the caravan fent word, he was well affured it was not 
done by any of our camp ; that we were peaceable 
merchants, travelling on our bufinefs ; that we had 
done no harm to them, or to any one elfe ; and 
therefore they muft look farther for their enemies, 

v^ho 



33^ ^I*E ANJb ADVENTURJiS 

who had iiijurcd them, for we were not the people j 
lb defired them not to difturb us ; for if they did, 
we fhould defend ourfelves. 

They were far from being fatisfied with this for an 
anfwer, and a great crowd of them came down in 
the morning, by break of day, to our camp ; but, 
feeing us in fuch an advantageous fituation, they 
durft come no farther than the brook in our front, 
where they flood, and fhewed us fuch a number, as, 
indeed, terrified us very much ; for thofe that fpoke 
leafl of them, fpoke of ten thoufand. Here they 
flood, and looked at us a while, and then fetting up 
3, great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among 
us ; but we were well enough fortified for that, for 
we were fheltered under our baggage; and I do .not 
remember that one man of us was hurt. 

Some time after this, we faw them move a little 
to our right, and expefted them on the rear, when 
a cunning fellow, a Coffack^ as they call them, of 
Jarawena^ in the pay of the Mufcovites^ calling to 
the leader of the caravan, faid to him, I will fend 
all thefe people away to Sibeilka : This was a city four 
or five days journey, at leafl to the fouth, and rather 
behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and, 
getting on horfeback, he rides away from our rear 
diredly, as it were, back to Nertzinfiay ; after this, 
he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army 
of the Tartars^ as if he had been fent exprefs to 
tell them a long flory, that the people who had 
burnt their Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka^ 
with a caravan of mifcreants, as he called them ; 
that is to fay, Chriftians ; and that they were re- 

folved 



OF ROBINSO^r CRUSOE* 337 

folved to burn the god Seal Ifarg^ belonging to the 
Tongufes. 

As this fellow was a mere Tartar j and perfedtly 
fpoke their language, he counterfeited fo well, that 
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in 
a mod violent hurry, to Sibeilka^ which, it feems, 
was five days journey to the fouth j and in lefs than 
three hours they were entirely out of out fight, 
and we never heard any more of them, nor evet 
knew whether they went to that other place called 
Sibeilka^ or no* 

So we pafled fafely on to the city of Jarawenai 
where there was a garrifon of Mufcovites ; and there 
we refted five days, the caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the laft day's march, and with want 
of reft in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful defart, which 
held us three-and*twenty days march. We furnifhed 
ourfelves with fome tents here, for the better ac- 
commodating ourfelves in the night > and the leader 
of the caravan procured fixteen carriages, or wag- 
gons, of the country, for carrying our water and 
provifions ; and thefe carriages were our defence 
every night round our little camp ; fo that had the 
Tartars appeared, unlefs they had been very nume- 
rous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt 
us. 

We may well be fuppofed to want reft again after 
this long journey ; for in this defart we faw nei- 
ther houfe or tree, or fcarce a bufli ; we faw, indeed, 
abundance of the fable-hunters, as they called them : 
Thefe are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary^ of which 
this country is a part ^ and they frequently attack 
Vol. IL Z fmall 



338 LIFE AND ADVENTURBS 

fmall caravans ; but we faw no numbers of them tcv 
gether. I was curious to fee the fable-(kins they 
catched ; but I could never fpeak with any of them; 
for they durft not come near us j neither durfl we 
ftraggle from our company to go near them. 

After we had paffed this defart, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited; that is to fay, we 
found towns and caftles fettled by the czar of Muf- 
covy^ with garrifons of ftationary foldiers to protect 
the caravans, and defend the country againft the 
Tarfarsj who would otherwife make it very dan- 
gerous travelling ; and his czarifh majefty has given 
fuch ftri£t orders for the well guarding the caravans 
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard 
of in the country, detachments of the garrifon are 
always fent to fee travellers fafe from ftation to fta- 
tion. 

And thus the, governor of Adinjkoy^ whom I had 
an opportunity to make a vifit to, by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of- 
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there 
was any danger, to the next ftation. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe^ we ihould find the country better peopled, 
and the people more civilized; but I found myfelf 
miftaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the 
Tonguefes to pafs through ; where we faw the fame 
tokens of paganifm and barbarity, or worfe, than 
before ; only as they were conquered by the Muf- 
covitesy and entirely reduced, they were not fo dan- 
gerous ; but for the rudenefs of manners, idolatry, 
and polytheifm, no people in the world ever went 
beyond them. They are clothed all in ikins of 

beafts. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 339 

bfeafts, and their houfes are built of the fame. 
You know not a man from a woman, neither by 
the ruggednefs of their countenances, or their 
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is co- 
vered with fnow, they live under ground, in houfes 
like vaults, which have cavities or caves going from 
one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-ChUThaungu for a 
whole village, or country, thefe had idols in every 
hut, and every cave; befides, they worfhip {he 
ftais, the fun, the water, the fnow ; and, in a word, 
every thing that they do not underftand, and they 
underftand but very little ; fo that almoft every ele- 
ment, every uncommon thing, fets them a facri- 
ficing. 

But I am no more to defcribe people than coun- 
tries, any farther than my own ftory comes to be 
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar 
to myfelf in all this country, which, I reckon was, 
from the defart which I fpoke of laft, at leaft four 
hundred miles, half of it being another defart, 
which took us up twelve days fevere travelling, 
without houfe, tree or bufli ; but w^re obliged again 
to carry <*ir own provifions, as well water as bread. 
After we were out of this defart, and had tra- 
velled two days, we came to Janezay^ a Mufco- 
vite city or ftation, on the great river yanezay^ 
This river, they told us, parted Europe from AJia^ 
though our map-makers, as I am told, do not agree 
to it ; however, it is certainly the eaftern boundary 
of the antient Siberia^ which now makes a province 
only of the vaft Mufcovite empire, but is itfelf equal 
in bignefs to the whole empire of Germany^ 

Zz And 



34<5 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

And yet here I obferved ignorance and paganifm 
ftill prevailed, except in the Mufcovite garrifons: 
All the country between the river Oby, and the river 
yane:^ayy is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar- 
barous, as the remoteft of the Tartars ; nay, as 
any nation, for aught I know, in Afta or America. 
I alfo found, which I obferved to th€ Mufcovite go- 
vernors, whom I had opportunity to converfe with, 
that the pagans are not much the wifer, or the nearef 
Chriftianity, for being under the Mufcovite go- 
vernment ; which they acknowledged was true 
enough, but, they faid, it was none of their bu- 
finefs } that if the czar expeded to convert his Si- 
betian^ or Tonguefsj or Tartar fubjeSs, it fhould be 
done by fending clergymen among them, not Ibl- 
diers ; and they added, with more fincerity than I 
expefted, that they found it was not fo much the con- 
cern of their monarch to make the people Chriftians, 
as it was to make them fubjeds. 

From this river to the great river Oby^ v^e croffed 
a wiM uncultivated country ; I cannot fay 'tis a bar-

beriaj where I continued fome time on the following 
occafion : — 

We had been now almoft feven months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace; 
whereupon my partner and I called a council about 
our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, 
confidering that we were bound for England^ and 
not for MofcoWj to confider how to difpofe of our- 
felves. They told us of fledges and rein deer to 
carry us over the fnow in the winter-time j and, in- 
deed, they have fuch things, .as it would be incredi. 
ble to relate the particulars of, by which means the 
Ruffians travel more in the winter than they can in 
fummer ; becaufe in thefe fledges they are able to 
run night and day : the fnow being frozen, is one 
univerfal covering to nature, by Vhich the the hills^ 
the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all fmooth, and 
hard as a fl:one ; and they run upon the furface, 
without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occafion to pufli at a winter journey 
of this kind ; I was bound to England^ not to Mof^ 
cowy and my route lay two ways : either I muft go 
on as the caravan went, till I canje to jfarijlawj and 
then go off weft for Narva, and the gulph of Fin- 
land, and fo either by fea or land to Dantzick, where 
I might pofllibly fell my China cargo to good advan- 
tage, or I muft leave the caravan at a little town on 
the Dwina, from whence I had but fix days by wa-

of fliipping, either to England, Hollandy or Ham^

able vifits. It was talking one night with a certain 
prince, one of the baniflied miiiifters of ftate be- 
longing to the czar of Mufcovy^ that my talk of my 
particular cafe b^gan. He had been telling me abun* 
dance of fine things, of the greatnefs, the magni- 
ficence, and dominions^ and the abfolate power of 
the emperor of the Riiffians. I interruptejl him, and 
told him, I was a greater and more powerful prince 
than ever the zcar of Mufcovy was, though my do- 
minions were not fo large, or my people fp many. 
The Rtijfflan grandee looked a little furprized, and 
fixing his eyes fteadily upon me, began to wonder 
what I meant. 

I told him his wonder would ceafe when I ha4 
explained myfelf. Fir ft, I told him„ I had the ab^ 
folute difppfal of the lives and fortunes of all my 
fubjefts : That notwithftanding my abfplute power, 
I had not one perfon difaffedled to niy government 
or to my perfon, in all my doniinions. He fhook 
his head, at that, and faid, There, indeed, I out^did 
the czar of Mufcovy. I told him, that all the lands 
in my kingdom were my own, and all my fubjecis 
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will ; that 
they would all fight for me to the laft drop ; and 
that never tyrant, for fuch I acknowledged myfelf to 
be, was ever fo univerfally beloved, and yet fo hor- 
ribly feared, by his fubje£ts. 

After amufing them with thefe riddles in go- 
vernment for a while, I opened the cafe, and told 
them the ftory at large of my living in the ifland, 
and how I managed both myfelf and the people there 
that were under me, juft as I have fince minuted it 
down. They were exceedingly taken with the ftory, 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOS* 345 

and efpecially the prince, who told me with a figh, 
that the true greatnefs of life was to be mafter of 
ourfelves ; that he would not have changed fuch a 
flate of life as mine, to have been czar of Mufcovy ; 
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
feemed to be baniflied to there, than ever he found 
in the higheft authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his mafter the czar : that the heighth of human wif- 
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum- 
ftances, and to make a calm within, under the 
weight of the greateft ftorm without. When he 
came firft hither, he faid, he ufed to tear the hair 
from his head, and the clothes from his back, as 
others had done before him ; but a little time and 
confideration had made him look into himfelf, as 
^ well as round himfelf, to things without : that he 
found the mind of man, if it was but once brought 
to reflefl: upon the ftate of univerfal life, and how 
little this world was concerned in its true felicity, 
was perfeflily capable of making a felicity for itfelf, 
fully fatisfying to itfelf, and fuitable to its own beft 
ends and defires, wjth but very little afliftance from 
the world ; that air to breathe in, food to fuftain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercife, in order 
to health, compleated, in his opinion, all that the 
world could do for us : and though the greatnefs, 
the authority, the riches, and the pleafures, which 
fome enjoyed in the world, and v^rhich he had en- 
joyed his fhare of, had much in them that was agree- 
able to us, yet he obferv^d, that all thofe things 
chiefly gratified the coarfeft of our affeftions ; fuch 
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, 
pur yanity, and our fenfualityj all which were, 

indeed.

indeed, the mere produft of the ward part of man, 
were in themfelves crimes, and had in them the feeds 
of all manner of crimes ; but neither were related to 
or concerned with, any of thofe virtues that confti- 
tuted us wife men, or of thofe graces which diftin- 
guifhed us as Chrijiiam : that being now deprived of 
all the fancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the full 
exercife of all thofe vices, he faid, he was at leifure 
to look upon the dark fide of them, where he found 
all manner of deformity ; and was now convinced, 
that virtue only makes a man truly wife, rich, and 
great, and preferves him in the way to a fuperior 
happinefs in a future ftate ; and in this, he faid, 
they were more happy in their banifhment, than all 
their enemies were, who had the full poffeffion of all 
the wealth and power that they (the baniflied) had 
left behind them. 

Nor, Sir, faid he, do I bring my mind to this 
politically, by the neceflity of my circumftances, 
which fome call miferable ; but, if I know any thing 
of myfelf, I would not go back, no not though 
my mafter, the czar, fliould call me, and offer ta 
reinftate me in all my former grandeur; I fay, I 
would no more go back to it, than I believe my foul 
when it fhall be delivered from this prifon of the body 
and has had a tafte of the glorious ftate beyond life, 
would come back to the goal of flefli and blood it is 
now inclofcd in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt 
and grime of human affairs. 

He fpake this with fo much warmth in his temper, 
fo much earneftnefs and motion of his fpirits, which 
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident 
it was the true fenfe of his foul j and, indeed, ther^ 
was no room to doubt his fincerity. 

J told 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 34^ 

I told him, I once thought myfelf a kind of a 
monarch in my old ftation, of which I had given 
him an account, but that I thought he was not a 
monarch only, but a great conqueror ; for that he 
that has got a viftory over his own exorbitant de- 
fires, and has the abfolute dominion over himfelf, 
and whofe reafon entirely governs his will, is cer- 
tainly greater than he that conquers a city, But^ 
my lord, Md I, fhall I take the liberty to afk you a 
queftion ? With all my heart, faid he. If the door 
of your liberty was opened, faid I, would not you 
take hold of it to deliver yourfelf from this exile ? 

Hold, faid he, your queftion is fubtle, and re- 
quires fome ferious juft diftinftions to give it a fincere 
anfwer ; and V\\ give it you from the bottom of my 
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would 
move me to deliver myfelf from the ftate of banifli- 
ment, except thefe two : Firft, the enjoyment of my 
relations ; and, fecondly, a little warmer climate : 
but I proteft to you, that to go back to the pomp of 
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a mi- 
nifter of ftate ; the weaUh, the gaiety, and the plea- 
fures, that is to fay, follies of a courtier ; if my maf- 
ter fhould fend me word this moment,, that he reftores 
me to all he banifhed me from ; I proteft, if I know 
myfelf at all, I would not leave this wildernefs, thefe 
defarts, and thefe frozen lakes, for the palace of 
MofcoWf 

But, my lord, faid I, perhaps you not only are 
baniflied from the pleafures of the court, and from the 
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be- 
fore, but you may be abfent too from fome of the con- 
yeniencies of life ; your eftate, perhaps, confifcated, 

and 



348 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and your efFefts plundered ; and the fupplies left 
you here may not be fuitable to the ordinary demands 
of life. 

Ay, faid he, that is as you fuppofe rac to be, a lord, 
or a prince, &c. So, indeed, I am ; but you are 
now to confider me only as a man, an human crea- 
ture, not at all diftinguifhed from another ; and fo I 
can fuffer no want, unlefs I fhould be vifited with 
iicknefs and diftempers. However, to put the quef- 
tion out of difpute ; you fee our manner j we are in 
this place five perfons of rank ; we live perfeftly re- 
tired, as fuited to a (late of banifhment ; we have 
fomething refcued from the fliipwreck of our fortunes, 
which keeps us from the mere neceflity of hunting 
for our food ; but the poor foldiers who are here, 
without that help, live in as much plenty as we. 
They go into the woods, and catch fables and foxes ; 
the labour of a month will maintain them a year ; 
and as the way of living is not expenfive, fo it is not 
hard to get fufEcient to ourfelves : So that objeaion 
is out of doors. 

I have no room to give a full account of the mofl: 
agreeable converfation I had with this truly great 
man ; in all which he fliewed, that his mind was fo 
infpired with a fuperior knowledge of things, fo fup- 
ported by religion, as well as by a vaft fhare of wif- 
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as 
much as he had exprefTed, and that he was always 
the fame to the laft, as will appear in the ftory I am 
going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful 
winter I thought it to be ; the cold was fo intenfe, 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE- 349 

that I couM not fo much as look abroad without 
being wrapt in furs, and a malk of fur before my 
face, or rather a hood, with only an hole for breathy 
and two for fight. The little day-light we had, was, 
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five 
hours a day, and fix at moft ; only that the fnow 
lying on the ground continually, and the w^eathet^ 
being clear, it was never quite dark. Our horfes were 
kept (or rather ftarved) under-ground ; and, as, for 
our fervants (for we hired fervants here to look after 
our horfes and ourfelves), we had every now and then 
their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care of, left 
they fhould mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houfes 
being clofe, the walls thick, the lights fmall, and the 
glafs all double. Our food was chiefly the flefh of 
deer, dried and cured in the feafon; good bread 
enough, but baked as bifcuits j dried fifh of feveral 
forts, and fome flefli of mutton, and of buffaloes, 
which is pretty good beef. All the ftore of pro- 
vifion for the winter are laid up in the fummer, and 
well cured ; our drink was water mixed with aqua 
vitae inftead of brandy ; and, for a treat, mead inftead 
of wine j which, however, they have excellent good. 
The hunters, who ventured abroad all Weathers, fre- 
quently brought us in frefh venifon, very fat and 
good ; and fometimes bears flefh, but we did not 
much care for the laft. We had a good flock of tea, 
with which we treated our friends as above ; and, in 
a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all things 
confidered. 

It was now March^ and the days grown confider- 
ably longer, and the weather at leaft tolerable ; fo

350 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them 
over the fnow, and to get things ready to be going ; 
but my mcafures being fixed, as I have faid, for 
Arch-Angely and not for Mufcovy or the Balticky I 
made no motion, knowing very well, that the (hips 
from the fouth do not fet out for that part^ of the 
world till May or ^une ; and that if I was there at 
the beginning of Auguji^ it would be as foon as any 
fliips would be ready to go away ; and therefore, I 
fay, I made no hafte to be gone, as others did \ in a 
word, I faw a great many people, n^, all the tra- 
vellers, go away before me. It feems, every year 
they go from thence to Mo/cow for trade ; viz. to 
carry furs, and buy neceffaries with them, which 
they bring back to furnifh their fhops ; alfo others 
went on the fame errand to Arch-Angel ; but then 
they alfo, being to come back again above eight 
hundred miles, went all out before me. 

In fhort, about the latter end of May^ I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, 
it occurred to me, that feeing all thefe people were 
banlfhed by the czar of Mufcovy to Siberia^ and yet, 
when they came there, were at liberty to go whither 
they would ; why did they not then go away to any 
part of the world wherever they thought fit ? and I 
began to examine what fhould hinder them from 
making fuch an attempt. 

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that fubje£t with the perfon I have mentioned, who 
anfwered me thus : Confider, firft, faid he, the 
place where we are ; and, fecondly, the condition we 
are in ; efpecially, faid he, the generality of the 

people

peopk who ar€ banilhed hither- We are furrounded, 
laid he, with ftronger things than bars and bolts : 
OH the north fide is an unnavigable ocean, where fliip 
never failed, and boat never fwam ; neither, if we * 
had both, could we know whither to go with them. 
Every other way, faid he, we have above a thoufand 
miles to pafs through the czar's own dominions, and 
by ways utterly impaffable, except by the roads made 
by the government, and through the towns garrifoned 
by his troops ; fo that we could neither pafs undif- 
covered by the road, or fubfift any other way : fo 
that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was filenced, indeed, at once, and found that 
they were in a prifon, every jot as fecure, as if they 
had been locked up In the caftle of Mo/cow ; how- 
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might 
certainly be made an inftrument to procure the efcape 
of this excellent perfon, and that it was very eafy 
for me to carry him away, there being no guard over 
him in the country ; and as I was not going to Mof- 
cow^ but to Arch-Angel^ and that I went in the na- 
ture of a caravan, by which 1 was not obliged to lie 
in the ftationary towns in the defart, but could en- 
camp every night were I would, we might eafily 
pafs uninterrupted to Arch-Angel^ where I could im- 
mediately fecure him on board an EngliJJo or Dutch 
ftip, and carry him off fafe along with me ; and 
as to his fubfiftence, and other particulars, that 
ihould be my care, till he Ihould better fupply him- 
felf. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earneftly 

on me all the while I fpoke ; nay, I could fee in his 

very face, that what I faid put his fpirits into an ex-

ceeding ferment ; his colour frequently changed^ 
his eyes looked red, and his heart flutterfed, that it 
might be even perceived in his countenance j nor 
could he immediately anfwer me when I had 
done, and, as it were, expected what he would fay to 
it ; and after he had paufed a little, he embraced 
me, and faid, How unhappy are we ! unguided crea- 
tures as we are, that^^even our greateft ads of friend- 
fliip are made fnares jto us, and we are made tempters 
of one another ! My dear friend, faid he, your offer is 
fo fincere, has fuch kindnefs in it, is fo difmterefted 
in itfelf, and is fo calculated for my advantage, that 
I muft have very little knowledge of the world, if I 
did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the 
obligation I have upon me to you for it : But did 
you believe I was fincere in what I have fo often faid 
to you of my contempt of the world ? Did you be- 
lieve I fpoke my very foul to you, and that I had 
really maintained that degree of felicity here, that 
had placed me above all that the world could give 
me, or do for me ? Did you believe I was fincere, 
when I told you I would not go back, if I was re- 
called even to be all that once I was in the court, and 
with the favour of the czar my mafter ? Did you 
believe me, my friend, to be an honeft man, or did 
you think me to be a boafting hypocrite ?— Here he 
flopped, as if he would hear what I would fay ; but, 
indeed, I foon after perceived, that he flopped be- 
caufe his fpirits were in motion ; his heart was full 
of .flruggles, and he could not go on. I was, I con- 
fefs, aftonifhed at the thing, as well as at the man, 
and I ufed fome arguments with him to urge him tp 
fet himfelf free ; that he ought to look upon this as a 
2 door

door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
fummons by Providence^ who has the care and 
good difpofition of all events^ to do himfelf good, 
and to render himfelf ufeful in the world* 

He had by this time recovered himfelf. How do 
you know, fir, faid he, warmly, but that inftead of 
a fummons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another 
inftrument, reprefenting, in all the alluring colours, 
to me, the ihew of felicity as a deliverance, which 
may in itfelf be my fnare, and tend direclly to my 
ruin ? Here I am free from the temptation of return. 
ing to my former miferable greatnefs ; there I am 
not fure, but that all the feeds of pride, ambition, 
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my 
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, 
again overwhelm me j and then the happy prifoner, 
whom you fee now mafter of his foul^s liberty, Ihall 
be the miferable flave of his own fenfes, in the full 
poffeffion of all perfonal liberty. Dear Sir, let me 
remain in this bleffed confinement, banilhed from the 
crimes of life, rather than purchafe a Ihow of free- 
dom dX the expence of the liberty of my reafon, 
and at the expence of the future happinefs which 
now I have in my view, but fliall then, I fear, quick- 
ly lofe fight of; for I am but flefh, a man, a mere 
man, have paflions and affeftions as likely to poffefs 
and overthrow me as any man : O be not my friend 
and my tempter both together ! 

If I was furprifed before, I was quite dumb now, 
and flood filent, looking at him ; and, indeed, ad- 
mired what I faw ; the ftruggle in his foul was fo 

VoLt IL A a great, 



354 ^^^^ ^^-^ ADVEJ^TUkfiJ^ 

great, that though the weather was extremely coid^ 
It put him into a mod violent fweat, and I found he 
ivanted to give vent to his mind ; fo I faid a word ot 
two, that I would leave him to confider of it, and 
wait on him again ; and then I withdrew to my own 
iipartment. 

About two hours after, I heard fomebody at of 
near the door of the room, and I was going to open 
the door } but he had opened it, and come in : My 
dear friend, faid he, you had almdft overfet me, but 
I am recovered : do not take it ill that I do not clofe 
with your offer ; I affure you, it is not for want of 
a fenfe of the kindnefs of it in you ; and I come to 
tnake the moft fincere acknowledgement of it to you ; 
but, I hope, I have got the viftory over myfelf. 

My lord, faid I, I hope you are fully fatisfied, that 
you did not refift the call of Heaven. Sir, faid he, 
if it had been from Heaven, the fame j5ower would 
have influenced me to accept it ; but I hope, and am 
fully fatisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline 
it ; and I have an infinite fatisfaftion in the parting, 
that you fhall leave me an honeft man ftill, though 
not a free man. 

I had nothing to do but to acqulefce, and make 
profefiion to him of my having no end in it, but a 
lincere defire to ferve him. He embraced me very 
pailionately, and afTured me, he was fenfible of that, 
and fliould always acknowledge it ; and with that 
he offered me a very fine prefent of fables, too much 
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum- 
fiance? ; and I would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refufed. 

The 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 355 

The next morning I fent my fervant to his lord- 
ftiip, with a fmali prefent of tea, two pieces of China 
damafk, aiid four little wedges of japan gold, which 
did not all weigh above fix ounces, or thereabouts ; 
but were far fhort of the value of his fables, which 
indeed, when I came to Englatid^ I found worth near 
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and 
one piece of the damalk, and one of the pieces of 
gold, which had a fine ftamp upon it, of the Japan 
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, 
but would not take any more ; and fent word by my 
fervant, that he defired to fpeak with me» 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had paffed between us, and hoped I would not move 
him any more in that affair ; but that, fince I made 
fuch a generous offer to him, he alked me, if I had 
kindnefs enough to offer the fame to another perfon 
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great 
ihareof concern. I told him, that I could not fay I 
inclined to do fo much for any one but himfelf, for 
whom I had a particular value, and fhould have been 
,gladto have been the iuftrument of his deliverance; 
however, if he would pleafe to name the perfon to me, 
I would give him my anfwer, and hoped he would 
not be difpleafed with me, if he was with my anfwer* 
He told me, it was only his fon, who, though I had 
not feen, yet was in the fame condition with himfelf, 
and above two hundred miles from him, on the other 
fide the Oby ; but that, if I confented, he would 
fend for him. 

. I made no hefitation, but told him I would do it : 

I made fome ceremony in letting him underftand 

that it was wholly on his account ; and that feeing I 

A a 2 could

could not prevail on him, I would fhew my refpeiJ; 
to him by my concern for his fon : but thefe things^ 
are too tedious to repeat here. He fent away th^ 
next day for his fon, and in about twenty days he 
came back with the meffenger, bringing fix or feven 
horfes loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the 
whole, amounted to a very great value. 

His fervants brought the horfes into the town, 
but left the young lord at a diftance till night, when 
he came incognito into our apartment, and his 
father prefented him to me ; and, in fhort, we con- 
certed there the manner of our travelling, and every 
thing proper for the journey. 

I had bought a confiderable quantity of fables, 
black fox-lkins, fine ermins, and fuch other furs 
that are very rich ; I fay, I h^d bought them in 
that city for exchange for fome of the goods brought 
from China ; in particular, for the cloves and nut- 
megs, of which I fold the greateft part here; and 
the reft afterwards at Arch-Angel^ for a much better 
price than I could have done at London ; and my 
partner, who was fenfible of the profit, and whofe 
bufmefs, more particularly than mine, was merchan- 
dize, was mightily pleafed with our ftay, on account 
of the trafHc we made here. 

It was in the beginning of June when I left this 
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the 
world ; and, indeed, it is fo far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it fhould be much 
talked of. We were now come to a very fmall cara- 
van, being only thirty-two horfes and camels in all, 
and all of them paffed for mine, though my new 
gueft was proprietor of eleven of them* It was moft 

^ '''■ natural

natural alfo, that I fhould take more fervants with 
me than I had before, and the young lord paffed for 
my ftqward ; what great man I paffed for myfelf I 
Jknow not, neither did it concern me to enquire. 
We had here the worft and the largeft defart to pafs , 
over that we met with in all the journey; indeed I 
call it the worft, becaufe the way was very deep in 
fome places, and very uneven in others ; the beft we 
had to fay for it, was, that we thought we had no 
troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they 
never came on this fide the river Oby^ or at leaft but 
very feldom } but we found it otherwife. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Mufcovite 
fervant, or rather a Siberian fervant, who was per- 
fedly acquainted with the country ; and who led us 
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the 
principal towns and cities upon the great road, fuch 
ds Tumeuy Soloy Kamajkoy^ and feveral others j be- 
caufe theM^^ci;/*/^ garrifons, which are kept there,are 
very curious and ftrid in their obferyation upon tra- 
vellers, and fearching left any of the baniflied perfons 
of note ftiould make their efcape that way into Muf^ 
covy ; but by this means, as we were kept out of the 
cities, fo our whole journey was a defart, and we 
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when 
we might have had good accommodation in the cities 
on the way : this the young lord was fo fenfible of, 
that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we 
came to feveral cities on the way ; but lay abroad 
himfelf, with his fervant, in the woods, and met us 
always at the appointed places. 

We were juft entered Europe^ having paffed the

between Europe and Afia ; and the firft city on the 
European fide was called Soloy Kamojioy^ which is as 
much as to fay, the great city on the river, Kama / 
and here we thought to have feen fome evident alte- 
ration in the people, their manners, their habit, 
their religion, and their bufmefs ; but we were nuf*- 
taken ; for as we had a vaft defart to pafs, which, 
by relation, is near feyen hundred miles long in fome 
places, but not above two hundred miles over where 
we pafled it; fo, till we came paft that horrible, 
place, we found very little difference between that 
country, and the Mogul Tartary ; the people moftly 
Pagans J and little better than the favages oi America ;^ 
their houfes and towns full of idols, and their way 
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as 
above, • and the villages near them ; where they 
are Chrijiians^ as they call themfelves, of the Greek 
church ; but even thefe have their religion mingled 
with fo many reliques of fuperftitipn, that it is fcarce 
to be known in fome places from mere forcery and 
witchcraft. 

In paffing this fbreft, I thought, indeed, we muft, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, efca- 
ped, as before, have been plundered and robbed,- 
and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves ; of what 
country they were, whether the roving bands of the^ 
OJiiachiy a kind of Tartars^ or wild people on the' 
banks of the Oby^ had ranged thus far ; or whether 
they were the fable-hunters of Siberm^ I am yet at ^ 
lofs to know; but they were all on horfeback, 
carried bows and arrows, and were at firft about 
five-and-forty in number ; they came fo near to

US as within about two mufquet (hot ; and, aiking 
no queftions, they furrounded us with theii: horfe> 
and looked very earneftly upon us twice j at length 
they placed themfelves juft in our way ; upon which 
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being 
not above fixteen men in all ; and being drawn up 
thus, we halted, and fent out the Siberian fervant 
who attended his lord, to fee who they were j his 
mailer was the mor^ willing to let him go, becaufe 
he was not a little apprehenfive that they were a 
Siberian troop fent out after him. The man came 
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to 
th^m ; but though he fpoke feveral of their languages, 
or dialefts of iahguages rather, he could not under* 
. ftand a word they faid : however, after fome fign^ 
to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, fo 
he faid he underflood them to mean, oflfering to 
ihoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back 
no wifer than he went, only that by their drefs, 
he faid, he believed them to be fome Tartars, of 
Kalmuck^ or of the Circajjian hords ; and that there 
muft be more of them on the great defart, though 
he never heard that ever any of them were feen fo 
far north before. 

This was fmall comfort to us; however, we 
had no remedy: there was on our left hand, at 
about a quarter of a mile's diftance, a little grove 
or clump of trees, which flood clofe together, and 
very near the road; I immediately refolved we 
would advance to thofe trees, and fortify ourfelves 
as well as we could there; for, firfl, I confidered 
that the trees would in a great meafure cover us from 
jheir arrows ; and in the next place, they could not 
A a 4 come 



360 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

come to charge US in a body : it was, indeed, my 
ofd Fortuguefe pilot who propofejj it ; and who had 
this excellency attending him, namely, that he was 
always readieft and moft apt to direft and encourage 
us in cafes of the moft danger. We advanced im- 
mediately with what fpeed we could, and gained 
that little wood, the Tartars^ or thieves, for we 
knew not what to call them, keeping their ftandj 
and not attempting to hinder us. "When we came 
thither, we found, to our great fatisfaftion, that it 
was a fwampy, fpringy piece of ground, and, on 
the other fide, a great fpring of water, which, 
running out in a little rill or brook, was a little far- 
ther joined, by another of the like bignefs ; and was, 
in fhort, the head, or fource of a confiderable river, 
called afterwards the Wirtjka^ The trees which grew 
about this fpring, were not in all above two hundred, 
but were very large, and flood pretty thick ; fo that 
as foon as we got in, we faw ourfelves perfedly fafe 
from the enemy, unlefs they alighted and attacked 
us on foot. 

But to make this more difficult, our Fortuguefe^ 
with indefatigable application, cut dow great arms 
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite 
off, from one tree to another ; fo that he made a con- 
tinued fence almofl: round us. 

We ftaid here, waiting the motion of the enemy 
fome hours, without perceiving they made any offer 
to ftir ; when about two hours before night, they 
came down direftly upon us ; and, though we had 
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by 
fome more of the fame, fo that they were near four-

fcore horre, whereof, however, we fencied fome wer^ 
women. They came in till they were within half a 
ihot of our little wood, when we fired one mufqiiet 
without ball, and called to them in the Ruffian tongue, 
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; 
but, as if they knew nothing of what we faid, they 
came on with a double fury direftly up to the wood- 
fide, not imagining we were fo barricaded, that they 
could not break in : our old pilot was our captain> 
as well as he had been our engineer ; and defired 
of us, not to fire upon them till they came within 
piftol (hot, that we might be fure to kill ; and that . 
when we did fire, we Ihould be fure to take good 
aim. We bade him give the word of command ; 
which he delayed fo long, that they were, fome of 
them, within two pikes length of us when we fired. 

We aimed fo true (or Providence direfted our 
fliot fo fure) that we killed fourteen of them at the 
firfl: volley, and wounded feveral others, as alfo 
feveral of their horfes ; for we had all of us loaded our 
pieces with two or three bullets a piece, at leaft. 

They were terribly furprifed with our fire, and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from 
us ; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and, 
feeing them keep that diftance, we fallied out, and 
caught four or five of their horfes, whofe riders, 
we fuppofed, were killed ; and coming up to the 
dead, we could eafily perceive they were Tartars^ 
but knew not from what country, or how they came 
to make an excurfion fuch an unufual length. 

About an hour after, they made a motion to at- 
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to 
fee where elfe they might break in j but finding us 

always

5ilways ready to face them, they went off iagain, 
andiwe refolved not to ,ftir from the place for that 
night. 

We flept a little, you may be fure ; but fpent the 
moft part of the night in ftrengthening our fituation, 
and barricading the entrances into the wood ; and,, 
keeping a (Irifl; watch, we waited for day-light, and, 
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome difco- 
very indeed : for the enemy, who we thought were 
difcouraged with the reception they had met with, 
were now increafed to no lefs than thiee hundred, 
and had fet up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as 
if they were refolved to befiege us j and this little 
camp they had pitched, was upon the open plain, at 
about three quarters of a mile from us. We were in- 
deed furprized at this difcovery ; and now, I confefs, I 
gave myfelf over for loft, and all that I had. The 
lofs of my efFeds did not lie fo near me (though 
they were very confiderable) as the thoughts of 
falling into the hands of fuch barbarians, at the 
latter end of my journey, after fo many difEculties 
and hazards as I had gone through ; and even in 
fight of our port, where we expefted fafety and de- 
liverance. As for my partner, he was raging : he 
declared, that to lofe his goods would be his ruin ^ 
and he would rather die than be ftarved ; and he 
was for fighting to the laft drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flefh fhewed 
itfelf, was for fighting to the laft alfo ; and my old 
pilot was bf the opinion we were able to refift them 
all, in the fituation we then were in : and thus we 
fpent the day in debates of what we ihould do ; 
but tow^ards evening, we found that the number of 

our 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 'iG'l 

€)^xt enemies ftill increafed: perhaps, as they were 
abroad in feveral parties for prey, the firft had fent 
gut fcouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of 
their booty,; and we did not know but by the morn- 
ing they might ftill be a greater number; fo I 
began to enquire of thofe people we had brought 
jfrom Toboljki^ if there was no other, or more pri- 
vate ways, by which we might avoid them in the 
n^ght, and pprhaps, either retreat to fome town, or 
get help to guard us over the defart. 

The Siberian^ who was fervant to the young lord, 
told us, if we defigned to avoid them, and not fight, 
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a 
way that went north towards the river Petraz^ by 
which he made no doubt but we might getaway, 
and the Tartars never the wifer ; but he faid, his lord 
had told him he would not return, but would rather 
chufe to fight. I told him, he miftook his lord ; 
for that l|e was too wife a man to love fighting for 
the fake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave enough 
by what he had (hewed already ; but that his lord 
knew better than to defire to have feventeen or 
eighteen men fight five hundred, unlefs an unavoida- 
ble neceflity forced them to it ; and that if he thought 
it poffible for us to efcape in the night, we had no- 
thing elfe to do but to attempt it. He anfwered, if 
his lord gave him fuch order, he would lofe his life 
if he did not perform it. We foon brought his lord 
to give that order, though privately, and we imme- 
diately prepared for the putting it in pradice. 

And firft, as foon as it began to be dark, we 
^ndled a fire in our little camp, which we kept 

burning, 



364 ^'^^ ^^^ ADVENTURES 

burning, and prepared fo as to make it burn all 
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were ftiU 
there ; but, as foon as ir was dark, that is to fay, 
. fo as we could fee the liars, (for our guide would 
not ftir before) having all our horfes and camels 
ready loaded,^ we followed our new guide, who, I 
foon found, (leered himfelf by the pole, or north 
ftar, all the country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter ftill ; not that it was quite dark 
all night, but the moon began to rife, fo that, in 
fhort, it was rather lighter than we wilhed it to be ; 
but by fix o'clock next morning, we were gotten 
near forty miles, though the truth is, we alniofl: 
fpoiled our horfes. Here we found a Rujftan village, 
named Kirmazinjkoy^ where we refled, and heard 
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that day. About 
two hours before night we fet out again, and tra- 
velled till eight the next morning, though not quite 
fo haflily as before ; and about feven o'clock we 
pafled a little river, called Kirtza^ and came to a goo4 
large town inhabited by Ruffians^ and very popu- 
lous, called Ozcmys : There we heard, that feveral 
troops, or herds of Calmucks had been abroad upon 
the defart, but that v/e were now completely out of 
danger of them, which was to our great fatisfaftion, 
you may be fure. Here we were obliged to get fome 
frefh horfes, and having need enough of reft, we; 
ftaid five days ; and my ^partner and I agreed to give 
the honeft Siberian^ who brought us hither, the va- 
lue of ten piftoles for his conducing us. 

In five days more we came to VeuJJtma^ upon the 
river Witzogda^ which running into the river Dwinay

'Vft were there very happily near the end of our tra- 
vels by land, that river being navigable in feven 
days paffage to Arcb- Angel : from hence we came to 
Lawrenjkoy^ where the river joins, the third of July ; 
and provided ourfelves with two luggage-boats, and 
a barge, for our convenience. We embarked the fe- 
venth, and arrived all fafe at Arch-Angel the eigh- 
teenth, having been a year, five months, and three 
days on the journey, including our flay of eight 
months and odd days at Toboljki. 

We were obliged to flay at this place fix weeks for 
the arrival of the fhips, and mufl have tarried longer, 
had not a Hamburgher come in above a month fooner 
than any of the EngUjh fhips ; when, after fome con- 
fideration, that the city of Hamburgh might happen 
to be as good a market for our goods as London^ we 
ail took freight with him ; and having put our goods 
on board, it was mofl natural for me to put my 
(leward on board to take care of them ; by which 
means my young lord had a fufHcient opportunity to 
conceal himfelf, never coming on fhore again in 
all the time we flaid there ; and this he did, that he 
might not be feen in the city, where fome of the 
Mofcow merchants would certainly have feen and 
difcovered him. 

We failed from Arch-Angel the twentieth of Au- 
guji the fame year ; and, after no extraordinary bad 
voyage, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of 5^^- 
iember : here my partner and I found a very good 
fale for our goods, as well thofe of China^ as the 
fables, &c. of Siberia ; and dividing the produce of 
our effeds, my fhare amounted to 3475I. 17s. 3d.

had included, in this, about 600L worth of diamonds, 
which I had purchafed at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe^ in order to go to the court of 
Vienni^ where he refolved to feek proteftion, and 
where he could correfpond with thofe of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the teftimonies he could give, of grati- 
tude for the fervice I had done him, and his fenfi? 
of my kindnefs to the prince his father.

Hamburghj I came from thence over land to the 
Hague J where I embarked in the packet, and arrived 
in London the loth of January^ ^7^5^ having been 
gone from Engla7id ten years and nine months. 

And here, refolving to hatrafs myfelf no more, I 
am preparing for a longer journey than all thefe, hav- 
ing lived feventy-two years a life of infinite, variety, 
and learned fufficiently to know the value of re- 
tirement, and the blefling-of ending our days ia

THE 



LIFE OF DE FOE. 



IT IS lamented by thofe who labour the fields of 
Britifli biography, that after being entangled in 
briars they are often rewarded with the fcanty pro- 
dufts of barrennefs. The lives of literary men are 
generally paffed in the obfcurities of the clofet, 
which conceal even from friendly inquiries the arti - 
fices of ftudy, whereby each may have rifen to emi- 
nence. And during the fame moment that the dili- 
gent biographer fets out to alk for information, with 
regard to the origin, the modes of life, or the vari- 
ous fortunes of writers who have amufed or in- 
ftrufted their country, the houfe-keeper, the daugh. 
ter, or grand-child, that knew connexions and tra- 
ditions, drop into the grave. 

Thefe reflexions naturally arofe from my inquiries 
about the life of the Author of The History of 
THE Union of Great Britain; and of The 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Whether 
he were born on the neighbouring continent, . or in 
this ifland ; in London, or in the country ; was 
equally uncertain* Arid whether his name were 
Foe, or De Foe, was fomewhat doubtfuL Like 
Bb2 Swift, 



^yt THE LIFE OF DE FOE. 

Swift, he had perhaps, reafons for concealing what 
would have added little to his confequence. It is 
at length known, with fufficient certainty, that our 
author was the fon of James Foe, of the parifli of 
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, Citizen and But- 
cher. The concluding fentiment of The True-born 
EngHjhman^ we now fee, was then as natural as it 
will ever be juft : 

Then, let us boaft of anceftors no more. 
For, fame of families is all a cheat; 
^Tis perfonal virtue only makes us great. 

If we may credit the Gazette, Daniel Foe, orDc 
Foe, as he is faid by his enemies to have called 
himfelf, that he might not be thought an Englilh- 
man, was born in London *, ^bout the year 1663, 
His family were probably Diffenters f , among whom

* It IS at laft difcovered, by fearching The Chamberlain* s books, 
which have fince been burnt, that our author was the fon of James 
Foe, of the parifh of Cripplegate, London, Citizen and Butcher i 
who was himfelf the fonof Daniel Foe, of Elton, in the county 
of Northampton, Yeoman ; and who obtained his Freedom by 
ferving his apprenticefhip with John Levit, Citizcii and Butcher. 
Daniel Foe, the fon of James, was admitted to hts Freedom by hirlhy 
on the 26th of January, i687-8» I was led to thefe difcoveries 
by obferving that De Foe had voted* at an eledlion for a Repre- 
Tentative of London ; whence I inferred, that he muft have been 
a citizen either by birth or fervice. But in the parifh books I -« 
could find no notice of his baptifm ; as his parents were Dif- 
fcnters. 

f In his Preface to ** Mere Reformation^" De Foe complains. 
That fome DifTenters had reproached him, as if he had faid, 
<* that the gallows and the gallies ought to be the penalty of go- 
ing to the conventicle ; forgetting, that I muft dcfign to have my 
father^ my mnfe^ fix innocent children, and myfclf put into the fame 
condition. To fuch DifTenters I can only regret," fays he, " That 

when

he received no unlettered education ; at leaft it is 
plain, from his various writings, that he was a 
zealous defender of their principles, and a ftrenuous 
fupporter of their politics, before the liberality of 
our rulers in church and ftate had freed this conduft 
from danger. He merits the praife which is dnh 
to fincerity in manner of thinking, and to unifor- 
mity in habits of afting, whatever obloquy may have 
been caft on his name, by attributing writings to 
him, which, as they belonged to others, he was 
ftudious to difavow. 

Our Author was educated at a diflenting academy, 
which was kept at Newington- Green by Charles 
Morton. He 'delights to praife *^ that learned gen-, 
tleman*,'* whofe inftruftive leflbns he probably en- 
joyed from 1675 to 1680, as a mafter, who taught 
nothing either in politics, or fcience, which was 
dangerous to monarchial government, or which 
was improper for a diligent fcholar to know. 
Being in 1705 accufed by Tutchin of illiterature, 
De Foe archly acknowledged, " I owe this juftice 
to my ancient father, who is yet living, and in 
whofe behalf I freely teftify, that if I am a blockhead, 
it was nobody's fault but my own ; he having 
fpared nothing that might qualify me ta match 

the accurate Dr. B or the moft learned 

Tutchint.'' 

when I had drawn the pidlure, I did not, like the Dutclimah 
with his naan and bear, write under them — This is the man; and 
this is the bear,*' De Foeexprefsly admits, that he was a dis- 
senter, though no independent y ffth'monarchy man^ or leveller*

374 'THE LIFE OF DE T0t4 

De Foe was born a writer, as other men are born 
generals and ftatefmen: and when he was not twenty- 
one, he publifhed, in 1683, a pamphlet againft a 
very prevailing fentiment in favour of the Turks, as 
oppofed to the Auftrians ; very juftly thinking, as 
he avows in his riper age, that it was better the 
Popifh Houfe of Auftria fhould ruin the Proteftants 
in Hungary, than the infidel Houfe of Ottoman 
Ihould ruin both Proteftants and Papifts, by over- 
running Germany *. De Foe was a man who would 
fight as well as write for his principles : and before 
he was three-and-twenty he appeared in arms for 
the Duke of Monmouth, in June 1685. Of thi^ 
exploit he boaftsf in his latter years, when it 
was no longer dangerous to avow his participation 
in that imprudent enterprife, with greater men of 
fimilar principles. 

Having efcaped from the dangers of battle, and 
from the fangs of Jt..ery8, De Foe found complete 
fecurity in the more gainful purfuits of peace. Yet, 
he was prompted by his zeal to mingle in the con- 
troverfies of the reign of James 2d, whom he effi- 
cacioufly oppofed, by warning the Diffenters of the 
fecret danger of the infidious tolerance, which was 
oftered by the monarch's bigotry, or by the minif- 
ter's artifice. When our Author coUefled his writ- 
ings, he did not think proper to republifh either his 
trafl: againft the Turks, or his pamphlet againft the 
King. 

De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London 
on the 26th of January, 1687 — 8; when, being al- 
lowed his freedom by birth, he was received a mena- 

* Appeal, p. 51. t AppcaL

bsr of that eminent corporatloii. As he had en- 
deavoured to promote the revolution by his pen and 
his fword, he had the latisfaftion of partaking, 
ere long, in the pleafures and advantages of that great 
event. During the hilarity of that moment, the Lord 
Mayor of London a(ked King William to partake of 
the city feaft on the 29th of Oftober, 1689. Every ^ 
honour was paid the Sovereign of the people's choice. 
A regiment of volunteers, compofed of the chief 
citizens, and commanded by the celebrated Earl of 
Peterborough, attended the King and Queen from 
Whitehall to the Manfion Houfe. Among thefe 
troopers, gallantly mounted, and richly accoutred, 
was Daniel De Foe, if we may believe Oldmixon *. 
While our author thus difplayed his zeal, and 
courted notice, he is faid to have afted as a . holier 
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill : but the hofier f and 
the poet are very irreconcileable charaders. With 
the ufual imprudence of fuperior genius, he was 
carried by his vivacity into companies who were 
gratified by his wit. He fpent thofe hours with a 
fmall fociety for the cultivation of polite learning, 
which he ought to have employed in the calculations 
of the counting-houfe: and being obliged to abfcond 
from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attri-

tfiat he never was a hofier,, or an apprentice^ but admits that hp 
had been a Trader. [Reyiew, vol. ii. p. 149.] Oldmixon, who 
never fpeaks favourably of De Foe, allows that he had never been 
a merchant otherwife than peddling a little to Portugal. Hift.

buted thofe misfortunes to the war, which were prcf-^ 
bably owing to his own mifconduft. An angry 
creditor took out a commifGon of" bankruptcy^ 
which was foon fuperfeded on the petition of thofe 
to whom he was moft indebted, who accepted a 
compofition oh his fingle bond. This he pundu- 
ally paid by the efforts of unwearied diligence^ 
But fome of thofe creditors, who had been thus 
fati^fied, falling afterwards into diftrefs themfelves, 
De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claims j 
being then in rifmg circumftances from King Wil- 
liam's favour *. This is fuch an example of ho«- 
nefty, its it would be unjuft to De Foe and to the 
world to conceal. Being reproached in 1705 by 
Lord Haveriham with mercenarinefe, our author 
feelingly mentions 5 " How, with a numerous fa-' 
mily, and no helps but his own induftry, he had 
forced his way with undifcouraged diligence, through 
a fea of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, ex- 
clufive of compofition, from feventeen thoufand to 
lefs than five thoufand pounds -[-.'* He continued 
to carry on the pan-tile works near Tilbury-fort '^ 
though probably with no great fuccefs- It was af- 
terwards farcaftically faid, t/jot he did noi^ like the 
Egyptians^ require bricks without Jiraw^ but, like the 
yews, required bricks without paying his labourers^ 
He was born for other enterprifes, which, if they 
did not gain him opulence, have conferred a renown^

guage wherein his works are written^

powers of pleafing, who did not, with the ufual in- 
ftability of friendftiips, defert him afnidft his diftref- 
fes. They offered to fettle him as a faftor at Cadiz, 
where, as a trader, he had fome previous correfpond- 
ence. In this fituation he might have procured bu- 
finefs by his care, and accumulated wealth without 
a rifque : but, as he affures us in his old age. Pro- 
vidence^ which had other work for him to do^ placed 
afecret averjion in his mind to quitting England. He 
had confidence enough in his own talents to think, 
that on this field he could gather laurels, or at leaft 
gain a livelihood. 

In a projeBing age^ as our Author denominates 
King William's reign, he was himfelf a projeftor. 
While he was yet young, De Foe was prompted by 
a vigorous mind to think of many fchemes, and to 
offer, what was moft pleafing to the ruling powers, 
ways and means for carrying on the war. He wrote, 
as he fays, many jheets about the coin ; he propofed 
a regifter for feamen, long before the a6l of Parlia- 
ment was thought of; he projected county banks and 
factories for goods ; he mentioned z propofal for a 
commijfton of inquiries into bankrupts ejiates ; he con- 
trived a penjion-office for the relief of the poor. At 
length, in January 1696^^ — 7, he publiihed his EJfay 
upon ProJ€£ls ; which he dedicated to Dalby Tho- 
mas, not as a Cpmmiflioner of glafs duties, under 
whom he then ferved, or as a friend, to whom he 
acknowledges obligations ; but as to the moft pro- 
per judge on the fubjeft. It is always curious to 
trace a thought, in order to fee where it firft origi- 
nated, or how it was afterwards expanded. Among 
other projeds, which fhew a wide range of know- 
ledge.

ledge, he fuggefts to King William the imitation of 
Lewis 14th, in the eftablifhment of a fociety ** for 
encouraging polite learning, for refining the Eng- 
lifli language, and for preventing barbarifms of 
manners/' Prior offered in 1700 the fame proje6l 
to King William, in his' Carmen Seculare ;. Swift 
mentioned in 17 10 to Lord Oxford a propofal/or 
improving the Englijh tongue ; and Tickell flatters 
himfelf in his Profpe6l of Peace ^ that our daring lanr 
guage — ^all /port no more in arbitrary found. How- 
ever his projeds were taken, certain it is, that when 
De Foe ceafed to be a trader^ he was, by the inter- 
pofition of Dalby Thomas probably, appointed in 
1695, ciccomptant to the Commiflioners for manag- 
ing the duties on glafs ; who, with our Author 
ceafed to aft, on the firft of Auguft, 1699, when 
the tax was fuppreffed by ad of Parliament *. 

From projefts of ways and means^ De Foe's ar- 
dour foon carried him into the thorny paths of fa- 
tiric poetry; and his mufe produced, in January 
1 700 — I , The True-born Engliflonmn. Of the origin 
of this fatire, which was the caufe of much good for- 
tune, but of fome difafters, he gives himfelf the fol- 
lowing account:—-" During this time came out 
an abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verfe, written 
by one Mr. Tutchin, and called The Foreigners : in 
which the Author, who he was I then knew not, 
fell perfonally upon the King, then upon the Dutch 
nation, and, after having reproached his Majefty 
with crimes that his word enemies could not think 
of without horror, he fums up all in the odious 
name of Foreigner. This filled me with a kind 
of rage againft the book, and gave birth to a trifle, 

* lo-ii Wm.IIL ch. i8. 

which 



CHARLES 2d — GEORGE 2d. 379 

¥?hich I never could hope fhould have met with fo 
general an acceptation/* The fale was prodigious, 
and probably unexampled; as Sacheverel's trial had 
not then appeared. The True-born Englijhman was 
anfwered, paragraph by paragraph, in February 
1700 — I, by a writer, who brings hafte to apo- 
logize for dulnefs. For this Defence of King 
William and the Dutch, which was doubtlefs circu- 
lated by detradion and by power, De Foe was 
amply rewarded. " How this poem was the occa- 
fion,'* fays he, " of my being known to his Ma- 
jefty; how I was afterwards received by him; how 
employed abroad; and how, above my capacity of 
deferving, rewarded, is no part of the prefent cafe.** 
Of the particulars, which the Author thus declined 
to tell, nothing now can be told. It is only certain, 
that he was admitted to perfonal interviews with the 
King, who was no reader of poetry ; and that for 
the Royal favours De Foe was always grateful. 

When '* the pen and ink war was raifed againft 
a {landing at my,** fubfequent to the peace of Ryf- 
wick, our Author publiftied An Argument, to 
prove that a {landing army, with confent of Parlia- 
ment, is not inconfi{lent with a free government. 
" Liberty and property,** fays he, '' are the glo- 
rious attributes of the Engli{h nation; and the 
dearer they are to us, the lefs danger we are in of 
lofing them : but 1 could never yet fee it proved, 
that the danger of lofmg them by a fmall army was 
fuch, as we {hould expofe ourfelves to all the world 
for it. It is not the King of England alone, but 
the fword of England in the hand of the King, that 
gives laws of peace and war now to Europe : and

bis hand in time of peace, bid the faire{l of all men

firous of reading this treatife on an interefting topic^ 
will meet with ftrength of argument, conveyed in 
elegant language. 

When the nation flamed with faftion, the Grand 
Jury of Kent prefented to the Commons, on the 8th 
of May 1701, a petition, which defired them-^- 
'*' to mind the public bufmefs more, and their pri- 
vate heats lefs ;" and which contained a fentimeUt, 
rfiat there was a defign, as Burnet tells, other coun- 
ties and the city of London fhould equally adopt. 
Meflrs. Gulpeppers, Polhill, Hamilton, and Ch?imp- 
neys, who avowed this intrepid paper, were com- 
mitted to the Gatehoufe, amid the applaufes of their 
countrymen. It was on this occafion that De 
Foe*s genius diflrated a Remonfl:rance, which was 
figned Legion^ and which has been recorded in hif- 
tory for its bold truths and feditious petulance. De 
Foe's zeal induced him to aflume a woman's drefs^ 
while he delivered this factious paper to Harley, 
the Speaker, as he entered the Houfe of Commons*. 
It was then alfo that our Author, who was tranfported 
by an equal attachment to the country and the 

* Mr. Polhill, *of Cheapftead-place, in Kent, wbofe fether, 
Mr. David Polhill, was comniitted to the Gatehoufe, and thereby 
gained great popularity, was fo good as communicate to me 
the curious anecdote of De Foe's drefling himfelf in women's 
clothes, and prefenting the Legion Paper to the Speaker* De 
Foe fays himfelf in his Original Power of the People^ p, 24 i 
** This is evident from the tenor and yet undifcovered original 
of the Legion Paper ; the contents of which had fo much plain 
truth of fad ; 2Lnd. which I could give a better hiftory 0/*, if it were 
needfuL^^ When De Foe republifhed his works in 1703, he 
thought it prudent to expunge this paffage, that too plainly 
pointed out the real htftory of the Legion. Paper ^ which is not men- 
tioned by the Commons Journals,

court, publifhed Thf Orighial Power of the colledive 
Body of the People of England^ examined and affertedU 
This rimeful treatife he dedicated to King William, 
in a dignified ftrain of nervous eloquence. " It is 
not the lead of the extraordinaries of your Majefty's 
charafter/' fays he, " that, as you are King of 
your people, fo you are the people's King ; a title, 
which, as it is the moft glorious, fo it is the mod 
indifputable.'* To the Lords and Commons he ad- 
dreffes himfelf in a fimilar tone : The vindication of 
the original right of all men to the government of 
themfelves, he tells them, is fo far from being a de- 
rogation from, that it is a confirmation of their legal 
authority. Every lover of liberty muft be pleafed 
with the perufal of a treatife,* which vies with Mr. 
I^ocke^s famous tra£l in powers of reafoning, and is 
fuperior to it in the graces of ftyle. 

At a time when '' union and charity, the one 
relating to our civil, and the other to our religious 
concerns, were ftrangers in the land,'* De Foe pub- 
Uflied The Freeholder's Plea againji Stockjobbing Elec-^ 
iions of Parliament Men^ '' It is very rational to 
fuppofe,'' fays our Author, " that they who will buy 
will fell ; or, what feems more rational, they who 
have bought mufl felW This is certainly a perfuafive 
perforpiance, though we may fuppofe, that many 
voters were influenced then by arguments ftill 
more perfuafive. And he concludes with a fentiment, 
which has not been too often repeated. That nothing 
can make us formidable to our neighbours, and 
maintain the reputation of our nation, but unioQ 
among ourfelves. 

How much foever King William may have been 
pleafed with The True-born Englijhman^ or with 

other 



382 THE LI^E OF DB WE. 

Other fervices, he was little gratified probably by our 
Author's Reafons againji d War with France. This 
argument, Jhewing that the French King^s owning the 
Prince of Wales as -King of Englandy is no fufficiertt 
ground of a War^ is one of the fineft, becaufe it is 
one of the moft ufcful, trafts in the Englilh lan- 
guage* After remarking the univerfal cry oftbepeo-^ 
pie for war^ our Author declares he is not againft 
war with France, provided it be on juftifiable 
grounds ; but, he hopes, England will nevei: be fo 
inconfiderable a nation, as to make ufe of difhoneft 
pretences to bring to pafs any of her defigns : and ■ 
he wiflies that he who defires we Ihould end the 
war honourably^ ought to defire alfo, that we begin it 
fairly. " But if we muft have a war,** our Author 
hoped, " it might be wholly on the defenfive in 
Flanders, in order to carry on hoftilities in remote 
places, where the damage may be greater, by wound- 
ing the Spaniard in feme weaker part ; fo as upon a 
peace he Ihall be glad to quit Flanders for an equi- 
valent.'* Who at prefent does not wifh that De 
Foe*s argument had been more ftudioufly read, and 
more efficacioufly admitted ? 

A fcene of forrow foon after opened, which pro- 
bably embittered our Author's future life. The 
death of King William deprived him of a proteftor, 
who, he fays, trufted, efteemed, and much more 
valued him than he deferved ; and who, as he flattered 
himfelf amidft his later diflreflTes, would never have 
fuffered him to be treated as he had been in the 
world. Of that monarch's memory, he fays, that 
he never patiently heard it abufed, nor ever could 
do fo : and in this gratitude to a Royal benefaftor 
there is furely much to praife, but nothing to blame.

. In the midft of that furious conteft of party, civil 
and religious, which enfued on the stcceflion of 
Queen Anne, our Author was no unconcerned 
fpedator. He reprinted his Enquiry into the Occa-- 
ftonal Conformity of Dijfentersj which had been pub- 
liflied in 1697, with a dedication to Sir Humphrey 
Edwin, a Lord Mayor, who having carried the 
regalia to a conventicle, gave rife to fome wit in 
The Tale of a Tub, and occafioned fome claufes in 
an aft of Parliament. De Foe now dedicated his 
Enquiry to John How, a diffenting minifter, of whom 
Anthony Wood fpeaks well. Mr. How did not 
piuch care, fays Calamy *, to enter upon an argu- 
ment of that nature with one of fo warm a temper as 
the author of that Enquiry^ and contented himfelf 
with publifhing fome Conftderations on the Preface of 
an Enquiry concerning the occafional Conformity of 
Diffenters. De Foe's pertinacity foon produced a 
reply. He out-laughs and out-talks Mr. How, who 
had provoked his antagonift's wrath by perfonal far- 
cafms, and who now thought it hard that the old 
Ihould be fhoved off the ftage by the young. De 
Foe reprobates, with the unforbearance of the 
times, " this faft and loofe game of religion ;'* for 
which he had never met with any confiderable ex- 
cufe but this, " that this is no conformity in point 
of religion, but done as a civil aftion." He foon 
after publifhed another Enquiry^ in order to fhew, 
that the Dijfcnters are no ways concerned in occafional 
conformity. The controverfy, which in thofe days 
occafioned fuch vehement contefts between the t\vo 
Houfes of Parliament, is probably filenced for ever.

hepublifbed towards the end of the year 1702 ; and 
which is a piece of cxquifite irony, though there 
are certainly paflages in it that might have fhewn 
confiderate men how much the Author had been

Jljould not have been perceived by all the town^ and thai 
not one man can fee it^ either churchman or dijfenter\ 
This is one of the ftrongeft proofs, how much the

tefy to all miftaken people, who, it feems, have not

the world with the genuine meaning of the paper^ 
which he hopes may allay the anger of Government,

defign to inflame and divide us.'* Neither his fub* 
miffivenefs to the ruling powers, nor his generofity 
to his printers, was a fufficient fliield from the re- 
fentment of his enemies* He was found guilty of a 
libel, fentenced to the pillory, and adjudged to be 
fined and imprifoned. Thus, as he acknowledges, 
was he a fecond time ruined ; and by this affair, as 
he aflerts, he loft above £2^500 fterling, which 
confifted probably in his brick works and in the more 
abundant produfl: of his pen. 

When, by thefe means, immured in Newgate, our 
Author confoled himfelf with the animating reflec- 
tion, that having meant well he unjuftly fuffered. 
He had a mind too aftive to be idle in the folitude 
of a prifon which is feldom invaded by vifitors.

^ The Review pointed the way to the Tatlers, Spec- 
tators, and Guardians, which may be allowed how- 
ever to have treated thofe interefting topics with 
more delicacy of humour, more terfenefs of ftyle, 
and greater depth of learning ; yet, has De Foe 
many paffages, both of profe and poetry, which, few: 
refinement of wit, neatnefs of expreffion, and effi- 
cacy of moral, would do honour to Steele or to 
Addifon. Of all this was Johnfon unconfcious, when 
he fpeaks of the Tatlers and Speftators as the firft 
Englifh writers who had undertaken to reform either 
the favagenefs of neglefl:, or the impertinence of 
civility ; to fhew when to fpeak, or to be filent j how 
to refufe, or how to comply. 

In the midft of thefe labours our Author pubfifh- 
ed, in July 1704, The Storm; or, a colleflionof 
the moft remarkable cafualties, which happened ia 
the tempeft, on the 23d of November, 1703. In 
explaining the natural catifes of winds De Foe ihews 
more fcience, and in delivering the opinions of the an'- 
cients that this ijland was more fuhje6l to florfiis than 
other parts of the worlds he difplays more literature, 
than he has been generally fuppofed to poffefs. 
Our Author is moreover entitled to yet higher 
praife. He feized that awful occafion to inculcate 
the fundamental truths of religion ; the being of a. 
God, the fuperintendency of Providence, the cer* 
tainty of heaven and hell, the one to reward, the 
other to punifli. 

While, as he tells himfelf, he lay friendlefs 
in the prifon of Newgate, his family ruined, and

himfelf without hopes of deliverance, a meffage was 
brought him from a perfon of honour, whom till 
that time he had not the leaft knowledge of. This 
was no lefs a perfon than Sir Robert Harley, the 
Speaker of the Houfe of Commons. Harley ap- 
proved probably of the principles and condufl: of 
De Foe, and doubtlefs fprefaw, that, during a fac- 
tious age, fuch a genius could be converted to many 
ufes. And he fent a verbal meffage to the prifoner, 
defiring to know what he could do for him. Our Au- 
thor readily wrote the ftory of the blind man in the 
Gofpel; concluding — Lord^ that I may receive my 
fight. 

When the high-flyers were driven from the ftation 
which enabled them to inflame rather than conciliate, 
Harley became Secretary of State, in April i704. 
He had now frequent opportunities of reprefenting 
the unmerited fufterings of De Foe to the ^een and 
to the Treafurer ; yet, our Author continued four 
months longer in goal. The Queen, however, in- 
quired into his circumilances; and Lord Godol- 
phin fent, as he thankfully acknowledges, a confi- 
derable fum to his. wife, and to him money to pay 
his fine and the expence of his difcharge. Here is 
the foundation, fays he, on which he built his firft 
fenfe of duty to the Queen, and the indelible bond of 
gratitude to his firji henefa6lor. '^ Let any one fay, 
then/' he aflcs, " what I could have done, lefs or

m the viciffitude of party, had been pcrfecuted by 
faftion, and overpowered, though not conquered, 
by violence. 

Such vras the high interpofitimi by which De Foe 
was relieved from Newgate, in Auguft 1704. In 
order to avoid the town-talk, he retired immediately 
to St. Edmund'S Bury : but his retreat did not pre- 
vent perfecution. Dyer, the news-writer^ propa- 
gated that De Foe had fled from juftice. Fox, the 
bookfeller, publi(h.ed that he had deferted his 
fecurity. Stephen, a ftate-meffenger, every where 
faid, that he had a warrant for feizing him. 
This I fuppofe was wit, during the witty age of. 
Anne. In our duller days of law, fuch out-, 
rages would be referred to the judgment of a Jury. 
De Foe informed the Secretary of State where he 
was, and when he would appear ; but he was told 
not to fear, as he had not tranfgreffed. Notwithftand- 
ing this vexation, our Author-s mufe produced, on 
the 29th of Auguft 1704, A Hy?nn to ViSlory^ when 
the fuccefsful fkill of Marlborough furniflied our 
poets with many occafions to publifli Gazettes in 
flhyme. 

De Foe opened the year 1704— -5 with his Double 
welcome to the Duke of Marlborough ; difclaiming any 
expectation of place or penfion. His encomiaftic 
ftrains, I fear, were not heard while he wrote, 
like an honed Englifliman, againfl the continuance 
of the war- — a war indeed of perfonal glory, of na- 
tional celebration, but of fruitlefs expence. De 
Foe*s adtivity, ar his needs, produced in March 
J 705, The Confolidator ; or, Memoirs of Sundry 
Tranfaftions, from the world in the moon. It was

flew. In the lunar language he applies his fatiric 
file to the prominences of every character : of the 
poets, from Dryden to Durfy; of the wits, from Ad- 
difon to Prior ; of the metaphyficians, from Mai- 
branche to Hobbs ; of the free- thinkers, from Afgyl 
to the Tale of a Tub. Our author continually com-» 
plains of the ill ufage of the world ; but with all his 
acutenefs he did not advert, that he who attacks the 
world, will be by the world attacked ^ He makes the 
lunar politicians debate the policy of Charles XII. in 
purfuing the Saxons and Poles, while the Mufco.. 
vites ravaged his own people, I doubt whether it 
were on this occafion that the Swedilh Ambaflador 
was fo ill-advifed as to complain agajnft De Foe, for 
merited ridicule of a futile warfare. They had not 
then difeovered, that the beft defence againfl the 
fhafts of fatire is to let them fly. Our Author's fen-- 
timent was expanded by Johnfon, in thofe energetic 
lines, which thus conclude the charafter of the 
Swedijh Charles ; 

*' Who left the name, at which the worM grew pale, 
^^ To point a moral, or adorn a tale." 

De Foe was fo little difturbed by the appearance 
of The Moon Calf or accurate refledtions on the 
Confolidator, that he plunged into a controverfy with 
Sir Humphrey Maekworth about his hiWfor employ- 
ing the poor. This had been pafled by the Com-* 
mons, with great applaufe, but received by the 
Peers with fuitable caution. De Foe, confidering 
this plauftble projed as an indigejied chaos ^ reprefented 
it, thiough feveral reviews, as a plan which would

Tuin the induftrious, and thereby augment the poor. 
Sir Humphrey endeavoured to fupport his work* 
houfes, in every parifh, with a parochial capital 
for carrying on parochial manufadiure. This drew 
from De Foe his admirable treatife, which he en* 
titled Giving alms no charity* As an Englijh Free-^ 
holder he claimed it as a right to addrefs his per- 
formance to the Houfe of Commons, having a par** 
ticular intereft in the common good j but, confider- 
ing the perfons before whom he appeared, he laid 
down his archnefs, and aflumed his dignity. He 
maintained, with wonderful knowledge of faft and 
power of argument, the follovnng pofitions : i ft. That 
there is in England more labour than hands to perform 
it; and confequently a want of people, not of em- 
ployment: — 2dly, No man in England, of found 
limbs and fenfes, can be poor merely for want of 
work: — 3dly, All workhoufes for employing the 
poor, as now they are employed, ferve to the ruin 
of families and the increafe of the poor: — 4thly, 
Jt is a regulation of the poor that is wanted, not a 
fetting them to work. Longer experience ihews 
this to be a difficult fubjeft, which inqreaf^s in dif- 
ficulty with the effluxion of time. 

De Foe had fcarcely difmiffed Sir Humphrey, 
when he introduced Lord Haveriham, a peer, who 
is famous in our ftory, as a maker andpublifher of 
fpeeches. His Lordfliip publifhed his fpeech on the 
ftate of the nation in 1705, which was cried about 
the town with unufual earneftnefs. Our Author's 
prudence induced him to give no anfwer to the 
/peech ; but a pamphlet, which was hawked about 
the ftreets and fold for a penny, our Author's 
jQurewdnefs confidered as a challenge to every reader. 



CHARLES 2d GEORGE 2d. 39$ 

He laughed and talked fo much, through feveral Re- 
views^ about this factious eflfufion, as to provoke a 
defence of topics, which his Lordfnip ought neither 
to have printed nor fpoken. De Foe now publifhed 
a Reply to Lord Haverjham^s vindication of his Speech. 
During fuch battles the town never fails to cheer the 
fmaller combatant. Our Author, with an allufion 
to the biography of both, fays farcaftically : " But, 
fate that makes footballs of men, kicks fome up 
fiairs, and fome down ; fome are advanced without 
honour^ others fupprejfed without infamy ; fome are 
raifed without merits fome are crujhed without a crime ; 
and no man knows by the beginning of things, whe* 
ther his courfe ihall iffue in a peerage or a pillory J* 

In the midft of thefe difputes, either grave or lu- 
dicrous, De Foe publifhed Advice to all Parties. He 
ftrenuoufly recommends that moderation and for-* 
bearance, which his opponents often remarked he 
was not fo prone to practice as to preach. While 
he thus gave advice to all parties, he conveyed many 
falutary leffons to the Diffenters, whom he was 
jealous to defend. In the Review, dated the 25th 
pf December 1705, he conjures them for God*s. 
fake, if not for their own fake, to be content. ** Are 
there a few things more you could wifh were done 
for -you ? refolve thefe wiflies into two conclufions :

induced him to colled: fonie loofe pieces^ held good, 
fays he, for proceeding to a fecond volume, " that

laments the fcandalous liberty of the prefs; whereby 
piratic printers deprive an author of the native pro- 
duft of his own thought, and the purity of his own 
ftyle. It is faid, though perhaps without authority, 
that the vigorous remonftrances of De Foe procured 
The"*" Ad for the encouragement of learning, by vejiing 
the copies of printed books in the authors or their ajjigns. 
The vanity of an adminiftratlon, which affecked 
to patronize the learned, concurring with the mu- 
tual intereft of bookmakers and bookfellers, pro-? 
duced this falutary law, that our Author alone had 
called for without fuccefs. De Foe's writings, thus 
coUefted into volumes, were foon a third time 
printed, with the addition of a key* The fatire be- 
ing now pointed by the fpecification of charafters, 
and obfcurities being illuminated by the annexation 
of circumftances, a numerous clafs of readers were 
induced, by their zeal of party, or defire of fcan- 
dal, to look for gratification from our Author's 
treatifes. He is ftudious to complain. That hi^ writ-

whatever nature, led him to Exeter, and other weft- 
^rn towns, in Auguft, September, and Oftober, 
J 705, a projefl: was formed to fend him as a foldier 
to the army, at a time when footmen were taken 
from the coaches as recruits: but confcious of his 
being a Freeholder of England, and a Liveryman of 
London, he knew that fuch charaders could not be 
violated, in this nation, with impunity. When fome 
of the Weftern Juftices, of more zeal of party thaa 
fenfe of duty, heard from his opponents of De Foe's 
journey, they determined to apprehend him as a 
vagabond : but our Author, who, among other qua- 
lities, had perfonal courage in a high degree, reflefted, 
that to face danger is moft effeftually to prevent it. 
In his abfence, real fuits were commenced againft 
him for fiftitious debts : but De Foe advertifed, that 
genuine claims he would fairly fatisfy. If all thefe 
uncommon circumftances had not been publiflied 
in The Review^ we ihould npt have feen this ftriking 
pifture of favage manners. So much more free are 
we at prefent, that the Editor of a newfpaper, how- 
ever obnoxious to any party, may travel peaceably 
about his affairs over England, without fear of in- 
terruption. Were a Juftice of Peace, from what- 
ever motive, to offer him any obftrudtion, fuch a 
magiftrate would be overwhelmed by the public in- 
dignation, and punifhed by the higher guardians of 
pur quiet and our laws. 

De Foe began the year 1706 with A Hymn U

ment joining in one addrefs to the Queen. On

396 THE LIFE OF DE FOE. 

National Prejudices again/i an Union with Scotland. 
A few weeks after he gave the world a fecond effay, 
to foften rancour and defeat perverfity. But the 
time was now come, when he was to perform what 
he had often promifed : and his fruitfulnefs produced 
in July 1706, Jure Divinoy a fatire againft tyranny 
and paflive obedience, which had been delayed, for 
fear^ as he declares, of parliamentary cenfure. Of 
this poem, it cannot be faid, as of Thomfon's L/- 
berty^ that it was written to prove what no man ever 
denied. This fatire, fays the preface, had never 
been publifhed, though fome of it has been a long 
time in being, had not the world feemed to be go- 
ing mad a fecond time with the error of pajjive obedi^ 
ence^ and non-rejijiance. And becaufe fome men 
require, fays he, more explicit anfwers, I declare 
my belief, that a monarchy, according to the pre-. 
fent conftitution, limited by Parliament, and depend^ 
ent upon law^ is not only the beft government in the 
world, but alfo the beft for this nation in par- 
ticular, moft fuitable to the genius of the people, 
and the circumjiances of the zvhole body. Drydeu 
had given an example, a few years before,' of ar- 
gumentative poetry in his Hind and Panther; 
by which he endeavoured to defend the tenets of the 
Church of Rome. Our author now reafoned in 
rhyme, through twelve books, in defence of every 
man^s birth-right by nature, when all forts of liberty 
were run down and oppofed. His purpofe is doubt- 
lefs honefter than Dryden's ; and his argument, be- 
ing in fupport of the better caufe, is perhaps fuperior 
in ftrength : but in the Jure Divino we look in 
vain for 

The varying verfe, the^full-refounding line, 
. The long majeftic march, and energy divine.

Our author was foon after Engaged in more im# 
portant, becaufe much more ufeful, bufmefs. Lord 
Godolphin, who knew how to difcriminate charac- 
ters, determined to employ him on an errand, 
which, as he fays, was far from being unfit for a 
Sovereign to direft, or an honeft man to perform. 
By his Lordfhip he was carried to the Queen, who 
faid to him, while he kiffed her hand*, thaijhe had 
fuch fatisfadlion in his former fervicesj that Jhe had 
again appointed him for another affair^ which was 
fomething nice^ but the treafurer would tell him the 
reji. In three days he was fent to Scotland. His 
knowledge of commerce and revenue, his powers of 
infinuation, and above all his readinefs of pen, were 
deemed of no fmall utility in promoting the Union. 
He arrived at Edinburgh, in Odober 1706. And 
we fliall find him no inconfiderable aftor in the 
performance of that greateft of all good works. He 
attended the committees of Parliament, for whofe 
ufe he made feveral of the calculations f on the fub- 
jeft of trade and taxes. He complains |, however, 
that when afterwards fome clamour was raifed upon 
the inequality of the proportions, and the contrivers 
began to be blamed, and a little threatened aAa-mob^ 
then it was D. F. § made it all, and he was to be 
ftoned for it. He endeavoured to confute || all that

his fhare x>f danger^ fince, as he fays, he was 
watched by the mob ; had his chamber windows 
infulted ; biit, by the prudence of his friends, and 
God's providence, he efcaped *. In the midft of 
this great fcene of bufmefs and tumult^ he collefted 
the documents, which he afterwards publiflied for

the moft diiEcuItj and, at the fame time, the moft; 
fortunate, tranfaftions, in our annals* 

During all thofe labours and rifques, De Foe pub-i 
liflied, in December 1706, Caledonia^ a Poem, in 
honour of the Scots nation. This poetic effay^ 
which was intended to refcue Scotland from Jlander 
in opimon^ Caledonia herfelf bade him dedicate td 
the Duke of Queenfberry. Befide Ather benefac*

calls Daniel De Foe, Efqiiirei an exclufive privilege 
to fell his encomiaftic ftrains for feveii years, with-

in writing them, but the known author, D. F. On 
the 1 6th of January, the a£t of Union was paffed

to London, in February 1706-7. While he thus 
afted importantly at Edinburgh, he formed con-f

nexions with confiderable perfons, who were proud 
of his future correfpondence, and profited from his 
folitical interejis *. 

How our Author was rewarded by the minifters who 
derived a benefit from thofe fervices, and from that 
danger, as he does not tell, cannot now be known. 
Before his departure for Scotland, indeed. Lord 
Godolphin, as he acknowledges f, obtained for 
him the continuance of an appointment, which her 
Majefty, by the interpofition of his firft benefaftoi*, 
had been pleafed to make him, in confideration of d 
former fervice, in a foreign country^ wherein he rurl 
as much rifque as a grenadier on the counter-fcarp. 
As he was too prudent to difclofe \mfecret fervices^ 
they muft at prefent remain undifcovered. Yet is 
there reafon to think that he had a penfion rathef 
than an office^ fmce his name is not in the red book of 
the Queen ; and he folemnly avers, in his Appeal^ 
that he had not intereft enough with Lord Oxford 

• Lord Euchan was fo obliging as to communicate the fubjoined 
c^Ltradt of a letter to his Lordfhip's grandfather, the Earl of

fo procure him the arrears due to him in the time of ihei 
former Minijlry. This appointment^ whatever it were^ 
he is ftudious to tell, he originally owed to 
Harley: he, however, thankfully ackiiowIedge% 
that Lord Godolphin continued his favour to him 
after the unhappy breach that feparated his firft be- 
nefador from the Minifler, who continued in power 
till Auguft 1710. 

The nation, which was filled with combuftible 
matter, burft into flame the moment of that memo- 
rable feparation, in 1707. In the midft of this 
conflagration our Author was not inaftive. He 
waited on Harley after he had been driven from 
power, who generoufly advifed him to continue bis 
fervices to the ^een^ which hefuppofed would have no 
relation to perfonal differences among Jiatefmen. Go-^ 
dolphin received him with equal kindnefs, by fay- 
ing — I always think a man honeji till I find to the 
contrary. And if we may credit De Foe's aflevera- 
tions, in the prefence of thofe who could have con* 
viQ:ed him of falfehood, he for three years held no 
correfpondence with his principal benefactor ^ which thi 
great man never took ill of him. 

As early as February 1706 — 7, De Foe avowed 
his purpofe to publifh the Hiftory of the Union, which 
he had ably aflifted to accompliih. This defign he 
executed in 1709, though he was engaged in other 
lucubrations, and gave the world a Review three 
times a week. His hiftory feems to have been 
little noticed when it firft appeared; for, as the 
preface ftates, it had many difficulties in the way ; 
many faftions to encounter, and parties to pleafe. 
Yet it was republifhed in 17 1 2 ; and a third time in 
1786, when a fimilar union had become the topic

of public debate and private converfation- The 
fubjeft of this work is the completion of a meafure, 
which was carried into eiffeft, notwithftanding ob- 
ilrudions apparently infurmountable, and tumults 
approaching to rebellion, and which has produced the 
ends defigiied j beyond expeftation, whether we confuier 
its influence on the Government^ or its operation on the 
governed. The minutenefs with which he defcribes 
what hefaw and heard 09 the turbulent ftage, where he 
aQ:ed a confpicuous part, is extremely interefting to 
us, who wifli to know wliat aftually paffed, however 
this circumftantiality may have difgufted contenipo- 
raneous readers. Hiftory is chiefly valuable as it 
tranfmits a faithful copy of the inanners ^ndi fenttments 
of every age. This narrative of De Foe is a drama, 
in which he introduces the highefl peers and the 
lowefl: peafants, fpeaking and afting, according as 
they were each actuated by their charaderifticp^flTionsj 
and while the man of tafte is amufed by his manner^ 
the man of bufmefs may draw inftruffioh from the 
documents^ which are appended to the end, and in- 
terfperfed in every page. This publication had alone 
preferved his name, had his Crufoe pleafed us lefs. 

De Foe publiftied in 1 709, what indeed required 
lefs efibrt of the intelleQ: or the hand. The Hijiory of 
Addrejfes ; with no defign, he fays, and as we may 
believe, to difturb the public peace, but to com- 
pare the prefent tempers of men with the paft, in 
order to difcover who had altered for the better, and 
who for the worfe. He gave a fecond volume of Ad- 
drefles in 171 1, with remarks ferious and comical. 
His purpofe plainly was to abate, by ridicule, the 
public fervour with regard to Sacheverel, who, by 

Vol. IL Dd I know 



402 THE LIFE OJ^ DE FOE# 

I know not what fatality, or folly, gave rife to 
eventful changes. De Foe evinces, by thefe timeful 
publications, that amidft all that enthufiafm and 
tumult, he preferved his fenfes, and adhered to his 
principles. 

When, by fuch imprudence as the world had never 
feen before, Godolphin was in his tura expelled, in 
Auguft 1 7 1 o, our Author waited on the ex-minifter ; 
who obligingly faid to him, .That he had the fame 
good-will^ but not the fame power to ajfifl him : and 
Godolphin told him, what w>is of more real ufe—— 
to receive the ^een^s commands from her confidential 
fervants^ when hefaw things fettled^ It naturally oc- 
curred to De Foe, that it was his duty to go along 
with the Minifters, while, as he fays, they did not 
break in on the conftitution. And who can blame 
a very fubordinate officer, (if indeed he held au 
office), who had a wife and fix children to maintain 
with very precarious means ? He was thus, fays he, 
caft back providentially on his firfl: benefaftor, wha 
laid his cafe before her Majefty, whereby he preferved 
his intereft, without any engagement. On that me- 
morable change De Foe however fomewhat changed 
his tone. The method I fhall take, fays he*, in talking 
of the public affairs, fhall for the future be, though 
with the fame defign to fupport truth, yet with more 
caution of embroiling myfelfwith a party, who have 
no mercy, and who have no fenfe of fervice* 

De Foe now lived at Newington, in comfortable 
circumflances, publifhing The Reviews^ and fend- 
ing out fuch trafts, as either gratified his prejudices, 
gr fupplied his needs- During that contentious pe-

affifted by Doftor D'Avenant; but the latter folemnly 
denied it : and it foon after appeared to be the 
produdion of Daniel De Foe, an ambidextrous 
hireling, who for this dirty work received a large 
weekly allowance from the Treafury. That he wrote 
in the Mercator^ De Foe admits ; but he exprefsly 
denies ^ that he either was the Author of it, had 
the property of it, thie printing of it, the profit of it, 
or had the power to put any thing into it, if he 
would.*' And, by his Appeal, he affirms before 
God and the world, " that he never had any pay- 
ment, or reward, for writing any part of it/' Yet, 
that he was ready to defend thofe papers of the 
Mercator which were really his, if men would an- 
fwer with arguments, rather than abufe; though 
not thofe things which he had never written, but 
for which he had received fuch ufage. He adds, 
with the noble fpirit of a true-born Englifhman, 
*^ The prefs was open to me as well as to others ; 
and how, or when I loft my Englijh liberty of 
fpeaking my mind, I know not : neither how my 
fpeaking my opinions, without fee or reward, could 
authorife any one to call me villain, rafcal, traitor, 
and ifuch opprobrious names/* 

Of the imputed connexion with hhjirji benefactor ^ 
Harley, during that memorable period, our Author 
fpeaks with equal firmnefs, at a moment when firm- 
plainly mentioned in the fourth. Mr. I)aniel Foe may change 
his name from Review to Mercator^ from Mercator to any other 
iltUy yet ftill his fmgular genius fhall be diftinguifhed by his ini- 
initable way of writing. Thus perfonal farcafm was introduced 
to fupply deficience of fads, or weaknefs of reafoning. When 
Charles King republifhed The Brifijh Merchant in volumes, among 
various changes, he expunged, with other perfonalities, the name 
of De Foe.

nefs was neceffary. " I folemnly proteft," fays he, 
by his Appeal^ " in the prefence of Him who IhaU 
judge us all, that I have received no inftruftiong, 
orders, or diredions for writing any thing, or ma- 
terials from Lord Oxford, fmce Lord Godolphin 
was Treafurer, or that I have ever fhewn to Lord 
Oxford any thing I had written or printed/' 
He challenges the world to prove the contrary ; 
and he affirms, that he always capitulated for 
liberty to fpeak, according to his own judgment of 
things. As to confideration, penfion, or reward, he 
declares mod folemnly that he had none, except 
his old appointment made him long before by Lord 
Godolphin. "What is extremely probable we may 
ealily credit, without fuch ftrong affeverations. 
However Lord Oxford may have been gratified by 
the voluntary writings of De Foe, he had doubtlefe

Thomas Hanmer, as he would by no means be an occafion of a 
breach among friends. The Treafurer had other reafons: The 
treaty had been made by Bolingbroke, >vhom he did not love i

againft the peace of Utrecht, becaufe he approved 
pi it as little as he had done the treaty at Gertruy- 
.denburgh, under very different influences, a few 
years before. The peace he was for, as he himfelf 
fays, was fuch as fliould neither have given the 
Spanifli monarchy to the Houfe of Bpurbon, nor to 
theHoufe of Auftria; but thatthi§ bone of conten* 
lion fhould have been fo brpken to pieces, as that ijt 
ihould not have been dangerous to Europe ; and 
that England and Holjand Ihould have fo ftrengthr 
jened theinfelves, by fliaring its cqmmerce, as jDbould 
have made them no more afraid of France, or the 
Emperors and that all that we ihould conquer in the 
Spanifh Weft Indies Ihould be gur own. But it i^ 
equally true, he affirms, that when the peace wa? 
eftabliihed, ^' I thpughi our bufinefs was to make 
the beft of it ; and rather tp inquire >yhat improver 
ments cojald be made of it, than to be continually 
exclaiming againft thofe who procured it.*' 

He manfully avowed his opinion in 1 715, when 
it was both difgraceful and dangerous, that the 9th 
arlicle pf th^ Treaty of Commerce was calculated 
for the advantage of our trade ; " Let who will make 
it, that,*' fays he^ ^' is nothing to me. My reafons 
are, becaufe it tied up the French to open the door 
to our manufadures, at a ceftain duty of importation 
there, and left the ParliamenI; of Britain at liberty to 
fhut their-s out, by as high duties as they pleafed 
here, there being no limitation upon us, as to duties 
pn French goods, but that other nations ftiould pay 
the fame. While the French were thus bound, and 
the Britifh free, I always thought we muft be in a 
condition to trade to advantage, or it muft be our 
pwn fault : this was my opinion, and is iojiill; and

I wovtid engage to maintain it againft any niaDi, on a

venture my life upon the caufe, if I were affurisd of 
fair play in the difpute. But, that it was jny opi- 
;iion, we might carry on ;a trade with France! to our 
great advantage, and that ^e ought for that reafon 
to trade with them, appears in the third, fourth, 
fifth, and fixth volumes of The Reviews^ above nine 
years before The Mercator was thought of." Expe- 
rience has decided in favour of De Foe againft his 
opponents, with regard both to the theory and the 
praftice of commerce. 

In May 171 3, our Author relinquiflied the Re* 
njtewj after nine years continuance : in Newgate it 
began, and in Newgate it ended. Whether we 
confider the frequency of the publication, or the 
power of his difquifitions, the pertinacity of his op- 
ponents, or the addrefs of his defences, amid other 
ftudies, without afliftants, this muft be allowed to 
be fuch a work, as few of our writers have equal- 
led. Yet, of this great performance, faid Gay;

ever would be. But of all their works, which 
of them have been fo often Ikimmed, or yielded fuch 
cream, as Robinfon Crufoe^ the Fmnily InJlruBor^ or 
Religious Courtjloip ? Some of their writings may 
indeed be allowed to have uncommon merit ; yet, 
let them not arrogatQ exclufive excellence, or claim 
appropriate praife. 

When De Foe relinquiflied the Review^ he began 
to write A General Hijiory of Trade, which he pro- 
pofed to publifh in monthly numbers. The firft 
number appeared on the firft of Auguft 1713. His 
great defign was to fhew the reader, " What the whole 
world is at this time employed in as to TradeJ*' But 
his more immediate end was, to re£lify the mijlake we 
are fallen into as to Commerce, and to inform thofe 
who are willing to inquire into the truth. In the 
execution of this arduous undertaking, he avows his 
intention of fpeaking what reafon dictates and fafl: 
juftifies, however he may clalh with the popular 
opinions of fome people in trade. He could not 
however wholly abftradt himfelf from the paffing 
fcene. When his fecond number appeared, on the 
15th of Auguft 1713, he gave a difcourfe on the har- 
bour of Dunkirk ; wherein he infifts, that the port 
ought to be deftroyed, if it muft remain with France; 
but, if it were added to England, or made a free- 
port, it would be for the good of mankind to have a 
fafe harbour in fuch dangerous feas. This Hiftory 
of Trade, which exhibits the ingenuity, the ftrength, 
and the piety of De Foe, extended only to two num- 
bers. The agitations of the times carried him to 
other literary purfuits ; and the faftioufnefs of the 
times conftrained him to attend to perfonal fecurity,

fo much approved, by the zealous friends of the Pro-

them through the moft diftant counties. And De 
Foe protefts, that had the Eleftor of Hanover given 
him a thoufand pounds, he could not have ferved him 
more effeflually, than by writing thefe three trea- 
tifes. 

The reader will learn, with furprife and indigna- 
tion, that for thefe writings De Foe was irrefted, 
obliged to give eight hundred pounds bail, contrary 
to the Bill of Rights, and profecuted by informa-? 
tion, during Trinity term 1713. This groundIef$ 
profecution was inftituted by the abfurd zeal of 
"William Benfon, wiio afterwards becai^e ridicu- 
loufly famous for literary exploits, which juftly 
raifed him to the honours of the Dunciad. Our 
Author attributes this profecution to the malice of 
his enemies, who were numerous and powerful. 
No inconfiderahle people were heard to fay, that they 
knew the books were againft the Pretender, but that 
De Foe had difobliged them in other things, and

was prompted by confcioufnefs of innocence to defend 
himfelf int he Review dwrmg the profecution, which 
offended the Judges, who,beingfomewhatinfeQ:€d with

gate in Eafter term 1 71 3. He was however foonreleaf- 
ed on making a proper fubmiffion. But it was happy 
for De Foe that his^;;y? benefador was ft ill in power, 
whoprocured him the Queen's pardon, inNovember* 
1 7 13. This a6t of liberal juftice was produced by 
the party- writers f of thofe black and bitter days, as an 
additionalproof of Lord Oxford's attachment to the 
abdicated family, while De Foe was faid to be con- 
vifted of abfolute Jacobitifm, contrary to the tenor 
of his life, and the purpofe of his writings. He him- 
felf faid farcaftically, that they might as well have 
made him a Mahometan. On his tomb-ftone it 
might have been engraved, that he was the only 
Englifliman who had been obliged to alk a royal par- 
don, for writing in favour of the Hanover fucceffion.

treafonable defign to bring in the- Pretender wks

except in the affertions of thofe who wifhed toprcH 
mote their intereft by exhibiting their zeal. And 
I have fhewn, that De Foe had done more to keep 
out the Pretender, than the poUtical tribe, who pro- 
fited from his zeal, yet detraded from his fame.

the rage of men increafed upon me to that degree^ 
that their threats were fuch as I am unable to ex- 
prefs. Though I have written nothing fince the 
Queen's death ; yet, a great many things are called 
by my name, and I bear the anfwerers infults. I have 
not feen or fpoken viath the Earl of Oxford,'* con- 
tinues he, " fince the Bang's landing, but once ; yetj 
he beats the reproach of my writing for him, and I

deed to have been, at that noify period, flunned by 
factious clamour, and overborne, though not filenced^ 
by unmerited obloquy. He probably loft his original 
appointment, when his firft benefactor was finally ex- 
pelled. Inftead of meeting with reward for his 
zealous fervices in fupport of theProteftant fucceflion, 
he was on the acceffion of George I. difcountenanced 
by thofe who had derived a benefit from his aftive

of any other writer, that before he could finifh his 
Appeal, he was ftruck with an apoplexy. After 
languifhing more than fix weeks, neither able to go 
on, nor likely to recover, his friends thought fit to 
delay the publication no longer. '' It is the opinion 
of moft who know him,'* fays Baker, the publifher,' 
^^ that the treatment which he here complains of, 
and others of which he would have fpoken, have been 
the caufe of this difafter.*' When the ardent mind 
of De Foe reflefted on what he had done, and what 
he had fuffered, how he had been rewarded and per-^ 
fecuted, his heart melted in defpair. His fpirit, like 
a candle ftruggling in the focket, blazed and funk, 
and blazed and funk, till it ,difappeared in dark- 
nefs. 

While 



4l6 THE LIFE OF DS FOE/ 

While his ftrength remained, he expoftulated wit&l 
his adverfaries in the following terms of great man- 
linefs, and inftrudtive intelligence : — " It has been 
the difafter of all parties in this nation, to be very 
hot in their turn, and as often as they have been fo, 
I have differed with them all, and fhall do- fo. 
I will repeat fome of the occafions on the Whig fide, 
becaufe from that quarter the accufation of my turn- 
ing about comes. 

^ Thejirjl time I had the misfortune to differ with 
my friends, was about the year 168-3, whea the 
Turks were befieging Vienna, and the Whigs in 
England^ generally fpeaking, were for the Turks 
taking it; which I, having read the hiftory of the 
cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their 
wars, and how they had rooted out the name of the 
Chriftian religion in above three fcore and ten king, 
doms, could by no means agree with : and though 
then but a young man, and a younger author, I op- 
pofed it, and wrote againft it, which was taken 
very unkindly indeed. 

*' The next time I differed with my friends, was 
when King James was wheedling the Diffenters to 
take off the penal laws and teft, which I could by 
no means come into. 1 told the Diffenters, I had 
rather the Church of England fhould pull our clothes 
off by fines and forfeitures, than the Papifts Ihould 
fall both upon the Church and the Diffenters, and 
pull our fkins off by fire and faggot, 

" The next difference! had with good men, was about 
the fcandalous pradice of occafional conformity, in 
which I had the misfortune to make many honefl men 
angry, rather becaufe I had the better of the argu- 
ment, than becaufe they difliked what I faid.

it on ; they . would be friends indeed, if they would 
talk of taking^it off again. 

" Again^ I had a breach v/ith honed men for their 
male-treating King William, of which I fay nothing ; 
becaufe I think they are now opening their eyes, and 
making what amends they can to his memory. 

" The fifth difference I had with them, was about 
the treaty of partijtion, in which many honeft men 
were miftaken, and in which I toM them plainly 
then, that they would at lafl: end the war upon 
worfe terms ; and fo it is my opiriion they v;ouM 
have done, though the treaty of Q ertruydenburgh 
had taken place* 

" Thejxth time I differed with them, was when 
the old Whigs fell out with the modijrn Whigs; and 
when the Duke of Marlborough and my Lord Go- 
dolphin were ufed by the Obfervator in a manner 
worfe, I confefs, for the time it 1 afted, than ever 
they were ufed fince ; iiay^ though it were by Abel

ticulars with me, what real guilt I may have, I 
would freely acknowledge ; and if they would pro- 
duce any evidence of the bribes, the penfions, and 
the rewards I have taken, I would declare honeftly 
whether they were true or no. If they would give 
a lift of the books which they charge me with, and

Charles King re-publiilied The Briti/h Merchant ^ in 1 721, he with- 
out a fcruple attributed The Mercator to a hireling writer of a 
weekly paper called The Revieiv. And Anderfon, at a ftill later 
period, goes further in his Chronology of Commerce, and names 
De Foe, as the hireling writer of The MercatoTy and other papers 
in favour of the Frc:nch tr^ty of trade. We can now judge

With the fame independence of fpirit, but with 
greater modefty of manner, our Author openly dif- 
approved of the imtemperance, which was adopted 
by Government in 17 14, contrary to the original pur- 
pofe of George I. " It is and ever was my opi- 
nion," fays De Foe in his Appeal^ " that modera- 
tion is the only virtue by which the tranquillity of 
this nation can be preferved; and even the King 
himfelf, (I beUeve his Majefty will allow me that 
freedom,) can only be happy in the enjoyment of 
the crown, by a moderate adminiftration : if he 
ihould be obliged, contrary to his known difpofition, 
to join with intemperate councils, if it does not 
leffen his fecurity, I am perfuaded it will leffen his 
fatisfaftion. To attain at the happy calm, which is 
the confideration that fhould move us all, (and 
he would merit to be called the nation's phy-

the political teftament of De Foe ; which it had been

the living challenge, and the death-bed declaration of De Foe ; 
on the other, the mere furmife and unauthorifed affertion of 
King, Anderfon, and others, who detradl from their own vera-

rather by Roberts the bookfeller, than by De Foe 
the Author *. But the perfecutions. of party did 
not ceafe when De Foe ceafed to be a party-writen 
He was infulted by Boyer, in April 171 6, as the 
author of The Triennial Ad impartially Jiated : " but, 
whatever was ofl^ered/' fays Boypr, " againft the 
Septennial Bill, was fully confuted by the ingenious 
and judicious Jofeph Addifon, Efquire/* Whether 
De Foe wrote in defence of the people^s rights, or 
in fupport of the law's authority, he is to be cen- 
fured: whether Addifon defended the Septennial 
Bill, or the Peerage Bill, he is to be praifed. With 
the fame mifconception of the faft, and malignancy 
of fpirit, Tolland reviled -f De Foe for writing an 
. anfwer to 31&^ State Anatonty^ in 171 7. The time 
however will at laft come, when the world will 
judge of men from their actions rather than pre-

party ^writing. And from this eventful epoch, he ap-

harden the heart ; how to regulate, more than to 
vitiate, the praftice of life. 

Early in 17 15 he publiflied The Family InJlruBor^

iid, to mafters and fervants ; 3d, to hufbands and 
wives. He carefully concealed his authorfliip, left

was then too bufy to look immediately into the work. 
The bookfeller foon procured a recommendatory let- 
ter from the Reverend Samuel Wright, a well- 
known preacher in the Black-Friars. It was praifed 
from the pulpit and the prefs : and the utility of the 
end, with the attraftivenefs of the execution, gave 
it, at length, a general reception *. The Author's 
firfl: defign was to write a Dramatic Poem ; but the 
fubjefl: was too folemn, and the text too copious, to 
admit of reftraint, or to allow excurfions. His 
purpofe was to divert and injtrud:^ at the fame mo- 
ment; and by giving it a dramatic form, it has been 
called by fome A religious play.^ De Foe at laft faya 
with his ufual archnefs: As to its being called a play, 
be it called fo, if they pleafe : it muft be confeffed, 
fome parts of it are too much aded in many fami- 
lies among us. The Author wiflies, that either all 
cur Plays were as ufeful for the improvement and 
entertainment of the world, or that they were lefs 
encouraged. There is, I think, fome myjlicifm in 
the preface, which, it were to be defired, a judicious 
hand would expunge, when The Family lnJiru£lor 
{hall be again reprinted ; for, reprinted it will be, 
while our language endures ; at leaft, while wife men

422 THE LIFE OF DE FOE. 

De Foe afterwards added a fecond volume, in two 
parts ; ift, relating to Family Breaches; sdly, to the 
great Mi/lake^ of mixing the PaJJions in the managing of 
Children. He confidered it, indeed, as a bold adven^ 
ture to write a fecond volume of any thing ; there 
being a general opinion among modern readers, that 
fecond parts never come up to the fpirit of the firft. 
He quotes Mr. Milton, for differing from the world 
upon the queftion, and for affirming with regard to 
his own great performances, That the people had a 
general fenfe of the lofs of Par ad if e^ but not an equal 
gufl for regaining it. Of De Foe^s fecond volume, 
it will be eafily allowed, that it is as inftrudbive arid 
pleafing as the firft. His Religions Courtfhip^ which 
he publiftied in 1722, may properly be confidered as 
a third volume : For the defign is equally moral, the 
manner is equally attraftive, and it may in the fame 
manner be called a Religious Play. 

But the time at length came, when De Foe was 
to deliver to the world the moft popular of all his 
performances. In April 17 19, he publiflied the 
well-known Life and furprifing Adventures of Robin- 
fon Crufoe. The reception was immediate and univer-r 
fal ; and Taylor, who purchafed the mahufcript 
after every bookfeller had refufed it, is faid to have 
gained a thoufand pounds. If it be inquired by 
what charm it is that thefe furprifing Adventures 
Ihould have inftantly pleafed, and always pleafed, it 
will be found, that few books have ever fo natu- 
rally mingled amufement with inftruftion. The at* 
tention is fixed, either by the fimplicity of the nar- 
ration, or by the variety of the incidents ; the heart 
is amended by a vindication of the ways of God to 
man: and the underftanding is informed, by various 

examples. 



CHARLES 2d GEORGE 2d» 423 

examples, how much utility ought to be preferred to 
ornament : the young are inftrufted, while the old 

' are amufed. 

Robinfon Crufoe had fcarcely drawn his canoe 
afliore, when he was attacked by his old enemies, 
ihefavages. He was affailed firft by The Life and 

Jirange Adventures of Mr. D De F — , of London^ 

Hq/iery who has lived above Fifty Tears by hiinfelf in 
the Kingdoins of North and South Britain. In a dull 
dialogue between De Foe, Crufoe, and his man Fri- 
day, our Author's life is lampooned, and his mif- 
fortunes ridiculed. But he who had been ftruck by 
apoplexy, and who was now difcountenanced by 
power, was no fit objeft of an Englifhman's fatire. 
Our Author declares, when he was himfelf a writer 
of fatiric poetry, " that he never reproached any 
man for his private infirmities, for having his houfe 
burnt, his fhips caft away, or his family ruined ; nor 
had he ever lampooned any one, becaufe he could 
not pay his debts, or differed in judgment from 
him/* Pope has been juftly cenfured for purfuing 
a vein of fatire extremely diffimilar. And Pope 
placed De Foe with Tutchen, in The Dunciady when 
our Author's infirmities were greater and his com- 
fort lefs. He was again affauhed in 17 19, hy Jri 

Epifile to D De F—, the reputed Author of Ro-^ 

binfon Crufoe. " Mr. Foe," fays the letter-writer, 
*^ I have perufed your pleafant ftory of Robinfon 
Crufoe; and if the faults of it had extendea no fur- 
ther than the frequent folecifms and incorreftnefs of

lary critic, who renewed his angry attack when the 
fecond volume appeared, has ah the dulnefs, with- 
out the acumen, pf Dennis, and all his malignity, 
without his purpofe of reformation. The Life of 
Crufoe has pafled through innumerable editions, an4 
has been tranflated into foreign languages, while the 
criticifm funk into oblivion, 

De Foe fet the critics at defiance while he had 
the people on his fide. As a commercial legillator he 
knew, that it is rapid fale which is the great incen^ 
tive : and, in Auguft 17 19, he publifhed a fecond 
volume of Surprijing Adventures^ with fimilar fuc-* 
cefs. In hope of profit and of praife, he produced' 
in Auguft 1720, Serious Refiedions during the Life 
of Robinfon Crufoe ^ with his Vifton of the Angelic Wor/dn 
He acknowledges, that the prefent work is not 
merely the produ.ct of the two firft volumes, but the 
two firft may rather be called the produQ: of this ; 
the fable is always made for the moral, not the moral 
for the fable. He however did not advert, that inr 
ftruftion muft be infinuated rather than enforced. 
That this third volume has more morality than fable, 
is the caufe, I fear, that it has never b^e^i read with 
the fame avidity as the former two, or fpoken of with 
the fame approbation. We all prefer amufement to 
inftru&ion ^ and he who would inculcate ufeful 
truths, muft ftudy to amufe, or he will offer his 
leffons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor atten- 
tive. 

The tongue of detraflion is feldom at reft. It has 
often been repeated, that De Foe had furreptitioufly 
appropriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a 

Scotch 



CHARLES 2(3 GEORGE 2d. 425 

Scotch mariner, who having lived folitarily on the 
ifle of Juan Fernandez, four years and four months, 
was relieved on the 2d of February, 1708-9, by Cap- 
tain Woodes Rogers, in his cruizing voyage round the 
world. But let no one draw inferences till the fa£k 
be firft afcertained. The adventures of Selkirk had 
been thrown into the air, in 171 2, for literary 
hawks to devour * ; and De Foe may have catched a 

^ The whole ftory of Selkirk is told in Woodes Rogers's voyage, 
which he publiflied in 1712, from p. 125 to 131, inclufive : whence 
it appears, that Selkirk had preferved no pen, ink, or paper, and 
had loll his language ; fo that he had no journal or papers, which he 
could communicate, pr by others could be ftolen. There is an 
account of Selkirk in The Engltjhman^ No. 26. The particular 
manner how Alexander Selkirk lived four years and four months, 
in the ifle of Juan Fernandez, is related in Captain Cook's 
voyage into the South Sea, which was publiflied in 17 12. And 
.Selkirk's tale was told in the Memoirs of Literature, 5. vol, 
p. X18: fothat the world was fully poflefled of Selkirk's ftory in 
17 J2, feven years prior to the publication of Crufoe's adventures. 
Nor were his adventures fingular ; for, Ringrofe mentions, in his 
account of Captain Sharp's voyage, a perfon who had efcaped 
(ingly from a fliip that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and 
who lived alone five years before he was relieved : And Dam- 
pier mentions a Mofquito Indian, who having been accidentally 
left on this ifland, fubfifted three years folitarily, till that voyager 
carried him off. From which of thefe De Foe borrowed his great 
incident, it is not eafy to difcover. In the preface to The Se^ 
rious RefleBions^ he indeed fays, " That there is a man alive and 
well known, the adlions ofwhofe life arethe juft fubjeft of thefc 
volumes, and to whom the moft part of the ftory dire Aly alludes." 
This turns the fcale in favour of Selkirk. Nor, was the name of 
Crufoe wholly fiftitious ; for, among De Foe's contemporaries, 
JohnDunton fpeaksof Timothy Crufoe, who was called the Golden 
Preacher, and was fo great a textuary, that he could pray two 
hours together in fcripture language ; but, he was not arrived at 
perfedlion ; as appeared by his floth in tying the conjugal knot : 
yet, his repentance was fincere and public, and I fear not but he

common 



426 THE LIFE OF D£ FOE.' 

common prey, which he converted to the ufes of his 
intelled, and diftributed for the purpofes of his in- 
tereft. Thus he may have fairly acquired the fun- 
damental incident of Crufoe^s life ; but, he did not 
borrow the various events, the ufeful moralities, 
or the engaging ftyle. Few men could write fuch a 
poem ; and few Selkirks could imitate fo pathetic an 
original. It was the happinefs of De Foe, that as 
many writers have fucceeded in relating enterprifes 
by land, he excelled in narrating adyentures by fea, 
with fuch felicities of language, fuch attraftive vari- 
eties, fuch infinuative inftrudion, as have feldom 
been equalled, but never furpaffed. 

While De Foe in this manner bufied himfelf in 
writing adventures, which have charmed every 
reader, a rhyming fit returned on him. He pub* 
lilhedin 1720, The complete Art of Paintings which 
he did into Englijh from the French of Du Frefnoy. 
Dryden had given, in 1695, atranflation of DuFref- 
Iioy's poem, which has been efteemed for its know- 
ledge of the fifter arts. What could tempt De Foe 
to this undertaking it is not eafy to difcover, unlefs 
we may fuppofe, that he hoped to gain a few guineas, 
without much labour of the head or hand. Dryden 
has been juftly praifed for relinquifhing vicious ha- 
bits of compofition, and adopting better models 
for his mufe. De Foe, after he had feen the cor- 
reftnefs, and heard the mufic of Pope, remained 
unambitious of accurate rhymes, and regardlefs of 
fweeter numbers. His politics and his poetry, for 
which he was long famous among biographers, 
would not have preferved his name beyond the fleet- 
ing day; yet I fufpeft that, in imitation of Milton, he 
would have preferred his "Jure Divino to his Robin- 
fon Crufoe. 

De 



CHARLES 2d — GEORGE 2d. 427 

De Foe lived not then, however, in pecuniary 
diftrefs; for his genius and his induftry were to him 
the mines of Potofi: and in 1722, he obtained from 
the Corporation of Colchefter, though my inquiries 
have not difcovered by what interpofition, a ninety- 
nine years leafe of Kingfwood-heath, at a yeatly rent 
of a hundred and twenty pounds, with a fine t)f 
five hundred poimds *• This tranfadion feems to 
evince a degree of wealth much above want, though 
the affignment of his leafe not long after to Walter 
Bernard equally proves, that he could not eafily hold 
what he had thus obtained. Kingfwood-heath is now 
worth three hundred pounds a year, and is advertifed 
for fale by Bennet, the prefent pofTefTor. 

Whatever may have been his opulence, our Au- 
thor did not wafte his fubfequent life in unprofitable 
idlenefs. No one can be idly employed who endea- 
vours to make his fellow fubjefts better citizens and 
wifer men. This will fufficiently appear if we con- 
fider his future labours, under the diftinfl: heads of 
voyages ; fiftitious biography ; moralities, either 
grave or ludicrous; domeftic travels; and trafts on 
trade. 

The fuccefs of Crufoe induced De Foe to publilh, 
in 1720, The Life and Piracies of Captain Singlet on ^ 
though not with fimilar fuccefs : The plan is narrower, 
and the performance is lefs amufive. In 1725, he 
gave A New Voyage round the Worlds by a Courfe 
never failed before. Mod voyagers have had this 
misfortune, that whatever fuccefs they had in the ad- 
venture, they had very little in the narration : they are 
indeed full of the incidents of failing, but they have

nothing 



428 THE LIFE OF DE FOE. 

nothing of ftory fpr the nfe of readers who never in- 
tend to brave the da.ngers of the fea. Thefe faults 
De Foe is ftudious to avoid in his new voyage. He 
fpreads before his reacJers fuch adventures as no 
writer of a real voyage can hope to imitate, if we ex- 
cept the teller of Anfon*s tale. In the life of Crufoe 
we are gratified by continually imagining that the 
fiaion is a fafl:: in the voyage round the world we 
are pleafed by conftantly perceiving that the hSt 
is a fiaion, which, by uncommon Ikill, is made 
more interefting than a genuine voyage. 

Of fiftitious biography it is equally true, that by 
matchkfs art it may be made more inftruftive 
than a real life. Few of our writers have excelled 
De Foe in this kind of biographical narration, the 
great qualities of which are, to attract by the diver- 
lity of circumftanc^s, and to inftrud by the ufeful- 
nefs of examples. 

He publifhed, in 1720, the Hiftory of Duncan 
Campbell. Of a perfon who was born deaf and 
dumb, but who himfelf taught the deaf and dumb 
to underftand, it is eafy to fee that the life would be 
extraordinary. It will be found, that the Author 
has intermixed fome difquifitions of learning, and 
has contrived that the merrieft paffages fhall end 
with fome edifying moral. The fortunes and mif- 
fortunes of Moll Flanders were made to gratify the 
world in 1721. DeFoe was aware, that in relating 
a vicious life, it was necelTary to make the beft ufe 
of a bad ftory ; and he artfully endeavours, that 
the reader fhall be more pleafed with the moral than 
the fable ; with the application than the relation ; 
with the end of the writer than the adventures of 
the perfon. There was publifhed in 1721, a work 
^ * of 



CHARLES ad— -GEORGE 2d, 429 

of a fimjlar tendency, the Life of Colonel Jack, who 
was born a gentleman but was bred a pickpocket. — 
Our Author is ftudious to convert his various adven- 
tures into a delightful field, where the reader might 
gather herbs, wholefome and medicinal, without 
the incommodation of plants, poifonous, or noxious. 
In 1724, appeared the Life of Roxana. Scenes of 
crimes can fcarcely be reprefented in fuch a manner, 
fays De Foe, but fome make a criminal ufe of them; 
but when vice is painted in its low-prized colours, it 
is not to make people love what from the frightfiil- 
nefs of the figures they ought neceflarily to hate. 
Yet, I am not convinced, that the world has been 
made much wifer, or better, by the perufal of thefe 
lives : they may have diverted the lower orders, but 
I doubt if they have much improved them ; if how- 
ever they have not made them better, they have not 
left them worfe. But they do not exhibit many 
fcenes which are welcome to cultivated minds. Of a 
very different quality are the Memoirs of a Co- 
valier^ during the Civil Wars in England, which 
feem to have been publiflied without a date. This 
is a romance the likeft to truth that ever was writ- 
ten. It is a narrative of great events, which is 
drawn with fuch fimplicity, and enlivened with fuch 
reflexions, as to inform the ignorant and entertain 
the wife. 

The moralities of De Foe, whether publiflied in 
fmgle volumes, or interfperfed through many paf- 
fages, mufl at laft give him a fuperiority over the 
crowd of his contemporaries. The approbation 
which has been long given to his Family Injirudor and 
his Religious Courtjhip^ feem to contain the favour- 
able decifion of his countrymen. But there are ftill 

other 



430 THE LIFE OP DE FOB. 

Other performances of this nature, which are ndx^ 
to be mentioned, of not inferior merit. 

De Foe publifhed, in 1722, A Journal of tA^ 
Plague in 1665. The Author's artifice confifts in 
fixing the reader's attention by the deep diftrefs of 
fellow-men; and, by recalling the reader's recollec- 
tion to ftriking examples of mortality, he endeavours 
to inculcate the uncertainty of life, and the ufeful- 
nefs of reformation. In 1724, De Foe publiflied 
The great Law of Subordination. This is an admi- 
rable commentary on the Unfufferable Behaviour of 
Servants. Yet, though he intereft by his mode, in- 
form by his fads, and convince by his argument, 
he fails at laft, by expeding from law what muft 
proceed from manners. Our Author gave the 
Political Hijiory of the Devil J in 1726. The matter 
and the mode conjoin to make this a charming per- 
formance. He engages poetry and profe, reafoning 
and wit, perfuafion and ridicule, on the fide of reli^ 
gion and morals, with wonderful efficacy. De Foe 
wrote a fyflem of magic in 1726. This may be pro- 
perly regarded as a fupplement to the Hiftory of the 
Devil. His end and his execution are exadly the 
fame. He could fee no great harm in the prefent 
pretenders to magic, if the poor people would but 
keep their money in their pockets ; and that they 
Ihould have their pockets picked by fuch an unper- 
forming, unmeaning, ignorant crew as thefe are, 
is the only magic De Foe could fee in the whole 
fcience. But the reader will difcover in our Au- 
thor's fyftem extenfive erudition, falutary remark, 
and ufeful fatire. De Foe publifhed in 1727, his 
Treatife on the Ufe and Abtife of the Marriage-Bed. 
The Author had begun this performance thirty years 

before ; 



CliARLES 2d — GEORGE 2d. 4^1 

before : he delayed the publication, though it had 
been long finiflied, in hopes of reformation. But 
being now grown old, and out of the reach of fcandaly 
and defpairing of amendment from a vicious age, 
he thought proper to clofe his days with this fatire. 
He appealed to that Judge, before whom he expeflt- 
ed foon to appear, that as he had done it with an 
upright intention, fo he had ufed his utmoft endeavour 
to perform it in a manner, which was the leaft liable 
to refleSion, and the moft anfwerable to the end 
of it — the reformation of the guilty. After fuch an 
appeal, and fuch affeverations, I will only remark, 
that this is an excellent book with an improper title- 
page. 

We are now to confider our Author's Tours. 
He publifhed his Travels through England, in 
1724 and 1725; and through Scotland, in 
1727. De Foe was not one of thofe travellers 
who feldom quit the banks of. the Thames. 
He had made wide excurfions over all thofe coun- 
tries, with obfervant eyes and a vigorous intelleft. 
The great artifice of thefe volumes confifts in the fre- 
quent mention of fuch men and things, as are always 
welcome to the reader's mind. 

De Foe's Commercial Trails are to be reviewed 
laftly. Whether his fancy gradually failed, as age 
haftily advanced, I am unable to tell. He certainly 
began, in 1726, to employ his pen more frequently 
on the real bufinefs of common life. He publifhed, 
in 1727, The Complete Englijh Tradefman; direding 
him in the feveral parts of trade. A fecond volume 
foon after followed, which was addreffed chiefly to 
the more experienced and more opulent traders. In

thefe treatifes the tradefman foun4 many diredions 
of bufinefs, and many leffons of prudence, De Fpe 
was not one of thofe writers, who confider frigate 
vices as public benefits : God forbid, he exclaims, 
that I fhould beunderftood to prompt the vices of the 
age, in order to promote any praftice of traffic : 
trade need notbe deftroyed though vice were mortally 
wounded. With this falutary fpirit he publifhed, ia 
1728, A Plan of the Englijh Commerce. This feems 
to ht the conclufion of what he had begun in 
v/i^^ In 1728, Gee printed his Trade and Navi-^ 
gatim confidered. De Foe infifted, that our induftry, 
our commerce, our opulence, and our people, had 
increafed and were ihcreafing. Gee reprefented that 
our maxiufaftures had received mortal flabs; that 
our poor were deftitute, and our country miferable^ 
De Foe maintained the truth, which experience has 
taught to unwilling auditors. Gee afTerted the falfe- 
hood, without knowing the fad : yet Gee is quoted^ 
while De Foe, with all his knowledge of the fub- 
jed, as a commercial writer, is almoft forgotten* 
The reafon may be found perhaps in the charade- 
liftic remark with which he opens his plan : Trade^ 
lili:e religion, is what every body talks of, bat few 
una^erftand. 

"V^'hen curlofity has contemplated fuch copiouf- 
nefs, x^uch variety, and fuch excellence, it naturally 
inquires., which was the laft of De Foe's performances? 
Were we to determine from the date of the title- 
page, the Flan of Commerce muft be admitted to be 
his laft. But if we muft judge from his prefatory 
declaration, in The Abufe of the Marriage-Bed^ 
where he talks of cloftng his days with this fatire^ 
which he was fo far from feeing caufe of being

of it where he was going to account for it, we 
muft finally decide, that our Author clofed his ca- 
reer '^ with this upright intention for the goodofman^

De F06, after thofe innumerable labours, which 
\ have thus endeavoured to recal to the public recol- 
ledion, died in April, 173 1, within the parifh of 
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, at an age, if he 
were born in 1663, when it was time to prepare for 
his laji voyage. He left a widow, Sufannah, who 
did not long furvive him, and fix fons and daugh- 
ters, whom he boafts of having educated as we^ll as 
his circumftances would admit. His fon Daniel is 
faid to have emigrated to Carolina ; of Benjamin, 
his fecond fon, no account can be given. His 
youngeft daughter Sophia, married Mr. Henry Ba- 
ker, a p'etfon more refpeftable as a philofopher than 
a poet, who died in 1774, at the age of feventy. 
His daughter Maria married one Langley ; but 
Hannah and Henrietta probably remained unmar- 
ried, fince they were heireffes only of a name, which 
did not recommend them. With regard to

genious and brifk; of a fpirit, enterprifmg ancj 
bold, but of little prudence ; with good nature and 
real honefly. Of his petty habits little now can be 
told, more than he has thus confeffed himfelf J :

or revengeful j and though this be true, and 1 chal- 
lenge all the world to prove the contrary, yet, I 
muft own, I fee fmall fatisfaftion in all the negatives

When De Foe had arrived at fixty-five, while he 
was encumbered with a family, and, I fear, pinched 
with penury, Pope endeavoured, by repeated ftrokes, 
to bring his gray hairs with forrow to the grave. 
This he did without propriety, and, as far as appears,

Mi^thout provocation ; for our Author is not in the 
black lift of fcribblers, who by attempting to leffen 
the poet*s fame, incited the fatirift's indignation. 
The oflFence.and the fate of Bentley and DeFoe were 
neatly alike. Bently would not allow the tranjlation 
to he Homer: De Foe had endeavoured to bring 
Milton into vogue feven years ere the Paradife Loji 
and Chevy Chafe had been criticifed in the Speftators 
by Addifon. Our Author had faid in More Reform

Let. this defcrlbe the nation's charafter. 

One man reads Milton, forty . 

The cafe is plain, the temper of the time. 
One wrote the lewci^ the other the/ublime* 

An enraged poet alone could have thruft into the 
Dunciadj Bentley, a profound fcholar, Gibber, a 
brilliant wit, and De Foe, a happy genius. This was 
the confequence of exalting fatire as the teft of 
truth ; while truth ought to have been enthroned the , 
teft of fatire. Yet, it ought not to be forgotten, that 
De Foe has fome farcafm, in his Syjiem of Magic ^ on 
the fylpbs and gnomes, which Pope may have deemed 
a daring invafion of his Roficrutian territories. 

De Foe has not yet outlived his century, though 
he have outlived moft of his contemporaries. Yet the 
time is come, when he muft be acknowledged as one 
of theableft, as he is one of the moft captivating^ 
writers, of which this ifland can boaft. Before he 
canbe admitted to this pre-eminence, he muft be con- 
fidered diftinflly, as a poet, as a novelift, as a pole, 
mick, as a commercial writer,and as a grave hiftorian. 

As a poet, we muft look to the end of his effufions 
rather than to his execution, ere we can allow him 

F f 2 confiderable 



43^ THE LIFE OF DB FOE. 

confiderable praife. To mollify national animofities, 
or to vindicate national rights, is certainly noble ob- 
jefts, which merit the vigour and imagination of 
Milton, or the flov/ and precifion of Pope ; but our 
Author's energy runs into harftinefs, and his fweet- 
nefs is to be tafted in his profe more than in his* 
poefy. If we regard the adventures of Crufoe, like 
the adventures of Telemachus, as a poem, his moral, 
his incidents, and his language, muft lift him high 
on the poet's fcale. His profefled poems, whether 
we contemplate the propriety of fentiment, or the 
• fuavity of numbers, may indeed, without much 
lofs of pleafure or inftruftion, be reflgned to thofe, 
who, in imitation of Pope, poach in the fields of 
obfolete poetry for brilliant thoughts, felicities of 
phrafe, or for happy rhymes. 

As a novelift, every one will place him in the fore- 
moft rank, who confiders his originality, his pet- 
formance, and his purpofe. The Ship of Fools haid 
indeed been launched in early times ; but, who like 
De Foe, had ever carried his reader to fea, in order 
to mend the heart, and regulate the praftice of life, 
by fliewing his readers the effecls of adverfity, or how 
they might equally be called to fuftain his hero's 
trials, as they failed round the world. But, without 
attraftions, neither the originality, nor the end, can 
have any falutary confequence. This he had fore- 
feen ; and for this he has provided, by giving his ad- 
ventures in a ftyle fo pleafmg, becaufe it is fimple,and 
fo interefting, becaufe it is particular, that every one 
fancies he couldwrite afimilar language. It was, then, 
idle in Boyer formerly, or in Smollet lately, to fpeak 
of De Foe as a party writer^ in little ejlimation. The 
writings of no Author fmce have run through more 

numerous 



CHARLES 2d. GEORGE lid. 437 

numerous editions. And he whofe works have plea- 
fed generally and pleafed long, muft be deemed a 
writer of no fmall eftimatlon ; the people's verdift 
being the proper teft of what they are the proper 
judges. 

As a polemick, I fear we muft regard our Author 
with lefs kindnefs, though it muft be recollefted, 
that he lived during a contentious period, when two 
parties diftradted the nation, and writers indulged 
in great afperities. But, in oppofition to reproach, 
let it ever be remembered, that he defended freedom, 
without anarchy; that he fupported toleration, 
without libertinifm j that he pleaded for moderation 
even amidft violence. Vv ith acutenefs of intelleQ:, 
with keennefs of wit, with archnefs of diftion, and 
pertinacity of defign ; it muft be allowed that nature 
had qualified, in a high degree, De Foe for a difpu- 
tant. His polemical treatifes, whatevermight havebeen 
their attradions once, may now be delivered with- 
out referve to thofe who delight in polemical reading. 
De Foe, it muft be allovi ed, was a party-writer : But, 
were not Swift and Prior, Steel and Addifon, 
Halifax and Bolingbroke, party- writers ? De Foe, 
being a party-writer upon fettled principles, did 
not change with the change of parties : Addifon 
and Steel, Prior and Swift, connefted as they were 
with perfons, changed their note as perfons were 
elevated or depreffed. 

As a commercial writer, De Foe is fairly intltled 
to ftand in the foremoft rank among his contem- 
poraries, whatever may be their performances or 
their fame. Little would be his praife, to fay of 
him, that he wrote on commercial legiflation Hke 
F f 3 Addifon, 



43* "THE LIFB OJ? DE FQE. 

Addifon, who when he touches on Trade, finks 
into imbecility, without knowledge of fad, or power 
of argument *• The diflinguifhing charaderiftics 
of De Foe, as a commercial difquifitor, are origina-^ 
llty and depth. He has many feiitiments with re- 
gard to traffic, which are fcattered through his 
Reviews, and which I never read in any other book. 
His Giving Jims no Charity is a capital performance, 
with the exception of one or two thoughts about 
the abridgment of labour by machinery, which are 
either half formed or half expreffed. Were we to 
compare De Foe with D'Avenant, it would be found, 
that D'Avenant has more detail from official docu<> 
ments; that De Foe has more faft from wider 
inquiry. D'Avenant is more apt to confider laws 
in their particular application j De Foe more fre- 
quently inveftigates commercial legiflation in its 
general effefts. From the publications of D'Avenant 
it is fufficiently clear, that he was not very regard- 
ful of means or very attentive to confequences ; 
De Foe is more corre£l in his motives, and more 
falutary in his ends. But, as a commercial prophet, 
De Foe muft yield the palm to Child ; who fore- 
feeing from experience that men's conduft muft 
finally be direfted by their principles, foretold the 
colonial revolt : De Foe, allowing his prejudices to 
obfcure his fagacity, reprobated that fuggeftion, 
becaufe he deemed intereft a more ftrenuous prompter 
than enthufiafm. Were we however to form an 
opinion, not from fpecial paffages, but from whole

performances, we muft incline to De Foe, whea 
compared with the ableft contemporary: we muft 
allow him the preference, on recolleftion, that when he 
writes on commerce he feldom fails to infinuate fome 
axiom of morals, or to inculcate fome precept of 
religion. 

As an hiftorian, it will be found, that our Author 
had few equals in the Englifh language, when he 
wrote. His Memoirs of a Cavalier (hew how well 
he could execute the lighter narratives. His Hiftory 
of the Union evinces that he was equal to the higher 
department of hiftoric compofition. This is an ac^ 
count of a fingle event, difficult indeed in its exe- 
cution, but beneficial certainly in its confequences. 
With extraordinary Ikill and information, our Author 
relates, not only the event, but the tranfaftions which 
preceded, and the effedts which followed. He is at 
once learned and intelligent. Gonfidering the fac- 
tioufnefs of the age, his candour is admirable. His 
moderation is exemplary. And if he fpoke of James I. 
as a tyrant, he only exercifed the prerogative, which 
our hiftorians formerly enjoyed, of carting obloquy on 
an unfortunate race, in order to fupply deficience of 
knowledge, of elegance, and of ftile. In this in- 
ftance De Foe allowed his prejudice to overpower his 
philofophy. If the language of his narrative want 
the dignity of the great hiftorians of the current 
times, it has greater facility ; if it be not always 
grammatical, it is generally precife ; and if it be 
thought defedive in ftrength, it muft be allowed to 
excel ifl fweetnefs. 

Such then are the pretenfions of De Foe to be ac- 
knowledged as one of the ableft and moft ufeful
