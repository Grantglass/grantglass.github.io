This book is dedicated 
with loving interest 
the small beginners in reading 
everywhere. 



Regarding the Book 

T he Robinson Crusoe Reader will be found an ideal 
book for the child’s earliest reading lessons. The 
story itself holds the attention of the youngest, since 
all children have a sympathetic ‘interest in primitive life, and 
the development of the story brings his industrial resources 
into intelligent activity. The Suggestions to Teachers ” 
have been worked out with special care, since by carrying 
out these suggestions, the children will be enabled to repro- 
duce much of Robinson Crusoe’s life in the school room, 
and the reading lessons will thereby be made a delight. 
Suggestions as to the use of the sand table, of drawing, 
modeling, weaving and paper cutting, also of games, mind 
pictures and stories, are intended as suggestions only, for 
teachers will find new possibilities in almost every lesson. 

The vocabulary of about five hundred words has been 
carefully chosen and graded, and contains only words which 
a child can readily comprehend. The greater part of these 
will already be familiar to the child through primers which 
have previously been studied. 

It is intended that the story of Robinson Crusoe should 
first be told by the teacher in a very brief outline. This 
will arouse the interest of the children and will awaken a 
desire upon their part to be able to read the story for 
themselves. 

Cordial thanks are hereby extended for the kindly 
interest and criticism which the author has received from 
W. F. Webster, author of ‘‘English: Composition and 
Literature,” and principal of the East High School, Minne- 
apolis; and to the principals and primary teachers whose 
helpful comments and suggestions have made the prepara- 
tion of the book a genuine pleasure. 



The Robinson Crusoe Reader. 





Robinson Crusoe was an English boy. 
He loved the water, and he loved the big 
ships. 

Robinson Crusoe loved the water so 
well, that he ran away from home. He ran 
away from his English home, to a great 
ship. 

The ship had big white sails, and Rob- 
inson Crusoe liked to see them. He liked 
to see the water, and the pretty white sails. 

7 


The Ship Danced on the Waves. 


The ship’s sails were big and white. 
The wind blew the big white sails. The 
wind made pretty waves, and the ship 
danced on the waves. 

Then the ship sailed away over the 
water, and Robinson Crusoe was on the 
ship. He had run away from home. 
Robinson Crusoe had left his English home 
to sail far over the water.

Robinson Crusoe liked the big ship. 
The wind blew the great white sails. The 
pretty waves danced and tossed. 

Robinson Crusoe was glad he was on 
the great ship. He liked the big water. 
He liked to see the waves dance and toss 
in the wind. 

The ship sailed far away. It sailed 
far, far over the water. The. wind blew 
the big sails, and the ship sailed fast. 

4 

Robinson Crusoe was on the ship a long 
time. He was a long way from his English 
home. He liked the big ship, with its 
great white sails. He was glad he had 
left his home, to go on the big ship. 

One day the wind blew hard. The 
waves grew very big and very high. They 
did not toss and dance now. They dashed 
high overThe ship. The wind blew very, 
9 


very hard. Robinson Crusoe began to be 
afraid. He was afraid of the big waves 
that came so fast. 


5 



A Great Wave Dashed Over the Ship. 


The wind blew hard, and a great storm 
came. The big ship was far from Robin- 
son Crusoe’s home. The great waves 
were dashing over it. Robinson Crusoe 
was afraid. He began to be sorry that he 
had run away from home. 

Then, a great wave came. It dashed 
high over the ship, and the ship broke. 
The waves carried Robinson Crusoe into 


10 


the water. Oh, how sorry he was that he 
had left his far-away home! 

Robinson Crusoe tried to swim, but the 
waves were too big. He went far down 
into the water. 


6 



. A Great Wave Carried Robinson Crusoe to Land. 


Robinson Crusoe could see land, not 
far away. He tried to swim to the land, 
but the waves dashed over him. Then a 
big wave came, and the big wave helped 
Robinson Crusoe. It carried him far 
toward the land. 

Robinson Crusoe tried again to swim, 
and a great wave helped him again. It 
carried him safe to the land. 


11 


Oh, how glad Robinson Crusoe was! 
His ship was broken in the storm: its 
white sails could toss and dance no more. 
But Robinson Crusoe was safe on land, 
and oh, how glad he was! 


— -7 

Robinson Crusoe looked about at the 
strange land. He walked about the shore. 



soe’s heart began 
ship was broken, ai 


Then he climbed to 
a high place and 
saw that he was on 
an island. The water 
was all around him. 
Robinson Crusoe 
was alone on a 
strange island. 
What could he do 
now? His ship was 
broken. 

Robinson Cru- 
to be heavy. His 
1 he had no food and 


no bed on all the strange land. Where 
was he to sleep? He was afraid to sleep 
upon the land. He must sleep in a tree. 
What a queer bed to sleep in! 

With a heavy heart, Robinson Crusoe 
walked about on the shore. He was 
ship-wrecked on a strange island, and he 
must sleep in a tree. Oh, how he wished 
that he had not left his English home! 


In the morning, Robinson Crusoe left 
his queer bed in the tree, and walked 
down to the shore. The storm was over, 
and the sun was shining. 

In the night, the waves had tossed the 
wrecked ship nearer the land. “How 
strange!” thought Robinson Crusoe. And 
now the waves were still, too. 

Robinson Crusoe was glad to see his 
ship near the island. He was glad to see 
t it, even if it was wrecked and broken. 

13 


Now he could swim to the ship, for the 
waves were still. Perhaps he could climb 
upon it and find food. 


9 



The morning sun was shining, and 
the waves were still. Robinson Crusoe’s 
heart was not so heavy now. His ship 
was near the island, and there was food 
on the ship! 

How hungry Robinison Crusoe felt! 
He had tasted no food for a long, long 
time. But he knew where to find the 
ship’s food. Perhaps the food would be 
wet. How sorry he would be, if it was! 

14 


Robinson Crusoe swam to the ship, 
and climbed upon it. Then he looked 
for food. When he found it, it was safe 
and dry. The water had not wet it at 
all. Oh, how hungry he felt, and how 
good the food tasted ! 


10 



Robinson Crusoe Made a Raft. 


Robinson Crusoe must get the ship’s 
food to his island. How could he do it? 
15 


He had no one to help him. He thought 
about the ship’s tools. He would find 
the tools and make a raft! Then he 
could carry the food to his island, on the 
raft. 

The raft was made from parts of the 
broken ship. It took a long time to make 
it, and Robinson Crusoe worked very hard. 

When the raft was made, Robinson 
Crusoe put his food and his tools upon it. 
Then he waited for the tide. When the 
tide came, it floated his raft toward the 
island. The raft floated safe to land, with 
his food and tools. 


11 

When night came, Robinson Crusoe 
did not go back to his queer bed in the tree. 
His heart was not so heavy now. He 
had food from the ship, and it tasted good. 
He had tools, too, and he would make a 
home on the island. 


16 



17 


There were guns on the ship, and Rob- 
inson Crusoe wanted the guns. He could 
get food on the island, if he had them. 
He wanted the ship’s sails, too. They 
were big and heavy, but he wanted to 
take them to the island. 


12 



“He Put His Food and Tools on the Raft.” 


Robinson Crusoe put the food, the tools 
and the guns upon his raft. He put the 
18 



heavy sails upon the raft, too. Then he 
took the two cats with him, and waited 
again for the tide. The dog could swim 
to the island, but the cats could not swim. 
They floated to the island upon the raft. 

Every day, Robinson Crusoe went to 
the ship. He put many goods from the 
ship upon his raft, and took them to the 
islahd. The tide always floated his raft 
safe to shore. 

Robinson Crusoe worked hard to make 
his raft. He had no one to help him. 
He worked hard to get so many of the 
ship’s goods to the island. But, oh, how 
glad he was to have them. He could 
live upon the island now. 


19 


13 



“ He Was All Alone on the Island. ” 


One morning, when Robinson Crusoe 
walked down toward the shore, he found 
that his ship was gone. In the night, the 
waves had broken it, and it had gone 
down into the water. Oh, how lonely 
Robinson Crusoe felt! He was all alone 
on the strange island. His ship was 
gone. Now he knew that the island must 
be his home. 

But Robinson Crusoe had food and 
guns on the island. He had his cats and 

20 


his dog, too. He could go hunting and 
get more food, and he could make a house 
for his goods. 

Robinson Crusoe could find plenty to 
do, but, oh, how lonely he felt! 


14 



Robinson Crusoe wanted a safe place 
for his house. He looked about the island 


21 



and found a great rock near the shore. 
Then he made a tent from the ship’s sails 
and set it up near the rock. The tent 
made a good house, for the sails were 
strong and heavy. 

After his tent was set up, Robinson 
Crusoe made a wall around it with the 
ship’s goods. He tried to make the wall 
as strong as he could, so he would be 
safe in his tent. Perhaps he could sleep 
in his tent at night, now. It was in a safe 
place near the great rock. The food and 
guns and tools were in the tent. 

Robinson Crusoe had found a hammock 
in the ship. He put the hammock in the 
tent. Then he could sleep in the hammock. 
It made a good bed. Robinson Crusoe liked 
it better than his bed in the tree. 

15 

Robinson Crusoe knew that he could 
not get away from the island. There was 
water all about him, and he had no ship. 

22 


It was very lonely. He could talk only to 
his dog and his cats. But he would work 
and make a home. He 
hoped that a ship might 
some day come and take 
him* away from the island. 

After Robinson Crusoe 
had set up. his tent and 
made his wall, he went 
hunting. He had bread 
from the ship, but he had 
no meat. So he took his 
gun and went hunting. 

Robinson Crusoe found 
goats on the island. He 
shot one of the goats and 
took it home. The meat 
of the goat tasted good. Robinson Crusoe 
gave some of it to his dog and to his cats. 

16 

The tent near the rock made a good 
house, but Robinson Crusoe had only a 

23 



hammock in it. He wanted a chair and a 
table. He would have to make them. 

There was no chair 
and no table on all the 
big island. No one 
lived there but Robin- 
son Crusoe. 

“Perhaps I can 
make a chair and a 
table,” said Robinson 
Crusoe to himself. 
Then he thought of 
the boards in his raft. So, with his tools, 
he made a chair and a table, from the 
boards. They looked very queer when 
they were made, for Robinson Crusoe was 
not used to this kind of work. But he had 
done the best that he could. They were 
strong, and he could use them. 

There were many kinds of work for 
Robinson Crusoe to do upon the island, 
and Robinson Crusoe was glad. He was 
not so lonely when he was at work. 

24 



Robinson Crusoe needed a spade. He 
knew that he could not make this from 
boards. It would not be strong. He 
could not dig with a spade made from a 
board. So Robinson Crusoe found a tree 
of very hard wood. Then, with his tools, 
he cut a spade from the hard wood. He 
tried to make it the best that he could. 
It took a very long time, but he could dig 
with the spade when 
it was finished. 

17 


Robinson Crusoe 
wanted more room 
in his house. He 
wanted more room for 
his goods. The rock, 
by his tent, was soft, 
and he could dig into 
it. So he dug i nto the 
big, soft rock with his 
spade, and made a 
cave. 



Robinson Crusoe Dug a Cave, 
With His Spade. 


25 


It was a little cave, at first. But soon 
Robinson Crusoe wished that his cave 
was bigger. So he began to work, to 
make it wider and higher. He wished 
to have a very big cave. 

Robinson Crusoe worked more than 
two weeks, to finish his house. It was 
hard work, too, but every day the cave 
grew wider and higher. Then, just as 
Robinson Crusoe began to think it was 
big enough, something happened! 

18 

Robinson Crusoe had made his cave 
too big. The roof broke, and a great lot 
of earth fell into the cave. Poor Robinson 
Crusoe! He had to take out all the earth 
that had fallen. 

And this was not all. He had to prop 
up the roof of the cave, so that no more 
earth could fall. 

It took Robinson Crusoe a week to 
finish this work. He had to prop his roof 
with posts and boards. When he had 
26 


finished, his cave was very big and very 
safe, too. No more earth could fall into it. 

There were now two rooms in Robin- 
son Crusoe’s house. He put his goods 
from the ship, in the cave. In the tent, 
he had his chair, his table and his ham- 
mock. The tent was his sleeping room. 

19 

Robinson Crusoe often 
took his guns and went hunt- 
ing. He found fowl upon 
the island, as well as goats. 
The meat of the fowl tasted 
very good. It was as good 
as the goat’s meat. 

One morning Robinson Crusoe saw a 
wild-cat, and shot it. The 
meat of the wild-cat was 
not good to eat, but its 
skin was soft and pretty. 

Robinson Crusoe 
wanted the skin, so he 
27 




took it home. He put the skin on posts 
in the sun, and the sun dried it. Then he 
used the pretty skin in his tent. 

After that, Robinson Crusoe saved the 
skins of animals that he shot, and dried 
them in the sun. Some of the skins dried 
hard and stiff, but some of them were fine 
and soft. Robinson Crusoe found many 
ways to use the fine, soft skins. 



He Would Have to Make the Boards 
from Trees.” 


20 

Robinson Crusoe 
had plenty of boards 
from his rafts, so he 
made a table for his 
cave. He made it bet- 
ter than the first one, 
for he knew better, 
now, how to use his 
tools. Robinson Cru- 
soe’s cave was his 
kitchen. He could 
eat and he could work 
in his kitchen. 

28 


After Robinson Crusoe had finished 
his cave, he wanted shelves on the walls. 
He needed shelves for his food and for his 
tools. He needed shelves for many of his 
goods. But his boards were gone; he had 
used them all. 

Robinson Crusoe needed very big 
boards for his shelves. He would have to 
make the boards from trees. For this 
work, he had only an ax. He could 
make only one board from a tree, with 
the ax. 

It took a long, long time to get enough 
boards for his shelves. But Robinson 
Crusoe was willing to work hard, and he 
had plenty of time. 


21 

When he had finished 
making the boards, 
Robinson Crusoe had 
shelves for his kitchen. 
The shelves were wide. 



29 


and he could put his food and goods 
upon them. He hoped to put his kitchen 
in better order, and to have a better place 
to work. Robinson Crusoe liked to have his 
house in order. He was glad he made the 
wide shelves. Now he had plenty of room. 

Robinson Crusoe’s cats and dog lived 
with him. They were his family, and he 
was kind to them. He liked to have them 
about, for he was not so lonely then. He 
used to talk to them, but they could not 
talk to him. 

One day, when Robinson Crusoe was 
hunting, he found a lame goat. Something 
had happened to the goat. It had 
broken its leg. Robinson Crusoe took the 
lame animal home to his cave. He took 
good care of it, and the goat’s leg got well. 
When the goat got well, it did not go away. 
It liked Robinson Crusoe; he was kind to 
it when it was lame. 

Robinson Crusoe’s family was growing. 

30 


Two cats, a dog and a goat now lived 
with him. He was kind to them all. 

22 

At night, Robinson Crusoe was afraid 
of wild animals. He was afraid there 
might be savages on 
the island. His wall 
was notstrongenough. 

He wished for a better 
wall, in order to be 
safe. 

Robinson Crusoe 
thought he would 
make a very strong 
wall. He would make 
one that would go all 
around his tent, to the 
big rock. Then he 
would be safe. He 
would have to work strong waii.” 

hard to make it, but he was used to hard 
work. 



31 


Many trees were growing upon the 
island. Robinson Crusoe thought he would 
make his wall from trees. With his ax, 
he cut big posts. Then, with his spade, 
he set them deep into the ground. 

It took a great many posts to make the 
wall, all around his house. Robinson 
Crusoe worked a very long time. But 
when the wall was made, it was wide and 
high. No wild animals nor savages could 
get through it. It was much better than 
his first wall. 


23 

Robinson Crusoe felt very safe inside 
his strong wall. It did not have even a 
door. He did not want a door in his wall. 
But he must still go out upon the island. 
How could he do that? 

Robinson Crusoe made a ladder. He 
made a ladder to use in the place of a 

32 


door. When he wished to go out upon 
the island, he put his ladder up by the 
wall, and climbed 
to the top. Then 
he put his ladder 
over the wall and 
climbed down. 

When he was safe 
inside his wall, his 
ladder was safe in- 
side, too. 

In all the time 
that Robinson Cru- 
soe had lived upon 
the island, he had 
not seen any sav- 
ages. But he was 
afraid some might 
be there. The 
island was very big. 

Now he felt safe in 
his house, with the 
strong wall around 

“He Made a Ladder to Use in the 1 
It* of a Door.” 



33 


24 


Robinson Crusoe had found some books 
upon the ship. He took the books to 


the island, and kept them 
upon his shelves. But 
he could not read in them 
at night. He had no light. 
When it grew dark, he 



had to go to bed. Oh, how he wished 
that he had a light! After his work was 
finished, he wanted to read in his books. 

One day, Robinson Crusoe thought of 
something he could use to make a light. 
He waited, and when he went hunting 
again, he shot a goat and saved its fat. 
He took some of the fat home to his kitchen. 
When he had tried out some of it, he put 
it into a little dish that he happened to 
have. Then he made a wick and put it 
in the fat. He hoped that it would burn. 
Pretty soon he lighted the wick, and the 
little wick burned and lighted his kitchen! 
Robinson Crusoe was very happy. He 


34 



35 




had found a way to make a light for his 
house. 

After that, when Robinson Crusoe went 
hunting, he kept the fat of any animals that 
he killed. He wanted enough fat for his 
light. After he had worked hard all day, 
he liked to read in his books at night. 
There was plenty of time for him to work 
and to read. He was very glad when he 
could read after dark. 


25 


One day, when Robinson Crusoe was 
looking about his shelves. 



he found a little bag. He 
wanted to use the bag, so 
he took it outdoors and 
shook it. Then he took it 
into the kitchen again, 
and thought no more 
about what he had done. 


When Robinson Cru- 
soe went out doors, one 


'He Saw Some Little Green 
Blades Growing.’' 


36 


morning, he saw some little green blades 
growing up out of the ground. At first he 
could not think what they were. Then he 
thought about the bag he took outdoors 
and shook. It had had a little dried bar- 
ley in it. The barley had fallen upon the 
ground. And now the barley that he 
shook upon the ground, was growing! It 
was growing up out of the earth in little 
green blades. Oh, how surprised and 
glad Robinson Crusoe felt! 

26 

When Robinson Crusoe saw the little 
green blades of barley growing, he began 
to think. He began to think how good 
God had been to him. He had run away 
from home. He had been ship-wrecked, 
and tossed upon a lonely island. But he 
had found plenty to eat. He had tools to 
work with. Now, when his bread from 
the ship was almost gone, he had barley 
growing. 


37 


Robinson Crusoe had not thought that 
the bits of barley were good. He had 
tossed them out of the bag, and they had 
fallen upon the soft earth. Then the sun 
and the rain had ma^e them grow. Rob- 
inson Crusoe saw that God’s care was 
over him, even on this lonely island. Then 
Robinson Crusoe’s heart was thankful. 

The little blades of barley were given 
good care. Robinson Crusoe watched 
them every day. There was very little of 
the barley at first. But it could be planted 
again, and then there would be more. 

Robinson Crusoe was very thankful for 
his little crop of barley. 

27 

The bread that Robinson Crusoe had 
brought from the ship, was almost gone. 
It had lasted a long, long time, but it was 
almost gone now. After awhile Robinson 
Crusoe would have barley to use, and he 
38 


could make bread from it. How thank- 
ful he was ! 

Robinson Crusoe’s little £rop was given 
the best of care. He would save 
it all, and plant it again. Then, 
after a while, he hoped to have 
plenty to use. 

How the little old bag had sur- 
prised him! Something that he 
never had thought of, had hap- 
pened. He had not thought that 
the bits of dry barley were of any 
use. But now the barley was 
growing, and some day he could 
have it to eat. How good God had 
been to him! 

On the shelves, in his kitchen, 
Robinson Crusoe had gold that 
he had brought from the ship. But the 
gold was of no use to him on the island. 
The little bag of barley was of more use 
than all the gold. 



39 


28 

One day, Robinson Crusoe took his 
guns and went out with his dog. He had 



to climb over the wall on his ladder. 
The dog could climb over the wall, too. 
Robinson Crusoe and his dog were going 
hunting. They needed more food. 

Down by the shore, they found a lot 
of turtles. Robinson Crusoe had seen no 
turtles on the island, before. But he was 

40 


glad, for he knew the turtle’s meat was 
good. He would have some turtle meat 
and turtle eggs to eat. They would taste 
good. 

The dog helped Robinson Crusoe to 
get a big turtle. Then they took it home. 
Robinson Crusoe did not hunt goats that 
day. He had something that would taste 
better than the meat of goat or of fowl. 
He was hungry for some of the turtle eggs. 

-29 

Every day, Robinson Crusoe looked at 
his barley. The little green blades grew 
fast. It would soon be ripe enough to cut. 

When the barley was ripe, Robinson 
Crusoe had to cut it with a sword. The 
sword was one that had been on the ship. 
It had a good blade. It was a queer tool 
for cutting a crop of barley, but Robinson 
Crusoe had nothing better. 

The first year, all the barley had to be 
saved to plant again. When the time 
came to plant it, Robinson Crusoe dug the 

41 


ground with his spade. Then he planted 
the harley in the soft earth. How thank- 
ful he would he when he could have some 
of it to eat. He had given it good care. 

♦ He had watched it every day. 



“It Was a Queer Tool for Cutting a Crop of Barley.” 


Robinson Crusoe had plenty of work to 
do, and he was getting used to living alone 
on the island. But every day he hoped he 
might see the sail of a ship. Every day 
he looked across the deep water, but no 

42 


ship came. Sometimes his heart was very 
heavy. But he was thankful that he had 
plenty to eat, and 
plenty of work to do. 

He knew that God cared 
for him, and that made 
him happy. 

30 


Robinson Crusoe 
was afraid he would 
forget how long he had 
been upon the island. 
He did not want to 
forget; so he made a 
calendar. It was a queer 
calendar, but he could 
count the weeks and 
years in order upon it. 

The calendar was 
made from a post. 
Robinson Crusoe put a 
board upon the top of 

43 



“Every Day He Cut a Notch i 
the Post.” 


the post, and marked on the board the day 
and year that he came to the island. Every 
day he cut a notch in the post, with his 
knife. On Sunday he cut a bigger notch. 
Then he could always tell how long he 
had been away from his English home. 

There was no one on the island to talk 
to Robinson Crusoe. Sometimes he was 
afraid he would forget how to talk. 
Through the long days he used to talk to 
his dog and his cats, but they could not 
talk to him. It was very lonely for 
Robinson Crusoe. Now that he had his 
light, he could read inside his tent after 
dark. Robinson Crusoe liked to watch the 
little wick burn, and give its light. He 
would have been more lonely if he had 
not had his books to read. Robinson 
Crusoe found a Bible with his books. He 
read in his Bible every day. 

Sometimes Robinson Crusoe would talk 
to his dog about the calendar he had made. 

44 


When he cut the notch with his knife, he 
would tell the dog about his English home. 
He would tell him about the ship, and the 
great storm. He would tell him about 
the raft, and the tide that floated his raft 
to the island. He had to talk to his dog, 
so he would not forget 
how to talk. 

31 


The island was very 
big, but Robinson Cru- 
soe never had been very 
far away from his tent. 
One day, he thought he 
would go to the other 
side of the island. He 
took plenty of guns, and 
his sword, and plenty 
of food. 

After a long time, he 
came to the other side 
of the island, and oh, it 

45 



“How Thankful Robinson Crusoe 
was to Find the Fruit!” 


was beautiful! He never had thought the 
island was so beautiful. Many kinds of fruit 
grew there, and how thankful Robinson 
Crusoe was to find the fruit! He could have 
fruit to eat, now, and how good it was. 

When Robinson Crusoe went home, 
he took some of the ripe fruit with him. 
He had melons and grapes. He had 
lemons, too. The melons and grapes and 
lemons all grew in this beautiful part of 
the island. How good they tasted with 
his bread and meat! 


32 



“He Would Make Raisins from the Grapes.’* 


When Robinson Crusoe got home with 
his fruit, he found that his grapes were 

46 


broken. The clusters were big and heavy, 
and the grapes had broken. His lemons 
and melons were good, but he wanted the 
grapes. He must make something in 
which to carry his fruit., He must find 
some way to take cari^ of his grapes. 

Robinson Crusoe went again to the 
beautiful side of the island. He knew, 
now, how he would care for his grapes. 
The clusters were big and heavy. They 
were too ripe and heavy to carry home 
safely. He would make raisins from the 
grapes! 

With his knife, Robinson Crusoe cut 
many clusters of grapes. Then he hung 
them upon the trees where the sun was 
shining. He knew the sun would dry 
the grapes through. When they were 
dried they would make good raisins. 


47 


33 



Robinson Crusoe wanted to stay a long 
time in the part of the island where the 
fruit grew. So he made a 
bower. He set up a tent 
and made a wall around it of 
small trees. He called this 
‘’his bower. He could sleep 
in the tent, and stay as long as he wanted 
to in this part of the island. He could 
care for all his fruit. . 

The sun dried the grapes 
through and made them into 
raisins. Robinson Crusoe 
would never forget how good 
they tasted. 



When Robinson Crusoe went home 
again, he made some bags. Then he took 
the bags to his bower. 
Now he had something 
in which to carry his 
fruit. He could carry 

48 



his melons and lemons and raisins safely 
home in the bags. 

The heavy clusters of grapes had made 
good raisins. They tasted better to 
Robinson Crusoe than anything else in 
the island had tasted. The raisins lasted 
all through the year. 

34 

Near his new bower, Robinson Crusoe 
found something besides fruit. He found 
a parrot. There 
were many beautiful 
birds on this side of 
the island, but when 
he saw the parrot, 
he was very happy. 

“ I can teach the par- 
rot to talk to me,” he 
thought, “and I can 
talk to the parrot.” 

So he caught it, and 
took it to his tent. 



49 


The parrot soon grew tame, for Robin- 
Crusoe gave it food and took good care of 
it. He called it Poll, and tried to teach it 
to talk. He would say, “Pretty Poll; 
pretty Poll,” over and over again. It was 
a long time before Poll began to talk, and 
sometimes Robinson Crusoe wondered if 
the bird would never learn. 

One day, when Robinson Crusoe was 
at work. Poll called, “Pretty Poll; pretty 
Poll.” oil, how glad Robinson Crusoe 
was! It seemed so good to hear someone 
talk, even if it was only a parrot. They 
were the first words Robinson Crusoe had 
heard since he had been upon the island. 
After that Poll learned to say many new 
words. 

Robinson Crusoe made a cage for Poll. 
The parrot liked his cage. He liked, 
too, to sit on Robinson Crusoe’s finger. 
Robinson Crusoe could carry^ him all 
around the tent on his finger. 

50 


Robinson Crusoe’s family was bigger 
than ever now. He had a dog, two cats, 
a goat, and a parrot. It was a queer 
family for a man to have. 



35 


When all of Robinson Crusoe’s fruit 
was ripe, he carried it home to his cave. 
He put the fruit away on the wide shelves 
in his kitchen. He carried the melons 
and lemons and raisins in the bags that 
he had made. 

After that, Robinson Crusoe stayed at 
home. The barley that he had olanted 
was ripe, and he must cut it. He took his 
sword again and went out to cut his crop 
of barley. There was more of it now, but 
not enough for Robinson Crusoe to eat. 
He must plant it again. Before long he 
would have enough to eat. 

After the barley was cut, Robinson 
Crusoe began to carry it to his cave. But 
he needed something in which to carry it. 


He thought he would try to make some 
baskets. He had no one to teach him, 
and he wondered if he could weave them; 
but he could try. He had made some 
small baskets when he w^ a boy, and he 
would try again, 


- 36 - 


There were small, soft twigs growing 
near the bower. Rob- 
inson Crusoe gathered 
some of them, and be- 
gan to weave a basket. 
While he worked with 
the twigs, he talked to 
the parrot. Poll would 
hang to the top of his 
cage and call, “Pretty 
Poll; pretty Poll.” 
Then he would listen to Robinson Crusoe 
again. 

It took some time to finish the basket, 
but Robinson Crusoe did his work well. 
52 



“Robinson Crusoe Learned to Weave 
Very Good Baskets.” 


. When it was finished, the basket would 
hold his barley. 

After a time, Robinson Crusoe learned 
to weave very good baskets. / He gathered 
many of the soft twigs. He made small 
baskets for his raisins, and some very big 
ones in which to carry heavy things. He 
made a great many baskets, for he had 
needed them ever since he had been upon 
the island. 

37 

One day after Robinson had gathered 
his barley and put it away in baskets, he 
and his dog went hunting. The dog 
caught a little goat. Robinson Crusoe did 
not kill the little goat. He took it home 
' and it grew tame and would stay near him. 

There was very little powder left for 
Robinson Crusoe’s guns. It had lasted a 
long time. Before he caught the goat, he 
had often wondered what he would do when 
his powder was gone. He could not even 
go hunting, for he could not make more 
53 


powder. But Robinson Crusoe could 
always think of something to do. When 
his dog caught the little goat, he thought, 
“ How good it would be to have a flock 
of tame goats.” If he had a flock of tame 
goats, he could save his powder, and still 
have meat. 

“I will shoot no more goats,” said 
Robinson Crusoe to himself. “ I will make 
traps and catch them.” So Robinson 
Crusoe made traps, and he caught many 
goats in them. He did not go hunting 
with his guns. He made traps and caught 
many goats for his flock. 

38 

Robinson Crusoe made a wall to keep 
his flock of goats from running away. 
After the goats had been inside the wall a 
little while, they grew tame. Then Robin- 
son Crusoe had something more for food. 
He had milk! After the goats grew tame, 
he could milk them. 


54 


Robinson Crusoe learned to make 
butter from the milk. He made butter 



“After the Goats Grew Tame, He Could Milk Them.” 


and cheese, too. Oh, how glad he was 
that he had the flock of goats. He had 
not thought about the butter and cheese 
when he made traps for the goats. He 

55 


had tasted no butter nor milk nor/cheese 
since he came to the island. How good 
they tasted. They made him think of his 
English home. 

Ever since he came to the island, 
Robinson Crusoe had been learning to do 
new things. He was learning something 
new all the time. 


39 

Sometimes Robinson Crusoe grew very, • 
very lonely. Then he would look again 
for a ship to come and take him away. 
His heart would grow heavy as he thought 
about his lonely life on the island. 

Then Robinson Crusoe would read his 
Bible. He would begin to think of all the 
good things God had given him? He had 
been saved from the storm. He had a safe 
home by the great rock, and a beautiful 
bower, where he gathered his fruit. 

He looked back to the time when he 
was ship-wrecked; when he had no food 


56 


and no bed on all the strange island. Then 
he wondered at the way God had cared 
for him ever since. 



“Sometimes Robinson Crusoe Grew Very, Very Lonely.” 


Robinson Crusoe grew thankful, then. 
He went back to his work with a light 
heart. , thankful that God had 

carecf for him every day. 

57 


40 

Now that Robinson Crusoe had butter 
and milk and cheese, he needed dishes to

hold his food. He wondered if he could 
make a dish. He was learning to do many 
new things; he would try to make some 
dishes. He could think of no other way 
in which he would ever get them. 

Robinson Crusoe went to look for clay. 
He found some and brought it home. 

58 



Then he wet the clay, and marked it into 
pieces. From the pieces he shaped little 
dishes with his fingers. Some of the dishes 
fell in, and some of the dishes fell out, but 
Robinson Crusoe kept on trying. When 
he had made a dish, he put it in the sun 
to dry. 

The dishes were not very well shaped, 
but the wet clay dried in the sun. When 
Robinson Crusoe had finished his work, 
he had some queer little dishes. They 
were as queer little dishes as he ever had 
seen. But they would hold his food. Now 
he had learned to make dishes from clay, 
as well as to weave baskets from twigs. 
He could make as many dishes as he cared 
to, and they would dry in the sun. 

Robinson Crusoe was learning to do 
many new things. He could weave baskets 
from twigs, and make dishes from clay. 
He had learned to shape his dishes better, 
and to make bigger ones. Robinson 
Crusoe liked his new work. 


59 


- 41 - 


Robinson Crusoe could not cook in his 
dishes. The wet clay would 
dry in the sun, but when 
Robinson Crusoe put the 


over 



the fire, they 
would break. 
“There must 
be a better 
way of mak- 
ing dishes 
to cook in,” he 
thought. 

One day Robin- 
son Crusoe found 
a piece of one of his 
broken dishes in 
the fire. When he 
took it up, he found 


“As the Wheel Turned, He Shaped the Clay 
with his Fingers.” 


that it was 
baked as 
hard as a 


rock. So Robinson Crusoe learned from 


60 


this broken piece, to bake his dishes with 
fire. Then he could cook in them, when 
he cared to, and they would not break. 

After a time, Robinson Crusoe made a 
flat wheel, like a potter’s wheel, to shape 
his dishes upon. He would put a piece of 
wet clay on the wheel and turn the wheel 
with his foot. Then, as the wheel turned, 
he would shape the clay with his fingers, 
as potters do. In this way he could make 
his dishes round and smooth, and better 
shaped. 

Robinson Crusoe made two or three 
large pots for his barley, and many little 
dishes. When he had burned the pots 
hard, in his fire, they would hold water 
and he could cook in them. 

42 

How was Robinson Crusoe to make 
meal from his barley? He must have 
meal or he could not make bread or cakes. 
Ever since bis barley began to grow, he 
61 


had tried to think how he could make it 
into meal for cakes. 

At last Robinson Crusoe thought about 
the hard wood he had used for his spade. 



He would take a piece of this wood and 
shape it like a big dish. Then he could 
put his barley into the big hard-wood dish 
and pound it. 


62 


Robinson Crusoe did this. He burned 
out the inside of the dish with fire, and he 
shaped the outside with his ax and his 
hatchet. It took a long time to cut the 
outside of this dish, and to burn and shape 
the inside. The wood was very, very 
hard. But when it was finished, Robinson 
Crusoe had a good dish. He could put 
his barley into it, and pound it into meal. 
The wood was too hard to break. 

Every day Robinson Crusoe found 
many things to do. He looked after 
his traps and cared for his flock. He 
milked the goats, and sometimes he made 
butter and cheese. When he had time, 
he would weave new baskets, or make pots 
and dishes from clay. The wet clay soon 
dried in the sun. The pots for cooking 
baked hard in his fire. 


63 


_^43 

Robinson Crusoe had no oven to bake 
his bread and cakes in. When his barley 
grew ripe he could pound it into meal, 
but how was he to bake it into bread? 
This was a new trouble. But Robinson 
Crusoe would not give up. He always 
found some way out of trouble. 

One day Robinson Crusoe thought of 
a way to make an oven. He mixed some 
clay and shaped it like a big round dish. 
Then he burned it hard and smooth in the 
fire. This big dish was his oven. 

When Robinson Crusoe wanted to 
bake bread or cakes, he wet the meal and 
put the cakes where his fire had been. 
Then he placed his oven over the cakes 
and made more fire all around the oven. 
Robinson Crusoe could not want a better 
oven than this. It baked good bread and 
cakes. 


64 


44 


It was hard for Robinson Crusoe to 
work with his tools. They 
were very dull. He had been 
upon the island a long time, 
and he had used his tools 
almost every day. Now they 
were almost too 
dull to use. 

There had 
been a grind- 
stone on the 
ship, and Rob- 
inson Crusoe 
had taken it 
to the island. 

But he could 
not hold his 
tools and turn the grindstone, too. Now 
he must find a way to grind his tools. 

For a week, Robinson Crusoe tried to 
find a way to use his grindstone. After 

65 



“After That, Robinson Crusoe’s Tools 
Were No Longer Dull.” 


much trouble, he made a frame for the 
stone, with two wheels on the frame. Then, 
by placing a belt on the wheels, he could 
turn the grindstone with his foot. 

After that, Robinson Crusoe’s tools 
were no longer dull. He could hold them 
in his hands and grind them, while he 
turned the stone with his foot. He could 
work much better with his tools. 



About this time, Robinson Crusoe be- 
gan to think of making a boat. He was 
thankful for God’s care over him since he 
had been upon the island. But he often 
grew very, very lonely. Then he wanted 
to go away from the island. He would 
need a big boat, if he was to try to leave 
the island. 

Robinson Crusoe looked and looked for 
a ship, but no ship came. So he thought 
he would try to make a boat big enough 
to take him away from the island. 

66 


After his crop of barley was gathered, 
Robinson Crusoe went to the woods, and 



“He Shaped It with His Ax and Hatchet.” 


there he found a great tree growing. He 
must make his boat as the savages make 
boats ; he must cut it out of a tree. 

With his ax, Robinson Crusoe cut down 
the big tree. Then he cut from it, a piece 
as long as he wanted his boat to be. It 
was a very big tree, and it took many days 
to cut the great piece for his boat. After 
the piece was cut, he shaped it with his 

67 


ax and his hatchet, like the outside of a 
boat. Then he cut away the inside a 
little bit at a time. 

It took Robinson Crusoe four or five 
months to make his boat. The four or 
five months seemed like a long time to 
Robinson Crusoe. But he was well pleased 
with the boat when it was finished. It 
would be dry; no water could get, in to 
wet it. 

46 

For four or five months, Robinson 
Crusoe worked to shape his boat from the 
tree. But how was he to get it to the 
water ? Here was a new trouble ! When 
the boat was made, Robinson Crusoe found 
that it was too big to move. 

In every way that he could think of, 
Robinson Crusoe tried to get the boat to 
the shore, but he could not move it. Then 
he tried to dig a canal, but the boat was 
too far from the water. He could not dig 
the canal. It would take him many years 
68 


to dig a canal big enough to float his boat 
to the shore. 

At last, Robinson Crusoe had to give 
up. He could do nothing with the boat. 
He could not use it upon dry land; he 
could not dig a canal big enough to float 
it to the water. All his hard work was lost ! 

Foolish Robinson Crusoe ! He had not 
thought about getting his boat to the 
water, when he cut down the big tree. 
But he had learned one thing. He had 
learned to think before he began to work. 

Robinson Crusoe did not like to give 
up his boat and stay on the island. But 
he went back to his work, and was thankful 
that he still had food to cook, and his flock 
of goats to watch. After awhile he began 
to be as happy and as thankful as he had 
been before he thought about the boat. 


69 


- 47 - 




When the sun was shining, it was very 
hot on Robinson Crusoe’s island. The sun 
almost burned him when he 
went outside his tent. 

Robinson Crusoe had 
now been upon the island 
almost five years. He could 
tell how long he had 
been there, by his 
calendar. He had 
marked it with a notch 
' almost every day. 
Robinson Crusoe’s 
clothing was all worn 
out. But he must 
have clothing. He 
needed it to keep the hot sun from burn- 
ing him. 

There was no cloth on the island, but 
Robinson Crusoe had the soft skins that he 
had dried in the sun. He must make his 
clothing from skins. Hehadnoclothtouse. 

70 



“He Must Make His Clothing • 
from Skins.” 


First of all, Robinson Crusoe made a 
round cap from a piece of one of the skins. 
Then, after much trouble, he made some 
clothing. His clothing was in two pieces; 
a jacket, and a pair of breeches. It took 
a long time to make these, for Robinson 
Crusoe was not used to this kind of work. 

When the cap and the clothing were 
made, they were very queer in shape. But 
they could be worn, and they would keep 
the hot sun from burning him.

finished making 


71 


his cap and his clothing, he wanted some- 
thing more to keep the hot sun from his 
head. He wanted an umbrella to carry 
over his head. He knew the umbrella 
would be hard to make. It would be 
more trouble to make, than both the 
jacket and the breeches had been. 

With his knife, Robinson Crusoe made 
the frame of the umbrella from sticks. He 
would cover the frame with skins. But 
first he must make the frame so that it 
would open and close. Then he could 
carry it better. 

Robinson Crusoe did not work four or 
five months on his umbrella as he did on 
his boat; but he worked a very long time. 
He made two or three frames which he 
tossed away, before he got one to open 
and close. 

At last the umbrella was finished, as 
he wanted to have it, for Robinson 
Crusoe would not give up. The frame 
was shaped and the cover put on, 

72 


and the umbrella would open and close. 
It was like nothing that Robinson Crusoe 
ever had seen before, but it would keep 
off the sun or the rain. 


- 49 - 

This is the way Robinson Crusoe looked 
when he put on his new 
clothing. His cap was round 
and high, with a long piece 
at the back to keep off the 
sun or the rain. His 
clothing, like his cap, 
was made with the hair 
left on the skins. The hair 
was on the outside, 
so the rain would run 
off. The clothing was in 
two pieces; a goat’s skin 
jacket, and goat’s 
skin breeches 
that had little 

“This Is the Way Robinson Crusoe shaOC tO them. 
Looked.” ^ 

73 



Around his jacket, Robinson Crusoe 
wore a belt, to carry his hatchet, and his 
powder and shot in. On his back he had 
a basket, in one hand a gun, and in the 
other hand, the goat-skin umbrella. 

Robinson Crusoe laughed when he 
looked at himself. He laughed at his 
queer breeches, and at his very queer 
umbrella. They did not look much like 
his English clothing. He wondered what 
the people of his country would think, if 
they could see him dressed as he was 
dressed now. 

But there was no one on the island to 
see him. He had made his new clothing 
the best that he could. 



- 50 - 


When Robinson Crusoe 
was ship-wrecked on 
the island, he was 
I afraid he would find 
nothing to eat. 



/ 




Now he had meat 
and eggs; he had 
milk, butter 
and cheese, raisins and fruit. 

From his barley, he had 
meal for bread and 
cakes. 

Robinson Crusoe was very thankful 
for all these good things. He was thank- 
ful, too, that he had his cats and dog, 
his goat and parrot. They made a queer 
family. 

When he sat down to eat, the dog was 
always at his right hand. The two cats 
sat, one on each 
side of the table. 

Poll, alone, could 
talk to Robinson 
Crusoe, and he 
was very glad to 
have Poll talk. 

His dog was get- 


75 


ting very old, for Robinson Crusoe had 
now been upon the island many years. 

During these years, Robinson Crusoe 
had learned many things. Best of all, he 
had learned to love God, and to thank 
Him for His care. 



“He Heard Someone Call, ‘Robin, Robin Crusoe!’” 

One day Robinson Crusoe put on his 
new cap and clothing, took his umbrella 

76 


to keep off the burning sun, and went to 
see his bower. He put his powder and 
hatchet in the belt that he wore over his 
jacket, and took his gun in his hand. 
Robinson Crusoe had to laugh when he 
looked down at the queer breeches he wore, 
but they would keep off the sun or the rain. 

The day was very hot, and when Rob- 
inson Crusoe got to his bower, he was worn 
out with the long walk. He thought he 
would lie down. He would lie down in 
his old tent and sleep. 

He had slept but a little while when 
he heard some one call, “Robin, Robin 
Crusoe.” 

Oh, how surprised Robinson Crusoe 
was ! He was too much surprised to move. 
And he was frightened, too. Then he 
listened. 

“Robin, Robin Crusoe!” he heard some 
one say again. Then he looked around, 
and saw that it was Poll! 


77 


Robinson Crusoe did not know how the 
parrot came to be there. But, oh, how 
the queer bird had frightened him. 

52 

For many months and years Robinson 
Crusoe lived quietly upon the island. He 



“He Saw the Print of a Foot in the Sand.” 

went hunting and fishing; he took care of 
his corn and of his raisins; he made 
baskets and dishes as he needed them. 

Robinson Crusoe had worn his clothing 
of skins a long time and was used to the 
78 


queer way that he was dressed. He had 
used his umbrella very often. It kept the 
rain and the hot, burning sun from his head. 

He lived very quietly for many years. 
But one day something very strange hap- 
dened. Something so strange happened 
that it frightened Robinson Crusoe more 
than he had ever been frightened before. 

Robinson Crusoe had often gone around 
to the shore on the other side of the island. 
But one day, as he walked there near the 
water, he saw the print of a foot in the 
sand. It was the print of a man’s foot, 
but Robinson Crusoe had not made it. 
Some other man had left the print of his 
foot in the sand. 

Now Robinson Crusoe was frightened! 
How had this happened? He could not 
tell. He looked all about; he thought 
some one must be near. But he could see 
no one; he heard no one. 

Then Robinson Crusoe ran! He ran 
as fast as he could to his home. As he 


79 


ran, he kept looking back. He thought 
every tree was a man. 


- 53 - 


At last Robinson Crusoe got home and 
was safe inside his wall. But he could 

not sleep 
that night. 
He lay in 
his ham- 
mock and listened to every 
sound. He kept thinking 
of the foot-print in the 
sand. Someone had walked 
there, and who could it be? 
For a long time Robinson Crusoe 
stayed inside his house. He stayed inside 
and made his wall stronger, and he made 
places in the wall to shoot through. 

When he did go outside again, he 
carried his guns and he kept looking about. 
He knew that someone had been upon the 
island, but he did not know who. He could 
80 



“He Saw Some 
Canoes.” 


think of nothing but the man’s foot-print 
on the sand. At every sound, he ran 
back to his cave. Then he hid, and 
listened. 

But Robinson Crusoe saw nothing more 
to make him afraid. He lived quietly 
again for a long time. But when he 
walked about the island, as he had done 
before, he always wore his sword in his 
belt and carried plenty of guns. He never 
could tell when he would need them. 

One day, when Robinson Crusoe was 
looking out over the deep water, he saw 
some canoes. There were men in the 
canoes, and they were coming to the 
island. Robinson Crusoe kept himself 
hidden. He was glad now, that he had 
made his wall stronger. 

54 

When the canoes came near, Robinson 
Crusoe could see that the men in them 
were savages. They wore no clothing 
81 


and they had no guns, but they carried 
bows and arrows, and they were coming 
on shore. 

Robinson Crusoe ran to his strong wall. 
He stayed there and listened a long time, 
but he heard no sound. 

After a time he climbed over the wall 
and went out where he could lie upon the 

^ ground and see the savages again. 

But he kept himself hidden from 
1. He was not as fright- 
1 as when he saw the print 
le man’s foot in the sand. 
Robinson Crusoe 
could see the savages 
through the trees. 
They carried their 
bows and arrows 
when they left the 
canoes, and they had 
two prisoners with 
them. Just as Robinson Crusoe looked, 
one of the prisoners got away. He ran 
82 



The Prisoner Ran Fast. 


very fast and came toward the place where 
Robinson Crusoe was hidden. The sav- 
ages ran after him, but he could run faster 
than they, and they could not catch him. 

Robinson Crusoe thought, “If I can 
save this man from the savages, he can 
stay with me and live on the island. He 
can be my servant. Then I will not be 
alone.” 

The prisoner ran fast, and when the 
savages saw that they could not catch 
him, they went back to the shore. 

Then Robinson Crusoe called to the 
man, and made signs for him to come to 
him. He took him inside his strong wall, 
and gave him bread and raisins, and water 
to drink. 

The prisoner was glad to get away 
from the savages. He liked Robinson 
Crusoe, but he could talk to him only 
in signs. 

After a time, the savages got into their 
canoes and left the island. 


83 


55 

Robinson Crusoe named his servant 
Friday. He was thankful that he had 



“By This Sign He Told Robinson Crusoe That He 
Would Always Be His Servant.” 


someone on the island with him. And 
Friday was glad the savages did not 
catch him; he wanted to stay on the 
island. 

Friday tried to tell Robinson Crusoe 
that he would be his servant, but he could 
not talk in the white man’s language. He 
put his head on the ground, then he put 

84 


Robinson Crusoe’s foot on his head. By 
this sign, he told Robinson Crusoe that he 
would always be his servant. 

Friday wore no clothing, and he did 
not know what a gun was. But he could 
use a bow and arrow, and Robinson 
Crusoe could teach him to talk in his 
language. 

Robinson Crusoe named his man Fri- 
day, for it was on that day that he came 
to him. It had been twenty-five years 
since Robinson Crusoe was ship-wrecked. 
Now he was pleased at what had hap- 
pened. He had lived twenty-five years 
alone on the island when Friday came 
to him. 


56 

During all the twenty-five years that 
Robinson Crusoe had been alone on 
the island, he had wanted someone to 
talk with him. Now he liked to hear 
Friday talk, but he could not understand 
85 


him. He would teach Friday to talk in 
English. 

Robinson Crusoe could understand the 


signs that Friday 
make Friday under- 


made, and he could 
stand some things. 
Friday learned 
fast. He kept 
trying to talk just 
as Robinson Cru- 
soe did. 

Friday liked 
the way Robin- 
son Crusoe lived, 
and he was glad 
he got away from 
the savages. 
When Friday put 
his head on the 
sand and put 
Robinson Cru- 
soe’s foot on his 
head, he told Robinson Crusoe that he 
would always be his servant. 

86 



“It Was the First Clothing Friday Ever 
Had Worn.” 


Robinson Crusoe gave Friday a good 
bed to sleep in at nigbt, and he made him 
clothing to wear. At first it was a great 
trouble to Friday to wear clothing, for he 
was not used to it. It was the first cloth- 
ing F riday ever had worn. But he wanted 
to be dressed like Robinson Crusoe. 

Robinson Crusoe wanted to teach 
Friday how white men live and work. 
He wanted him to understand all their 
ways. 

Friday soon learned to talk a little in 
Robinson Crusoe’s language. He learned 
to call Robinson Crusoe “master” and 
to say “yes” and “no”. He learned the 
English names of many things. 

57 

One day Robinson Crusoe took Friday 
hunting. Friday took his own* bow and 
arrows; he was afraid of a gun. He 
could not understand how it could shoot. 

87 


He talked to the gun in his own language, 
and told it not to shoot him. 

Friday kept trying to understand about 
the white man’s gun. He asked his master 



“He Would Place Little Stones on the Ground." 


many things about it. It was not at all 
like his own bow and arrows, and for a 
long time he was afraid of it. 

While they were hunting, Robinson 
Crusoe shot a goat, and after he had 
dressed it, he took part of it home. He 
88 


cooked the meat and taught his servant 
how the white men cook and bake their 
food. Friday liked to live as the white 
men live. He told Robinson Crusoe the 
meat was very good. 

When Friday wanted to tell Robinson 
Crusoe about any number, he would place 
little stones on the ground. If he wanted 
to say twenty, he would place twenty 
stones on the ground. Then Robinson 
Crusoe would say “twenty,” and Friday 
would say it after him. This was the 
way he learned all new words. 

When he had learned to talk more, 
Friday told Robinson Crusoe about his 
people. Friday’s people were savages, 
but they were not the savages that had 
taken him a prisoner. 


89 


58 

Friday was happy with his white mas- 
ter. His own people were dark. They 
had very dark skins, and they did not live 
nor work as Robinson Crusoe did. 

After a time, Friday learned to spade 
the ground and to make a hedge, and he 
learned to plant the barley. When the 
barley was ripe, Robinson Crusoe taught 
him to niake it into meal. Robinson 
Crusoe taught him, too, how to bake 
his bread. 

Friday could soon do every kind of 
work that was given him to do. He 
wanted to do all that Robinson Crusoe 
told him. But Robinson Crusoe could 
not teach Friday to eat salt on his food. 
Friday did not like salt. 

For a long time Friday liked to count 
with stones better than with words. He 
liked to put down the stones and have 
Robinson Crusoe count them. But after 
a time he learned to count in words. 


90 


During the first year, Friday learned 
the name of everything about him. This 
was a pleasant year for Robinson Crusoe. 
It was pleasant to have someone to help 
him when he worked, and pleasant to have 
someone to talk with him. 

Friday was a good servant. He did 
all that was given him to do, and he was 
always merry and happy. 


59 



“It Was a Fine Boat.’” 


One day Robinson Crusoe made Friday 
understand that he wanted a boat. He 

91 


wanted a fine boat that could take them 
both away from the island. 

They must first find a tree that was 
near enough to the water. Robinson 
Crusoe thought of the other boat that he 
made. He would do better this time. 

In his own country Friday had made 
boats from trees. When he knew what 
Robinson Crusoe wanted, he found a good 
tree, and cut it down with his master’s ax. 
Friday had learned to use white men’s 
tools, and he had learned the names of 
the tools. 

Robinson Crusoe and Friday worked a 
month to finish their boat. It was a fine 
boat, and big enough to hold twenty 
people. 

While they worked at the boat, Robin- 
son Crusoe told Friday about his country 
and his people. He told him about the 
fine ships of the white men, with their big 
sails. Friday never had seen a boat with 

92 


a sail. He liked to have his master tell 
him of his English home. He was always 
merry and happy. 


60 

In a year or two Friday had learned 
to talk and to understand nearly all that 
Robinson Crusoe said to him. Robinson 
Crusoe told Friday about his coming to 
the island ; about his ship which was 
wrecked, and about his living there all 
alone for so many years. 

Friday had learned to shoot with the 
guns and was not afraid of them any 
more. He had learned, too, to use 
Robinson Crusoe’s tools; but best of all, 
he liked a knife which Robinson Crusoe 
had given him. It was a good knife and 
Friday liked it better than any of Robin- 
son Crusoe’s tools or guns. 

Nearly every day since coming to the 
island, Robinson Crusoe had cut a notch 
in his calendar. He did not often forget. 

93 


He had now been upon the island for 
more than twenty-five years. 

Ever since he had been ship-wrecked 
he had looked and hoped for a ship, but 
only the dark savages, with their canoes, 
had visited his island. But Robinson 
Crusoe was glad the savages had come. 
If they had not visited his island, he would 
not have had his man Friday. It was not 
nearly so lonely after Friday came. 

Friday was a good servant. He loved 
Robinson Crusoe and wanted to please 
him. Robinson Crusoe taught Friday 
about God. He read to him from his 
Bible. He taught him about God’s love 
and God’s care. 


61 

Friday knew that Robinson Crusoe 
always hoped for a ship to come from his 
country, and one day, when Friday had 
been living with him for three years, some- 
thing fine happened. Friday had gone 

94 


down to the shore to look for turtles, when 
he saw a big ship. It was like the ships 
of the English people, and a 
small boat was coming from it 
to the shore. 

Friday ran to Robin- 
son Crusoe and told him 
about the ship, and oh! 
how surprised and 
happy Robinson 
Crusoe was. 

Both Robinson 
Crusoe and Friday 
watched the great 
ship, and they 
watched the small Happened.” 

boat that was coming toward the island. 
The small boat was quite near enough for 
Robinson Crusoe to count the number of 
people in it. 

Robinson Crusoe’s thoughts were very 
pleasant. Perhaps these people might be 
95 



willing to take him back to his country. 
He would soon find out. 

Friday looked in surprise at the fine, 
big ship. He never had seen any ship 
like it. The dark people of his country 
had no great ships. They made their 
boats from trees and burned out the in- 
side with fire. His people never visited 
any country that was far away. Their 
boats were not big enough. 

Friday looked in surprise at the great 
ship on the water. What big, big sails it 
had! Perhaps Robinson Crusoe would 
take him to the ship. 

62 

When the little boat landed at the 
island, both Robinson Crusoe and Friday 
went down to the shore and talked to the 
men who had come in the boat. The men 
were surprised to find any one on the 
island. 

One of the men in the boat was the 
captain of the fine big ship. He was in 
96 


trouble with his men. They were going 
to leave him on the island and go away 
again. 



Robinson Crusoe talked with the cap- 
tain and promised to help him. Then 
Robinson Crusoe and Friday and the 

97 


captain took the other men prisoners. 
After that the captain could go safely back 
to his ship again. 

Robinson Crusoe told the captain about 
his coming to the island twenty-eight years 
before. He told him about his living there 
alone, nearly all of that time. He said he 
had kept hoping to see someone from his 
country, but no one but the savages had 
visited the island. Then Robinson Crusoe 
took the captain to his tent, and the 
captain saw his strong wall and his cave, 
and all his goods. The captain was 
surprised to see such a pleasant place. 
He had thought that no one lived on the 
island. 

The men on the ship, who had wanted 
to make trouble for the captain, were afraid 
when they saw that he had found other 
men to help him. They promised to do 
all that the captain asked. 


98 


63 



“And Then the Beautiful English Ship Took Robinson Crusoe 
Back to His Own Country.” 


The captain was very thankful to 
Robinson Crusoe for helping him out of 

99 



his trouble. He asked Robinson Crusoe 
what he could do for him, in return for his 
help. 

Robinson Crusoe told the captain that 
he still wanted to go back to his English 
home, and the captain gladly promised to 
take him there. 

So Robinson Crusoe got ready to leave 
the island that he had lived upon so long. 
He took with him, for relics, the goat- 
skin cap and the queer umbrella that he 
had made, and his parrot. He wanted 
to keep these relics of the strange life he 
had lived for so many years. 

He left the island with a thankful 
heart, and he and Friday went on board 
the ship. And then the beautiful English 
ship spread its great white sails, and took 
Robinson Crusoe back to his own country.

Suggestions to Teachers 


During the time that the children are studying the Robinson Crusoe 
Reader, it is the intention of the author that they shall, in so far as is practi- 
cable, live Robinson Crusoe’s life in the school room. There is no child’s 
classic which so brings them into touch with the primitive life of man, 
nor which so forcibly brings before them man’s physical requirements and 
the steps involved in their attainment, as does DeFoe’s Robinson Crusoe. 
All this will be made doubly real and interesting to them, if they are allowed 
to carry out the drama for themselves. To this end, every suitable means 
which the teacher can devise should be used to enable the children to enter 
personally into all the trials and triumphs of DeFoe’s hero. 

Lesson 1. For industrial work connected with this lesson, let the 
children make drawings of Robinson Crusoe’s home, of the ship, and of 
Crusoe running to the ship. Let them cut and fold these objects from paper, 
and fashion them from sticks. Let them model the hull of a ship and add 
paper sails; also have them talk of the sea and of ships, and tell what they 
can about each. Let them choose one of their number to pose as Robinson 
Crusoe running to the ship. Make use of the sand table to picture the 
s.cene, dressing a figure of Robinson Crusoe in the costume of the time. 

Lessons 2 and 3. Have the children draw a ship on rough water. 
Have them model a ship for their sand table, with figure of Robinson Crusoe 
upon it, — the ship sailing away from the shore. Cut the different objects 
from colored paper and paste to make a poster picture of the lesson. Explain 
about the ships of Crusoe’s time, and compare them with those of the 
present time : sails vs. steam. 

Lesson 4. Let the children make a drawing of smooth water, and one 
with waves. Let them draw the ship on quiet water, and again when the 
waves are dashing. Have them imitate the sound of the wind and the 
motion of the waves. Have them close their eyes and imagine themselves 
upon the ship; then tell the story in their own words, making complete 
sentences to be written upon the blackboard. 

101 


Game: Choose one boy for Crusoe, and other children to represent the 
waves. Let them join hands and circle quietly around Crusoe, then dance 
around, waving their arms, to represent the storm. Crusoe should first 
show gladness, then fear. 

Lesson 5-7. In connection with these lessons, let the children use 
the sand table making Crusoe’s island. Have them make drawings of 
the shore, of the big waves, and of the tree*which was Crusoe’s bed. Show 
them a picture of a storm at sea. Have them close their eyes and form a 
mind-picture of the ship-wreck, and of Robinson Crusoe’s reaching the land. 
Then let them tell the story in their own words, placing well-formed sentences 
upon the board. Have them paint a picture of the shore of Crusoe’s island, 
with the trees and the blue water, or cut same from colored paper. 

Lessons 8-10. Explain to the children about the tides, then have 
them tell the story of these lessons. Have them make drawings of the broken 
ship and of the quiet water, and let them picture Crusoe swimming to the 
ship. In various ways, have them reproduce his rafts, by drawing, paper 
cutting, and the use of sticks. Have them use the sand table as often as 
possible, using an old mirrow, or piece of bright tin, for the sea, and making 
the island of sand upon its surface. Have them make a raft for the sand 
table, and model various foods and tools to place upon it. Place the wrecked 
ship near the island, with its sails broken down. Have one child pose as 
Crusoe, making raft. 

Lessons 11 and 12. Have the children draw, cut and model the cats, 
dog and guns mentioned in these lessons. Let them guess why Crusoe 
wanted the guns, and why he wanted the sails. (Lesson 14 tells.) Have 
them tell the story of the rescue of the dog and cats, or vary this by having 
one child take the part of the dog, another, one of the cats, and a third, 
Robinson Crusoe; then let each one tell his individual story of the ship- 
wreck and rescue. 

Game: Have three children personate the dog and cats, and let Robin- 
son Crusoe find them upon the ship. He should pose in such a way as to 
express his surprise and pleasure. 

Lessons 13 and 14. Have the children draw, paint or cut from colored 
paper, a picture of Crusoe sitting on shore, his ship gone. Also have them 

102 


make a drawing of his tent by the rock, with its wall. Have them cut and 
fold tents from paper, and let them tell something of tents that they have 
seen. Have them make hammocks, and picture them. These lessons afford 
excellent opportunities for the use of the sand table. Have the children 
fashion the island with its great rock, a cliff or shelf of rock, rather than a 
great stone, and set up a tent of paper, before it. Then let them make a 
wall around the tent, from any small objects such as blocks or pebbles to 
represent casks and boxes from the ship. 

Lessons 15 and 16. Have the children make drawings of Crusoe 
going hunting; of bistable and chair; also fashion the latter from sticks, or 
cut them from paper. If the shapes are “queer,” Robinson Crusoe’s were 
also, but he “did the best that he could.” Try to have the children imitate 
this spirit in their work. 

With the same mediums, let the children make Robinson Crusoe’s spade, 
and have them tell where he found his materials, and how he made his chair, 
table and spade, tracing the work, step by step. Some one of the class may 
be able to whittle a small spade from wood, to be used on the sand table. 

Pose: Let one of the boys bring a toy gun to school, and personate 
Crusoe going hunting. 

Lessons 17 and 18. Have the children dig a cave in the sand table. 
Let them reproduce Crusoe’s house of two rooms, the cave and the tent, 
and furnish the tent with table, chair and hammock. Have them tell where 
they think Crusoe got the posts and boards to prop up his roof. Let them 
make drawings of the house on the island, and [describe it in well-formed 
sentences. 

Tell them something of men’s dwellings from early times — caves in cliffs, 
skin-covered tents of North American Indians, snow houses of Eskimos — 
illustrating the use of the material at hand. 

Lessons 19 and 20. How did Crusoe get the pretty fur rug for 
his tent? Let the children tell. Let them tell, also, how he got boards 
for his shelves, and describe the work he had to do to obtain one board. 
Have them tell of Crusoe’s family, and reproduce from memory, drawings of 
the fowl and wild-cat. Have them cut from paper, or paint, an illustration 

103 


of Crusoe shooting the fowl; also making his chair, and chopping trees. 
Let them pose for these. 

Lessons 21-23. On the sand table, have the children make a wall 
about the tent, using sticks for posts. Have them make a ladder from stiff 
paper, or from small sticks glued, to use on the wall. For language work 
have them describe the different steps of the work Crusoe had to do to make 
his wall; also describe the manher in which he used his ladder, and tell why 
he wanted a ladder instead of a door. Tell the children something of the 
old walled cities — the walls for the protection of the inhabitants. 

In connection with lesson 21, have the children model a goat to add to 
Crusoe’s sand table family. If any child in the room owns a goat, let him 
bring it to the school yard for the children to see. 

Lesson 24. In connection with this lesson, have the children draw, 
cut from paper and model from clay, Robinson Crusoe’s books and his light. 
After they have modeled small dishes, place a bit of wicking in each. Upon 
your own desk, place a real light of this kind, and have it burning. Have 
the children trace the steps by which Crusoe secured his light. Tell them 
about various kinds of lights, describing the making of a candle, first by 
dipping, then by casting in moulds. Explain the “trying out” of the fat. 
Also mention the methods of lighting which have followed the use of candles, 
and tell something of each, without going into difficult details. 

Pose: Improvise a tent, and let one of the boys sit inside it, reading by 
the light. The tent can be used for many different pictures, having the 
children represent Crusoe at his various tasks, either inside the tent, or just 
outside its opening. 

Lessons 25-27. Have the children reproduce Crusoe’s little bag and 
the bits of grain, in various mediums. Have them make drawings of the 
barley growing, and finally of the ripened heads of grain, bringing out the 
point of the multiplied grains produced from a single seed, so showing why 
Crusoe planted his barley over and over, before he could use it for food. 

Bring to school, pictures of planting, reaping, etc., including a copy of 
Millet’s “The Gleaners,” and talk about the pictures. Also talk to the 
children about the growth of grains and their uses. Have them recite 
verses or sing songs pertaining to the subject. Teach them how im- 

104 


possible it would be for any man to make the seed, or to cause it to grow, 
and so show them Crusoe’s dependence on God’s care. Have the children 
tell of the many ways in which God had cared for and protected Crusoe, and 
make a list on the blackboard. Show them the uselessness of money, of 
itself. 

On the sand table, place bits of green near the rock, or better still, 
prepare a bit of soil and plant a few seeds of barley or other grain, that the 
children may watch them grow. 

Lessons 28 and 29. Have the children picture the sword with which 
Crusoe cut his grain. Tell them something of the progress in methods of 
cutting grain, from the sickle to the modern mower. Have them model 
turtles from clay, then tell something of the turtles and their use as food. 
For language work, have them tell the story of the grain, step by step. (In 
DeFoe’s narrative, Crusoe uses the term “corn” as we do “grain.” It was 
actually barley, as he explains.) Have the children make drawings of Crusoe 
cutting the grain with his sword. Let one child present a series of pictures 
of Crusoe at work, by posing as though spading the ground, sowing the seed, 
or cutting the ripened grain. 

Lesson 30. The children will enjoy making a calendar like Crusoe’s, 
and marking or cutting the days of a week upon it. Have different children 
personate Crusoe talking to his dog, and let them tell the stories mentioned 
in the lesson. For language lessons, have them describe Crusoe’s calendar, 
and tell what they can about a calendar, and how time is marked by it. 
Have them set up a calendar like Crusoe’s upon the sand table. 

Lessons 31-33. Let the children make drawings of the fruit Crusoe 
found; also have them model the fruit from clay. Let them use the sand 
table and reproduce this part of the island as realistically as possible, making 
the bower, with its tent, the fruit trees and vines. 

Describe to the children the process of making raisins from grapes, then 
have the children tell how Crusoe’s raisins were made. 

Let a child pose as Crusoe discovering the fruit. 

Lessons 34-36. Let the children model a parrot and the different 
members of Crusoe’s family. From paper, have them cut Poll and his cage, 

105 


using colored paper if available. Allow the children to tell a few stories of 
pet parrots. 

Have one of the children personate Crusoe at his tent door, weaving 
his basket from twigs. Follow this by a lesson in weaving. Tell the 
children something of Indian basket weaving. Baskets were one of the first 
receptacles made by primitive man. Teach the children the lesson of 
Crusoe’s perseverance. It will help them in their work. Have them 
enumerate some of the uses Crusoe had for his baskets. 

Lessons 37 and 38. Tell the children something about traps and 
trapping; then have them tell of Crusoe’s flock of goats, and what they can 
about traps. After reading the first paragraph of lesson 34, have them guess 
what else Crusoe had for food after he learned to milk the goats. Tell them 
something of the process of butter-making and cheese-making. 

Lessons 39-41. Have the children name the reasonf Crusoe had for 
feeling sorrowful, then the reasons he had for feeling thankful. Write these 
in separate lists upon the blackboard. 

Have the children model dishes from clay, imagining themselves ship- 
wrecked on Crusoe’s island. Let them tell what they have to put into the 
dishes. Make a point of Crusoe’s perseverance in spite of mishaps. Tell 
them the story of a dish, beginning with the clay taken from the earth. 
Use pictures, stories, poems or songs relating to the potter and the potter’s 
wheel. If possible, take the children to visit a pottery, showing them the 
wheels and kilns. Show them the difference between the baked and the 
unbaked clay, using a dish that they have modeled, and any piece of earthen- 
ware that has been fired. Afterward, have the children describe the making 
of a dish. 

Lessons 42 and 43. Have the children reproduce with various mediums, 
Crusoe’s hatchet and his hard-wodd dish. Have them make a model of his 
oVen. Explain to them more fully, how he could bake with it. Then let 
the children tell all that Crusoe had to do before his bread was ready to eat, 
beginning with the barley. They ,can dramatize the various steps of the 
process. 

Lesson 44. In connection with this lesson, improvise a grindstone and 
show its use. Robinson Crusoe’s device for turning the stone with his foot 

106 


may be made plain by having the children notice the wheels, treadle and belt of 
a sewing machine. This they can do at home. The boys can tell something 
about working with dull tools. Have them tell some of the purposes for 
which Crusoe had used his tools. When it became necessary for Crusoe to 
use his grindstone, “he found away.” Impress the children with Crusoe’s 
spirit, of “never give up.” 

Lessons 45 and 46. In connection with these lessons, the children 
can draw, cut and model the boat that Crusoe made. Let them tell the 
steps of the work from growing tree to finished boat. Describe a canal, then 
have the children tell the story of Crusoe’s boat, and of the lesson he learned 
from making it. Place a model of the boat on sand table. Make the be- 
ginning of a canal. 

Lessons 47-49. Let the children make a drawing of Crusoe’s umbrella. 
Have them tell the story of his clothing, tracing it from the animals that 
roamed about the island. Have them close their eyes and picture to them- 
selves Crusoe, dressed in skins; then have them give a description of his 
appearance, in well formed sentences. 

If a doll or model has been used upon the sand table, its clothing should 
be made to conform to Crusoe’s present costume. Have some of the chil- 
dren pose as Crusoe making his clothing, or working at his umbrella. 

Lessons 50-52. Let the children give a description of Crusoe’s family 
at dinner. Have them tell the story of Poll’s frightening Crusoe ; also the 
story of his greater fright at sight of the foot-print in the sand. Explain 
to the children why Crusoe was so afraid. 

On the sand table, have the children imitate a foot-print ; they can also 
make an impression of a foot in clay. One child may pose as Crusoe dis- 
covering the foot-print. Then let them paint an illustration of the lesson in 
colors, or cut the picture from paper. 

Have two children personate Crusoe and Poll, when Poll frightened 
Crusoe at his bower. 

Lessons 53 and 54. In connection with these lessons, have the chil- 
dren make drawings of canoes, also have them fashion canoes from paper or from 
birch bark if obtainable. Explain to them something of the construction of 

107 


a canoe, and of the manner in which it is propelled. Let them make draw- 
ings of bows and arrows, and fashion them from bits of wood and string. If 
any member of the class has a good bow and arrow, let him bring it and 
show it to the class. Show why primitive races could make bows and 
arrows, but not guns. Have the children reproduce Crusoe’s thick wall, 
upon the sand table, with sticks through openings to simulate guns. Place 
several canoes at the water’s edge. 

Let the children tell the story of the landing of the savages, and of the 
escape of the prisoner. 

Lessons 55-57. A new figure, that of Friday, must now be added to 
the sand table group. Have the children illustrate, by paper cutting or 
drawing, Friday’s manner of telling Crusoe that he would be his servant. A 
skillful child may be able to model the figures of Crusoe and Friday in this 
attitude, for the sand table. Have the children count with stones, and let 
two of them personate Friday counting with stones and Crusoe watching him. 

As a language lesson, have them tell about Friday and the guns. The 
children can pose in illustration of this, also. 

Lessons 58-60. As Crusoe teaches Friday to do the work that he has 
learned to do, the children can be reviewed in their industrial work, and can 
be shown the improvement that they have made, just as Crusoe learned by 
practice to do his work better. 

Let the children tell the new things that Friday learned, among other 
things, his knowledge of God. Make a list on the blackboard, so that the 
children will be impressed with the difference between the savage and even 
the primitive civilized life. 

Lessons 61-63. Give a brief description of a mutiny, so that the 
children will better understand the captain’s trouble. Be sure the children 
understand the meaning of the word “relic.” Let them imagine to them- 
selves, Friday’s surprise upon going aboard the great ship; then let them tell of 
it. Have them describe Crusoe’s departure from the island. For a drawing 
lesson, have them picture the big ship with Crusoe and Friday on board, 
waving farewell to the island.
