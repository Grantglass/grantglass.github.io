gained a very plentiful foTtTine. He manied my 
mother at York, who received her iirft brfath in 
that country: and as her maiden name was Sobiti- 
foiiy I was called Robinfon Kreutznaer; which not 
being eafily pronounced in the Englitli tongue, vce 
ate commonly known by the name of Crufoe.

both my repentance and my good refolutions, for- 
getting entirely the vows and promifes I made in 
iny di(lrer&: and whenever any ic(lc6t ions wouid 
return on me, what by company, and what by 
drinking, I foon maftered tbofe fits, as I deridingly 
called them. But this only made way for another

1 thought at firft to return home, but fliame op* 

f>ored that good motion, as thinking t (hould be 
aughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So 
flrange is the nature of vouth, who are not aftumed 
to fm, but yet aQiamed to repent; and fo far from 
being afhamed* of thofe aAions for which they may 
be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to 
their duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom. 
In f^orty I travelled up to London, refolving upo|i a 
voyage; and a voyage 1 foon heard of, by my aci- 
quaintance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to 
go to the coaft of Guihea. Having fome money, 
and 2tppeaiing like a gentleman, I went on board not 
as a common faitor or foremafl[*man , n^y, the com- 
xnaddcr agreed I fliould go that voyage with him with- 
out any expence ; that I (hoiild be his mdTtnate and 
companion,and 1 was very welcome to carry any thip|[ 
with me, and make the $efl mercbandile T could. 

I bleiTed ray happy fortune, and humbly thanked 
my captatii forthis offer; and acquainting my ftiencis 
/ jn Yorkdiire, forty pounds were fent me, the greateft 
part of which my dear father and* mother contri- 
DOted to, with which 1 bought toys and trifles, as 
the captain directed me. My captain alfo' taught 
me navigation, how to keep an account of the ftip's 
courfCi take an obfervation, and led me into tiit 
knowledge of feveral ufeful branches cf the mathema- 
tics. And indeed this voyage made me both a failor 
and a merchant ; for 1 brought home five pounds 
nine ounces of gold dud for my adventure, which 
produced, at mv return to London, alraoft three hun- 
dred pounds. But in thi^ voy;ige 1 was extremc^y fick, 
being thrown into a violent calenture through ihe 
exceilivc heat, trading upon the coafl fiom the lati- 
tude of fifteeti degrees north- even to the line itftlf. 
But a!us ! my dear friend the c.ipt;an departed this 
life foon after his arrival. This was a fenfihtc ijricf 
to me, yet I refolved to go another voyage with his 
mate, who had now got the coomiand of the Ihip.

quired wealth, (fo that I had two hundred pound* 
left, which I repofed \v\it\ the captains widowyvho 
was ^h honeft gentlewoman) jret my rijisfortunes ia 
this unhappy Voyage wcr^ very great. For our (hip 
ftIUng,towafds'lhc Canary itidinHs, wc were chafed by 
z'Salee'Tovtr i and in fpite of all the hafte we could 
make, by ctoudiugas much canvas as our yards could

fo ih^jf we prepared ouuclvcs to fight. They had, 
eighteep'^guns. aiid we had but. twelve. About thrice, 
in the a6^erQOo<i| tliere was a defperate engagements 
wherein ifi^ny were Killed and wounded on both -

taking rroiice of me, kept me to be his own flavc. 

In this cpodition, I thought myfeif the mofl mi« 
ferablc ereature on earth, and the prophecy of my 
father came afrcfh into^ my thoughts. However, my 
condition was better than I thought it to te^as wiu 
foon appear* Some hopes indeed I had that my new. 
patron would go to Tea again, where he might be 
tkken^ by a Spanifh. or Portuguefe man of war, and 
then 1 ihould be fet at libetty. But in this I tvas. 
uiinakei;! ; for he never took me with. him, but left 
me to look after his little garden^ and do. the drudgery 
of his houfe^' and when he returned from Tea, would 
make me lie in ^he cabin', ^nd lopkafter the ihip. 1

dexterity in eatching the fifh, that he would often 
fend tne with a' Moor, who yas one of his kln(men^ 
and the Morefco yoifth, to catc ii a di(h of fi{h tor hina. 
One inorning. as we were at the fportj there arofe 
fuch a thick fog, that we loft fight of the flioce; and 
rowing we knew not wh^ch way, we laboured all the 
night and in' the morning found ourfelves in tlir 
ocean« two leagues from land. However, we atUined ' 
ttiere at length, and made the greater hafte, beCaufe. 
tfur ftomachs were eitceeding fliarp and hungry. In 
cirder to prevent fuch difaflcis fot the future my pa- 
tron ordered a carpenter to build a little ftatt-rdcm

hind it to fleer and to hale homethe main-(heet, with 
other convenicncics to keep him from theweathcr, as 
alfo locker* to put in all mjnncrof provifiohSj^i.tlVa

In this he frequently took us out a fefiiing ; aiid^

her ancient and pendants out, . and ' every* thing 
rendy ; but their minds altering, my patroti ordered 
us to go a fiQiing, For that his guefls would certainly 

. fup with him that night. 
' And now I began to think of my deliverance in* 
deed; In order fo this I perfuadcd (he Moor to get 
fome provifions ph board,, as not 4 'f^rig to meddle 
witli our patr6n*s; and he taking my advice, we 
flored ourfelves with rulk bifcuit, and three jars of 
water. Behdes, I privately conveyed into the boat 
a bottle of brandy, fome twine, thread, a hammer, 
hatchet, atid a fiw; and, in particular, fome bees«

the fea. But after fomc time, the lifing of the 
water caufed the raft to float again, and coming up 
a little river with land on both fides, I landed in a 
little cave, as near the mouth as poflible, the belter 
todifcovcr a fail, if any fuch fliould pais that way. 

Not far off, I cfpieda hill of a liupcndous hci^ht^ 
furrounded with leffer hills about it, and thither I" 
wasrcfolved to* go and view the country, that I 
might fee what part was beft to fix tny habitation. 
Accordingly, arming inyfelf with a piflol, a fowjir^g- 
piece» powder and ball, I afcended the mountain. 
There! perceived 1 wasin'anifland, encohipaffcd 
by the fea ; no diftant landtto be feen but.fcattenng 
rocks that lay to the weft s| that it feemed to be a 
barren place, and, as I thought, inhabited j^nly by 
xviid beaftf* I perceived abundance of fowls, but 
ignorant of what kind, or whether good for nou- 
rifhment, I ihot orie of them at my return, whic^ 
occafipned a confuted fcreaming among the other 
bivds; and I founc} it, by its colours and beak, to* 
be a kind of a hawk', but its fleLh was pcrfeft carrion. 

When I came to my raft, I brought my eff'efts otf. 
ftore, which work fpcnt that.day entirely; and fear*

got on board as beforr^ and prepared ^ fecond raft^ 
faifmore nice thail the iirft ; upon which J brought 
away the carpenter's ftores, two or three bags full 
of nails, a great jack-fcrew, a dozen ©r two of

foreiop-fail, a hatnmock, and. rome bedding; and 
thus completing my fecond c^rgb, I made all the 
haile to (hote I could, fearing fome wild beaft mi^ht 
deftroy what I had there already. But t Only found 
a little ivild cat, fitting on one of the chefls, which 
Hot fejeming to fear me, I threw her a piece of bil» 
tuit Which (he inftantty ate, and departed. 
' When 1 had gotten thefe cffcGtt on Ihore, T T^ent 
to ^ork, in order to tnnke m6 a little'tept with the 
fail and fome poles which I had cut for that purpofc; 
and having' fifnifhed it, what ^ings might be da* 
fiiagedby the weather I brought in, piling all the 
icmpty dhefts and ca(ks in a circle, the better to 
fortify it againft any fudden atteidpt pf tnah or beaft. 
Aftet this^ 1 blocked up the doors with fome boards* 
and an empty cheft turned the ion^waybut. I 
then charged my gun and piffbl, and laying my 5ed 
6n the ground, tlept as comfortably till next inorti*

twine, a barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a barrel 
of meal, three Calks of rum, and, what indeed, was 
moft welcoHle t<J me« a whole hogftiead of bread. 

The next time'I went, I cut the cables in pieces, 
carried off a hawfer whole, with a great deal of iron 
work, aiid made another raft with the mizen and

TKiiteen days I had now been on the iRandi and

and, at length, T refolved to do both: The man- 
ner or {®vtn of which will not^' I hope, be unplcafing 
toddcribe. ' './-'. 

When 1 confidercd the ground where I Was, thlit 
it was moorifii, and had no frefti water n*car it, my 
refolutions were to fcarch for a (oil healthy and well 
watei:ed, where I n)ight riot oviy be (heltered from

fituated,. as well as to be fccurtfd from wild men, 
and brails of prey, as more eafily to difcbvcir any 
diAant fail» fhould it ever fo happen. 

And, indeed, it was not long before I had my 
defire. J found a little plain near a rifing hiil, the 
front towards which being as fleep as a hbufe fide, • 
nothing could" defcend on me from the top. On th^ 
£de of this rock was a little hollow place, refem^ 
bling the cjntrahce ox ddor of a cave.- Juft before

a lillrfdred*'yai'ds* broad,' and about. rwic'e as Ion g^

Jainirig ten'yards in it& femi-diameter, and tweijty 
yards In the whole, driving two rows of flrong ftakes 
not. fix inches fr®rh each other.. "Then. with, the 
piecies of cable which I had cut on board, Lrcgu*

their tops)' which wei>e more than five feet put of 
the. ^atth> and after drove another row of pilef 
looking within fide againft them, between two. or 
three feet high, which made me conclude it a little 
im'preghable caftle for men and beafts. And for my 
better Iccurity Lwoukl have no dojpr, but entered 
in and catii^ out by the help of a ladder which I 
alfo made.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

v^ith. little air, obliged me, for the moft part, to keep 
tvithinddoi*«. 

Jan, I . StiU fultrjr, However, obliged by ncceffity, 
I went out with my gun^ and fourid agreat ftore of 
goats Jn the vallies : they where exceeding (by, nor 
could any iog hunt them down. 

Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was to 
Sni(b the wall before defcribed, and fearch the jOand^ 
I dtfcoyered'a kind of pigeons h'ke our houfe pigeons 
in a neft among the rocks. ' I brought them home, 
Rurfed them till they could fly, and then they left 
me. Af^erthis, Ifhot fome, which proved fcxcel« 
ient fi:>od« Some time I fpent vainTy in contriving to 
m^ke a caik ; I may well Tay it was vain, becaufe I 
^ould neither joint the ftaves, nor fix the heads, fo as 
to make it tight : So leaving that, I took fome goat's' 
tallow I had by me, and a Sttle oakhum for the wick, 
iand provided myfelF with a lamp, which ferved me 
•inftead of candles. 

But now a very Qrange event happened. For beine 
m the bergh^ of my feircb, what Chould come into 
my hand, but a bag, which w^s ufed to hold corn (as 
I fuppofed) for die fowls; fo immediatly refolving to 
~]>ut gunpowder in it, I Ihook all Che hufks' and dirt 
upon one fide of the rock, little expecting what the 
*f:onfequence would be« The raiti had fallen plentiful- 
ly a few days before^ aijd about a month after, to 
my great ama^ment, fomething begah to loo][|: out 
very green and flourilfaing ; and when I came to view 
it more nicelyi^ ever}' day 2^s it grew, I found about 
ten or twelve ears of green barley appeared in tbe- 
<very fame fhafe and make as that in England* 

1 can fcare exprefs the agitation of n^y mind zt 
^is fight. Hitherto I had looked upon the a£^i.ons 
of this life no otherwife than only as the events of 
i»iind chaiice and fortune, Eiut now, the ap|)earanci^ 
'jof this barley, ^ouri&itig in a barren foil, and my 
ignorance in not conceiving how it ftiould come 
there, made nie conclude,' /Afl/ miracles were not yet 
'teafed-t nay, I even tfeought that Goo had appointed

it to grow there without any feed, purely for my fuf- 
tenance in this miferable and defolate ifland. And 
indeed fuch great effcSt this had upoh me, tha^ it often 
made ine melt into tears, through a grsuteful fence 
of GoD*s mercies; and the; greater ftiil was my 
thankfulnefs, when I perceived about this liule field 
pf barley, fome rice ftalks, alfo wonderfully fiourifhing. 

Whileahus pleafed in mind, I concluded there 
mufi be more corn in the ifland; and therefore made 
a diligent fearch narrowly among the rocks;, but not 
l>emg able to find any, on a fudden, it came into my 
mind, how I had fhaken the huiks of corn out of the 
Ibag, and then my admiration ceafed, lyith my grati- 
tude, to the divinq Being, as thinking, it was but natural, 
and not to be conceived a miracle: tho' even the man- 
ner of its prefervation might have made me own it as 
a wonderful event of .Goo's kind providence.: . 

It was about the latter end of June when the ears 
of this ^6rn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, 
together with 20 pr jO ftalks pf rice, . expecting one 
day I fhould reap the fruit of my labour; yet fqio: 
years were expired before' I coiild allow myfelf to eat 
any barley bread,, and much longer time before I hail 
anyrice. Afterthis, with.indefatigable nain.s and in- 
duftry for three pr tour months, at laff I finifted my 
houfe on the 14th of April, having no way to go into 
it, but by a Jad<)er>gainft the'walT. . - ? • 

/April 1 5. I fini/hcd my ladder, and a.fcended it;* 
afterwards pulled it up, then let it dpwn on the otha: 
fuie, and defcended into my new habitation, where I 
had fpace enough, and fp fortified, tHat nothing could 
attack me, without fcaling the walls. 

But what does all human pains and induffry avail, 
if the bleiHng of God. does not crown our labours? 
Or who can fland before the Almighty, when he 
'llretcheth forth his arm ? For one tim? as I was at 
the entrance of my cave^ there happened fuch a dread- 
ful earthquake, that hot only the roof of thie cave 
came tumbling about .my ears, but the pofts feemed 
to crack terribly at the fame time, Thisputmein

Sb laying' /^^^ni up in feparate parcelsit and theft

after having ipent three rfays in this journ^; :. B^- 
Vbre I got''hoiBr» thegraper weve fa bmifed^hat

'Kood, but 6i tKbfe I could bring only a few. ' 
; ' Joly T9* HaiF^ing prepared two bags, I returndi

4he 'grapeft rprtratt about,' trcd to piceef , ahd abun^* 
^df^tfeeateny which made me conclude there wet e 
^iW »beafl« thereabouts^ To prevcfift this happen* 
^ng agiHi,' i gathered a hrgie duafiitity of tbe gtapes, 
ind hutig them upon^ the oiit irrauche^ of the tree*

And now contemplating 6n the fruitfuhi^fs of thlst 
'ivalley, the pleafantnefs of itsfituation, its-fecurrty 
frotu liorms, arid the deltghtfulnefs'sf the adjacent 
woods, I concluded I was fettled in the woH^ part 
of the country, and thercfforcf was thinking 'to re- 
taove my habitatiicin, • • ; • '. • ^

■was a pdffibflity, fome time or other,, a fliip might 
either be driven or fail by ; and chat to inciofe my-

made me a liule>kind of bower, iuneundthg'it With 
a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well

a great part of July, I thinly it was the (irft day of

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

Aug. 74, This, day it began to r^in; and though 
IM ma^ mc a tent, like the other, yet hatin,^ no 
fliclter of a hill, to keep mc 4rom ftorms, nor aV^vc 
behind mc to retreat to,' I was obliged to return to 
myoldcaftlc^ the rain continued more or lefs every 
day, tiH the middle of X->ttobcr; and funietimeji fo 
violently, that 1 could not ftir out of my cave for fc- 
veral days. This feafon I found my family to en* 
cieafc; for one of my cats th^^t ran away tronrm^t 
anfl which i thought h^d been dead,, ceturned ahout 
Auguftj.with three kittens at her heels, likchcrfclf; 
which I thought flrange, bccaufe both my cats were 
females, and the wild cats o( theifl^in^ (eemed to be 
of a different kind from our European cats ; but from 
thcfe cats proceeded (uc):x numbers, that I was forced 
to kill and dcftroy them as I would do wil4 b'ead^s 
or vermin. « •*' . , : .. f

. food was thus : a bunch oF rainnis Icrved me for my

for my dinner,- and two/gr. tnrec turtle eggs for 
my (upper* While the ram laAed, : I 'daily worked 
two or tHree hours at enlarging my cave, and by de-

I perfeftly learned the method of it^ and wanted no^

wy journey, travelling about twelve milf^ further 
towards the caft, whcr^c I fet a gtcat pfle on the 
fliorc for a mark, concluding that my neitt joiirney 
/bpuld brins me to the other (ide of the iflind, eaft 
from my Cattle, and fd round till I came to iiiy*poft 
ag^ain, . As 1 hid a conftant view of the country,! 
thought I could not mifs my wav; but fcarce had't. 
travcUed thtee miles, Nvhen f d»cencled into a vcrjr 
large valley, fo furrouhded with hillincbvercd with. 
Avbod, that Ihaving no &uide but the futi, nor even 
thfniunlefs ! knew well the portion of the fun at 
that time of the day ;' and to add to my misfortune, 
..the weather proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to re- 
turn to my'poft by the fea-fide,' and fo backwards 
the fame way I came. In this journey my dog fut- 
prifed a 'kid, and would have killedf it, had I n^t 
prevented him. As I had often been thinking of 
getting a k^d or two, and fo raifing a breed of tame 

fo^ts to fupply me after my ammunition was fpent, 
took this dpport'utiity of oeginning: and; haviiig 
made a collar for this little creature, with a ftritig 
made of rope-yafn, I brought it to my bower, a'nd 
there inclofedl. him ; and haring fpent a pionth'in 
this journey, returned to my old habitation^ 

Nobody can doubt 6f my fatisfadion, when I re- 
turned to my little caftle, and repofed myfelf^ in my 
harnmock. After my. journey I refted i[iyfrff > a 

.week, which time 1 employed in making a* cage 
for my pretty polL ^ I now began to cpnfider of the 

• poor kid I had lefr in the bo\*^er, and immediately 
went to fetch it 'home. ' When I canie there, 1 fotmd 
the young creature, almoft Aarved ; 1 gave it foAic 
food, and tied it i« Before: hut- there was no occa- 
fion, for it;followerfme like a dog; and as I con^ 
Mritly fed it, it beeimc*fo*lovlngj gentle, and foftd, 
that it commenced one of mydomefttcks^ and yiiMi 
never leave me; *■'" * * »• -> 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, gj 

The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox beinv 
noiJif comej I kept the 30th of September in the noft 
^felemn 'manner, as ufual, it b^ing the third yeamf 
iny abod^ in the ifland» I fpent the whole day in »c*- 
-kno'i^kdging God's oiercies, in giving, thanks* for 
'making this fditary life as agreaUe, and lefs.iin^ 
-ful, than that of human fociety; and for the com« 
'munications of his grace to my foul, in fupportmg, 
comforting, ' and encouraging me to dci>end upon fa^ 
^Providences and hope for his eternal prefence in.the 
•ivorld ta come* ♦ .0 

Indeed, I often did confider bow much more hap- 
py 1 was, in this ftate of life, than in that accurfed 
-manner of living I formerly ufed, and fometimes 
' 'when huntfng, or viewing the country, the anguift 
of my foul would break out uppn me, and my vefy 
heart would ^fink within me, to think of the woods, 
the mountains, the deferts I was in y and. how 1 was 
a prifoner locked up within the eternal bars and 
bolts of the ocean^ in an uninhabited wildernefs, 
without hopes, and without redemption. In this 
condition I would often wring my hands, and weeg 
like ^ child: And evep fometimes in the middle m. 
my work this fit would often take me; and then! 
' would* lit down and figh, lookiag on the ground for 
an 4io«}r 'or two together, till fuch time as my grief 
got vent in a flood of tears^. 

. One morning, as 1 was fadly employed in this man- 
ner i opened my Bible, when immediately. I fixed 
my eyes upon thcfe words, I Ml never leave tkee^ nor 
•' forfake thee ! Surely, thought I, thcfe words are dirdsd 
^ to me^ or elfe why ftiould they* appear juft at a mo^ . 
' ment when I am bemoaning my forlorn condition? and 
if God does not forfake me. What matters it, f^ncehe 
can make me more happy in this ftate of life, th^n if 
1 ciijoyed the greateit Tplendor in the world ? But 
while I was going to return God thanks for my pre^' 
fent- ftate, fomeching feemed to fiiock my mind, as if

aas had been 9 who fell into their hands. Not with-* 
flanding all this, my thoughts ran continually upon 
that ihore, I now wiihed for my boy Xury, and 
the long-boat, with the Ihoulder of mutton iail : I 
went to the (hip's boat, that had been caft a great 
way on the (hore in the late florm. She was remov- 
ed bat a little;; but her bottom being turned up by 
the impetuofity and fury of the waves and wind, £ 
fell to work with all the ftrength I had» and with 
levers and rolers I h^d cut. from the wood, to turn

work took me up three or four weeks, when findings

Nothing remained now,, but, indeed, the greateft 
difficulty, to get it into the water, it lying about ico 
yards from it. To remedy the firft inconvenience, 
which was a rifing hill between this boat and the 
creek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug ]nto 
the ilirfacc of the earth, and made a declivity. But 
when this was done, all the ftrength 1 had was as in^ 
fufficient to move it, as it was when 1 attempted to 
move the boat* I then proceeded to meafui-e. the 
diftance of ground, refolving to make a canal, in 
order to bring the water to the cance, fince I could 
not bring the canoe to th^ water. But as this feem- 
ed to be impra£licabl6 to myfelf alone, under the 
fpace bf ekven^or twelve years, it brought me into 
fome fort of confidcration : fa that I concluded this 
alfo to be impoffible, and the attempt vain. I now 
fawy af»d not before, what ftapidity it is to begin 
wo/K before we reckon its cofl:?, or judge rightly our 
own abilities togo through withits performance; 

In the height of this ^rork my fourth yeap spired 
from the time i was caft on this iiland. At this tinac 
I did not forget rny andiverfary ; but kept it with 
rather greater devotion than before. For now my

the. r^ft to me ? the .money 1 had, lay by mc as def- 
picable drofs, which I would freely have given for a 
grofs of tobacco pipes or a hand-mill to grind my 
corn; in- z word, the nature and experience of 
thefe things di(Slated to me this juft lefledlion, That 
the good things of this world are no iurther good to 
us, than they are for our ufc; and that whatever 
we may heap up to give others, we can but enjoy as 
much as we u&, and no more, 

Thefe tht^.ghts rendered my mind more ca(V than 
ufual. Eevery time 1 fat down to meat, I did it with 
th?nkfulnef$^ adoiiring the providential hand of God^ 
who in this wlldernefs had fpread a table to me. And ;| 

nowi coufidered what 1 enjoyed, rather than what I, \ 

wanted, cooipared my prefcnt condition with what ;; 

1 at firft expcded it ibotildbej how I ihould have \\ 

dune, if I had. got nothi;ig out of the fiiip; that I 
muil have peri(hed before 1 bad caught fid or turtles ( 
cr lived, had I found them like a mere favage, by 
eating them, raw, and pulling them to pieces with 
my daws, like a beaft^ I next compared my iia-> 
tioji to. that which I dtferved : how undutiful I had ' i 

been to my parents; bow deftitute of the fear of 
God J .how ^^ J of every thing that was good ; and . 
how ungratetul for thofe abundant mercies I had 
received from heaven, being fed, as it were, by a 
miracle, even as great as Elijah's being (cd by ravens ; 
and caft on a place where there is no venemous crea* 
tares to poifon or devour me ; in ihort, making God's 
tender metcies matter of great con(blatioj|, I relin« 
quifhed all fadncfs, and gave way to contentment.

my gun on .my fhouldcr ; and over my head a great 
clumfy Ugly goat's (kin umbrella, which, however 
next to my gun, was the mod neceffary thin§ about 
me. As for my face, the colour was not fo Iwarthy 
as the Mulattoes, or as might have been expeAcd 
from one who took fo little care of it, in a climate 
within nine or ten degrees of the Equinox. At one 
time my beard grew lo long that it hung down a- 
bove a Quarter af a yard ; but as I bad both razors

to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whifters, 
the like of which Thad fcen worn by (ome I'urks at

But all this was of no confequence here, there be* 
ing none to obferve oiy behaviour or habit* And fo, 
without fear and withoiaf control, I proceeded en my

fixdays. I firft travelled along the fea (bore, direAiy

to the fame height that I Was before upon ; when 
looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay 
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, 
1 w;)S amazed to fee the fea fo fmooth and quiet, 
there being no ripling motbn, noreurrent, zxiy more 
than in other places. This made me ponder fome 
time to guefs thereafon of it, when at lad I was 
convinced that the ebb fetting from the weft and 
•joining with the current of water from fome great 
river on (h<fre, muft be the occafion of thefe rapid 
dreams ; and that, confequently, as the winds blew 
morewcfterly, or more fouA wardly, fo the current 
came the nearer, or went the farther from the (hore* 
To filtisfy my curiofity, I waited there till evening,

when the time of ebb being madc^ I plainly per- 
ceived from ihe rock the current J?gain as before, 

' with this difference, that it ran farther off, near half 
a league from the fhore ; whereas in my fxpeditioo, 
it fet clofe upon it, furioufly hurrying me and my 
canoe along with it, which at another timeil would 
not have done. And now I was convinced, that by 
obi'erving the ebbing and flowing^, of thetidc,^! 
might eafily bring my boat round the ifland again. 
But when I began to think of putting it in practice, 

" the remembrance of the late danger (Iruck me with 
fuch horror, that 1 changed my refolutiun, and form-

You may eafily fuppofe, that, after having been' 
here fo long, nothing could be more amazing than, 
to fee* a human'creature. One day it happened, that 
going te my boat, T'faw the print of a man's naked 
foot on the ftiofe, very evident on the fand, as the.

the flriftefl attention. I caft my eyes aiound, but 
could fatisfy neither the one or the other. 1 pro- 
ceeded alternately to every part of the fliore, but* 
^tith equal effeft ; neither could I fee any othcr^

taken ether ways to have terrified aic ? why l|ou!d 
he leave his tnai^k on the other fide of the ii!and, and 
that too on the fand, where the (urging waves of the 
ocean might foon haveerafed theiniprei&on* Suie- 
ly this afiion was not confident with the fubtilty 
of Satany faid I to myfelf ; but rather muil be fome 
tfangerous creature^ fome wild favage of the main 
land over agalnd me, that» venturing too far in the 
ficeaoy has been driven here, either by ihe violent 
current or contrary winds ; and not caring to ftay 
«inthis defolate iiland, has gone back to fea again. 

Happy indeed, tfaoagbel tomyfetf, that none of 
the ravages bad feen mc in that place : yet I was not 
altogether without fear, left, having found my boat, 
thev ftould return in numbers anddevour mc* oral 
lean carry away all my com, and deftroy nqy flock 
of tame goats. In a word^ all my religpoi^s hopes 
^aDiihed^s though f thought God would t^ow pro- 
t'€£l me by hts power, who had fo wooderfully pre- 
i'ervcd me foTeng. . 

What various chains, of providence ar^ there ia 
the life of man ? Hbw changeable are our affe^i- 
ons, according to different circumflances? We love 
to'-day, what we hate to-morrow; wefbun one hour, 
-what we feek the next. This was evident iit me in 
the mod cenfpicuous manner : For I, w!io before 
had fo much lamented my condition, ,in being ba- 
Biilied from all humau kind, was now even ready to 
expire, when I eonCdered that a man had fet hi&ioot 
on this dcToIate ifland. But, when 1 confidi^red my 
ilation of life, decreed by the iafinitety wife and 
good providence of God, that I ought not to dif- 
pute my Creator's fovereignty, who had an un- 
doubted right to govern and difpofe of his creatures 
as he thinks convenient ; and that his jufiice aod 
mercy could either puni(h or deliver me : I fay, 
when I confidered all this, I comfortably found it 
iny duty to truft fincerely in him,, pray ardently to 
him, and humbly refign myfelf to his divine'wiil* 

One morning, lying on my bed, fhefe^ words of 


DF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75^ 

the facred writings came into my mine), Call vpon 
n:e m the djy of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and tliou^ 
Jfialt glorify me, * Upon this fentence, lifing more* 
cbcarfully from my bed, 1 offered up my prayers in 
the mofl heavenly manner: and when -I had done, 
taking up my Bible to read, thefe words appeared 
firft in my fight : Wait on the Lord^ and be of ^ood 
cheer, and he Jhall Jirenrthen thy heart ; Wait, 7//y, 
on the Lord. Such divine comfort did this give me, 
as to remove all caufe of fadnefs upon that occifion.' 

Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fears, 
for three days and nights, I at laft ventured out of 
my ca file, and milked my goats, one of which was 
almeft fpoiled for want of it. 1 next, (though in 
great fear) vifitcd my bower, and milked my flocks 
there alfo; when, growing bolder, 1 went down to 
the l"hore again, and meaiurisg the print of the foot 
to mine, to (ee perhaps whether 1 myfelf had -not 
occafioned "that mark, I found it much fuperior in 
largenefs ; and fo returned home, now/abfofutely 
convinced^ that either fome men had been on fhore, 
. orthitthe iiland muft beinli>ibited ; and therefore 
tl^at I might be furpri zed before I was aware. ' 

1 now began to think of providing for my fecurity, 
flnd refolved in. my mind many diflferent fchemei 
for that purpofe. i frfl propofed to cut down my 
inclolures, and turn my tame cattle wild itito the 
woeds; that the enemy might not find them, and 
frequent the ifland in hopes of killing'rhe fanie^ 
Secondly, I was for digging up my corn fields for the 
very'f;ime reafon,' And, lajtiyy I concluded to demo* 
liJh my bower, \ci\, 'iecinga place of humm con- 
trivance, they might come farther, anff find out 
and attack me m my little cafile. ' • ' ' 

' Such notions did the fear of darigei'fuggeft to 
me; and I looked I thought like tfie^uhfortunate 
king' 4aul, when not only opprelTed bv'"the Phllif- 
tines, but alio forlaken by Gocinimfelf. :Pind, it

little confidence }n hinii. fearing tbofe more wh6 
could kill thU fading body, than him who Could 
deAroy my mortal ibul. 

Sleep was an utter ft ranger to my eyes that night; 
yet nature, fpcnt and tired, fubmitt^d to i filent re* 
pofethe next morning, and then joining reafon with 
fear, I eonfidered, tl^t this delightful and pjeafant 
ifland might not be fo entirety forfaken as I might 
think ; but that the inhabitants from the other (bore 
might fail, either withde(igo» or from peoeflity, by 
crois winds ; and, if the latter circumftance, i haa 
reafoi% to believe they would depart the firft oppor- 
tunity. However, my fear made me thipk of a 
place of retreat upon an attack. I now repented 
that 1 had made my deor to come out beyond my 
fortification ; to remedy which, I refolved to make 
'Sie a fecond one : 1 fell to work, therefore, and 
drove betwixt that double row of trees^ which I 
planted above twelve years before, feverai firong 
piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and old 
cables, and ilrengthening the foot of it with 
esirth which I dug out of my cave; I alfe made 
mc feven holes, wherein I pl^^nted my mufkets 
like cannon^ fitting them into frames refembling 
carriages. This being fiuiihed with indefatigable 
indunry^ for a great way every where, I pkinted 
flicks of ofier like a wood, about twenty tnoufand 
of them, leaving a large (pace between them and 
say wall, that I might have room to l^e an enemy^ 
and that, they might not be (heltered among th^ 
young trees, if they ofTered to approach the outer 
wall. And indeed, fcarce two years had paiied 
over my head, when there appeare;! a lovely (hady 
grove, and in fix years it became a thick wood, 
perfectly impalfible. For my fafety, I left no ave- 
nue to go in or out ; inQead of which 1 fet two 
ladders, one to a^jpart of the roet which was low, 
ai^ then broke in, leaving room to place another 
ladder upon that i fo that when 1 took thJfe down^ 
jU if^ impoffible for aoy man to defcend* without

hurting himfclf ; and if they had, they would flill 
be at the outfide of my outer wall. But while I 
took all tB«fe mcafures of huai»n prudence for my 
own prefcTvation I was not akogethcr unmindiul of 
other affairs* To prefervc ray Aock of tame goats, 
that the cnfimy fliQuld not take all at once» I looked 
oat for the nioft retired part of the illand, which 
was the place where I had loft myfelf beforementu 
onedf and there finding a clear piece of land, con. 
taining three acres, fnrrounded with thick woods, I 
wrought fo hard, that in lefs than a month's time, J 
fenced it fo well round, that my flocks were very 
weU fecured in It, and I put therein two be goals 
and ten fhe ones. 

Ail this labour was occiUioned purely by fearful 
apprebeniiofis, on account of feeing the print of a 
xn9Ln*s foot* And not contented yet with what 1 had 
'done, I fearched for another |)lace towards the weft 
point of the jfland, where I mighi: alfo retain another 
iiock* Then waodering on this errand more to the 
weft of the ifland than ever I had yet done, and caft* 
ing my eyes tow^ards the Tea, mechought I perceived 
a tK>at at a - great diftance ^ but could not poffibly 
tell what it was for want of my pcrlpeaive glafs, ] 
confidered then it *^as no ftrangc thing to fee the 
print of a man's foot; and, concludmg them can* 
nibats, blelled God for being cait on the other fide 
of the ifland, where none of the favages, as I thought^ 
ever came* But when I came down the bill to th^ 
fhore, which was the S. W. poim of the ifland^ I was 
foon confirmed in my opinion ; nor can any one 
defcribe my horror and amazement, when I faw the 
ground fpread with (culls^ hand^, Feet, and bones of 
human bodies ; ^i:id particularly, 1 perceived a fpace 
like a circle, in the midft of which had been a fire, 
about which *l conje^ured thefe wretches fat^ and 
unnaturally facrificed and devoured their fellow* 
creatures. 

The horror and loatbfopenefs of this dreadful fpec-

then returned towards my habitation : and, in my way 
thither fhedcling floods of tears, and falling down on my 
bended kneeS| gave God thanks for making my nature 
contrary to thefe wretches, and delivering me fo long 
out of their hands. . - 

Though feafon and rrty lofig fefldence here had 
afiared rtie,-that thefe favages never came up to the' 
thick woody part of the country, and that I had u6 
reafon to be apprehenfive of a difcotery ; yet fwch an 
abhorrence did 1 ftill retain, that,'for two* years after, 
1 confined myfelf only to my three plantations ;' I 
mean my caftle, country feat, and inclofure in- the 
woods. ' And tho* in pr«cefs of- time, my dreadful 
apprehenfions began to wear away, yet my eyes were 
mpre vigitent for fear of being furprifed, and I was 
very cautious of firing my gun, left, being heard by 
thofe creatures, they (hould proceed t© atack me. I 
yefolved however, manfully to lofe isiy lite if they did, 
and went armed with three piftols ftuck in my gwrdle j 
■which, added to th« defcription I have given of myfelf 
l)efoi*e, made me look with a very formida We ap- 
pearance. 

Thus my circumftarrces for fome time femainefl - 
very calm and undifturbed i and when 1 compa/ed my 
condition to others, 1 found it far from being mifer- • 
able. And, indeed, would all perfons compare their 
circumftances, not with thofe above them, but witK 
thofe innumerable unhappy obje^^s beneath the^ji, I aih 
Ture we fhould not hear thofe daily murmiirings and 
compl'ainings that are in the world. For my part, I 
yi^ntci but few things. Irfdeed, the tenor theia- 
.Vages had ptit me in, fpoiled fome inventions for my 
own convenicncies. One of my projct^ls wasto brewr 
mc fome beer j a very whiiDfical one ind<?ed, when it 
'is confidered, that I had neither cafks fufRcient, nor 
could 1 make any to preferveitin ; neither had 1 hops

thingSt But now my inventtons were placecl «notfaef 
way ; aad d»y and night I could think of no biiig.but 
bow I niight deftroy fome of tbefe c»nniba]s,i;vlieQ pro«- 
ccedtfig to their bloody entertainments ; and fofaving 
a vi^m from being facrificed, that he might after be- 
come my (ervant. Many were my •contrirancet for 
this purpofe, and as inany more objeflions occurred, 
after 1 hatched them. I once contrived to dig a hole 
under the ptace where they made their iire, and put 
therein five or fix pounds of gun-powder, which 
would confequently blow up alt thofe that were nciur 
it ; but then I was loth to fpend fo much upon them, 
kft it ihould not dd that certain execution I could de- 
fire, and but only affright and not kill them. Having 
laid this deflgn afide, I again propofed to lie privately 
in ambuifa in f^me convenient place, with my three 
guns double loaded, and let fly at them in the midfl of - 
their dreadful ceremony; and having killed two or 
tRrec of them at every flhot, fall upon the reft fud- 
denly with my three piftols, and let not one mother's 
fon efcape. This imagination pleafed my fancy fo 
ihuch that I ufed to dream of it in the night time*. 
' To put my deflgn in execution, I was not long feek- 
ing for a place convenient for jay purpofe, where, un- ' 
feen I might behold every action of the fa vages. Here 
1 placed my two mudcetSp each of which was loaded 
with a brace o^ ftugs? and four or five bullets about 
the fize of piftol bullets; the fowling- piece was' 
charged with near a handful of the larg^ft fwan (hot, 
and in every piftol were about four bullets. And 
thus ail things being prepared, no fooner would the 
welcome light fpread over the element, but, like a 
giant refrejked with wine^ as t^e fcripturehas it, wouU 
I ilTue forth from my caftle^ and from a lofty hill^ 
three miles diftant, view if I could fee any invaders^ 
approach unlawfully to my kingdom, fiut having 
waited in vain two or three months, it not only grew 
vtry tirefome to me, but brotight me tdlfbme confi- 
deration, and made n» examine myfelf what ri^ht I 
had to kill thcfe creature^ in tbi^ manner.. 


8p, LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

^ If (argued I to myfelf} this unnatural cuftom of^ 
tneirs be a fin offenfive to heaven, it belongs to the 
Divine Being, who alone has the vindidive power ia 
his hands, to fhower down his vengeance , upon them* " 
And perhaps he does fo, in making them become one 
another's executioners. ^ Or, if God thinks thefe ' 
doings jufl, according to the knowledge they conceive, ' 
what authority have 1 to pretend to thwart the decrees 
of providence, which has permitted thcfe a£lions for * 
fo many ages, peiha'ps from almoft the beginning of 
the creation ? They never offended me, what right 
have 1 then to concern m}felf in their fhedding one 
another's biood ? And, indeeo, I have fince known, 
they value no more to kill and devour a captive taken 
in war, than we do to k'll an ox, or eat mutton. I 
then concluded, it neLeiT.irily followed, that thefe 
peopk were no more murdeiers than chriftians, who 
many times put V.'helc troops to the fword, after throw- 
ing down their 'arms. Ag^in I confidered, that if I 
fell upon them, I fhoulJ be as niuch in the wrong as 
the Spaniards, who had committed the grearcft bajba- T 
rities upon thefe p^iople who had never offended them 
in their whole lives ; a^s if the kingdom of bpain was . 
evident for a race of men withoutxommou compaflion 
to the miferable, a principal fign of a n)off ungenerous * 
tamper : thefe conftdcrations made me p^ufe, and made ' 
me think I hid tat^en vrong meafures in my refoluti-* 
ons ; 1 now argued with myfelf, it was better for me 
never to attack, but to remain undifcovercd as long 
as I poffibly could ; that an oppofite condudl would 
certainly prove deftru6tive ; for as it was fcarccly to 
be fuppofed I could kill them all, I might citler be 
overpowered by the remaining, or that fome efcapiiig, 
might bring tiioufand:* to my certain deftriidlion. And 
indeed, religion took their part fo much as to con- ' 
vlnce mc how cont/ary it was to my duty to be guilty 
of (bedding human blood, innecent blood, innocent as 
to my particular, whatever they are to one another ; 
that I had nothing to do with it, but leave it to the 
God of all power and doniinion, as I faid before, to 


' *» >«■. ••> 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. '^r 

do therein what feemed convenient to his hcaver^Iy 
wifdom. And, therefore, on my knees I thanked the 
Almighty from delivering rhc from blood-guiltinefs, 
' and begged his proteftion, that I might never faJl inu> 
their hands. ' ' 

Thus giving over an attempt which I had rafhly bc- 

* gun, I never afcehded the hill on that occafion after- 
^ wards ; I only removed' my boat, ' whio^h lay on the 
' other fide*of»theifland,'and every thing that belonged 

to her, towards the.eaft, .into a little cove, that there 
might not be the leaft (hadow of any boat near, or 

* habitation upon the iftand.* My caftle then became 
my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when I 
went out to'milk rnyfte" goats, and order' my little 
flock in the wood, which was quite but of danger : 
for fare I was, that thefe favages never came here with 
expe<5lation$ to find any thing, and coufequently ne- 
ver wandered from the coafl ; howevep, as they might 
have feveral times been on fliore, as well before as af- 

^ ter my dreadful apprehcnfions, I looked back with hor-» 
•ror to think in whdt rtate I might have been, had I 
fuddenly met them flenderly armed, with one gun oh- 
Ay loaded with fmall fliot ; and h'^w great would ha.ve 
be^n my amazement, if, inftead of (Geing the priht 
of one man*s foot, I had perceived fifteen or twenty 
favages, who, having once fet their eyes upon me, 
by the fwifmefs of their feet, would have left me no 
poflibility of efcaping? Thefe thoughts would fink

. appeared in the ktterpart of my abode on this ifland ; 
I am a ftranger in determining whence thefe fecret 
intiniAtions of Provideoce derive ; yet methinks they 
are not only fome proof of the converfe of fpirits* 
but alfo of the fecret comonunicatioas they are fup- 
pofed to have with thofe that have not pafled through 
Che gloomy vale of death* 

Thefe anxieties of mind^ and the care of my prC'* 
fervation, put a period to all futitre inventions ini 
contrivances, either for accommodation, or convent* 
cn;e« I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a fticjc, 
fire a gun, or make a fire, left either the noife 
ihould be heard, or the fmoke difcover me. And on 
this account I ufed to burn my earthen ware privately 
in a cave which I fouinl in the wood, and which I 
made convenient for^hat pUrpofe ; the principal caute 
(hat brought me here was to make charcoal, fo that I 
might bake and drefs my bread and meat without any 
danger. 

At that time a curious accident happened me* 
which I ihall now relate. 

While I was cutting down fome wood for nuking 
my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a thick 
branch of underwood. Curious to look into it, I 
. attained its mouth, and perceived it (ufficiem for me 
to ftand upright in. But when I had entered, and 
took. a further view, two rolling fhining eyet, Uke 
Saming ftarst feemed to dart themfelves at me ; fo that 
I made all the hafte out that 1 could, not knowing 
whether it wa$ the devil or a monfter that had taken 
his refidence in that place. When 1 recovered a lit- 
tle from my furprife, I called myfelf a thoufand fools, 
;for beijng afraid to fee the devil one moment, who had 
now lived twenty years in the mod retired folitu^e. 
And therefore reluming all the courage I bad, I took 
up a flaming firebrand, and in I ruflied again. 1 had

near as t could reckon about, twenty-riix jcars of age« 
His countenance had nothing in it 6erce or fitrly, 
^ut rather a fort of majefty in his face : and yet efpe* 
cialiy when he fmiled, he had all thefweetnefo of an 
European. His hair was not curled like wool^ as 
many of the blacks are, but long and Uack, with 
the moft beautiful, yet carelefs, trefies fprcading over 
his ihoulders. He had a very high and large fore- 
head, with a great vivacity and fpafkling (barpneft in 
his eyes. His fkin was not To tawny as the Virgi^i* 
ans, Brazilians^ or other Americans; but rather of 
a bright dun, olive colour, that had fooethtng agree- 
able in it, though not very eafy to give a defcription 
of. His face was round and plump, with afdiali 
nofe, very different from the fiatnefs of the negroes, 
« pretty final! mouth, thinlips, fine teeth, very well 
fet, ajid white as the driven fhow. In a word, fuch 
. ha>idfome features, and cxaA fymmetry in every part^ 
made me confider, that I had faved the life of an In^ 
dian prince, no le(s graceful and accompliibed than 
the great O/oonoko, whofe memorable behavioor and 
.unhappy contingencies. of life have charmed the world, 
both to admiration of his perfon, and compaffion to

and, in a little, tin^e, I began to fpeak to him, aad 
learn him how to talk to me again. 

In the firfl pjiace, 1 made him underfiand his name

faved^ hi$ life : 1 then taught him to fay Mafter, 
which I .made him fenfible was to be my name ; I 
likewife taught him to fay Yes and No, and to know 
wbat they meant* I gave him fome milk in an earthen 
pot, making him view me while I drank it before 
him, and foaked my bread in it ; gave him a cake 
pf bread, and caufcd him to foak it likewife, to 
which he readily confented, making iigns of the

dircftly to the place of their bloody enterta^nmejit; 
Burt l^vhen I came there, I wis ftriick with th^ utmoft 
horror at fo dreadfuf a fpedacle, whilft Friday wai 
110 way concerned about if, beins tio doubt in his 
turn, one of thofe devotirers* Here lay feverri hu-^ 
Inan' bulges, there feveral pietes of human flefli, half 
^aten, mangled and fcofched, whilft fireams of blood 
tin pfomifcftotifly as ^waters from a fountain. ' A« I 
was muiing on this dreadful fi^ht, Friday took alithe 
pains be could by pjirticular iigns, to make me aa- 
derftaiid, that they had brought over Ufax prifoners to 
feaft upon, three of whom they hafd calteti up, and 
fbat he was the fourth, pointing to himfeU: that 
tbere having beenai bloody battle between theni and 
\^i% great king, in tho juft defence of whom* he was 
taken prilbncr, with m^ny others ; aU of thefe were 
carried ofF to dtfferent places to be devoured by their 
conquerors; and that it was bis misfortune to be 
brought hither by thefe wretehts for the Mtty fame 
purpose* 

After I was made fenfible of thefe things., (caufed 
Friday to gather tfaofe ■ horrid remains, and Jay them, 
together upon a heap, which I ordered to be fet on 
£rc, and burnt them to a(hes : my man, however^ 
ftill retailed the nature of a cannibal, havjng a kan-

ince of it, that he durft not but conceal it: {6t I 
made him very fenfible, that if he offered any fuck 
thing, I would certainly (hoot him. 

This being done, I carried my man with oie to my 
caftlet and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which ( 
had taken out of the poor gunner's cheft before men«* 
tioned ; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him 
very well ; in the next place i made him a jerkin of 
goat (kin, fucii as.my mill was able to manage, and 
indeed I tkought myfelf then a tolerable good tailor. 
I gavt him al(6 a cap, which I made out of a hare's 
(kin, very convenient and fafliionable. Thus being 
clothed tolerably well, my man was na lefs proud of 
his habit, than I was in feeing him in it. Indeed he 
went very aukwardly at firft, the drawers being t«<» 
heavy on his thighs, notufed to bear any. weight, and 
the ileeves of the vvaiftcoat galled his moulders, and 
the in&dc of his arms ; but by a little eafing where 
he complained they hurt him, and by sdng himfelf to 
' them, at length he took to them very weiL 

My next concern was wKere I (hould lodge him : 
and that I might do well by him, and yet be|)eife£llv 
eafy myfelf, 1 ere<^ed a tent for him in the vacant 
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of 
the laft, and the outfide of the firft ; and as there was 
An entrance or door into my cave, I made a formal 
framed door^-cafe, and a door co open on tde iofide^ 
I barrod it up in the night time, taking in my ladders 
too, fo that, was my man tp prove treaeheroui, there 
could be n^ way ao come at me in the infide of my'

Biit there was no occafion for this precaution ; for

when the imm;2diate hand of death is ready to pot for 
ever a period to this mortal life : and indeed fo much

another fort of counteQai^e was neceffary, and to 
(Convince him that I would do Jiim no barm, I toole 
jiim, fmilrng, by the hand, then laughed at him, and 
pointing to the kid which I had (lain, made Agns to 
him to fetch it, which accordingly He did. No )efs

foupd to be a parrot. I made him underftand that I 
would ihoot and kill that bird ; accoidingly I fired, 
and bade him look, when immediately he faw the 
parrot fall down. Again he flood like one amazedt 
notwithdanding ail I had faid to jyirii : and the more 
confounded he was, becaufe he did not perceive me

would have wor&ipped n^e, but as for the gun, he 
would not i'o much as touch it for fever^ days but 
would come and communicate his tha|^ts to il,

bini do, when he thought my back was^urncd,:\thc 
chief intent of which was, to defire it not to kill

ftand his meaningy you maybe fure I was as won-

lived, eat man's flefh more. 

It is now high time 1 ihould fet my new fervam 
to work; fo next day 1 put him to beat out fooic 
corn, and fife it in the fame manner as I had done 
before. And really the fellow was very quick and 
handy in the execution of any thing I ordered him 
to go abour^ I made him miderftjnd tha^it was to 
make bread for us to eat, jnd afterwards let him fee 
me bake it. In fhort, he did every thing as I or- 
dered him in a little time as well as I couM perform 
it myfeif. ^ 

But now confidering that I bad two rnonths to 
feed inilead of one, it was neceffary that I muft 

t)rovide more ground for my harveil, and plant a 
arger qi^antity of corn ; upon which I marked out 
a larger piece of land, fencing it in the fame man*

I muft give Friday this good word, that no man 
couid work harder^ or with better will than he did:

nations werenearcft them; to which queftions the 
poor fellow declared all he knew, wlxh the greateft 
opcnnefs, and utmoft fincerity. When 1 demanded 
of him the particular names of the various nations 
of his fort of people, he could only anfwer me in 

feneral that they were called Car ale ^ Hence it was 
corifidercd that thcfe muft be the Caribbees, To 
much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that 
part of America, vhich j'eaches from the mouth of 
the river Oroonoko, to Guiana, and fo on to St.

up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to 
fay, beyond the fetting of the moon, which muft / 
be Weft from their country, there dwelt white 
bearded men,- fuch as I was, pointing to my whif-

tbat the fdHe adoration which the heathens give to 
their imaginary deity, is as great an argument of 
the divine effence, as the moft learned atheifls

that there was nothmg but what he knew, no thoughts

by ckgrees, I opened his eyes, and deicribed to him the 
manner of the Creation of the world, the fitiiation of 
paradife, the tranfgreflion of our firft parents, the 
wickednefs of God's peculiar people, and the itniver- 
fal (ins and abominations of the whole earth. When 
thefe things were implanted in his mind, I told bjm, 
that as God's judice was equal to his mercy, he 
refolved to deftroy this wortd, till his fon Jefus Chrift 
interpofed in our behalf; and, to procure our redemp- 
tion obtained leave of his heaveiily father to gome 
down from Heaven into the worlo, where he took 
human ns^ture upon him, in(tru£led us in fmr way to 
eternal life, and died as a facrifice for our ifrns; that 
he was new afcended into heaven, mediating for our 
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obcaining all 
thofe good benefits which we aflc in his name, by 
humble and hearty prayers, aU which were heard, at 
the throne of Heaven. As very frequently [ ufed to 
inculcate things into bis mind, Friday one day told me, 
that if o«r great God could hear us beyond the fun» 
be muft furely be ajgreater God than their Benamuctee^ 
%vho lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear 
^bem till they afcended thc-great mountains where be

m^n, called their Oowaiakeey meaning the Indian 
t^rie^ls, who went to fay 0, (fo he calira faying their

our faith is neither milled, nor ou^ reafon impofed

But, to ctear up this palpable cheat to my man

there was any fuch thing fpokcn to them, furely it mult

neceflary toenter into a long difcourlc with him, which 
I did after this manner. 

Friday, faid 1, you muft know, that before this 

, world was made, there was an Almighty Power ex- 
iHing, by whofe power all things were made, and 
whofe Majefty (hall* have no end.f To be glorified 
and adored by beings of a heavenly nature, he created

choir, Lucifer bore a great fway, as being* then» one 
of the peculiar favourites c?f 'thefe celeftial abodes ; but 
he, contrary to that duty which he owed his heavewly 
Sovereign, with unbounded 'rtigratitude to his divine 
Creator, not only ertvjed him that adoration which 
was his due, but thought tO'ufurp that throne which 
he had neither power to k^ep', nor titlo to pretend

No footier, proceeded I, was God freed from, and 
the Heavens clear of this arch^traitor, but the father 
fpeaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to 
his efTence, and were equal to him in power and glory. 
Come let us make man, faid he, in our own imager after 
c^romnliienefSf Gen. i* 26* to have dominion over the 
creatures of the world which we have created. And 
tKefe he intended (hould glorify him in Heavei;, accor- 
ding to their obedience in this ftate of probation on 
earth, which was, as it were, to be the fchool to train 
them up for thefe heavenly manfions* 

Now, Satan feeing him foiled ; yet that God had 
not taken the power from him as n prince of the air, 
which power Heaven deiigned he (hould retain, where- 
by his creatures might be tried ; in revenge for the dif- 
grace he had received, he tempts Adam's wife. Eve, 
to tafte of the. tree of knowledge of good and evil, 
which God had forbidden. He appears to her in the 
ihape of a ferpent, then a moft beautiful creature, and 
tells her, that it was no better than an impodtion which 
God had put upon her and her hufband, not to eat of 
that fair fruit which he had created ; that the taRe 
thereof would make them immortal like God himTclf ; 
and confequently as great and powerful as he. Upon 
which (be not only eat thereof herfelf, but made her 
huiband eat alfo, which brought them both under the 
lieavenly difpieafur^* 

Here Friday expreiled a great concern; Abt,poor 
mans! cried he, naugkty womans ! n^ighty devil! make 
God noilove de manPp make mans like devil him/elf . 

Friday, faid I, God (lill loved mankind, and tho' the 
itvil tempted human nature fo far^ he would not fufier 
bim to have aoubfolate power over them. ' 

I h^ve told you before of his tender love to his people, 
till they, like Lucifer, difobeyed his commands and 
rebelled againftliim; and even then, bow Jefus Cbrift, 
bis only fon, came to fave finners. But ftill every 
lyian that lives in the world is under temptation and 
trial. The devil has vet a power, as prince of the air^ 
to fu^eft evil cogita(ioa9 in our minds, and prompt us 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

onto wicked a6lionSf that he might glory in ourdef** 
tru^iion. Whatever c\riJ ibotights we have, proceed 
from bim^ fothat God, in this our diflrefs, exped^s we 
{hould apply ourfelvcs to him by fervent prayer for 
fpeedy redrefs. He is not like Benamuche, to let none 
come near him but Oofwa':ahee^ but fufFers the people 
as well as pricds to offer themfelves at his feet, thereby 
to be delivered from the power and temptation of the 
devil. 

But though at firft my man Friday cxpreflcd fome 
Concern at the wickednefs of Lucifer, I found it not 
fo cafy to impritit the right notions of him in his 
mitid, as it was aboift the divine effcnce of God : for 
there nature affifted me in all my arguments to ihpw 
to him plainly the neceffity of a great cauie» and 
over-ruUng governing power, of a fecret directing 
providence, and of tiie equity and reafonableneia 
of paying adoration to our Creator ; whereas there 
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil 
fpirlt, of h's firft beginning, his nature, and above 
all, of his inclination to evil actions, and his 
power to tempt us to the like. And indeed thii 
unlearned Indian, by the mere force of nature, 
puzzled me with one particular queftion> more than 
ever 1 eould have expefted. 

I had, one day, been talking to him of the om- 
nipotent power of God, and his infinite abhorrence 
of fin, infomuch that the fori ptures fty led him ^ 
confuming fire to alt the worker^ of iniquity^ and 
that it was in his power, whenever he pleafed^ to 
d?ftroy all the world in a moment, the greater part 
of -which are continually oflfending him. 

When, with a fcrious attention^ he had lifiencd 
a greaf while to what I faid, after 1 bad been telling 
hi<n how the devil was G©d*s enemy in the hearts, 
of men, and ufed all his malice and (kill to defeat 
the good dcfigns of Providence, and deflroy the 
kingdom of Chrift in the world, and fo forth : Very 
well, mafter, laid Friday, you lay God is fo Arongg

pray to htm, that h^e would tread d^wn Satan under

Friday quickly, if Go4t ^ yo^ fi^f has much Jlrong^ 
much might as the devils why God^io kill devil, make no 
mare tempt, no more da wicked. ^ _ ' 

' You may be certaiii, 1 was ftrangely furprized at 
this queflion of my man's \ and though an old man, 
1 was but a young doftor, and confcquently very 
ill qualified fuT a* cafuiR, or a refolver of intricate

when by our wicked a6iion^, we fo much offend 
hift )dtvine majeny? He gives us time to re-

blood, yet, however, we refted ourrdvcs content, 
that God would accept our deiires, and according to 
our faith, have mercy on us. 

But what we wanted one way, was made ap in 
another, and that was univerfal peace in our lixde 
church. We had no difputes and wrangiiogs about 
the nature and equality sf the holy, blefled, and un« 
•divided Trinity ; no niceties in dodtrine, or fchemes 
of church government ; ne four or morofe diflenter» 
to impofe more fublimated notions upon us ; no pen* 
da'nt fophii^ers to confound us with unintelligible 
myfteries i hut, in^ead of all this, we enjoyed the 
moil certain guide to heaven i that if, the word of 
God : btriides which, we had the comfortable views 
of his fplrit leading us to- the truth, and making us 
both willing and obedient to the inflruAion of| hi» 
word. • .« 

You may well fuppofe, that, by the frequent dif- 
courfc we had together, my man and 1 became moft 
intimately acquainted, and that there was but very 
little that I could fay, but what Friday underficod ^ 
and indeed, he fpoke very fluently, though it was but 
broken Englifb.^ 1 now took a particular pleafui-e m 
relating all my adventures, efpecially thofc that oc- 
curred fince my being caft on this ifland* i made 
him underftand that wonderful myfiery, as he'Con-- 
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet,, and taught him hovir 
to flioot. 1 alfo prefehted to him "d knife, which 
pleafed him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a 
frog hanging thereto, like thofe ih whi^h we wear 
hangeis in England ; and, inll^ead of a hanger to put 
in the frog, 1 gave him a hatchet, which was not on- 
ly as good, but even a better weapon upon many oc- 
cafions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, looked 
upon himfcif as greaj as Don' Quixote, v.'hen Mat ce- 
lebrated champion went to combat the windmill- 

I next gave hira a particular defcription of the ter- 
ritories of Europe, and in a particular . manner of 
Old England^ the place of my nativity. I laid be- 
fore him the manner of our wOr&ipping God, Qur

bad done, he ftocd pondering a great vhite^ and faid 
nothing. At laft, faid I, Friday, what makes you 
ponder fo much? He replied, O mafler^ me fee likt

It was fome time, indeed, before I underftood what 
my man meant ; but examining &t\6i\y into it,. I 
plainly found, that fuch another boat„ refembling

that is to fay, by his farthei explanation, that the

The manner df their cruelties to one another^

they flill lived there, having refided among thera . 
above four years, and that the fav^ges gave ihem 
viAua4s to live upoti; but pray, Friday, laid ft, 
whence proceeded all this good nature and generph 
fity ? How came it to pafs that they did not kill 
and e,*t them, to plcafe their devouring appetites,; 
and occafion fo plendid an* entertainment amon^ 
them ? No, no, laid Friday, (key not kill 'eirif they • 
make brother with 'em; by which 1 undeiftocd theic 
was a truce between ihem. And then I had a pnore 
favourable opinion of the IniiiJny, upou Fiiday!s 
uttering tbc(e words : My nation father nation no eat 
mans, but z^rhen mans ma.e xvaj'fght: as though he

fcnanccj that his eyes had an uncommon fparkling^ 
and brightnefn:, and fuch ai Grange eagcrnefs, as if 
be had a longing deiirc to be in his own country 
again. This msuie me not (o well fatibficd with 
my man Friday as before ; for by this appearance, 
1 made no difpute, but that if he could get bacic 
thither again, he would not only be unmindful of 
what reiieion I had taught him but likewife of the 

{;reat obligation he owed me for his wondeiful de- 
ivcrance : nay, that he would not only inform his 
countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of 
them to my kingdom, and make me a miferable 
iacrifice like thofe unhappy wretthes taktn in 
battle. '. 

Indeed I was very much to blame to have tf?cfe 
cruel and unjnft fufpicionf , and mufl frtely own I 
wronged the poor creature very m.uch, who*was of 
a quite contrary temper. And had he had that dif- 
cerning acutencfs which moft Ei*ropeans haye, >hc 
would certainly have perceived my coldnefs and in- 
difference, and alfo have been veiy much concerned 
upon that account ; as 1 was now more circumfpefi, 
I had mucn ieffened my kindnefs and familiarity 
with him, :tnd while this jeaioufy continued, I ufed 
that artful way of pumping him daily, tht:4cby to 
difcover whetncr he was deceitful in his thought s- 
and inclinations ; but certainly he had nothing ia 
bim but what was confident with the bcft princi- 
ples, both as a religious Ch ifljan and a grateful 
niend ; and, indeed, I feund every thing he (aid 
was fo ingenuous and innocent, ih^t 1 had t:o 
roorn for fui'picion, and, in fpite of ail uneafmefs> 
he not only ai^de me entirely his own again, but 
alfo caufed me inuch to lament that I ever con* 
ceived one ill thought of him. 

As we were walking up the fame hill ahother day, 
when the weather was fo hazy at fea, that 1 could 
not perceive the contment, Friday, faid I, don't

nation* And what would you du there Friday? 
Would you turn wjld again, cat man's fle(h, and be 
^ favage as you were formerly? No, no, (anfwered 
he» full of concern, and (l}aking bis head) Friday 
now tell them to live ,^ood, tell them pray God, tell them 
to eat com breads cattle, /te/k, m/7!', no eat man a^cdn* 
But furely, replied I, if you (hould offet to do all 
this, they will kill you ; and to manifeft their con* 
tempt of fuch infltu£tion, eat you up wheathey 
have done; He then put on a grave, yet innocent 
and fraooth countenance, faying. No, they no kill 
me^ they xmlUng love learn : that is, that they would 
be very willing to learn : adding withall, that they 
' had learned very much of the bearded mans that came tn 
the boat* Will you, faid I, go back again, Friday ? 
He (miled at that, and told me, that he could not 
fwim ,fo far. Bat faid I, I will make a canoe for 
you : yes^ majler faid he, me go if you go, me no go 
if you fiay\ l go, Friday ! why, would you have 
them eat me up, and devour your kind mafter? No^ 
no, faid he, me make them no eat majler, and me mah. 
them much love you; that is, he would tell them how 
I had flain his enemies, and thereby faved his life^ 
tor which reafon he w«uld make them love me: 
and then he related to me, as well as he was able, 
how exceeding kind thpfe of bis natioa were to the 
white, or bearded tnen. 

It was from thistime« indeed, I had ftrong incli* 
nations to venture over, and ufe my utmoft efforts^ 
ifpoilible, to join with thefe white bearded men, 
who undoubtedly were Spaniards or^Portuguefe ; 
for, thought I, it mud be certainly a better and iafer 
way to eicape when there is a good company, than 
for me alone, from an ifland 40 miles off the (hore,; 
and without any affiftance. Some days after, Fri* 
day and i being at work, as ufual, at the fame time^ 
diverting ourfelves with various difcourTes, I told 
him I had a boat which I would bed ow upon him, 
whenever be pleafed^to return tQ his nation : arid t^

him with mc to the other fide of the ifland, ^herc 
tny frigate lay, and then taking her from under 
water (for*I always kept her funk ior fear of a dif- 
^covery) we both went into it to fee how it would 
manage fuch ah expedition. 

And really never could any be more dexterous in 

' rowing than my faithful fervant, making the boat . 

^'go as faft agani as L could. Wcll^ now, Friday, 

•/aid I (hall we now go to yotir much dedred natiori ? 

But inftead of meeting with that chearfulnds I'CX* 

pe6led, he looked vcrv dull and melancholy at my 

- . fty.j'ng fo J which incleed at firft furprifed me, till 

he made me fehfible, that hisf concern was* vbout the 

. boat*s being too fmall to go fo far a voyage. Upon 

which I l^t him undcrftand 1 had a 'mUchi^iggcr ; 

; and^ accordingly the next day went to the place 

.where the firft boat 'lay, which I had iti«de, when 

all the ftrength I had, or art I could ufe, failed me 

in my attempt to get it into the water ; but now it 

' having lain m the fun two and twenty years^ and 

no care being taken of it all that while, it became 

in a manner rotten. My man told me, that fuch 

' a.boat would do very well for the purpofe, fufficient 

\ tQ csixry enough vittiefdrirttf bread, for that was his 

; ^mariner of talking. In ftiort, my mind being 

ftfongly fixed upoti my dcRgn of going •vcr with

woyld both go and make a boat full as big, and more* 

f)ropoitionabJe than that, wherein he might fafely 

I reiarn to his dwn nation. 

Thdfe (votds made Fridty look fo very pcnfive,

me not care to be in my nation^ leave you here, me dejire

was for the cenverfion of that barbarous people. But 
as 1 bad no apoftolic miffion, nor any concern about 
their falvation ; fo 1 had not the leaft intention or de- 
iire of undertaking it : and the ftrength of n^y incli* 
nation, in order to efcape, proceeded chiefly front my 
Ia*e difcourfe with Friday, about chefe iieventeen white 
beared men, that had been drrvenupon the barbarian 
coad; whom I defigned to join, as the only means 
to further our efcape. To which int^nt my man and 
I went to fearch for a proper tree to fell, whereof we 
might make a periagua or caaoe, to undertake the 
V Ay age ; and, indeed, we were not long in finding one 
fie for our purpofe, there being enough of wo^ in 
the ifland to have built a fleet of large vefiels, but the 
thing w« principally wanted,- was, to get one fo near 
the water^ that we might launch it after it was fini(b*> 
ed, and not commit fo horrid a miftate as I had done 
once before. 

Well, after a great learch^ for what wis bed and 
mod convenient, Friday at laft, who fe judgment in 
iucfa affairs was much niperior toniine# pitches up* 
on a kitid of wood the mod fitting for it. To.tbis 
day I cmnot tell the name of the tree, nor defcribe ' 
it any other way, than only by faying, that it ta 
very like that we call fujlic, or between that and 
the Nicaragua wood, being much of the iame co» 
lour and fmcli. But though my man exceeded nie 
in the knowledge of the mofl proper treCi yet I 
ihtwed hhn a tnuch better and cleaner wa}; to make 
a canoe than ever ke knew before : for he was for 
Wniog the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order

and then when the tide was out, we made a Arong

1, don*t-be terrified. A warrant you we will not 
only defend ourfeives againfl them, but kill the . 
ino(i of thefe cruel favagc^s. B^jt theugh I comfor* 
ted him in the he(l manner I could, the poor crea- 
ture trembled fo, that I fcarce knew what to da 
with him ; 0, majler^ Uid he, they came look Friday ^ 
cut pieces Friday, cut ameuf. . 

Why, Friday, (aid 1, they will eat me up as well 
as you, and my danger is as. great as yours. But 
fintc it fe fo, Wi murt refolve to fight for our lives. 
What fay you ? can you fight, Fud:iy ? Yes, faid 
he^ very faintly, inejhootj me kill what I can, but there 
come great many number* 1 hat's no matter, faid I 
agiin, our guns will terrify thofe that we do not- 
kill ; I am veiy willing to (land by you to the lad 
drop of my blood. 

Now, tell me, if yot» will do the like by me, amd 
obey my orders in whatfoever 1 command ? Friday 
then anfwered, Otnc^er^ melofe life far you, me Ae 
wkei^ ym bid die, fhUs concluding all queftions 
concerning his fidelity, tmmediateiy 1 fetclied hiitm 
a good dram of rum, (of which f had been a very 
good bufi>ind) atMi gave it him to cdrafoit bis heart. . 
After he had dr^nk it, 1 ordered him to take the 
twb fowling pieces, which We always carried, and 
load them wfth large fwan fiiot, as big as fmall piO*

gave Friday his hatchet, asaboft excellent weapoa 
for defence. 

Thus. prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as zny 
kni^ht-erraot that ever handled a fword and fpear. 1 
took my perfpe^ve glafs, and went up to the fide of 
the hilly to fee what I could, difcover ; and 1 perceiv-r 
ed very fooit, by my glafs, that there were one ani 
twenty favages, three prifoners, and three canocF^ 
ana their chief concent feemed to be the triun^phant ' 
b^nqtiet upon the three poor human bodies, aching, 
which by this time I had obferved was Very conomoA 
with them. I alfo xenrarked, that thty did not land 
at that place from whence Friday made his efcjrpe,. 
but nearer to the creek where the fhore was Jow, and 
whdre a thick wood came very clofe to the fea. My 
foul was theii filled with indignation and abhorrence 
at fuch inhun>an wrc|^hes, which put a period to M* 
my former thoughts jn their vindication, neither 
would I give myfelf time to confidcr their right of 
conquefty as 1 had done before : Butdefcendxng fcom 
the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told him, 
I' was refolvec to go fpeedily to them, and kill them 
all I afking hirh again in the fame bieath,^ if hw vtrould 
ftand by me : When by this time being recovered 
from his fright, and his fpirit much cheered with thef 
dram 1 had given him, he was very pleafeutj yet fe- 
rioufly telRng me,asne did before. When I kid d'le^kt

And liow it was, having &ced my refolution in (b 
fifong a manner, that nothing could diveft my breaffi

ifllbp's burden, a Tiliall hq^de of rum, which wa» 
foon iightened to our exceeding refreibment. Thu6 
we marched out, under a ponderous load of armour,, 
like tivo invincible champions^ wittf a ^i^aQticy ot pow 
der and bullets to (land our battle and load again, 
when the pieces were difc barged. And now my or- 
ders beiiv^ to be obeyed, i charged Friday to keep 
clofe behind me, and not to ftir, or (hoot, or attempt 
any thing till 1 commanded^him ; and, in the inte* 
rim, n*t to fpe.ik To 'much as one word. It was iiv 
this order 1 fetched a compafs to the right band of 
near a miFc, as well to get over the creek, as to at» 
tain tbe wood ; and by this, I thoi:ght to come with- 
in (hot of theiti before I could be difcerned, as 1 
found by my glafs, wou|d not be diiUculc to accom^ 
pliQ). 

But how fickle and lyavering is the mind of men, 
even in our greateU fury and (ULpngefl inclinations t 
for while I vicas taking this mafcTi, my reibiution be- 
gan CO abate, not through fear of tiieir numbers, who 
were a parcel of naiced unarmed wretches, but tboie 
reflections occiu'red to my thought|: W'hat power. 
was I commiflicned with, or what occa/ion or necef- 
itty had I to go and imbrue my hands in human bloody 
and murder people th^t had neither.done nor intcjid* - 
cd.co do me any Mrrong ? They were innocent in par- 
ticular as to me ; and their barbarous cuAom was 
not only their mibf«>rtune but a fign that God had left 
them in tlie moft immenfc fiupidity ^ but yet did not. 
]ii^arrant me to be a Judge of ri;eir actions, much lefs 
an executioner of his righteous judgements ; That 
on the contrary, whenever he tl>Qught fit, he would< 
take veng<?anc^ on theiu bimfelf and puniih them irt

Thus fixed in my refoJutiom 1 entered into the 
thick wood, (my man Friday following me clofe be- 
hind) when with ail poffible warincfs and fiknce,^l 
marched till I came to the ftirt of it, oh thait fide 
which was the neareft to them j for only one ^nd of 
the wood intcrpofcd between me and them. Upon ^ 
which I called very foftly to Friday ; andjhewmg 
him a great tree, that was juftat the corner of the 
wood, I ordered him to repair thiiher, and bring mo 
word, Jf he could plainly percch-c {heir adions ijac- 
cordly, hedid as 1 coifimanded him, and came back 
with this melancholy ftory, that they were all abo«t^ 
their fire, eating the flcih of one of their pritoners^; 
and that another lay bound upon the fand, a little dii- 
taut from them, which they defigned for their next fa- 
crtfice ; and this he told me was not one of their na- ^ 
tion, but one. of thofe very bearded men, who was 
duivcn by a ftorm into their country, and of whom 
he had fo often fpoketo me about. You may be iurc, 
that upon hearing this, my foul was ready to fink 
within me: when afcending up into a tree 1 law 
plainly, by my ghfs, a white man, who lay upon the 
beach of the fea, wi^h bis hands tied with flags or 
things refembling ruflies, being covered with cloties, 
and feemed to be art Eaivpean, From the tree where 
I took this profpea I perceived another tree, and a 
thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to them 
than where I was, which, by taking a finall circle 
. r<^nd, I might come at undifcovered and then' 1 
fhould be within half a (hot of thefe devourers. And 
this confidcration alone, to be more pcrfeftly revenged 
upon them, made nae withold my palRori, though I 
was enrj^ed to the higheft degree j when going back 
about twenty paces, I got behind fome buflics, which

I afcended to a little riiing ground, apd there 1 had a 
Ml vie«tf of thefe creaturef^* and 1 could perceive all 
their anions* 

. Such a fight^did then appear, as obliged me not to 
lofc a moment's time^ No left than nineteen of 
tkcfe wretches fat upoa the ground,- dofe together, 
expreiling all the delight imaginable at (o bsirbaroua 
an entertainm9nt ; and they bao juft fent two to mur- 
der this unhappy Chrifitan^ and bring him limb by ^ 
limb to their fire^ for they were then juft going ito 
unite the bands from his feet, in order for de^th. 
Hereupoh, immediately turning to my man, Kow^ 
Friday^ faid I, mind what I fay, fail in nothings but *"

vffli.m, who would have been facrific^-d, had not 
our fivft fire obliged the butchers, i»ith three others, 
to jump into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at 
them, at which (hot I thought he had killed them 
all, by reaj'on of their fallint; to the bot;om of the 
boat ; however, he killed two and mortally wound- 
ed a third; In the imean time 1 cm the flags that 
tied the hands and fei!t of the poor creature, and 
lifting" him up, afkcd him in the Portvguefe tongue, 
IVhat he was ?' he an( wered jpc in Latin^ Chrijiianus : 
but fo very weak and faint that he could fcaice ftand 
or (peak. 

I gave him immediately a dram and a piece of 
bread to cherifh him, and afked him, What eoun- 
try man he was ? He faid Efpaniola, and then uttered 
all the thankfulnefs imaginable For his deliverance* 
Si^ior^ (faid I with ag much Spanijh as I was mafler 
of) let us talk afterwards but fight now ; here, take 
this fword and piftol, Imd do what you can. And, 
indeed, he did fo with fuch courage and intrepidity^ 
that he cut two of them to pieces in an inftant, the 
lavages not hav*ing the power to fly for their lives. 
I ordered Friday to run for thoft pieoet we«had left 
at the tree, which he brought me with great (wift- 
ner<;, and then I gare him my mufket, while I Ioa« 
ded the reft. But now there happened a fierce en- 
counter between the Sfamard and one of the fava^ 
ges, who made at him with one. of their wooden 
i'words; and though the former was. as braVe as 
could be expe6^ed having twice wounded his enemy 
in the head ; yet being weak and faint, the Indran 
had throv^n him u}>on the. ground, and was wrefling 
my f^vord out of his band, which the Spaniard very 
wifely quitting drew out his piflol, and (hot him 
through the body before I could come near him 
fhongh I was running to his afliflance. As to /hV 
</jy, fee purfucd the flying wretches with his hat- 
chet, dlfpatchJn^ three, but the reft were too nim- 
ble for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fow^

wood* Friday purfued and killed ; but ihe other 
notwithftandiog bis wounds^ plunged bimfelf into 
the lea, and fwam to tbofe who were left in the c^- 
noeg which with one wounded, were all that efca- 
ped out of one and twenty, . 

Ihe favages in the canoe worked very hard to 

get out pf our reach, and Friday was as eager in 

purfuing them ; and, indeed, I was no lefs anicious 

about their efcape, left, after the news had been 

carried to their people, they (hould return in n3uU 

titudes, and deftroy us. So being refolved to pur* 

fue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and 

bid Friday follow vat ; but no fooner Has I in^ than 

to my fuTprife, I found another poor creature, 

bound hand and foot fof tbe (laughter, juft as the 

Spamard had been, with very, little life in hinu 

Immediately I unbound him, ^nd would have 

helped bioi up ; but he could neither (land nor 

ipeak but groaned fo piteoufly, as thinking be was 

.otsly uilbound in order to be (laie* Hereupon I bid 

Friday fpeak to him, aod. tell hisi of his deliverance ; 

iriusa pulling out my bottle I madc^tbe poor wretch 

drink a dram, which, with the joyful news he had 

receivolt fo revived hisheai^t, that he fat up in the 

boat* .As fooft as Friday began to hear him fpeak, 

ami look tiKire fully in his face, il would harxe mov-- 

led asiy one to tears to perceive Ms utiGomcnofi tmnt* 

portr^ ioy : for he kifled, embiaeedhim, hugged 

him, oriedi^ laughed, haliooed, jumped abouli, 

dac^ed^ fung, then cried again, wrung his hands, 

belt his £ace and head,, then fungand jumped about 

again, like a diftradled creature :. fo that it was a 

great while before I could m^ke him fpeak to me, 

or tell me what was the matter with him ; but 

when be came to the liberty of his Ipeech, at laft 

hf told me it was his father* 

Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee that 
dutiful and tender affedion this poor lavage ha4'4o

boat, o{)eu hi& breail, and hold his father's head

^erc fiiff and aunibed, with binding, and chafed 
and rubbed them wiih his hands; by which means* 
perceiving what the cafe was, I gave him fomc 
Turn, which proved of great benefit to him. 

While we were bufy in this action, the favages 
iiad gotten almoA out of fight; and happy it was 
we did not purfue them : For there arofe from the 
north-weft, which continued all night l<>ng, (uch 
a violent fiorm, that 1 could not fuppofe otherwiiie 
but that they were all drowned. AHcr this I called 
Friday to me, and aflced him, if he had given his 
father any bread?. He ihook his head, and faid. 
None, noi one bit, me eat a up all; fo I gave hiw a 
cake o( bread out of a little ^poucb I carried for 
this end* I likewife gave a dram for himfelf and 
<wo or three bunches of raiHasfor his father* Bot]» 
thefe he carried to him, for* he would mjike him 
drink the dram to comfort kirn* 

Away he then runs out of theT>oat as if be was . 
bewitclied, with fuch extraordinary (wiftnefs, th^ 
he was out of iight as it were in an inftant ; but, at , 
iiis return I perceived him flacken bis pace, becaufe ; 
he had fomethingyibis hand. And this 1 found to , 
be, as he approached nearer, an earthen jug with 
fome watet for his father, with two more cakes of 
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being 
very thirfty mifelf, I. drank (bme of the watcr» of 
which when his father had drank fufficiently, it^ 
more revived his fpirits than all the rum 1 had givea 
him. , . 

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him ta

Sying with the greateft fWtfrneft, and no left than 
iixlcen or feventeen wolves purfuirtg after him, in 
tirder to devour the poor creature : and iiinjueition- 
llbiy they did fo, after they had run hitn down, hot 
Ibtfing ^ble to hold out that fwtftnefii with which be. 
*ift firfi ^^o^^ped them. 

' When we rode up t^ that entrance from whence

- Never certainly was there a more fmious charge 
Hian what the wolves made upon us in this place $ 
and the fight of the horfes, w^ch was the principal 
prey they aimed at, psovokcd^ their hunger, and added 
to their natural- fiercenefs; They came on us with a 
mod dreadful noi(e, that made the woods ring again ; 
and beginning to.mount the pieces of timber, I or- 
dered every man to fire as before dlrefled : and, in«< 
tieedy fo well did they take their aim, that they kilU 
ed fcveral of the wolves at the firfi volley; bat fiill 
we were obliged takeep a continual firing, by reafon 
they came on like devils, pufliing one another with 
the greateft fury* Btit'our fecond volley fomething 
abated their courage, when, fiopping a little, we 
hoped they wouki have ftiade the beft o( their way p 
however, it did not prove fo, for others m^dt a new 
attempt upon us ; and though in four firings we kiUed 
leventccn or eighteen «f them,'la0ung twice as many^ 
yet they ieveral times fucceffiveiy came on, as though 
they valued not their lives for the fakeof their prey* 
« Unwilling wa$ 1 to fpend our lafb ihot too fuddenly^

that 1 had' no bccafion to feek for more riches, who' 
already was bfeft with fufiicicncy, with much ftrug-

As to the next concern, relarng to our corn and

valley where the cave was, that being moft proper 
for both. But yet, when we confidered further^ 
we altered one part of our refolution ; which was, to 
remove only part of our corn there; fo that in*cafe 
one part was dcftroy«d the other might be preferv-

a great deal of prudence in it : 'and that was, in not 

• trufting the three favages whom we had taken pri- 
foners, with any knowledge of the plantations which 
we had made in the valley, of what number of cat- 
tle wc had there, much lefs.of the cave, wherein we 
kept fcveral arms, and two barrels of powder you 
left for us, at your departure from this ifland. But 
chough we would not change ^ur habitation, wc 
refolvedti) make it more fortified, and nriore (ecret. 
To this end. Sir, as you had planted ^^rees at fome

imitating your example, planted and filled up the 
whoie fp^ce of ground, even to the banks of the 
creek f nay^ into the vjery ooze, where the tide flow*

I had planted they had intermingled fo mapy (hort 
ones, all of which growing wonderfully faft and thick, 
a little dog could fcarce find a pafTage through them. 
Nor was this lufficient, as we thought, for wc did the 
fame to all the ground to the fight and left hand of 
us, even to the top of the hill, without fo much as 

' leaving a paflage for ourfelves, except by the ladder : 
M^hrch being taken dowa, nothing but what had 
wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. 
And, indeed, this was exceedingly well contrived, 
efpecially to ferve that occafion, for which we after» 
wards found it neceffary. 

Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, 
having, all this time, not one vifit from the favages. 
Indeed one morning, we had an alarm, whichfput 

- us into fome amazement: for a few of my Spaniards 
being out very early, p,crceivcd no Icfs than iwcaty

cftnoeSy as it were coming on (hore: upon whichf 
returning home, with great percipitation, they gave 
tjs the alariPy which obliged us to keep at home all 
that day, and the next, &:oing out only in the night- 
time to make our obfervations; but, as good luck 
would have it, they were upon another d«figii| and 
did not land that time upon the ifQjnd. 

But now there happened another quarrel between 
the three EngliQjmen, and lome of my Spaniards^ 
The occafion was this: One of them being enraged 
at one of the favages, whom we had takcw prifoner^ 
for not being able to comprehend fomfthing#hicb 
he was (hewing him, fdatched up a hatchet in ^ 
^rcat furyf not to correct but to kill him ; yet mif-' 
fing his head, be ^ave him fuch a barbarous cut on 
the fhoulder, that he Had tike to have Aruck off his^ 
arm : at which one of my good-'nalured Spaniards^ 
Uitrrpofing between the EngllQiman and the favage^, 
bcfeeched the former not to murder the poor crea- 
ture : but this kindnels had like to have co(l the 
Spaniard bis life, for the EnglKhman (truck at him^ 
ill the fame manner, which he fyimbly and wikly

the good Spaniard on theeatth r wheii- immediately 
two others coming to bis »elief» were attacked by the^ 
third Englifhman,, armed with an old cutlafs, whey 
wounded them both. This uproar foon reached our

About five days after, tbey came to tho(c UrmtB 
appointed, in order f6t mure viflualg, an4 fent xnc 
word by one of the Spaniards^ whom they called to 
where they had pitched their tents* and itfirked 
themfelves an habitation and plantati^Kiy at the N» 
£• and moil remote pirt of the ifland. And iade«d 
there they built themfelves two very han^foinc cot- 
tages, rerembling our little caftle, iDeing under the 
fide of a mountain, with fome trees already growing 
on three (ides of it ; fo that planting a few more^ 
it would be obfcured trom the fight, unleis partis 
cularly fought for. When thefe huts were fiuiflied^ 
we gave them fome dry goat fkins for bedding and 
covering; and upon thoir giving us fuller affuran- 
ces of their good behaviour for the future, we gave 
them fome peaa, barley, apd rice for fowing, and' 
whatever tools ^^e could (^are» 

Six months did they live in this feparate cond^* 
tion, in which they got their |irft harveft in, the 
quantity of which was but fmall, becaufe tbey had 
planted but little Isjnd : for indeed, all their plan- 
tation being to form, made it mMe difficult, efpc- 
cially as it w^s a thing out of their cknrent ; »n<l 
when they were obliged to make their boards and 
pots. Sit. tbey could make little or nothing of it*. 
But the rainy feafon coming on, put them into a 
greater perplexity for want of a cave to keep their 
corn dry, and prevent it from fpoiling ; and f€^ 
much did this humble them, that they begged of 
my Spaniards to help them, to which rhe good-na- 
tured men readily confented, and in four days 
fpace, worked a gveat hole in the fide of the bill for 
them, large enough for their purpole, to fccure their 
corn and other things from the rain^ though not 
comparable to ours, which had feveral srdditional 
apartments. ' . 

But a new whim poffffferf thefe rogues about three 
quarters of a year alter, which had like to have 
ruined us and themfelves too: for it feems being 
tired and weai;y i^i this fort of liviiag^. which naade

Indeed the proje^ was not fo [>i;(pd!lcrious, if 
they had not gone farther ; but they neither did, 
nor propofed any thing bv; what had mifchtef in thf

tired of ^heir.inanncr of living and the labour of 
their hands, in fuch einpJoyaients, not b^ing fuf- 
fici&nt to procure the neceffaiies of life, they only 
deljred one of the canoes we caqie over in, witb 
feme aims and anmunitoni for their defence, and 
they woi^ld feck ttuur fo^iuRcs abroad,, and never 
trouble us any more. To bcfure* Tve wwe gla4

'et horiefty qitde us Ingenuoully r^iefent to the^

might as well he (larvtd abroad as at home ; ^nd a*

childica to cry after theni i nay, fq iptent were they 
-upon their voyage, that if the Spaniards had not

wholly ignorant of, yet feemed entirely contented 
with ; and dragging the poor wretches into the boat,

and To taking leave withall pofltble refpe^ and tkank» 
though neither of thero underftood what the others 
faid, they failed away back to the ifland, and ther^ 
fct eight of the prifoners at liberty.

it was impo^ble to make them fenftble of any thing ^

^und them (lark naked, expeSing their fatal tiage- 
dy; there were three lufty men, well ihaped, with 
ilraight and fair limbs, between .thirty and five and 
thirty years old ; and five women, two of them 
might be from thirty to forty, two more not above four 
jand twenty ; and the laft a comely tall maiden of abduc *

they were tawny, nrhich their moded behaviour and 
other graces made amends for, wheiuthey afterwards 
came to be clothed^ 

This naked appearance, together with their mifer-

my Spaniards, who, for their part?, I may venture 
Sir, without flattery, to fay, are men of the beft be- : 
haviour, calmed tempers^ and fweetcft nature, that 
can poiGbly be ; for they immediately ordered Friday's 
fether to fee if he knew any of them, or if he under- 
ftood what they 'could fay. No fooner did the old In- 
dian appear, but he looked at them with great feri- 
oufnefs ; but, as they were not of his nation, they 
were utter Grangers to him, and none could under- 
(land his fpeech, or figns, but one woman. This

both did not make the fame improvements » either ta 
their cultivation or in their planting* The two ho* 
tieft had a multitude of young trees planted about 
their habitztions, fo that when you approachecS^near 
there^ nothing appeared but a wood, very pleaftng 
and delightful. Every thing they did.prorpered and 
^ourifbed ; their grapes planted' in order, feemed as 
though managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely 
preferable to any of the others. -Nor were the^ 
wanting to find out a place of retreat, but dug a cave 
sn the mod retired pftrt of a thick wood, to fee u re 
their wives and children, with their prevrfion and 
chiefeft goods, funrounded with innumerable ttakes, 
•and having a mofi- fubtle entrance, in cafe any mil- 
chief (bould happen, either from their fellow coun« 
try men, or the devouring favages. 

As to the reprobates, (though I mUft-own they 
were much more civilized than before) inftead of a 
delightful wood furrounding their dwellings, we found 
^ the words of king Solomon too truly verified ; / went 
ty the vineyard of thejlothful^ and it was all overgrown 
with thorns* In many places their crop wasoblcured 
by weeds ; the hedges having feveral gaps in them, 
the wild goats had got in, and eaten up the corn, and 
tierc and there; was a dead buih, to flop thofe gaps 
Tor the prefent, which was no more than (hutting the 
(lable door ^ben the fteed was Aoleivaway. But as

What to do with them at firft we could not tell ,s

to killing them, neither Chri&tanity nor hqmanity'

thought thev could better themfelves, I cannot tell ; 
but certainly one of them ran into. the -woods, and 
they could not hear of htm for a long time after. 

Undoubtedly » there was reafoA enough to fuppofr

turning in about four weeks thiie» and goin^off in 
the fydict of two dayr. You may be certain, ^ir, this 
thoughHy could not but terrify m exceedingly, and 
make us juftly conclude, that this favage would iii- 
form his countrymen of our abode in the ifhnd, how 
few and weak we were inccmparifou to their numbers ^

wretched maiineri As Atkins retreated, oar party

We could rather, at firft, have wifiied that the

Ulter ruin and diflblution, we were very well plea« 
fed the. Coptrary happened : And Will Atkins (who, 
though wounded, would not part from us all this 
while) advifed us not to let flip this advantage, but 
clapping between them and their boats, ideprive 
them of the capacity of ever returning to plague 
the ifland ; . I know, (faid he), there is but one ob- 
jedion you can make, which is, that thefe, crea- 
tures, living like wild beafls in the woods, may 
make excutlroBS, rifle the plantations, and deHroy 
the tame goats : But confider, we had better have 
to do with an hundred men,' whom we can kill or 
make flaVes of, at leifure, than with an hundred na* 
tions, whom it is impoflible we (hould fave ourfelvcs 
from, much lefs fubdue. This advice, and thefc 
arguments being approved of, we fet fire to their 
boats ; and though they were fo wet that they 
would not burn entirely, yet we made them i|;^:a- 
pable for fwimming in the feas. As foorias the lu^ 
dians perceived what w& were doing, many of thetn

• ^anoes, they would ricvcr trouble us again* • 

But ail their complaints, fubitiiflions and entrea-

us to the contrary, we deftroycd every one. of thcni

mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove 
to Fial« where felling their commodity-, which was 
corn, they refoived to take in their loading at the iflc 
of May, aad t<i fail to Newfoundland ; at the banks 
of which; meeting a French (hip bound to Quebec^ 
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, 
in this {liip he embarked ; the maAer of which dying 
at Quebec, that voyage was fulpendcd ,• and laftly, 
<hipping hirafelf f©r France, this laft jQiip was deftroyed 
by lire, as before has been related. 

At this time we talked .no further : but another 
morning he comes to me, juft as I was going to vifit 
the Engliihmen's colony, and tells me, that as he 
knew the profperity of the ifland was my principal 
defire, he had ibmething to communicate agreeable 
to my defign, by which perhaps he might put it, . 
more than he yet thought it was, in the way of the , 
benediAion of heaven. How, . Sir ? faid I, in a fur- 
prize, are we not yet in the way of God's bleifing, 
after all thefe fignal providences and deliverances, of 
which you have had fuch an ample relation? He re- 
plied, 1 hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your 
good defign will profper: but Alll there aie fo me 
among you that are not equally right in their adions ^ 
and remember, I befeech you, Sir, that Achan^ by 
his crime, removed God's blcfling from the camp of 
the children of Ifrael ; that though fix and*thirty were 
entirely innocent, yet they became the objefls of di- 
vine vengeance, and bore the weight of the punifhmcnt 
accordingly. 

So feniibly was I touched with this difcourfe, and 
fo fatisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his 
foul, that I defifed him to accompany me to the Eng- 
liftimen's plantations, which he was very glad of, by 
reafon they were the fubjc6l of what he defigned todif-^ 
courfe with me about; and while we walked on Xoofi^ 
ther, he began in the following manner ;

religion ; but, furcly both of us acknowledge thh^ 
that tbcre is a God, who having given us fome flated 
rules for our fcrvice and obediemce, we ought not 
'willingly and knowingly to oflend him, either by 
neglecting what he has commanded, ot by doing 
what-lie has forbidden. This truth evtry Cfariftian 
owns, that when any Dne»prefumptuoufly fins agaitift 
God's command, the Almighty then withdraws his 
kindnefs from him ; every good man therefore •»jght 
certainly to prevent fuch negleft of, or fin ag^nft 
God and his commands* I thanked the young prieft 
for expreffing^ To great a gpncern for us, and defired 
him tu explain the particuliars of what he bad obfer- 
ved, that, according to the parable of Achwit, 1 might 
remove the accurfed thing from among ul5. Why 
theti, Sir, faid he, in the firft plate, you have four 
Knglilhmcn, who have taken favagc women to theit 
wives, by whom they have feveral ehildren, though 
^ none of them are legally married, as the law of God 
and mah requires ; they, I fay, Sif, are no lefts than 
adulterers, and as tbey ftiU live in adultery, ate liable 
to the curfc of God. i know. Sir, you may objeft 
the want of a prieft or a clergymaft of any kind ; as 
jilfo pen ink and paper, to write dbwn a contract of 
marriage, and have it figned between them. But 
neither this, nor what the Spanifh governor has told 
you of their chufing by confent, can be reckoned a 
t»arriage, nor any more than an agreement to keep 
them from quarreling among themfelves ; for. Sir, 
the effence or facrament of matrimony (fo he called 
}t ) not only coiififts in mutual confent but legal obl- 
igation, which contpels them 10 own and ackilow-r 
ledge one another, to abflain froni other perfons, the 
men to provide for their wives and children, and the 
woAien to the fame and like conditions, muialls^ mu^ 
fandis, on their fide ; whereas, Sir, thefe men, upon 
their own pleasure, oh any bccafxon, may forfake 
thofe women, and rnarry others, and by difowning 
their children, fuffcr them utterly to periQi. Now, 
Sir, added he, can God be hoi^oitr^d ia fuch an un^

try it is pail my remedy, and I cannot hdp it.— 
7 rue, Sif'y anfwered the young pvieft, you canwt be' 
charged with thdt pari of ihe crime which was done in 
your abfence : but I befeech you, don't Jfatter yourfelf, 
that yuu are under no obligation now to put a period to it ; 
which if younegledi to da, the guilt will be entirely on you 
aloney Jinc£ it is ceriuinly in nobody* s power but yours, to 
^ker their condition^ T mui) eontefs,' i was fo "dull, 
that I thought he meant I ftould part them,- and 
knowing this would put the.whoU ifland. into Con fu-> 
lion, I told kim I would not confent to it upon any 
aecount wh^tfoever^ Sir, faid he in a great furpiize ; 
/ do not mean th<\t they Jhould feperates but marry themf\

by all the xfdtne^s prefent, which all the Euiopevn /aw^ 
decree to be of fyj^cient efficacy^ A"^aaed wjtb fuch 
true piety and fincerity, and confidering the validity 
of a written contrail, I ackaowledged all that he 
faid to be very juft and kind ^ and that I would dif- 
courfe with the men about it; neither could I fee' 
what reafon they could have not to let him ip^rry

church fends nufftonaries into Perfa, hdiay and China,

thai they would never foifake them while they had

Such a furpvifing account aa this was proveil very:

not be in vain. Accordingly I called her in, and

encouraged hiHi tiot to be afraid, but brtAg the (hip

muft engage them. According^ we did to, and 
fulled all our fails: As to the lavages, wc feared 
nothing, but only that they tnight let the ihip on 
fire^ to prevent which, I ordered them to get tfadir 
boats out, and fallen them, one clofe by the bead and 
the other by the.ftem, well manned, with fteets and

As they approached us, .they feemed to be in the 
the greateft amazement, not knowing what to. make 
of us. They.row««i round the (hip, which occaii- 
oned us to call to the men in the boats, not to fuffier 
them to come near. Hereupon they beckoned to the 
favages to keep back, which tkey accordingly did ; 
but at their retreat they let fly about fifty arrows at 
US, and very miicb wounded one of our men in the 
)oog-boat« I called to them not to fire upon any ac- 
count, but handing them down, fome deal boards, the 
carpenters made them a kind of fence to Aia Id them 
from the arrows. In half an hour after, they came 
fo near a<-flern of us, that we had a perifeft fight of 
them ; then they rowed a little farther out, till they 
came direAly along fid& of us, and then approached 
fo near that they could hear us Q>eak. This made ■ 
me order all our men to keep clofe, and get their J

and made faft our line to the boat ^ upon this^ flip- 
ping our cables, they, towed us out of the reac^ of 
their arrows, and quickly »fter^ abroadfide was given 
them from the (hip, which made a moft dreadful ba- 
vock among them- When we got on boards we ex- 
amined into the CiCcaGon of this fray ; <hc men who 
fled informed us, that an old woman who fold milk 
within the poles, had brought a young woman with 
lier, who carried roots or herbs, the £ght of whom fo 
much tempted our mea^ that theyoflered rudenefs to 
the maid, at which the old woman fet up a great cry ; 
nor would the failors part with the prizes but car- 
,fied her among the trees^ while the old woman went 
and brought a whole army ^iown upon them. At the 
beginning of the attack one of our men was killed 
with, a lance, and the fellow, wh« begun the mif- 
chief, paid dear enough for his miftrefs, though a8 
yet we did not know what had become of him; the 
reft lu,cki.lyefcaped. 

l*hc third night after the adion, being c«iriou€

But I utterly refufed to go, and commanded them 
b^cVf being unwiiling to hazard their lives, as the 

^fafety of the fliip wholly depended upon them. 
Notwithftanding all 1 cowld fay to them, they all 
left me but one, and the fupercargo: So wc three 
returned to the boat, where a boy was left, refolving . 
to flay till- they returned. At paningy I told 'them 
I fuppofed moft of them would (hare the fame fate

boys, come along we'll warrant well come offfafe *

all my' admonitions^ either concerning their own 
fafety, or the prefervation of tht (hip. Indeed^ 
they were well armed, every man having- a muiket, 
bayonet^ and a piftol, befides cutlaffefe^, haogers, 
pole'' axes, and hand granades* They came to a few 
Indian houfesatfirft, which not being the town they 
expefted, they went fartheri and fmding a cow tied 
to a tree, they concluded that fho would be a fuffi- 
cient guide, and fo it proved ; for after they untied 
her, fhe led them direftly to thetown, whichcon* 
fifted of above two hundred houfes, feveral families 
living ill (ome of the huts together. • At. thchr af-

Tiius defptrtftely reiblved they went to work ; but 
tKe firft ^arty had not gon« far, before they called 

. out to the reft, that they had found Tom Jeffreys 5 
whereupon they alltan up to the phce, and found 
the poorfellow mdeed hanging up naked by one arm,

frighted inhabitants endeavoured to run out to fave 
their lives, -but they werfe driven back into the 
flames by the failors, and killed wittiout mercy* 
At the firft houfe above-mentioned, after the boat-

perfon I fpokc to would have brought me .onjB,^b«|, 
like a fool, I muCl go along with hioi about two 
miles ffom the vilhge. My old pilot and I walkqd 
on. foot, forfooth, /orforae variety, when coming to . 
the placc-wherc the cansels were^kept as in a park 
guarded by Cirmefe fold! ersy we there agreed and 
bQught one, which ihc Cbinefe man that came with 
nie led along the road. But ^c had not gone far 
before we were attacked by five Tartar^, .njounted 
on horfeback,. two of whom feized the n)an, cook 
the camel from him, and rode away, while the other 
three approached us the firft of whom fuddenly 
fcpzcd. me as I was drawing my. fword, the fecoad 
knocked me down ; but.my ola trufty. Portygucfe, 
taking a piftol out of his pocket, which I knew no- 
thing of) and cc^n^ng up to the fellow that ftruck 
mc,' he, with one hand, pulled him off his horfe, 
and then (hot him dead upon the fpot ; then takmg 
hisfcymitar he (Iruck.at^he man that (lopt us, but 
. miflSng him, cut. off one of his horfe's ears, the 
pain of which made hinj throw his rider to tjhe 
ground. The poor Chinefi^ who haid led the camel, 
. lecing the Xartar down, runs to, him, and Ceizing 
upon his pole-axe, wrenched, it from his hands, and 
knocked ,his brains out. But there was another 
Tartar to deal with, who feemcd neither inclini^d 
to .fight nor to fly, and xny old mail having begun 
to charge l|is piftpl, the. very Aght.of it flruck fuch a 
terror into the wretch, that away he fcoured, leaving 
my old pilot, rather my champion anddefender, an 
^bfolute vifbory.

unafraid, if the Tartars attack us»..thcy will all 
run away. Why,. Siguier,.. fa:d 1, what will be 
iJone in this cafe? Done, fays.he, why, let fifty of 
uur men advance,, and flank them on each wing. I 
know the fellows will fight well enough in company.. 
We accordingly took his advice, and marched fUty 
to the right wing,, and th^ fame numher te the lefl, 
and with the reft made aline of lefeive, leaving the 
Aifi two huodred men to gu^rd the camels, or ^o 
jfTiil lis as occ;^fion required. 

Thus prepared, a party of the enemy canie fot>' 
v.ard, viewing our poiture, andtra-verfingthc ground 
on the fLont of our line. Hereupon we ordered 
Ji.e t,wo winga to move on,. and give- them a falute 
wiih their ihot ; which accordingly wad done. This 
put a Hop to their proceedings ^ for immediately 
wheeling off n> their left they ail niarohed an;a^, and 
we faw no more of them.. They had undoubtedly 
given an account to their companions of what recep?- 
lion they might expedl,. which; made them fo eaiiiy

When, we came to the city of Naum, we returned 
the governor hearty thanks,.and difperfed a hutidred 
crowns among the foldiers that, guarded us. Wc

paffing feveral great rivers anddefarts;. and on the 
13th of Aprils we came to the frontiei^s of Mufcovy, 
the frrfl town of which was called Argun. 

This happy occafion,.as I thought, of coming in- 
to a Chridian country^ made me congratulate the 
Scots merchant upon it: He fmiled at that, telling 
me not Id rejoice too foon ;. for,, faid he, except

fide, caiied Soloi Kotnofkoi, where we found- jthe 
people mojllyv Pagans as befpre. We then paiTed 
a^defart of about two hundred milea over : but in 
other places it is near feven hundred. In pafsing 

.this wild place, we were befct.by.-a troop of men 
on horfcback, and about five and forty men armed 
with bows and arrows* But perceiving, a fmall grove 
at a little diftance^ with a. marchy piece of ground 

^nd a fpring of water we retreated thither without 
oppofition, and waited till within two hours of night » 
when they attacked ns with great furyt We fitft 
fired without ball, calling to them in the Ruffian 
tongue to know'their bujrnefs ; but they, eithtr not 
knowing) or.feeming not to ui^derftand us, came di- 
re£lly to the wood^-iide, not GonfideriRg that we had 
fo fortifi^ it by cutting the boughs nearly off* fome 
trees and joining them to others fo tliat they could

In the mean while we loa^ded our pieces with two 
or three bullets each, fired again, and wounded i^,

l#ft/ And my ipartner declared, tkat a<; the lofs or 
his goods would be his ruin, before they ilx>u Id be 
talcen from him, he would fight to the laft drop ot 
his'blood. 'As we oould not ^uetend. to force our 
way, we had recourfe to a ih-atagem.; ^we kindled a 
large ii re* which bufJit all night ; and no fooncr W3s 
it dark, i>ut we purfued our journey towarcts the 
pole, or north <hr, 'atid travelling afl night, by fix 
o^cloclc in the morning we came to a :Runvin village, 
callcJ Kertza, and from thence came to a large tov^'u 
iiamcd Ozonoys, where we heard that feveral troops 
of CalAiuch Tartars bad been abroad upon the de- 
fort, but that we were pad all danger. In five days 
after we came* to Veuflrma,. upon the river Witzedga ; 
fiiom thence we came to Lawrenfkoy on ihe third of 
July, ^vhere, -previding ourfclvcs with two iaggage 
\:oA\% and a convenient bark, we embarked the 7th, 
and arrived at Archangel the 18th, after a year five 
months, amd three. days ^urpey, including the eight 
ii^ontlK^ and odd days at ToboHkot. We came 
from Xfchangel the 20th of Augurt in the fame year, 
and arrived at Hamburgh, the 30th 'of September. 
Here my partner add 1 made a very good fale of our 
gocds, both thofe of.China and Siberia.4 when, 6\- 
vidinig ojur effects, my lliare came to 347 5U 1 7s. 3d. 
after all the. lofles we had fuftained, and charges we 
hidbeen at. Here the young lord took his leave of 
me, in order to go to the courr of Vicna, not only 
ta ieek prowaion, but to corefpond with his father's 
frienJs. After we had ftaid four months in Ham- 
burgh, I w^cnt from thence over land to the Hague,
