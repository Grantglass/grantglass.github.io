If ever the story of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth
making public, and were acceptable
when published, the editor of this ac-
count thinks this will be so. -
The wonders of this man’s life exceed
all that (he thinks) is to be found extant;
the life of one man being scarce capable
of a greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with
seriousness, and with a religious appli-
cation of events to the uses to which
wise men always apply them, viz. to
the instruction of others by this exam-
ple, and to justify and honour the wis-
dom of Providence in all the variety of

they will,
The editor believes the thing to be a
just history of fact; neither is there any
appearance of fiction in it: and though
he is well aware there are many who,
on account of the very singular preser–
vations the author met with, will give it
the name of a romance; yet, in which-
ever of these lights it shall be viewed,
he imagines, that the improvement of it,
as well to the diversion, as to the instruc-
tion of the reader, will be the same; and
as such, he thinks, without further com-

great service in the publication.
LIFE AND AIDVENTURES
O F - s
ROBIN SON CR US OE,
I was born at York, in the year 1652, of a re-
putable family. My father was a native of Bre-
men, who, by merchandising at Hull for some
time, gained a very plentiful fortune. He mar-
ried my mother at York, who received her first
breath in that country: and as her maiden name
was Robinson, I was called Robinson Kreutz-
maer; which not being easily pronounced in the
English tongue, we are commonly known by
the name of Crusoe. -
I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhari's
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards: what be-
came of the other, I could never learn. -
No charge nor pains were wanting in my
education. My father designed me for the law;
yet nothing would serve me but I must go to
sea, both against the will of my father, the tears
of my mother, and the entreaties of friends.
One morning my father expostulated very
warmly with me. VVhat reason, says he, have
you to leave your native country, where there
must be a more certain prospect of content and
happiness, to enter into a wandering condition
of uneasiness and uncertainly 2 He recommend-

ed to me the Augur's wish, Neither to desire
poverty norriches; that a middle state of life was
the most happy; and that the high towering
thoughts of raising our condition by wandering
abroad, were surrounded with misery and dan-
ger, and often ended with confusion and disap-
pointment. I entreat you, may, I command
you, says he, to desist from these intentions.
Consider your eldest brother, who laid down
his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his dis-
obedience to my will. If you will go, added he,
my prayers shall, however, be offered for your
preservation ; but a time may come, when, de-
solate, oppressed, or forsaken, you may wish
you had taken your poor despised father's coun-
sel.—He pronounced these words with such a
moving and paternal eloquence, while floods
of tears ran down his aged cheeks, that it seem-
ed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But
this soon wore off, and a little after I informed
my mother, that I could not settle to any bu-
siness, my resolutions were so strong to see the
world; and begged she would gain my father's
consent only to go one voyage ; which, if it
did not prove prosperous, I would never at-
tempt a second. But my desire was as vain as
my folly in asking. My mother passionately ex-
pressed her dislike of this proposal, telling me,
That as she saw I was bent upon my own de-
struction, contrary to their will and my duty, she
would say no more, but leave me to myself to do
whatsoever I pleased.
I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when
one time being at Hull, I met a school-fellow
of mine, going along with his father, who was
master of a ship, to London; and acquainting

him with my wandering desires, he assured me
of a free passage, and a plentiful share of what
was necessary. Thus, without imploring a bless-
ing, or taking farewell of my parents, I took
shipping on the first of September 1651. We
set sail soon after; and our ship had scarce left
the Humber a-stern, when there arose so vio-
lent a storm, that, being extremely sea-sick, I
concluded the judgments of God deservedly
followed me for my disobedience to my dear
parents. It was then I called to mind the good
advice of my father; how easy and comfortable
was a middle state of life; and I firmly resolved,
if it pleased God to set me on dry land once
more, I would return to my parents, implore
their forgiveness, and bid a final adieu to my
wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm con-
tinued ; but these good resolutions decreased
with the danger ; more especially when my
companion came to me, clapping me on the
shoulder://hat, Bob said he, sure you was not
frightened last night with scarce a capfull of
wind?—And do you, cried I, call such a vio-
Zent storm a capfull of wind 2 A storm, you
jool you, said he, this is nothing : a good ship
and sea-room always baffles such a foolish
, squall of wind as that ; but you're a fresh-
water sailor; come, boy, turn out, see what fine
weather we have now, and a goodboul of punch
will drown all your past sorrows. In short, the
punch was made, I got drunk, and in one
night's time drowned both my repentance and
my good resolutions, forgetting entirely the
vows and promises I made in my distress: and
whenever any reflections would return on me,
A 4
what by company, and what by drinking, I.
soon mastered those fits, as I deridingly called
them. But this only made way for another trial,
whereby I could not but see how much I was
beholden to kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor
in Harwich road, where we lay wind-bound
with some Newcastle ships ; and there being
good anchorage, and our cables sound, the sea-
men forgot their late toil and danger, and spent
the time as merry as if they had been on shore.
But on the eighth day there arose a brisk gale of
wind, which prevented our tiding it up-the ri-
ver; and still increasing, our ship rode fore-
castle in, and shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the sea-
men themselves, and I heard the master ex-
press this melancholy ejaculation, Lord have
mercy upon us, we shall be all lost and undone?
For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin,
ill the universal and terribly dreadful appre-
hensions of our speedy fate made me get upon
deck: and there I was affrighted indeed. The
sea went mountains high; I could see nothing
but distress around us : two ships had cut their
masts on board, and another was foundered;
two more that had lost their anchors, were forc-
ed out to the mercy of the ocean; and, to save
our lives, we were forced to cut our foremast
and mainmast quite away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge
of my dreadful condition ? I was but a fresh-
water sailor, and therefore it seemed more ter-
rible. Our ship was very good, but over-loaded;
which made the sailors often cry out, She would
founder ; words I then was ignorant of All
this while the storm continuing, and rather in-
creasing, the master and the more sober part
of his men went to prayers, expecting death
every moment. In the middle of the night one
cried out, We had sprung a leak : another,
That there was four foot water in the hold. I
was just ready to expire with fear, when im-
mediately all hands were called to the pump;
and the men forced me also in that extremity
to share with them in their labour. VV hile thus
employed, the master espying some light colliers,
fired a gun as a signal of distress; and I noi
understanding what it meant, and thinking
that either the ship broke, or some dreadfi
thing happened, fell into a swoon. Even in
that common condition of woe, nobody mind-
ed me, excepting to thrust me aside with their
feet, thinking me dead, and it was a great while
before I recovered. -
Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal
given, they'ventured out their boat to save our
lives. All our pumping had been in vain, and
vain had all our attempts been, had they not
come to our ship's side, and our men cast them
a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, which
after great labour they got hold of, and we hal-
ing them to us, got into their boat, and left our
ship, which we perceived sink within less than
a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what
was meant by foundering at sea. And now
the men incessantly laboured to recover their
own ship; but the sea ran so high, and the wind
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient
to hale within shore; which with great diffi-
culty and danger, at last we happily effected,
landing at a place called Cromer, º º from
VVinterton light-house; from whence we all
walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity,
many good people furnished us with neces-
saries to carry us either to Hull or London.
Strange, that after all this, like the prodigal
son, I did not return to my father; who, hear-
ing of the ship's calamity, for a long time thought
me intombed in the deep. No doubt but I
should have shared in his fatted calf, as the
Scripture expresseth it: but my ill fate still push-
ed me on, in spite of the powerful convictions
of reason and conscience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days,
I met my old companion, who had given me
the invitation to go on board along with his fa-
ther. His behaviour and speech was altered,
and in a melancholy manner asked me how I
did, telling his father who I was, and how I
had made this voyage for a trial only to pro-
ceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gen-
tleman turning to me gravely, said, Young man,
Ozº ought never to go to sea any more, but to
take this for a certain sign that you will never
prosper in a sea-faring condition. Sir, answer-
ed I, will you take the same resolution ? It is a
different case, said he, it is my calling, and
consequently my duty; but as you have made
this voyage for a trial, you see what ill success
heaven has set before your eyes ; and perhaps
our miseries have been on your account , like
Jonah in the ship to Tarshish. But pray what
are you, and on what account did you go to sea 2
Upon which I very freely declared my whole
story; at the end of which he made this ex-
clamation : Ye sacred powers what had I
committed, that such a wretch should enter in-
º
to my ship, to heap upon me such a deluge of
miseries' But soon recollecting his passions,
Young man, said he, if you do not go back, de-
pend upon it, wherever you go, you will meet
with disasters and disappointments till your fa-
ther's words are fulfilled upon you. And so
we parted. -
I thought at first to return home; but shame
opposed that good motion, as thinking I should
be laughed at by my neighbours and acquain-
tance. . So strange is the nature of youth, who
are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to re-
pent; and so far from being ashamed of those
actions for which they may be accounted fools,
they think it folly to return to their duty, which
is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to London, resolving upon a voy-
age ; and a voyage I soon heard of by my ac-
quaintance with a captain who took a fancy to
me, to go to the coast of Guinea. Having some
money, and appearing like a gentleman, I went
on board not as a common sailor or foremast-
man; nay, the commander agreed I should go
that voyage with him without any expence ;
that I should be his mess-mate and companion,
and I was very welcome to carry anything with
me, and make the best merchandise I could.”
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly
thanked my captain for his offer; and acquaint-
ing my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were
sent me, the greatest part of which my dear fa-
ther' and mother contributed to, with which I
bought toys and trifles, as the captain directed
me. My captain also taught me navigation,
how to keep an account of the ship's course,
take an observation, and let me º the know-
A.
ledge of several useful branches of the mathe-
matics. And, indeed, this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant ; for I brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for
my adventure, which produced, at my return to
London, almost three hundred pounds. But
in this voyage I was extremely sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture through exces-
sive heat, trading upon the coast from the la-
titude of fifteen degrees north even to the line
itself.
"But alas! my dear friend the captain soon
departed this life after his arrival. This was a
sensible grief to me; yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, who had now got
command of the ship. This proved a very
aunsuccessful one ; for though I did not carry
quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired
wealth (so that I had two hundred pounds left,
which I reposed with the captain's widow, who
was an honest gentlewoman), yet my misfor-
tumes in this unhappy voyage were very great.
For our ship sailing towards the Canary islands,
we were chased by a Sallee rover; and in spite
of all the haste we could make, by crouding as
much canvas as our yards could spread, or our
masts carry, the pirate gained upon, us, so that
we prepared ourselves to fight. They had
eighteen guns, and we had but twelve. About
three in the afternoon there was a desperate
engagement, wherein many were killed and
wounded on both sides: but finding ourselves
overpowered with numbers, our ship disabled,
and ourselves too impotent, to have the least
hopes of success, we were forced to surrender;
and accordingly were all carried prisoners in-
to the port of Sallee. Our men were sent to
the Emperor's court to be sold there; but the
pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to
be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most
miserable creature on earth, and the prophecy
of my father came afresh into my thoughts.
However, my condition was better than I
thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some
hopes indeed I had that my new patron would
go to sea again, where he might be taken by a
Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then I
should be set at liberty. But in this I was mis-
taken ; for he never took me with him, but left
me to look after his little garden, and do the
drudgery of his house, and when he returned
from sea, would make me lie in the cabin, and
look after the ship. I had no one that I could
communicate my thoughts to, which were con-
tinually meditating my escape; no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotsman here, but myself; and for
two years I could see nothing practicable, but
only pleased myself with the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out
his ship as usual; and then he used constantly,
once or twice a week, if the weather was fair,
to go out a-fishing, taking me and a young Mo-
resco boy to row the boat; and so much pleas-
ed was he with me for my dexterity in catching
the fish, that he would often send me with a
Moor, who was one of his kinsmen; and the
Moresco youth, to catch a dish of fish for him.
One morning, as we were at the sport, there
arose such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the
shore; and rowing we knew not which way,
w
we laboured all the night, and in the morning
found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length,
and made the greatest haste, because our sto-
machs were exceeding sharp and hungry. In
order to prevent such disasters for the future,
my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long-
boat, with a place behind it to steer and hale
home the main sheet, with other conveniencies
to keep him from the weather, as also lockers
to put in all manner of provisions, with a hand-
some shoulder-of-mutton sail, gibing over the
cabin." -
In this he frequently took us out a-fishing;
and one time inviting two or three persons of
distinction to go with him, made provision ex-
traordinary, providing also three fusees with
powder and shot, that they might have some
sport at fowling along the sea-coast. The next
morning the boat was made clean, her ancient
and pendants out, and every thing ready ; but
their minds altering, my patron ordered us to
go a-fishing, for that his guests would certainly
sup with him that night. -
And now I began to think of my deliverance
indeed. In order to this I persuaded the Moor
to get some provisions on board, as not daring
to meddle with our patron's; and he taking my
advice, we stored ourselves with rusk biscuit,
and three jars of water. Besides, I privately
conveyed into the boat a bottle of brandy, some
twine, thread, a hammer, hatchet, and a saw";
and, in particular, some bees-wax, which was
a great comfort to me , and served to make
candles. I then persuaded Muley (for so was
the Moor called) to procure some powder and
shot, pretending to kill sea-curlieus, which he
innocently and readily agreed to. In short, be-
ing provided with all things necessary, we sail-
ed out, resolving for my own part to make my
escape, though it should cost me my life.
VVhen we had passed the castle, we fell to
fishing; but, º I knew there was a bite, I
dissembled the matter, in order to put further
out to sea. Accordingly we ran a league fur-
ther; when giving the boy the helm, and pre-
tending to stoop for something, I seized Muley
by surprise, and threw him overboard. As he
was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose, and
made towards the boat; upon which, I took out
a fusee, and presented it at him : Muley, said
I, I never yet designed to do you any harm,
and seek nothing now but my redemption. I
know you are able enough to suim to shore, and
save your life; but if you are resolved to fol-
low me to the endangering of mine, the very mo–
ment you proceed, I will shoot you through the
head. The harmless creature, at these words,
turned himself from me, and I make no doubt
got safe to land. Then turning to the boy Xury,
I perceived he trembled at the action; but I put
him out of all fear, telling him, that if he would
be true and faithful to me, I would do well by
him. And, therefore, said I, you must stroke
gour face to be faithful, and, as the Turks have
tearned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beard
of your father, or else I will throw you into the
sea also. So innocent did the child then look,
and with such an obliging smile consented, that
I readily believed him, and from that day for-
ward began to love him entirely. i.
-
We then pursued our voyage; and, lest they
should think me gone to the Streight's mouth, I
kept to the southward to the truly Barbarian
coast : but in the dusk of the evening, I chang-
ed my course, and steered directly S. and by E.
that I might keep near the shore; and, having
a fresh gale of wind, with a pleasant smooth
sea, by three o'clock next day I was 150 miles
beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions.
Yet still having the dreadful apprehension of
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days
successively, till such time as the wind shifting
to the southward, made me conclude, that if
any vessel was in chace of me, they would pro-
ceed no further. After so much fatigue and
thought, Ianchored at the mouth of a little river,
I knew not what, or where: neither did I then
See any people. What I principally wanted
was fresh water ; and I was resolved about
the dusk to swim ashore. But no sooner did
the gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed
the declining day, than we heard such barking,
roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that one
might have thought the very strangest monsters
of nature, or infernal spirits, had their residence
there. Poor Xury, almost dead with fear, en-
treated me not to go on shore that night. Sup-
posing, I don’t, Xury, said I, and in the morn-
ing we should see men who are worse than those
we fear, what then 2 Oden we may give dem de
shoot gun, replied Xury, laughing, and de gun
make dem all run away. The wit, and broken
English which the boy had learned among the
captives of our nation, pleased me entirely; and.
to add to his cheerfulness, I gave him a dram of
the bottle: we could get but little sleep all the
night for those terrible howlings they made ;
and, indeed, we were both very much affright-
ed, when, by the rollings of the water, and o-
ther tokens, we justly concluded one of those
monsters made towards our boat. I could not
see it till it came within two oars length, when
taking my fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I
hit him or no, I cannot tell; but he made to-
wards the shore, and the noise of my gun in-
creased the stupendous noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolved to go on
shore to get fresh water, and venture my life a-
mong the beasts or savages, should either attack
me. Xury said, he would take one of the jars,
and bring me some. I asked him why he would
go, and not I ? The poor boy answered, If uild
mans come, they eat me, you go away. A mind
scarcely now to be imitated, so contrary to self-
preservation, the most powerful law of nature!
This , indeed, increased my affection to the
child. Well, dear Xury, said I, we will both
go ashore, both kill wild mans, and they shall
eat neither of us. So giving Xury a piece of
rusk bread to eat, and a dram, we waded a-
shore, carrying nothing with us but our arms,
and two jars for water. I did not go out of
'sight of the boat, as dreading the savages com—
ing down the river in their canoes; but the
boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile
in the country, he wandered to it; and then
running back to me with great precipitation, I
thought he was pursued by some savage or wild
beast; upon which I approached, resolving to
perish or protect him from danger. As he came
nearer to me, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a creature he had shot,
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer
legs; however, we were glad of it, for it prov-
ed wholesome and nourishing meat; but what
added to our joy was, my boy assured me there
was plenty of water, and that he see no wild
mans. And greater still was our comfort, when
we found fresh water in the creek where we
were when the tide was out, without going so
far up into the country. -
In this place I began to consider that the Ca-
nary and Cape Verd islands lay not far off:
but having no instrument, I knew not what
latitude, or when to stand off to sea for them;
yet my hopes were, I should meet some of the
English trading vessels, who would relieve and
take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild
country, inhabited only by a few, that lies be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's dominions
and the Negroes. It is filled with wild beasts,
and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly. From
this place I thought I saw the top of the moun-
tain Teneriffe in the Canaries; which made me
try twice to attain it; but as often was I drove
back, and so forced to pursue my fortune along
shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but pretty high; and
the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go
further in. But Xury, whose youthful and pe-
netrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
soft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest
we should be devoured. For look yonder, may.
ter, said he, and see de dreadful monster fast
asleep on de side of de hill. Accordingly look-
ing where he pointed, I espied a fearful mon-
ster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that
lay on shore, covered as it were by a shade of
a piece of the hill. Xury, said I, you shall go on
shore and kill him. But the boy looked amaz-
ed: Me bill him, says he, he eat me at one
mouth ; meaning one mouthful. Upon which
I bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun
with two slugs, and a good charge of powder,
I took the best aim I could to shoot him through.
the head; but his leg lying over his nose, the
slug broke his knee-bone. The lion awaking
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giv-
ing the most hideous groan I ever heard : but
taking my second piece, I shot him through the
head, and then he lay struggling for life. Upon
this Xury took heart and desired my leave to go
on shore. Go then, said I. Upon which, tak-
ing a little gun in one hand, he swam to shore
with the other, and coming close to the lion,
put a period to his life, by shooting him again
through the head. -
But this was spending our ammunition in
vain, the flesh not being good to eat. Xury was
like a champion, and comes on board for a
hatchet to cut off the head of his enemy; but
not having strength to perform it, he cut off and
brought me a foot. I bethought me however
that his skin would be of use. This work cost
, Xury and me a whole day; when spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of the
sun effectually dried it in two days time, and it
afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparing-
ly on our provisions, and went no oftener on
shore than we were obliged for fresh water.
My design was to make the river Gambia or
Senegal, or any where about the Cape Verd,
in hopes to meet some European ship. If Pro-
vidence did not so favour me, my next course
was to seek for the islands, or lose my life among
the negroes. And in a word, I put my whole
stress upon this, & Either that I must meet with
» some ship, or certainly perish.)
One day as we were sailing along, we saw
people stand on the shore looking at us; we
could also perceive they were black and stark
naked. I was inclined to go on shore; but Xury
cried, No, no; however, I approached nearer,
and I found they ran along the shore by me a
good way. They had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who held a long stick, which Xury
told me was a lance, with which they could kill
at a great distance. I talked to them by signs,
and made them sensible I wanted something
to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat,
while two of them ran up into the country,
and in less than half an hour came back, and
brought with them two pieces of dry flesh, and
some corn, which we kindly accepted : and to
prevent any fears on either side, they brought
the food to the shore, laid it down, then went
and stood a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them,
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures
came from the mountains, one as it were pur-
suing the other with great fury, which we were
the rather inclined to believe, as they seldom
appear but in the night; and both these swiftly
passing by the negroes, jumped into the sea,
wantonly swimming about, as though the di-
version of the waters had put a slop to their
fierceness. At lastone of them coming nearer
to my boat than I expected or desired, I shot
him directly through the head; upon which he
sunk immediately, yet rising again, would have
willingly made to the shore; but between the
wound and the strangling of the water, he died
before he could reach it. -
It is impossible to express the consternation
the poor negroes were in at the firing of my
gun; much less can I mention their surprise,
when they perceived the creature to be slain by
it. I made signs to them to draw near it with a
rope, and then gave it to them to hale on shore.
It was a beautiful leopard, which made me de-
sire its skin : and the negroes seeming to covet
the carcase, I freely gave it to them. As for the
other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with a
pº, swiftness out of sight. The negroes
aving kindly furnished me with water, and
with what roots and grains their country af-
forded, I took my leave, and, after eleven days
sail, came in sight of the Cape Verd, and
those islands called by its name. But the great
distance I was from it, and fearing contrary
winds would prevent my reaching them, I be-
gan to grow melancholy and dejected, when,
upon a sudden, Xury cried out: Master! mas-
ter a ship with a sail 1 and looked as af-
frighted as if it was his master's ship sent in
search of us. But I soon discovered she was a
Portuguese ship, as I thought, bound to the coast
of Guinea for negroes. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But vain had it
been , if through their perspective glasses they
had not perceived me, and shortened their sail
to let me come up. Encouraged at this, I set up
my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both as
signals of distress; upon which they very kind-
ly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up
with them. . They spoke to me in Portuguese,
Spanish, and French, but neither of these did I
understand; till at length a Scots sailor called,
and then I told him I was an Englishman, who
had escaped from the Moors at Sallee; upon
which they took me kindly on board, with all
my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable
joy I felt at this happy deliverance; who, from
being a late miserable and forlorn creature, was
not only relieved, but in favour with the mas–
ter of the ship, to whom, in return for my de-
liverance, I offered all I had. God forbid, said
he, that I should take any thing from you. Eve-
ry thing shall be delivered to you when you
come to Brazil. If I have saved your life, it is
no more than I should expect to receive myself
from any other, when, in the same circumstan-
ces, I should happen to meet the like deliverance.
And should I take from you what you have,
and leave you at Brazil, why, this would be on-
ly taking away a life I have given. My cha-
rity teaches me better. Those effects you have
will support you there, and provide you a pas-
sage home again. And, indeed, he acted with
the strictest justice in what he did, taking my .
things into his possession, and giving me an exact
inventory, even to my earthen jars. He bought
my boat of me for the ship's use, giving me a
note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil;
and if any body offered more, he would make
it up. He also gave me sixty pieces for my boy
Xury. It was with great reluctance I was pre-
vailed upon to sell the child's liberty, who had
served me so faithfully; but the boy was willing
himself; and it was agreed that after ten years
he should be made free, upon his renouncing
Mahometanism, and embracing Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we
arrived in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All-
Saints bay, in twenty-two days after. And here
I cannot forget the generous treatment of the
captain. He would take nothing for my pas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and thirty for the lion's. Every thing he
caused to be delivered, and what I would sell
he bought. In short, I made about 220 pieces
of my cargo; and with this stock I entered once
more, as I may say, into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I
lived with him till such time as I was informed
of the manner of their planting and making
sugar; and seeing how well they lived, and how
suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a
desire to settle among them, and resolved to get
my money remitted to me, and to purchase a
plantation. : -
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door
to an honest and kind neighbour, born at Lis-
bon, of English parents, whose plantation join-
ing to mine, we improved it very amicably to—
gether. Both our stocks were low, and for two
years we planted only for food : but the third
year we planted some tobacco, and each of us
dressed a large piece of ground the ensuing year
for planting canes. But now I found how much
I wanted assistance, and repented the loss of
my dear boy Xury.
Having none to assist me, my father's words .
came into my mind; and I used to ask myself,
if what I sought was only a middle station of
life, why could it not as well be obtained in Eng-
land as here 7. When I pondered on this .#
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance for-
sook me. I had none to converse with but my
neighbour; no work to be done but by my own
hands; it often made me say my condition was
like to that of a man cast upon a desolate is—
land. So unhappy are we in our reflections, so
forgetful of what good things we receive our-
selves, and so unthankful for our deliverance
from those calamities that others endure.
I was in some measure settled, before the cap-
tain who took me up, departed from the Bra-
zils. One day I went to him, and told him
what stock I had in London, desiring his assis-
tance in getting it remitted; to which the good
gentleman readily consented, but would only
have me send for half my money, lest it should
miscarry; which, if it did, I might still have
the remainder to support me : and so taking
letters of procuration from me, bid me trouble
myself no further about it.
And, indeed, wonderful was his kindness
towards me; for he not only procured the mo-
ney Ihad drawn for upon my captain's widow,
but sent me over a servant with a cargo, pro-
portionable to my condition. He also sent me
over tools of all sorts, iron work, and utensils
necessary for my plantation, and which proved
of the greatest use to me in my business.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and un-
common success crowning my prosperous la-
bours, I might have rested happy in that middle
state of life my father had so often recommend-
ed; yet nothing would content me, such was
my evil genius, but I must leave this happy sta-
tion, for a foolish ambition in rising; and thus,
once more, I cast myself into the deepest gulf
of misery that ever poor creature fell into. Hav-
ing lived four years in Brazil, I had not only
learned the language, but contracted acquain-
tance with the most eminent planters, and even
the merchants of St. Salvadore; to whom, once,
by way of discourse, having given an account
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, and
the manner of trading there for mere trifles,
by which we furnish our plantations with ne-
groes, they gave such attention to what I said,
that three of them came one morning to me,
and told me they had a secret proposal to make.
After enjoining me to secrecy (it being an in-
fringement on the powers of the kings of Por-
tugal and Spain), they told me they had a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to
stock the plantation with negroes, which, as
they could not be publicly sold, they would di-
vide among them; and if I would go their su-
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading part,
I should have an equal share of the negroes,
without providing any stock. The thing indeed
was fair enough, had I been in another condi-
tion. But I, born to be my own destroyer,
could not resist the proposal, but accepted the
offer, upon condition of their looking after my
plantation. So making a formal will, I be-
queathed my effects to my good friend the cap-
tain, as my universal heir ; but obliged him to
dispose of my effects as directed, one half of the
produce to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England. B
The ship being fitted out, and all things rea-
dy, we set sail the first of Sept. 1659, being the
same day eighth year after I left my father and
mother in Yorkshire. We sailed northward
upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we
made Cape Augustin; from whence going far-
ther in the ocean, out of sight of land, we steer-
ed as though we were bound for the isle Fer-
nando da Noronha, leaving the islands on the
east; and then it was we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued for twelve days suc-
cessively, so that the winds carried us whereso-
ever they pleased. In this perplexity, one of our
men died, and one man and a boy were wash-
ed over-board. When the weather cleared up
a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north
Jatitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this
the captain gave reasons for returning; which I
opposed, counselling him to stand away for
Barbadoes, which, as I supposed, might be at-
tained in fifteen days. So altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west, in order to
reach the leeward islands; but a second storm.
succeeding, drove us to the westward; so that
we were justly afraid of falling into the hands
of cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts
of prey. --
In this great distress, one of our men, early in
the morning, cried out: Land, land! which he
had no sooner cried out, but ourshipstruck upon
a sand-bank, and in a moment the sea broke
over her in such a manner, that we expected
we should all have perished immediately. We
knew nothing where we were, or upon what
land we were driven ; whether an island or
the main, inhabited or not inhabited ; and we
could not so much as hope that the ship would
hold out many minutes, without breaking in
pieces, except the wind by a miracle should
furn about immediately. While we stood look-
ing at one another, expecting death every mo–
ment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest got her flung over the ship's
side, and getting all into her, heing eleven of
us, committed ourselves to God's mercy, and
the wild sea. And now we saw that this last
effort would not be a sufficient protection from
death; so high did the sea rise, that it was im–
possible the boat should live. As to making sail,
we had none; neither if we had, could we make
use of any. So that when we had rowed, or
rather were driven about a league and a half, a
raging wave, like a lofty mountain, came rolling
a-stern of us, and took us with such fury, that at
once it overset the boat. Thus being swallow-
ed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call
upon the tremendous name of God; much less
to implore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite
mercy to receive our departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death; but while I
was overwhelmed with water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable; for the joys
of heaven and the torments of hell seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying ago.
nies, and even the small space of time, as it were,
between life and death. I was going, I thought,
I knew not whither, in a dismal gulf unknown,
and as yet unperceived, never to behold my
friends, nor the light of this world any more!
Could I even have thought of annihilation, or a
total dissolution of soul as well as body, the
goomy thoughts of having no further being, nô
knowledge of what we hoped for, but an eter-
nal quietus, without life or sense; even that, I
say, would have been enough to strike me with
horror and confusion ' I strove however to the
last extremity, while all my companions were
overpowered and intombed in the deep : and
it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me
on the shore half dead with the water I had
taken in. As soon as I got on my feet, I ran as
fast as I could, lest another wave should pursue
me, and carry me back again. But, for all the
haste I made, I could not avoid it; for the sea
came after me like a high mountain, or furious
enemy; so that my business was to hold my
breath, and by raising myself on the water, pre-
serve it by swimming. The next dreadful wave
buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep,
but at the same time carried me with a mighty
force and swiftness toward the shore; when
raising myself, I held out as well as possible, till
at length the water having spent itself, began
to return, at which I struck forward, and feel-
ing ground with my feet, I took to my heels
again. Thus being served twice more, I was at
last dashed against a piece of a rock, in such a
manner as left me senseless; but recovering a
little before the return of the wave, which, no
doubt, would then have overwhelmed me, I
held fast by the rock till those succeeding waves
abated; and then fetching another run, was
overtaken by a small wave, which was soon con-
quered. But before any more could overtake
me, Ireached the main land, where clambering
28 LITE AND ADVENTURES
'I sat down on the grass, free from the dangers
of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and trans-
ports that my soul felt at this happy deliverance.
It was like a reprieve to a dying malefactor,
with the halter about his neck, and ready to be
turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation,
and often lifted up my hands, with the pro-
foundest humility, to the divine powers, for sav-
ing my life, when the rest of my companions
were all drowned. And now I began to cast
my eyes around, to behold what place I was in,
and what I had next to do. I could see no house
nor people : I was wet, yet had no clothes to
shift me; hungry and thirsty, yet had nothing
to eat or drink; no weapon to destroy any crea-
ture for my sustenance, nor defend myself a-
gainst devouring beasts; in short, I had nothing
but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a box half fill-
ed with tobacco. The darksome night coming
upon me, increased my fears of being devoured
by wild creatures; my mind was plunged into
despair, and having no prospect, as I thought,
of life before me, I prepared for another kind
of death than what I had lately escaped. I walk-
ed about a furlong to see if I could find any
fresh water, which I did, to my great joy; and
taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I
got up into a thick bushy tree, and seating my-
self so that I could not fall, a deep sleep over-
took me, and for that night j my sorrows
in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before
I awaked ; when I not only perceived the
tempest was ceased, but saw the ship driven al-
most as far as the rock before mentioned, which
B 3
the waves had dashed me against, and which
was about a mile from the place where I was.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis–
tant on my right hand, lying on shore, as the
waves had cast her. I thought to have got to her;
but there being an inlet of water of about half
a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned
again towards the ship, as hoping to find some-
thing for my more immediate subsistence. A–
bout noon, when the sea was calm, that I could
come within a quarter of a mile of her, it was
to my grief I perceived, that, if we had kept
on board, all our lives had been saved. These
thoughts, and my solitude, drew tears from my
eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to
the ship, I stripped and leaped into the water;
when swimming round her I was afraid I
should not get any thing to lay hold of; but it
was my good fortune to espy a small piece of
rope hang down by the forechains, so low, that,
by the help of it, though with great difficulty, {
got into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found
that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal
of water in her hold; her stern was lifted up
against a bank, and her head almost to the water.
All her quarter, and what was there, were free
and dry. The provisions I found in good or—
der, with which I crammed my pockets; and,
losing no time, ate while I was doing other
things; I also found some rum, of which I took
a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing
except a boat, which indeed was all, to carry
away what was needful for me. , , , ,
Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We
had several spare yards, a spare topmast or two,
and two or three large spars of wood. With
these I fell to work, and flung as many of them
over board as I could manage, tying every one
of them with a rope that they might not drive
away. This done, I went down the ship's side,
and tied four of them fast together at both ends,
in form of a raft, and laying two or three short
pieces of plank upon them crosswise, I found
it would bear me, but not any considerable
weight. Upon which I went to work again,
cutting aspare topmast into three lengths, add-
ing them to my raft with a great deal of labour
and pains. I then considered what I should
load it with, it being not able to bear a ponde-
rous burden. And this I soon thought of, first
laying upon it all the planks and boards I could
get; next I lowered down three of the seamen's
chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice,
three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats
flesh, and some European corn, what little the
rats had spared; and for liquors, I found seve-
ral cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in
which were some cordial waters, and four or
five gallons of rack, which I stowed by them-
selves. By this time the tide beginning to flow, I
perceived my coat, waistcoat and shirt swim
away, which I had left on the shore; as formy
linen breeches and stockings, I swam with them
on to the ship : but I soon found clothes e-
nough, though I took no more than I wanted for
the present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to
work with ; and, after long search, I found our
the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on
my raft. I then looked for arms and ammuni-
tion, and in the great cabin found two good
fowling-pieces, two pistols, several powder-
B
horms filled, a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I likewise found three barrels of
i. two of which were good, but the third
ad taken water, also two or §. broken oars,
two saws, an axe, and a hammer. I then put
to sea, and in getting to the shore had three en-
couragements: 1. a smooth calm sea; 2. the
tide rising and setting in to the shore. ; 3. the
little wind there was, blew towards land. Af-
ter I had sailed about a mile, I found the raft
to drive a little distance from the place where I
first landed; and then I perceived a little open-
ing of the land, with a strong current of the tide
running into it; upon which I kept the middle
of the stream. But great was my concern, when
on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran aground;
so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against
the chests to keep my effects in their places, all
I had would have gone into the sea. But after
some time, the rising of the water caused the
raft to float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, Ilanded in a little cave,
as near the mouth as possible, the better to dis-
cover a sail, if any such providentially passed
that way. *
Nol far off, I espied a hill of a stupendous
height, surrounded with lesser hills aboutit, and
thither I was resolved to go and view the coun- .
try, that I might see what part was best to fix
my habitation in. Accordingly, arming myself
with a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball,
I ascended the mountain. There I perceived I
was in an island, encompassed by the sea; no
distant lands to be seen, but scattering rocks
What lay to the west: that it seemed to be a bar-
ren place, and, as I thought, inhabited only by
wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls,
but ignorant of what kind, or whether good for
nourishment. I shot one of them at my return,
which occasioned a confused screaming among
the other birds; and I found it, by its colours
and beak, to be a kind of a hawk, but its flesh
was perfect carrion. -
When I came to my raft, I brought my ef-
fects on shore, which work spent that day en-
tirely; and fearing that some cruel beasts might
devour me in the night time while I slept, I
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests
and boards I had brought on shore. That night
I slept very comfortably; and the next morn-
ing my thoughts were employed to make a fur-
ther attempt on the ship, and bring away what
necessaries I could #’, before another storm
should break her to pieces. Accordingly, I got
on board as before, and prepared a second raft,
far more nice than the first; upon which I
brought away the carpenter's stores, two or
three bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a doz-
en or two of hatchets, and a grindstone. I also
took away several things that belonged to the
gunner, particularly two or three iron crows,
two barrels of musket bullets, another fowling-
piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large
bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took all
the men's clothes I could find, a spare foretop-
sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and thus
completing my second cargo, I made all the
haste to shore I could, fearing some wild beast
might destroy what I had there already. But I
only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the
chests, who not seeming to fear º ;" the gun
that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of
biscuit, which she instantly ate, and departed.
When I had gotten these effects, on shore, I
went to work, in order to make me a little tent
with the sail and some poles which I had cut
for that purpose ; and having finished it, what
things might be damaged by the weather, I
brought in, piling all the empty chests and casks
in a circle, the better to fortify it against any
sudden attempt of man or beast. After this, I
blocked up the doors with some boards, and an
empty chest turned the long way out... I then
charged my gun and pistol, and, laying my bed
on the ground, slept as comfortably, till next
morning, as though I had been in a Christian
country. - - S.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me along
time, yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, or
that both ammunition and provision might be
spent before such a thing happened, I brought
off as much as I could ; and so long as the
ship remained in that condition, I daily brought
away one necessary or other, particularly the
rigging, sails, and cordage, some twine, a barrel
of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal,
three casks of rum, and, what indeed was most
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread,
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pie-
ces, carried off a hawser whole, with a great
deal of iron work, and made another raft with
the mizen and sprit-sail-yards; but this being
so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden I had up-
on it, and not being able so dexterously to guide
it as the former, both my cargo and I were
overturned. For my part , all the damage I
sustained was a wet skin ; and at low water ,
after much labour in diving, I got most of the
\
cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been in the island,
and eleven times on board, bringing away all
that was possible; and, I believe, had the wea-
ther been calm, I should have brought away the
whole ship, piece by piece. As I was going the
twelfth time, the wind began to rise; however,
I ventured at low water, and rummaging the
cabin, in a locker I found several razors, scis-
sars, and some dozens of knives and forks; and
in another thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight,
silver and gold. Ah 1 simple vanity, said I,
whom this world so much dotes on, where is now
thy virtue, thy excellency to me? You cannot
procure me one thing needful, nor remove me
from this desolate island to a place of plenty.
One of these knives, so meanly esteemed, is to
me more preferable than all this heap. E'en
therefore remain where thou art, to sink in the
deep as unregarded, even as a creature whose
Zife is not worth preserving. Yet, after all this
exclamation, I wrapt it up in a piece of canvas,
and began to think of making another raft; but
I soon perceived the wind begin to arise, a fresh
gale blowing from the shore, and the sky over-
cast with clouds and darkness; so, thinking a
raft to be in vain, I let myself into the water
with what things I had about me, and it was
with much difficulty I got ashore, when, soon
after, it blew a fearful storm. •
That night I slept very contentedly in my
little tent, surrounded with all my effects; but,
when I looked out in the morning, no more
ship was to be seen. This much surprised me
for the present; yet, when I had * l
had lost no time, abated no pains, and had got
every thing useful out of her, I comforted my-
self in the best manner, and entirely submitted
io the will of Providence.
- My next thoughts were, how I should defend
and secure myself from savages and wild beasts,
if any such were in the island. At one time I
thought of digging a cave, at another I was for ,
erecting a tent; and, at length, I resolved to do
both : the manner or form of which will not,
I hope, be unpleasing to describe.
When I considered the ground where I was,
that it was moorish, and had no fresh water
near it, my resolutions were to search for a soil
healthy and well watered, where I might not
only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat,
put be more conveniently situated, as well to
he secured from wild men, and beasts of prey,
as more easily to discover any distant sail, should
it ever so happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my
desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towards which being as steep as a
house-side, nothing could descend on me from
the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door
of a cave. Just before this place, on the circle
of the green, I resolved my tent should stand.
This plain did not much exceed a hundred
yards breadth, and about twice as long, like a
delightful green before my door, with a pleasing,
ihough irregular, descent every way to the low
grounds by the sea-side, lying on the N.N.W.
side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the
excessive heat of the sun. After this I drew a
semicircle, containing ten yards in its semidia-
meter, and twenty yards in the whole, driving
down two rows of strong stakes not six inches
from each other. Then with the pieces of cable
which I had cut on board, I regularly laid them
in the circle between the piles up to their tops,
which were more than five feet out of the earth,
and after drove another row of piles looking
within side against them, between two and three
feet high, . made me conclude it a little
.impregnable castle for men and beasts. And
for my better security I would have no door,
but entered in and came out by the help of a
ladder, which I also made. -
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I
carried all my riches, ammunition, and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with
the dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised
my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days
labour and pains. One day in particular a
shower of rain falling, thunder and lightening
ensued, which put me in terror lest my powder
should take fire, and not only hinder my neces-
sary subsistence, by killing me food, but even
blow up myself and my habitation. To pre-
vent which, I fell to making boxes and bags, in
order to separate it, having by me near 15o
§. weight. And thus being established as
ing of the island, every day I went out with my
gun to see what I could kill that was fit to eat.
I soon perceived numbers of goats, but very
shy; yet having watched them narrowly, and
seeing I could better shoot off the rocks than
when in the low grounds, I happened to shoot
a she-goat suckling a young kid ; which not
thinking its dam slain, stood by her unconcern-
ed; and when I took the dead creature up, the
young one followed me even to the inclosure.
I lifted the kid over the pales, and would will-
ingly have kept it alive; but finding it could
not be brought to eat, I was forced to slay it
also for my own subsistence. -
Thus entered into as strange a scene of life
as ever any man was in, I had most melancho-
ly apprehensions concerning my deplorable
condition ; and many times the tears would,
º run down my face, when I consi-
ered how I was debarred from all commu-
nication with mankind. Yet while these de-
sponding cogitations would seem to make me
accuse Providence, other good thoughts would
interpose and reprove me after this manner :
Well, supposing you are desolate, is it not better
to be so than totally perish 7 Why were you
singled out to be saved, and the rest destroyed?
Why should you complain, when not only your
life is preserved, but the ship driven even into
your, reach, in order to take what was neces-
sary out of her for your subsistence 7 But to
proceed : It was, by the account I kept, the 3oth
of September when I first landed on this island,
About twelve days after, fearing lest I should
lose my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the
Sabbath-days, for want of pen, ink, and paper,
I carved with a knife upon a large post, in great
letters, and set it up, in the similitude of a cross,
on the sea-shore where I landed, I came on
shore Sept. 30. 1659. Every day I cut a notch
with my knife on the sides of this square post,
and that on Sabbath was as long again as the
rest; and every first day of the month as long
again as that long one. In this manner I kept
my calendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reck-
oning of time. But had I made a more strict
search (as I did afterwards), I need not have
set up this mark. For among the parcels be-
longing to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's
mate, I found those very things I wanted; par-
ticularly pens, ink, and paper; also I found two
or three compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspective glasses, books of navi-
gation, three English Bibles, and several other
good, books, which I carefully putºp. Here I
:cannot, but call to mind our having a dog and
two cats on board, whom I made inhabitants
with me in my castle. Though one might think
‘I had all the necessaries that were desirable, yet
still I found several things wanting. My ink
was daily wasting: I wanted needles, pins, and
thread to mend or keep my clothes together;
and particularly a spade, pick-axe or shovel, to
remove the earth. It was a year before I finish-
ed, my little bulwark; and having some inter-
vals of relaxation, after my daily wandering a-
broad for provision, I drew up this plan, alter-
inately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me
of the miseries and blessings of my life, under
so many various circumstances,

here add to the description I have giv-
en of my habitation, that having raised a turf-
wall against the outside of it, I thatched it so
close, as might keep it from the inclemency of
the weather; I also improved it within, enlarg—
ed my cave, and made a passage and door in
the rock, which came out beyond the pale of
my fortification. I next proceeded to make a
chair and table, and so began to study such me-
chanical arts as seemed to me practicable. When
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a
tree with my hatchet, making it as thin with
my axe as possible, and then smooth enough
w
‘with an adze to answer my designs : yet though
I could make no more this way than one board
out of a tree, in length of time I got boards e-
nough to shelter all my stores, every thing be-
ing regularly placed, and my guns securely
hanging against the side of the rock. This made
it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the re-
sult of vast labour and diligence; which leav-
ing for a while, and me to the enjoyment of, I

J O U R N A L.
SEPTEMPER 3oth, 1659, I unhappy Robinson
Crusoe, having suffered shipwreck, was driven
on this desolate island, which I named the De-
solate Island of Despair, the rest being swal-
lowed up in the tempestuous ocean. The next
day I spent in consideration of my unhappy
circumstances, having no prospect but of death,
either to be starved with hunger, or devoured
by beasts or merciless savages.
Octob. 1. That morning, with great comfort,
I beheld the ship drove ashore. Some hopes I
had, that when the storm was abated, I might
be able to get some food and necessaries out of
her; which I conceived were not damaged,
because the ship did stand upright. At this time
I lamented the loss of my companions, and our
misfortune in leaving the vessel. When I per-
ceived the ship as it were lie dry, Iwaded through
the sands, then swam aboard, the weather being
very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14th of this month, my time was em-
Sloyed in making voyages, every tide getting
what I could out of the ship. The weather ve-
ry wet and uncertain.
Octob. 20. My raft and all the goods there-
on were overset; yet I recovered most again at
low water.
Octob. 25. It blew hard, and rained night
and day, when the ship went into pieces, so that
nothing was seen of her but the wreck at low
water. This day I secured my goods from the
inclemency of the weather.
Octob. 26. I wandered to see where I could
find a place convenient for my abode. I fixed
upon a rock in the evening, marked out a half-
moon, intending to erect a wall, fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1... I erected my tent under a rock,
and took up my lodgings very contentedly in a
hammock that night.
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with
timber, chests, and boards. . . . "
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowls, resembling
ducks, which were good to eat, and in the after. .
noon made me a table. -
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the
morning I allowed myself two or three hours
to walk out with my gun ; I then worked till
near eleven o'clock, and afterwards refreshed
myself with what I had to eat. From twelve
to two I would lie down to sleep. Extreme sul-
try weather. In the evening got to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog,
shot a wild cat with a soft skin, but her flesh
was good for nothing. The skins of those I
killed, I preserved. In my return, I perceived
many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made off to sea. -
Nov. 6. Completed my table. -
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th,
but omitted the 11th, which, according to my
calculation, I supposed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, how-
ever, much cooled the earth; with thunder and
lightening, caused in me a terrible surprise.
The weather clearing, I secured my powder in
separate parcels.
Nov. 14,-16. I made little boxes for my
powder, lodging them in several places. I also
shot a large fowl, which proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, shovel,
and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caused to
supply the place of the first; but with all my art
I, could not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree re-
sembling what the Brazilians call an iron-tree.
I had like to have spoiled my axe with cutting
it, being very hard and exceeding heavy; yet,
with much labour and industry, I made a sort
of a spade out of it. -
... Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily car-
ried on my business; eighteen days I allowed
for enlarging my cave, that it might serve me,
not only for a ware-house, but kitchen, par-
lour, and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent,
unless the weather was rainy that I could not
lie dry. So wet would it be at certain seasons,
that I was obliged to cover all within the pale
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and
large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habita-
tion finished, but suddenly a great deal of the
top broke in, so that it was a mercy I was not
buried in the ruins. This occasioned a great
deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could
make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I mailed up some shelves and drove
nails and staples in the wall, and posts to hang
things out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then
made a sort of a dresser, and another table,
Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats,
shot one, wounded another. I led it home in
a string, bound up his leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length, it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and follow me where
I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up
fame creatures, in order to supply me with foo
after my ammunition was spent. -
Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exces-
sive hot, with little air, obliged me, for the most
part, to keep within doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry. However, obliged by ne-
cessity, I went out with my gun, and found a
great store of goats in the valleys; they were
exceedingly shy, nor could my dog hunt them
down. -
Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was
to finish the wall before described, and search
the island. I discovered a kind of pigeons like
our house-pigeons in a nest among the rocks.
I brought them home, nursed them till they
could fly, and then they left me. After this, I
shot some, which proved excellent food. Some
time I spent vainly in contriving to make a cask,
I may well say it was vain, because I could
neither join the staves, or fix the heads, so as to
make it tight: so, leaving that, I took some goats
tallow I had by me, and a little oakum for the
wick, and provided myself with a lamp, which
served me instead of candles. -
But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (as I supposed) for the fowls : so
immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it,
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of
the rock, little expecting what the consequence
would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a
few days before; and, about a month after, to
my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing : and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it
grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green
barley appeared in the very same shape and
make as that in England. -
I can scarce express the agitations of my mind
at this sight. Hitherto I had looked upon the
actions of this life no otherwise than only as the
events of blind chance and fortune. But now,
the appearance of this barley, flourishing in a
barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiv-
ing how it should come there, made me con-
clude, that miracles were not yet ceased; nay,
I even thought that God had appointed it to
grow there without any seed, purely for my sus-
tenance in this miserable and desolate island.
And indeed such great effect this had upon me,
that it often made me melt into tears, through
a grateful sense of God's mercies; and the great-
er still was my thankfulness, when I perceived,
about this little field of barley, some rice stalks,
also wonderfully flourishing. -
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be more corn in the island; and
therefore made a diligent search marrowly-a-.
mong the rocks: but not being able to find any,
on a sudden it came into my mind, how I had
shaken the husks of corn out of the bag, and
then my admiration ceased, with my gratitude
to the divine Being, as thinking it was but na-
tural, and not to be conceived a miracle; tho’
even the manner of its preservation might have
made me own it as a wonderful event of God's
kind providence. -
It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of this corn ripened, which I laid up very
carefully together with 20 or 3o stalks of rice,
expecting one day I should reap the fruit of my
labour; yet four years were expired before I
could allow myself to eat any barley bread,
and much longer time before I had any rice.
After this, with indefatigable pains and industry
for three or four months, at last I finished my
wall on the 14th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascend-
edit; afterwards pulled it up, then let it down
on the other side, and descended into my new
habitation, where I had space enough, and so
fortified, that nothing could attack me, without
scaling the walls. - … "
But what do all human pains and industry
avail, if the blessing of God do not crown our
labours? or, who can stand before the Almigh-
ty, when he stretcheth forth his arm? For one
time, as I was at the entrance of my cave, there
happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not
only the roof of the cave came tumbling about
my ears, but the posts seemed to crack terribly
at the same time. This put me into great amaze-
ment; and running to the ladder, and getting
over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an
earth-quake, the place Istood on sustaining three
terrible shocks in less than three minutes. But
judge of my terror when I saw the top of a
great rock roll into the sea; I then expected the
island would be swallowed up every moment.
And what made the scene still more dreadful,
was to see the sea thrown into the most violent
agitations and disorders by this tremendous ac-
cident. -
For my part, I stood like a criminal at the
place of execution, ready to expire. At the
moving of the earth, I was, as it were, sea-sick,
and very much afraid lest the rock , under
which was my fence and habitation, should
overwhelm me and it in a lasting tomb. -
When the third dreadful shock had spent
itself, myspirits began to revive; yet still I would
not venture to ascend the ladder, but continued
sitting, not knowing what I should do. So little
grace had I then, as only to say : Lord have
mercy upon me! and no sooner was the earth-
quake over, but that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tem-
pest arose, at the same time attended with a hur-
ricane of wind. The sea seemed mountains high,
and the waves rolled so impetuously, that no-
thing could be perceived but froth and foam.
Three hours did this storm continue, and in so
violent a manner, as to tear the very trees up
by the roots', which was succeeded by abun-
dance of rain. VVhen the tempest was over, I
went to my tent; but the rain coming on in a
furious manner, I was obliged to take shelter in
the cave, where I was forced to cut a channel
through my fortification to let the water out. It
continued raining all that night, and some time
the next day. These accidents made me re-
solve, as soon as the weather cleared up, to build
me a little hut in some open place, walled round
to defend me from wild creatures and savages;
not doubting, but, at the next earth-quake, the
mountain would fall upon my habitation and
me, and swallow up all in its bowels.
April 16,-20. These days I spent in con–
triving how and in what manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this while I was under
the most dreadful apprehensions. When I look-
ed round my habitation, every thing I found
in its proper place. I had several resolutions
whether I should move or not : but at length I
resolved to stay where I was, till I found out a
convenient place where I might pitch my tent,
April 22. When I began to put my resolu-
tions in practice, I was stopt for want of tools
and instruments to work with. Most of my axes
and hatchets were useless, occasioned by cutt-
ing the hard timber that grew on the island. It
took me up a full week to make my grindstone
of use to me; and at last I found out a way to
turn it about with my foot, by help of a wheel
and a string. -
April 28, 29. These days were spentingrind-
ing my tools.
April 5o. My bread falling short, I allowed
myself but one biscuit a day. -
º
'May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore, I
found a barrel of gun-powder, and several pieces
of the wreck, which the sea had flung up. Hav-
ing secured those, I made to the ship, whose
stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
a-shore ; but the rest lay in the sands. This I
suppose was occasioned by the earth-quake. I
now resolved to keep my old place of abode ;
and also to go to the ship that day, but then
found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with
my saw sawed off one of the beams, which kept
her quarter deck. I then cleared the sand till
flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they were
not wholesome. The same day I also catched
a young dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck,
and sawed another piece of timber; and when
the flood came, I made a float of three great
planks, which were driven a-shore by the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought of the
iron bolts, opened the deck with the iron crow,
and carried two planks to land, having made
a way into the very middle of the wreck.
May 1o, 11, 12, 13, 14. All this time I spentin
bringing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on pur-
pose to cut off some lead of the roll; but all in
vain, for it lay too low under water.
May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this
day; for employing myself in looking for pi-
geons, I outstaid my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the
wreck blown a-shore, which I found belonged
to the head of the ship. C
May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck.
and with great difficulty loosened some things
so much with the crow, that at the first flowing
tide several casks floated out, and many of the
seamens chests ; yet that day nothing came to
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which
had some Brazil porkin it. I continued work-
ing to the 15th of June (except the necessary.
times for food and rest); and had I known how
to have built a boat, I had timber and plank
enough: I had also near a loo weight of sheet-
lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the
sea-side, I found a large tortoise or turtle, being
the first I had seen on the island, though, as I
afterwards found , there were many on the
other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found
in her three-score eggs, and her flesh the most
savoury and pleasant I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being
a continual rain; and it was something more
chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceeding ill, taken with a trem-
bling and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked
with pain, and feverish.
Júne 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with
the dismal apprehensions of my condition.
Prayed to God more frequently, but very con-
fusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in
my mind. - -
June 23. Again relapsed much as before,
June 24. Mended a second time.
‘June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold
and hot fits, succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I scram-
bled out, shot a she-goat, brought it home, and
broiled some of it: I would willingly have stew-
ed it and made some broth, but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an
ague; thirsty, yet could not help myself to wa-
ter. Prayed to God in these words : Lord, in
pity, look upon me ! Lord have mercy upon me!
have mercy upon me ! After this I fell asleep,
which I found had much refreshed me when
. I awaked. I fell asleep a second time, and fell
into this strange and terrible sort of dream.
Methought I was sitting on the same spot of
ground at the outside of the wall where I sat
when the storm blew after the earth-quake; and
that Isaw a man descending from a great black
scloud, and light upon the ground. He was all
over as bright as a flash of fire that a little bes
fore surrounded him ; his countenance incon-
ceivably terrible; the earth as it were trembled
when he stept upon the ground, and flashes of
fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner I
thought him landed upon the earth, but with
a long spear or other weapon he made to-
wards me; but first ascending a rising ground,
his voice added to my amazement, when I
thought I heard him pronounce these dreadful
words: Unhappy wretch 1 seeing all these things
have not brought thee to repentance, thou shalt
immediately die. In pronouncing this dreadful
sentence, I thought he went to kill me with the
spear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to
express the horrors of my mind at this vision;
- C 2
and even when I awaked, this very dream made
a deep impression upon my mind. The little
divine knowledge I had, I received from my
father's instructions, and that was worn out by
an uninterrupted series of seafaring impiety for
eight years space. Except what sickness forced
from me, I do not remember I had one thought
of lifting up my heart towards God; but ra–
ther had a certain stupidity of soul, not having
the least sense of fear of the Omnipotent Being
when in distress, nor of gratitude to him for
his deliverances. Nay, when I was in the des—
perate expedition on the desert African shore,
I cannot remember I had one thought of what
would become of me, or to beg his consolation
and assistance in my sufferings and distress.
When the Portuguese captain took me up, and
honourably used me ; nay, farther, when I was
even delivered from drowning by escaping to
this island, I never looked upon it as a judg-
ment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog,
and that's all. Indeed, some secret transport
of soul I had, which was not through grace, but
only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive;
when my companions were all drowned, and
no other joy could I conceive but what is com—
mon with the sailors over a bowl of punch, af-
ier they have escaped the greatest dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food
mor conveniences, might have called upon me
for a thankful acknowledgment to Providence. .
Indeed, the growth of my corn touched me
with some sense; but that soon wore off again.
The terrible earth-quake pointed to me, as it
were, the finger of God; but my dreadful a-
* mazement continued no longer than its dura-
tion. But now, when my spirits began to sink
under the burden of a strong dislemper, and I
could leisurely view the miseries of death pre-
sent themselves before my eyes, then my awak-
ened conscience began to reproach me with
my past life, in which I had so wickedly pro-
voked the justice of God to pour down his ven-
geance upon me. -
Such reflections as these oppressed me even
in the violence of my distemper. Some prayers
I uttered, which only proceeded from my fear
of death. But when I considered my father's
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weep-
ing; for he told me : That, if I did persist in
my folly, I should not only be deprived of God’s
blessing, but have time enough to reflect upon
my despising his instructions, and this in a
wretched time, when none could help me. And
now, concluding it to be fulfilled, having no
soul in the island to administer any comfort to
me, I prayed earnestly to the Lord, that he would
help me in this my great calamily. And this, I
think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity
for many years. But now I must return to my
journal. -
June 28. Somewhat refreshed with sleep,
and the fit quite off, I got up. My dream still
occasioned in me a great consternation; and,
fearing that the ague might return the succeed-
ing day, I concluded it time to get something to
comfort me. I filled a case-bottle with water,
and set it within the reach of my bed, and, to
make it more nourishing and less chilly, I put
some rum in it. The next thing I did, was to
boil me a piece of goat-flesh, of which I ate but
little. I was very weak; lower; walked ars
bout, dreading the return of my distemper; and
at night I supped on three of the turtle's eggs,
which I roasted and ate, begging God’s blessing
therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again
out of doors with my gun; but was so weak,
that I sat down, and looked at the sea, which
was smooth and calm. While I continued
here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth
and sea, of which I have seen so much 7 From
whence came I myself, and all other creatures
living, and of what are we made 7
Our beings were assuredly created by some
almighty invisible power, who framed the earth,
the sea, and air, and all therein. But what is
that power? -
Certainly it must follow, that God has creat-
ed it all. Yet, said I, if God has made all this,
he must be the ruler of them all, and what is
relating thereto ; for certainly the power that
makes, must indisputably have a power to guide
and direct, them. And if this be so (as certainly
it must), nothing can happen without his know-
ledge or appointment. Then, surely, if nothing
happens without God's appointment, certainly
God has appointed these my sufferings to befal
me. And }. I fixed my firm belief, that it
was his will that it should be so; and then pro-
ceeded to inquire, why should God deal with
me in this manner, or what I had done thus
io deserve his indignation ?
Here conscience flew in my face, reprehend-
ing me as a blasphemer ; crying with a loud
and piercing voice : Unworthy wretch 1 dare
jou ask what you have done 2 Look upon your
past life, and see what you have left undone?
Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the
merciless hands of death? why not drowned
in Yarmouth roads, or killed in the fight, when
the ship was taken by the Sallee man of war?
why not entombed in the bowels of wild
beasts on the African coast, or drowned here
when all thy companions suffered shipwreck
in the ocean 7 *-
Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose
tip in a pensive manner, being so thoughtful
that I could not go to sleep; and fearing the
dreadful return of my distemper, it caused me
to remember that the Brazilians use tobacco
for almost all diseases. I then went to my chest,
in order to find some, where heaven, no doubt,
directed me to find a cure for both soul and
body; for there 1 found one of the Bibles, which
till this time I had neither leisure nor inclina-
tion to look into: I took both the tobacco and
that out of the chest, and laid them on the table.
Several experiments did I try with the tobacco.
First, I took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it; but
it being very green and strong, almost stupified
me. Next I steeped it in some rum an hour
or two, resolving when I went to bed to take
a dose of it; and, in the third place, I burnt
some over a pan of fire, holding my nose overit
so long as I could endure it without suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobacco,
I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did I
open it, but there appeared to me these words:
Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
liver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
At first this sentence made a ve: deep im-
/ - 4.
pression on my heart; but it soon wore off again,
when I considered the word deliver was foreign
to me. And as the children of Israel said, when
they were promised flesh to eat: Can God spread
a table in the wilderness 2 in like manner I be-
gan to say: Can God himself deliver me from
this desolate island 2 However, the words would
still return to my mind, and afterwards made
a greater impression upon me. As it now was
very late, and the tobacco had dozed my head,
I was inclined to sleep; but before I would lie
down, I fell on my knees, and implored the
promise that God had made to me in the holy
Scriptures, that: If I called upon him in the day
of trouble, he would deliver me. With much
difficulty I after drank the rum, wherein I had
steeped the tobacco; which flying into my head,
threw me into such a profound, sleep, that it
was three o'clock the next day before I awak-
ed; or rather, I believe, I slept two days, hav-
ing certainly lost a day in my account, and I
could never tell any other way.... When I got
up, my spirits were lively and cheerful; my
stomach much better, being very hungry; and,
in short, no fit returned the next day, which
was the 29th, but I found myself much altered
for the better. -
- g - *
The 3oth, I went abroad with my gun, but
not far, and killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling
a brand-goose, which, however, I cared not
to eat when I brought them home, but dined
on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the even-
ing I renewed my medicine, excepting that I
did not take so large a quantity, neither did I
chew the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke :
but next day, which was the first of July, hav-
w
-
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57
ing a little spice of the cold fit, I again took my
medicine as I did the first time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak.
In this condition I often thought of these words:
I will deliver thee, and while at some times I
would think of the impossibility of it, other
thoughts would reprehend me, for disregard—
ing the deliverances I had received, even from
the most forlorn and distressed condition. I
asked myself : VVhat regard have I had to
God for his abundant mercies 2. Have I done
my part? He has delivered me, but I have not
glorified him ; – as if I had said : I had not
owned and been thankful for these as delive-
rances, and how could I expect greater?' So
much did this sensibly touch my heart, that I
gave God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously topon-
der on what is written in the New Testament,
resolving to read a chapter every morning and
night, as long as my thoughts would engage
me. As soon as I set about this work seriously,
w
piety of my past life; these words that I thought
were spoken to me in my dream, revived : All
these things have not brought thee to repentance,
After this, I begged of God to assist me with his
Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day,
in perusing the Scriptures, I came to these
words: He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour,
to give repentance, and to give remission. Im-
mediately I laid down the book, and, with up-
lifted hands to heaven, loudly cried: O blessed
Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus thou exalted
Prince and Saviour, give me reº ! And

now indeed I prayed with a true sense of my
condition, and a more certain hope, founded
on the word of God. Now I had a different
sense of these words: Call on me, and I will
deliver thee; that is, from the dreadful load of
guilt which oppressed my sinful soul, and not
from a solitary life which might rather be call-
ed a blessing (seeing I wanted neither food nor
raiment), when compared with living among the
human race, surrounded with so much oppres-
sion, misery, and affliction : in a word, I came
to this conclusion, that a deliverance from sin
was a much greater blessing than a deliverance
from affliction. But again I proceed to my
Journal. - - -
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re-
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness.
The applications and experiments I used were
perfectly new ; neither could I recommend
ihem to any one's practice. For though it car-
ried off the fit, it very much weakened me; and
I had frequently convulsions in my nerves and
limbs for some time. From hence I learned,
that going abroad in rainy weather, especially
when it was attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind, was most pernicious to health.
I had now been above ten months in the is—
land; and as I never had seen any of the hu-
man kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole
monarch; and as I grew better, having secured
my habitation to my mind, I resolved to make
a tour round my kingdom, in order to make
new discoveries. - - -
The 15th of July I began my journey. I first
went to the creek, where I had brought my rafts
on shore, and travelling farther, found the tide
went no higher than two miles up, where there
was a little brook of running water, on the bank
of which were many pleasant savannas or mea-
dows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass.
On the rising parts, where I supposed the water
did not reach, I perceived a great deal of to-
bacco growing to a very strong stalk. Several
other plants I likewise found, the virtues of
which I did not understand. I searched a long
time for the cassava root, which I knew the In-
dians in that climate made their bread of; but
all in vain. There were several plants of aloes,
though at that time I knew not §. they were;
likewise I saw several sugar-canes, but imper-
fect for want of cultivation. With these few
discoveries I came back that night, and slept
contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the same
way, but farther than the day before, I found
the country more adorned with woods and
trees. Here I perceived different fruits in great
abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground,
and clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of
this discovery, yetate very sparingly,lest Ishould
throw myself into a flux or fever. The grapes
I found of excellent use; for when I had dried
them in the sun, which preserved them as dried
raisins are kept, they proved very wholesome
and nourishing, and served me in those seasons
when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended u
a tree, and slept very comfortably, though it
was the first time I had lain out of my habita-
tion. And when the morning canº § proceed-
ed with great pleasure on my way, travelling a-
bout four miles, as I imagined by the length
of the valley, directing my course northward,
there being a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me. At the end of this valley I
came to an opening, where the country seemed
to descend to the west; there I found a little
spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the side
of a hill, with its crystal streams running directly
east. And indeed here my senses were charmed
with the most beautiful landscape nature could
afford: for the country appeared so flourishing,
green, and delightful, that to me it seemed like
a planted garden. I then descended on the
side of that delicious vale, when I found abun-
dance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees,
but very wild and barren at that time. As for
the limes, they were delightful and wholesome,
the juice of which I after used to mix in water,
which made it very cool and refreshing. And
now I was resolved to carry home and lay up
a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against the
approaching wet season. So laying them up in
separated parcels, and then taking a few of each
with me, I returned to my little castle, after hav-
ing spent three days in this journey. Before I
got home, the grapes were so bruised that they
were utterly spoiled ; the limes indeed were
good, but of these I could bring only a few.
July 19, Having prepared two bags, I return-
ed thither again; but, to my great surprise, found
all the grapes spread about, trod to pieces, and
abundance eaten, which made me conclude
there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent
this happening again, I gathered a large quanti-
ty of the grapes, and hung them upon the out-
branches of the trees, both to keep them unhurt,
and that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and having well loaded myself with limes and
lemons, I returned once more to my old place
of residence.- . - -
And now contemplating on the fruitfulness
of this valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
security from storms, and the delightfulness of
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled
in the worst part of the country, and there-
fore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I considered again, that though it
was pleasant, it was off from the sea-side where
there was a possibility, some time or other, a
ship might either be driven or sail by, and that
to inclose myself among hills and woods must
certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance,
I resolved to let my castle remain where Pro-
vidence had first assigned it. Yet so ravished
was I with this place, that I made myself a little
kind of bower, surrounding it with a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked
and filled between with brush—wood; and hav-
ing spent a great part of the month of July, I
think it was the first of August before I began
to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3, Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I
took them from the trees, and they proved ex-
cellent good raisins of the sun : the most of
which I carried to my cave ; and happy for
me I did so, by which I saved the best part of
my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made myself a tent like the other,
yet having no shelter of a hill to keep me from
storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I was
obliged to return to my old castle. The rain
continued more or less every day, till the middle
of october, and sometimes' so violently, that I
could not stir out of my cave for several days.
This season I found my family to increase; for
one of my cats that ran away from me, and
who I thought had been dead, returned about
August, with three kitten at her heels, like her-
self; which I thought strange, because both my
cats were females, and the wild cats of the island
seemed to be of a different kind from our Euro-
pean cats; but from these cats proceeded such
numbers, that I was forced to kill and destroy
them, as I would do wild beasts or vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir
out, it raining incessantly; when beginning to
want food, I was compelled to venture twice,
the first of which I shot a goat, and afterwards
found a very large tortoise. The manner of my
regulating my food was thus: A bunch of rai-
sins served me for breakfast , a piece of goat's
flesh or turtle broiled for my dinner, and two
or three turtle eggs for my supper. While the
rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hours
at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked
it on towards one side, till I came to the out-
side of the hill, and made a door or way out,
which came beyond my fence or wall, and so I
came in and out this way. But after I had done
this, I was troubled to see myself thus exposed;
though I could not perceive any thing to fear,
a goat being the biggest creature I had seen up-
on this island. - :
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post,
which amounted to 365, I concluded this to be
the anniversary of my landing; and, therefore,
humbly prostrating myself on the ground, con-
fessing my sins, acknowledging God's righteous
judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve
hours till the going down of the sun; and then
eating a biscuit and a bunch of grapes, laid me
on the bed, and with great comfort took my
night's . Till this time I never had dis-
tinguished the Sabbath day; but now I made a
longer notch than ordinary for the days of rest,
.#divided the weeks as well as I could, though
I found I had lost a day or two in my account.
Myink failing soon after, I omitted in my daily
memorandum things of an indifferent nature,
and contented myself to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life. The rainy
and dry seasons appeared now regular to me,
and experience taught me how to provide for
them; yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my
experience very much failed me. You may
call to mind what I have mentioned of some
barley and rice which I had saved; about thirty
stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter;
and, at that time, the sun being in its southern
position, going from me, together with the rains,
made me conclude it a very proper season to
sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it in two
parts, sowed about two-thirds of my seed, pre-
serving by me about a handful of each. And
happy it was I did so; for, no rains falling, it
was choked up, and never appeared above the
earth till the wet season came again, and then
part of it grew, as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial";
and seeking for a moister piece of ground neas
my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed
in February, a little before the vernal equinox;
which having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and
sprung up very pleasantly. I had still saved part
of the seed, not daring to venture all; and by
the time I found out the proper seasons to sow
in, and that I might expect every year two seed-
times and two harvests, my stock amounted to
above half a peck of each sort of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like
willows the first year after lopping their heads.
I was ignorant of the tree I cut them from :
but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they
made a most lively appearance, and so flourished
in three years time, that I resolved to cut more
of them; and these soon growing, made a glo-
rious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet
and dry seasons, as in this manner.

February,
The wet seasons would continue longer or
shorter as the winds happened to blow. But
having found the ill consequences of being a-
broad in the rain, I took care beforehand to fur-
mish myself with provisions ; and, during the
wet months, sat within doors as much as pos-
sible. At this time I contrived to make many
things that I wanted, though it cost me much
labour and pains, before I could accomplish
them. The first I tried was to make a basket ;
but all the twigs I could get proved so brittle,
that I could not then perform it. It now prov-
ed of great advantage to me, that, when a boy, I
took great delight instanding at a basket-maker's
in the same town where, my father lived, to
view themat work; and, like other boys, cu-
rious to see the manner of their working these
things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing
but the tools. And it coming into my mind,
that the twigs of that tree of which I made my
stakes, might be as tough as sallow, willow, or
osiers, growing in England, I resolved to make
an experiment, and went the next day to my
country-seat, and found some fit for my turn;
and after cutting down a quantity with my
hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, when
fit to work with; carried them to my cave ;
where I employed myself in making several
sorts of baskets, insomuch that I could put in
whatsoever I pleased. It is true, they were not
cleverly made, yet they served my turn upon
all occasions. -
But still I wanted two necessary things. I had
no cask to hold my liquor, except two rundlets
almost full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary
size, and some square case-bottles; neither had
I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle,
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat : I
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry sea-
son a tobacco-pipe ; but for this I afterwards
found an expedient.
I kept myselfemployed in planting my second
row of stakes. But remembering that, when I
travelled up to the brook, I had a mind to see
the whole island, I now resumed my intention,
and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit-
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, I be-
gan my journey. Having passed the vale where
my bower stood, I came within view of the sea
lying to the west ; when, it being a clear day,
I fairly descried land, extending from the W.
to the S. W. about 1o or 15 leagues, as I con-
cluded; but could not say whether it was an
island, or a continent. Neither, could I tell
what this place might be; only thought it was
art of America, and where I might have been
in a miserable condition, had I landed. Again
I considered, that if this was the Spanish coast,
certainly, one time or other, I should see some
ship pass by; and if it was not, then it must be
the Savage coast, between the Spanish country
and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or
Iman-eaters.
* As I proceeded forward, I found this side of .
\
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
verdant grass, together with several very fine
woods. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my companion :
but it was with great difficulty I could knock
one down with my stick ; and I kept him at
home some years, before I could get him to call
me by my name.
In the low grounds I found various sorts of
hares and foxes, as I took them to be, but much
different from those in England. Several of
these I killed, but never ate them; neither in-
deed had I any occasion; for, abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
Leadenhall market to furnish me a better table.
In this journey I did not travel above two miles
a day, because I took several turns and wind-
ings, to see what discoveries I could make, re-
turning, weary enough, to the place where I
designed to rest all night, which was either in
a tree, or to a place which I surrounded with
stakes, that no wild creature might suddenly
surprise me. When I came to the sea shore,
I was amazed to see the splendor of it. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful
fish, and constantly abounding with innumer-
able turtles, and fowls of many kinds, which I
was ignorant of, except those called penguins.
I might have shot as many as I pleased, but was
tºº. my ammunition, rather chusing to
kill a she-goat, which I did with much difficul-
ty, on account of the flatness of the country.
Now though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet my habitation was so
much to my liking, that I did not repine at my
being seated on the worst part of the island. I
continued my journey, travelling about twelve
miles further towards the east, where I set a
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle, and
so round till I came to my post again. As I had
a constant view of the country, I thought I
could not miss my way; but scarce had I tra-
velled three miles, when I descended into a very
large valley, so surrounded with hills covered
with wood, that I, having no guide but by the
sun, nor even then, unless I knew well the po-
sition of the sun at that time of the day, and, to
add to my misfortune, the weather proving ve-
ry hazy, I was obliged to return to my post
by the sea side, and so backwards the same way
I came. In this journey my dog surprised a
kid, and would have killed it, had I not pre-
vented him. As I had often been thinking of
getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of
tame goats to supply me after my ammunition
was spent, I took this opportunity of beginning:
and, having made a collar for this little creature
with a string made of rope-yarn, I brought it to
my bower, and there inclosed and left him; and,
having spent a month in this journey, at length
I returned to my old habitation.
. Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I
returned to my little castle, and reposed myself
in my hammock. . After my journey I rested
myself a week, which time I employed in mak-
ing a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to
consider of the poor kid I had left at the bower,
and I immediately went to fetch it home.
When I came there, I found the young crea-
ture almost starved; I gave it some food, and
tied it as before: but there was no occasion, for
it followed me like a dog; and, as I constantly
fed it, it became so loving, gentle, and fond, that
it commenced one of my domestics, and would
never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 3oth of September
in the most solemn manner, as usual, it bein
the third year of my abode in the island. I spent
the whole day in acknowledging God's mercies,
in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human
society; and for the communications of his
grace to my soul, in supporting, comforting,
and encouraging me to depend upon his pro-
vidence, and hope for his eternal presence in
the world to come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was in this state of life than in that ac-
cursed manner of living I formerly used : and
sometimes when hunting, or viewing the coun-
try, the anguish of my soul would break out
upon me, and my very heart would sink within
me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the
deserts I was in ; and how I was a prisoner
locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of
the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with-
out hopes, and without redemption. In this
condition, I would often wring my hands, and
weep like a child. And even sometimes in the
middle of my work this fit would take me; and
then I would sit down and sigh, looking on the
ground for an hour or two together, till such
time as my grief got vent in a flood of tears.
One morning, as I was sadly employed in
*
this manner, I opened my Bible, when imme-
diately I fixed my eyes upon these words : 1
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee / Surely,
thought I, these words are directed to me; or
else why should they appear just at a moment
when I am bemoaning my forlorn condition ?
And if God does not forsake me, what matters
it, since he can make me more happy in this
state of life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splen-
dor in the world? But while I was going to re-
turn God thanks for my present state, something .
seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thus said:
Unworthy wretch can you pretend to be
thankful for a condition, from which you would
pray to be delivered ? Here I stopt ; – and
though I could not say, I thanked the divine
Majesty for being there, yet I gave God thanks
for placing to my view my former wicked course
of life, and granting me a true knowledge'of re-
pentance. And whenever I opened or shut the
Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed
my good friend in England to send it among
my goods without my order, and for assisting
me to save it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my seve-
ral daily employments were these : First, My
duty to Heaven, and diligently reading the holy
Scriptures, which I did twice or thrice every.
day. Secondly, Seeking provision with my gun,
which commonly took me up, when it did not
rain, three hoursevery morning. Thirdly, The
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what
I had killed, or catched for my supply, which
took me up a great part of the day; for, in the
middle of the #. the sun being in its height, it
was so hot, that I could not stir out; so that I
had only but four hours in the evening to work
in : and then the want of tools, of assistance,
and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little pur-
pose. I was no less than two and forty days mak-
ing a board fit for a long shelf, which two saw-
yers, with their tools and saw-pit, would have
cut out of the same tree in half a day. It was of
a large tree, as my board was to be broad. I was
three days in cutting it down, and two more in
lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a
piece of timber. This I hacked and hewed off
each side, till it became light to move; then I
turned it, made one side of it smooth and flat as
a board from end to end, then turned it down-
ward, cutting the other side, till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth
on both sides. Any body may judge my great
labour and fatigue in such a piece of work; but
this Iwent through with patience, as also many
other things that my circumstances made neces-
sary for me to do.
. The harvest months, November and Decem-
ber, were nowathand,in which I had the pleas-
ing prospect of a very good crop. But there I
met with a new misfortune; for the goats and
hares, having tasted of the sweetness ofthe blade,
kept it so short, that it had not strength to shoot
up into a stalk. To prevent this, I inclosed it
with a hedge, and by day shot some of its de-
vourers; and my dog, which I had tied to the
field-gate, keeping barking all night, so frighten-
ed these creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.
But no sooner did I get rid of these, than
other enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks
of several sorts of birds, who only waited till
my back was turned, to ruin me. So much
did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed
three of the malefactors; and afterwards served
them as they do notorious thieves in England,
hung them up in chains as a terror to others.
And, indeed, so good an effect had this, that
they not only forsook the corn, but all that part
of the island, so long as these criminals hung
there. - -
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of
December, which was my second harvest, I cut
it down with a scythe made of one of my broad
swords. I had no fatigue in cutting down my
first crop, it was so slender. The ears I carried
home in a basket, rubbing it out with my hands,
instead of threshing it; and when my harvest
was over, found my halfpeck of seed produced
near two bushels of rice, and two bushels and
a half of barley. And now I plainly foresaw,
that, by God's goodness, I should be furnished
with bread; but yet I was concerned, because
I knew not how to grind or make meal of my
corn, nor bread, neither knew how to bake it.
I would not, however, taste any of the crop,
but resolved to preserve it against next season,
and, in the mean while, use my best endeavours
to provide myself with other food. -
But where were my labours to end ? The
want of a plough to turn up the earth, or spade
and shovel to digit, I conquered by making me a
wooden spade. The want of a harrow I sup-
plied myselfwith dragging over the corn a great
bough of a tree. When it was growing, I was
forced to fence it; when ripe, to mow it, carry
it home, thresh it, part it from the chaff, and
save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind
it, sieve to dress it, yest and salt to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my
brains on work to find some expedient for every
one of these necessaries against the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
of ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75
that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up
three months; by which time the wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within
doors, I found several occasions to employ my-
self; and, while at work, used to divert myself
with talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and speak his own name Poll, the first wel-
come word I ever heard spoke in the island. I
had been a long time contriving how to make
earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely; and,
when I considered the heat of the climate, I did
not doubt but if I could find any such clay, I
might botch up a pot, strong enough, when
dried in the sun, to bear handling, and to hold
anything that was dry, as corn, meal, and other
things.
To be short, the clay I found; but it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to see
what awkward ways I took, and what ugly mis-
shapen things I made; how many fell in or out
or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed; so that
I think it was two months time before I could
perfect anything; and even then but two clum-
sy things, in imitation of earthen jars. These,
however, I very gently placed in wicker bas-
kets, made on purpose for them, and between
the pot and the baskets stuffed it full of rice and
barley-straw ; and these, I presumed, would
ID -

*
hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal, wher.
the corn was bruised. As for i. smaller things,
I made them with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins,
the sun baking them very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It once happened,
that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein
a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt hard
as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think
of burning some pots; and having no notion of ,
a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I fixed
ihree large pipkins, and two or three pots in a
pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on top, till I saw the
pots in the inside red-hot, and found that they
did not crack at all ; and when I perceived
74 LIFE AND ADVEN TURES
the fire about five or six hours, till the clay melt-
ed by the extremity of the heat, and would have
run to glass, had I suffered it; upon which I
slacked my fire by degrees, till the redness abat-
ed; and watching them till the morning, I found
I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen
pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I
could desire.
No joy could be º than mine at this dis-
covery. For after this, I may say, I wanted for
no sort of earthen ware. I filled one of my pip-
kins with water to boil me some meat, which
it did admirably well, and with a piece of kid
I made me some good broth, as well as my cir-
cumstances would afford me at that time.
The next concern I had was to get me a
stone-mortar to beat some corn in, instead of a
mill to grind it. Here indeed I was at a great
loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter; and many
days I spent to find out a great stone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and
strong enough to bear the weight of a pestle, that
would break the corn without filling it with
sand. . But all the stones of the island being of
a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruit-
less; and then I resolved to look out for a great
block of hard wood; which having soon found,
I formed it with my axe and hammer, and then
with infinite labour made a hollow in it, just as
the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. VV hen
I had finished this, I made a great pestle of iron-
wood, and then laid them up against my suc-
ceeding harvest. -
My next business was to make me a sieve or
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75
and husks. Having no fine thin canvasto searcé
the meal through, I could not tell what to do,
VVhat linen I had was reduced to rags : I had
goats-hair enough, but neither tools to work it,
nor did I know how to spin it. At length I re-
membered I had some neckcloths of callicoe or
muslin of the sailors, which I had brought out
of the ship, and with these I made three small
sieves, proper enough for the work.
I came now to consider the baking part.
The want of an oven I supplied by making
some earthen pans very broad, but not deep.
When I had a mind to bake, I made a great
fire upon my hearth, the tiles of which I had
made myself; and when the wood was burnt
into live-coals, I spread them over it, till it bee
came very hot; then sweeping demº, I set
2

down my loaves, and whelming down the earth-
en pots upon them, drew the ashes and coals
aii round the outside of the pots to continue
the heat; and in this manner I baked my bar-
ley-loaves, as well as if I had been a complete
pastry-cook, and also made of the rice several
cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder, that all these things took me
up the best part of a year, since what interme-
diate time I had, was bestowed in managing my
new harvest and husbandry; for in the proper
season I reaped my corn, carried it home, and
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub, instead of threshing it. And
now indeed my corn increased so much, that it
produced me about twenty bushels of barley,
and as much of rice, that I not only began to
use it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge
my barns, and resolved to sow as much at a
time as would be sufficient for me, for a whole
Car. -
y All this while, the prospect of the land, which
I had seen from the other side of the island, ran
in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance
from this place, though the fear of greater mis-
fortunes might have j me from it, For
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran
the hazard of being killed and eaten by the de-
vouring cannibals; and if they were not so, yet
I might be slain, as other Europeans had been,
who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all
this, my thoughts ran continually upon that
shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and .
the long boat, with the shoulder of mutton sail:
I went to the ship's boat, that had been cast, a
great way on the shore in the late storm. She
was removed but a little; but her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and fury of the
waves and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers I had
cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the
damages she had sustained. This work took
me up three or four weeks, when finding my
little strength all in vain, I fell to undermining
it by digging away the sand, and so to make it
fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and
guide it in the fall. But after this was done, I
was still unable to stir it up, or to get under it,
much less to move it forwards towards the wa-
ter, and so I was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not fright-
en me. I began to think, whether it was not
possible for me to make a canoe or perigua, such
as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But
there I lay under particular inconveniencies;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to
move it in the water when it was made. How-
ever, io work I went upon it, stopping all the
inquiries I could make, with this very simple
answer I made to myself: Let's first make it, I'll
warrant, I’ll find some way or other to get it
along when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diame-
ter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a space, and then parted into bran-
ches. Twenty days was I a hacking and hew-
ing this tree at the bottom, fourteen more in
cutting off the branches and limbs, and a whole
month in shaping it like the bottom of a boat.
As for the inside, I was three weeks ;" a mal-
D
let and chisel, clearing it in such a manner, as
ihat it was big enough to carry 26 men, much
bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and
consequently sufficient to transport me and all
my effects to that wished—for shore Iso ardently
desired.
Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the great-
est difficulty, to get it into the water, it lying
about 1oo yards from it. To remedy the first
inconvenience, which was a rising hill between
this boal and the creek,with wonderful pains and
labour I dug into the surface of the earth, and
made a declivity. But when this was done, all
the strength I had was as insufficient to move it,
as it was when I attempted to move the boat.
I then proceeded to measure the distance of
ground, resolving to make a canal, in order to
bring the water to the canoe, since I could not
bring the canoe to the water. But as this seem-
ed to be impracticable to myself alone, under
the space of eleven or twelve years, it brought
me into some sort of consideration : so that I
concluded this also to be impossible, and the
attempt altogether vain. I now saw, and not
before, what stupidity it is to begin a work before
we reckon its costs, or judge rightly our own
abilities to go through with its performance.
In the height of this work, my fourth year
expired from the time I was cast on this island.
At this time I did not forget my anniversary ;
but kept it with rather greater devotion than be-
fore. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing
to do with ; and very well might I say, as father
Abraham said unto Dives: Between me and
thee there is a gulf fixed. And indeed I was
separated from its wickedness too, having nei-
ther the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,
nor the pride of life; I had nothing to covet,
being lord, king, and emperor over the whole
country I had in possession, without dispute,
and without control. I had loads of corn,
plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and
grapes above measure. What was all the rest
to me? The money I had lay by me as despi-
cable dross, which I would freely have given
for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to
grind my corn. In a word, the nature and ex-
perience of these things dictated to me this just
reflexion, that the good things of this world are
no farther good to us, than they are for our use;
and that whatever we may heap up to give
others, we can but enjoy as much as we use,
and no more. -
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat,
I did it with thankfulness, admiring the provi-
dential hand of God, who, in this wilderness,
had spread a table to me. And now I consi–
dered what I enjoyed, rather than what I want-
ed; compared my present condition with what
I at first expected it should be ; how I should
have done, if I had got nothing out of the
ship; that I must have perished before I had
caught fish or turtles; or lived, had I found
them, like a mere savage, by eating them raw,
and pulling them to pieces with my claws, like
a beast. I next compared my station to that
which I deserved ; how unduliful I had been
to my parents; how destitute of the fear of God;
how void of every thing that was good; and
how ungrateful for those abundaº I
4.
had received from Heaven, being fed, as it were,
by a miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed
by ravens ; and cast on a place where there
were no venemous creatures to poison or de-
vour me; in short, making God's tender mer-
cies matter of great consolation, I relinquished
all sadness, and gave way to contentment.
. As long as my ink continued, which with
water I made last as long as I could, I used to
minute down the days of the month, on which
any remarkable thing happened. And,
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook
my parents and friends, and ran away to Hull,
in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards,
in the next year, I was taken, and made a slave
by the Sallee rovers;
That the very day I escaped out of the wreck
of the ship in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on
the same day, I made my escape from Sallee in
my patron's fishing-boat; -
And, that on the 3oth of September, being
the day of the year I was born on, on that day
twenty-six years after, was Imiraculously saved,
and cast a-shore on this island.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was
the biscuit which I had brought out of the ship:
and though I allowed myself but one cake a
day for above a twelvemonth, yet I was quite
out of bread for near a year, before I got any
corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to decay,
and my linen had been gone long before. How-
ever, I had preserved about three dozen of the
sailors checkered shirts, which proved a great
refreshment to me, when the violent beams of
he sun would not suffer me to bear any of the
º
seamens heavy watch-coats; which made me
turn tailor, and, after a miserable botching man-
mer, convert them to jackets. To preserve my
head, I made me a cap of a goat's-skin, with
the hair outwards to keep out the rain; which
indeed served me so well, that afterwards I
made me a waistcoat and open-kneed breeches
of the same : and then I contrived a sort of an
umbrella, covering it with skins, which not on-
ly kept out the heat of the sun, but the rain also.
Thus being easy and settled in my mind, my
chief.happiness was to converse with God, in
most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot say any ex-
traordinary thing occurred to me. My chiefen-
ployment was to cure my raisins, and plant my
barley and rice, of both which I had a year's
provision before-hand. But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at inter-
mediate times, my business to make a second,
of much inferior size; and it was two years be-
fore I finished it. But as I perceived it would
nowise answer my design of sailing to the other
shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour
round the island, to see what further discove-
ries I could make. To this intent, after having
moved her to the water, and tried how she
would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail of the ship's sail that lay by me.
I then made lockers or boxes at the end of it,
to put in necessaries, provisions, and ammuni-
tion, which would preserve them dry either
from rain, or the spray of the sea; and in the
inside of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place
to lay my gun, and to keep it dry, made a flag
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81
b
in the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the
sun off me. And now resolving to see the cir-
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualled
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen
of my barley-bread loaves, an earthen pot full
of parched rice, a little bottle of rum, half a
goat, powder and shot, and two watch-coats.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year
of my reign, or captivity, that I set out on this
voyage , which was much longer than I ex-
pected, being obliged to put farther out, by rea-
son of the rocks that lay a great way in the
sea. And indeed so much j these rocks sur-
prise me, that I was for putting back, fearing
that if Iventured farther, it would be out of my
power to return. In this uncertainty I cameº
to an anchor just off shore, to which I waded
with my gun on my shoulder, and then climb-
ing up a hill which overlooked that point, I saw
the full extent of it, and so I resolved to run all
hazards.
In this prospect from the hill I perceived a
violent current running to the east, coming very
close to the point; which I the more carefully
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when
I came to it, I might be drove into the sea by
its force, and not able to return to the island;
and certainly it must have been so, had I not
made this observation; for on the other side was
the like current, with this difference, that it set
off at a greater distance; and I perceived there
was a strong eddy under the land; so that my
chief business was to work out of the first cur-
rent, and conveniently get into the eddy. Two
days I staid here, the wind blowing very brisk-
ly E. S. E. which being contrary to the current,
leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so it was neither fit for me to keep too near
the shore, on account of the breach, nor stand
at too great a distance, for fear of the streams.
That night the wind abating, it grew so calm,
that I ventured out; and here I may be a mo-
nument to all rash and ignorant pilots : for I
was no sooner come to the point, and not above
the boat's length from shore, but I was got in-
to a deep water, with a current like a sluice of
a mill, which drove my boat along so violently,
that it was impossible for me to keep her near
the edge of it, but forced me more and more
out from the eddy which was to my left; and
all I could do with my paddles was useless, there
being no wind to help me. w
Now I began to look upon myself as quite
lost, since, as the current ran on both sides of
the island, I was very certain they must join
again, and then I had no hopes but of perishin
for want in the sea, after what provision I .
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen
to arise. -
Who can conceive the present anguish of my
mind at this calamity? With longing eyes did
Ilook upon my little kingdom, and thought the
island the pleasantest place in the universe.
Happy, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I never
see thee more? Wretched creature whither
am I going? Why did I murmur at my lone-
some condition, when now I would give the
whole world to be there again? While I was
thus complaining, I found myself to be driven
about two leagues into the sea; however, Ila-
boured till my strength was far spent, to keep
my boat as far north as possibly I ºld, to that
side of the current where the eddy lay on.
About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind
spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed
my heart ; and I was still more elated, when,
in about half an hour, it blew agentle fine gale.
Had any thick weather sprung up, I had been
lost another way : for having no compass on
board, I should never have found the way to
steer towards the island, if once it had disap-
peared ; but it proving the contrary, I set up
my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away
northward, as much as I could, to get rid of the
current. And no sooner did the boat begin
to stretch away, but I perceived, by the clear-
ness of the water, a change of the current was
near : for where it was strong, the water was
foul ; and where it was clear, the current a-
hated. To the east I soon saw, about half a
mile , a breach of the sea upon some rocks,
which caused it again to separate; and as the
main force of it drove away more southwardly,
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other
came back by the repulse of the rocks, making
a sharp eddy, which returned back again to the
north-west with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be
reprieved upon the ladder, or to be saved from
thieves just going to take away their lives, or
such as have been in the like calamities with
my own, may guess at my present excess of joy,
how heartily Iran my boat into the stream of .
this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail to
the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully before
it, with a smart tide under foot. By the assis-
tance of this eddy, I was carried above a league
home again, when being in the wake of the
island, betwixt the two currents, I found the
water to be in a sort of a stand. About four
o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the island, and perceived the points
of the rock which caused #. disaster, stretch-
ing out, as I observed before, to the southward,
which, throwing off the current more south-
wardly, had occasioned another eddy to the
north. But having a fair brisk gale, I stretch-
ed across this eddy, and in an hour came with-
in a mile of the shore , where I soon land-
ed, to my unspeakable comfort; and after an
humble prostration, thanking God for my de-
liverance, with a resolution to lay all thoughts
of escaping aside, I brought my boat safe to a
little cove, and laid me down to take a welcome
repose. When I awoke, I was considering
how I might get my boat home; and coasting
along the shore, I came to a good bay, which
ran up to a rivulet or brook, where, finding a
safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if she had
been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the
place where before I had travelled on foot; so
taking nothing with me, except my gun and
umbrella, I began my journey, and in the even-
ing came to my bower, where I again laid me
down to rest. I had not slept long before I was
awakened in great surprise, by a strange voice
that called me several times : Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Where are you,
Robin Crusoe 2 where are you ? where have you
been 2 -
So fast was I asleep at first, that I did not
awake thoroughly : but half asleep and half
awake, I thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me. But, as the voice repeated Ro-
binson Crusoe several times, being terribly af-
frighted, I started up in the utmost confusion;
and no sooner were my eyes fully open, but I
beheld my pretty Poll sitting on the top of the
hedge, and soon knew that it was he that called
me; for just in such bewailing language I used
to talk and teach him ; which he so exactly
learned, that he would sit upon my finger, and
lay his bill close to my face, and cry : Poor Ro-
binson Crusoe, where are you ? where have you
been 2 hou, came you here? and such like }.
I had constantly taught him. But even though
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while
before I could adjust myself; being amazed
how the creature got thither, and that he should
fix about that place, and no where else. But
now, being assured it could be no other than
my honest Poll, my wonder ceased; and reach-
ing out my hand, and calling familiarly Poll, ,
the creature came to me, and perched upon my
thumb, as he was wont, constantly prating to
me, with Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did I
come here, and where had Î been 2 as if the bird
was overjoyed to see me; and so I took him
home along with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my ram-
bling to sea; yet I could wish my boat, which
had cost me so much trouble and pains, on this
side the island once more, but which indeed
was impracticable. I therefore began to lead a
very retired life, living near a twelvemonth in
a very contented manner, wanting for nothing
except conversation. As to mechanic labours,
which my necessities obliged me to, I fancied I
could, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpen-
ter, were the poor tools I had to work withal
but good. Besides, as Limproved in my earth-
en ware, I contrived to make them with a
wheel, which I found much easier and better,
making my work shapely, which before was
rude and ugly. But I think I was never so ele-
vated with my own performance or project, as
for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which,
though it proved an awkward clumsy thing,
yet was very sound, and carried the smoke per-
fectly well, to my great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, making me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsome, were very handy and con-
venient to fetch things homein, as also for hold-
ing my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me exa-
mine after what manner I should kill the goats
or birds to live on, after it was all gone. Upon
which I contrived many ways to ensnare the
goats, and see if I could catch them alive, H.
ticularly a she-goat with young. At last I had
my desire; for, making pit-falls and traps bait-
ed with barley and rice, I found, one morning,
in one of them, an old he-goat, and in the other
three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boisterous was the old one, that I could
not bring him away. But I forgot the old pro-
verb, that hunger will tame a lion : for, had I
kept him three or four days without victuals,
aud then given him some water, with a little
corn, he would have been as tame as a young
kid. The other creatures I bound with strings
together ; but I had great difficulty before I
could bring them to my habitation. It was
some time before they would feed; but, throw-
ing them sweet corn, it so much tempted them,
that they began to be tamer. From hence I
concluded, that if I designed to furnish myself
with goats flesh, when my ammunition was
spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock
of sheep, about my settlement, was the only me-
thod I could take. I concluded also I must se-
parate the wild from the tame, or else they
would always run wild as they grew up; and
the best way for this, was to have some inclosed
piece of ground, well fenced, either with hedge
or pale, to keep them so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without
break in. Such an undertaking was very great
for one pair of hands; but as there was an ab-
solute necessity for doing it, my first care was
to find a convenient piece of ground, where
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat,
water to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.
Here again I gave another instance of my
ignorance and inexperience, pitching upon a
piece of meadow land so large, that had I in-
closed it, the hedge or pale must have been at
least two miles about. Indeed, had it been ten
miles, I had time enough to do it in; but then
I did not consider that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass as if they had had the
whole island, and consequently as difficult for
me to catch them. This thought came into my
head, after I had carried it on, I believe, about
fifty yards : I therefore altered my scheme, and
resolved to inclose a piece of ground about 15o
yards in length, and loo in breadth, sufficient
enough for as many as would maintain me, till
such time as my flock increased, and then I
could add more ground. I now vigorously pro-
secuted my work, and it took me about three
months in hedging the first piece; in which
time I tethered the three kids in the best part
of it, feeding them as near me as possible, to
make them familiar: and indeed I very often
would carry some ears of barley, or a handful
of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by
which they grew so tame, that when my inclo-
sure was finished, and I had let them loose,
they would run after me for a handful of corn.
This indeed answered my end ; and in a year
and a half’s time. I had a flock of about twelve
goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they
amounted to forty-three, besides what I had
taken and killed for my sustenance. After
which I inclosed five several pieces of ground
to feed them in, with pens to drive them into,
that I might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goats-
flesh, but milk too, which, in my beginning, I
did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though I never had milked a cow, much less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after
some essays and miscarriages, I made me both,
and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the Omnipotent Power
comfort his creatures, even in the midst of their
greatest calamities? How can he sweeten the bit-
terest providences, and give us reason to mag-
nify him in dungeons and prisons? What a
bounteous table was here spread in a wilder–
ness for me, where I expected nothing at first
but to perish for hunger? -
Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to have
seen me at dinner. There sat my royal ma-
jesty, an absolute prince and ruler of my king-
dom, attended by my dutiful subjects; whom,
if I pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter,
give them liberty, or take it away. When I
dined, I seemed a king, eating alone, none dar-
ing to presume to do so till I had done. Poll,
as if he had been my principal court-favourite,
was the only person permitted to talk with me.
My old but faithful dog, now grown exceed-
ing crazy, and who had found no species to
multiply his kind upon, continually sat on my
right hand; while my two cats sat on each side
of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a
principal mark of my royal favour. These
were not the cats I had brought from the ship;
they had been dead long before, and interred
near my habitation by mine own hand. But one
of them, as I suppose, generating with a wild
cat, a couple of their young I had made tame;
the rest ran wild into the woods, and in time
grew so impudent as to return and plunder me
of my stores, till such time as I shot a great ma-
my, and the rest left me without troubling me
any more. In this plentiful manner did I live,
wanting for nothing but conversation. One
thing indeed concerned me, the want of my
boat; I knew not which way to get her round
the island. One time I resolved to go along
the shore by land to her; but had any one in
England met such a figure, it would either have
affrighted them, or made them burst into laugh-
ter; nay, I could not but smile myself at my
habit, which I think in this place it will be very
proper to describe.
The cap I wore upon my head was great,"
high, and shapeless, made of a goats-skin, with
a flap or rº hanging down behind, not
only to keep the sun from me, but to shoot the
rain off from running into my neck, nothing
being more pernicious than the rain falling up-
on the flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket
of goats-skin, whose hair hung down such a
length on either side, that it reached down to the
calves of my legs. As for shoes and stockings,
I had none, but made a resemblance of some-
thing, I know not what to call it; they were
made like buskins, and laced on the sides like
spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the rest
of my habit. I had a broad belt of goats-skin
dried, girt round me with a couple of thongs,
instead of buckles ; on each of which, to sup-
ply the deficiency of sword and dagger, hung
my hatchet and saw. I had another belt, not so
broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which
hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it,
under my left arm, hung two pouches, made
also of goats-skin, to hold my powder and shot.
My basket I carried on my back, and my gun
on my shoulder; and over my head a great
clumsy, ugly goat-skin umbrella, which, how-
ever, next to my gun, was the most necessary
thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes', or as
might have been expected from one who took
so little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten
degrees of the Equinox. At one time my beard
grew so long that it lºung down above a quar-
ter of a yard; but as I had both razors and scis-
sars in store, I cut it all off, and suffered none
to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan
whiskers, the like of which I had seen worn
by some Turks at Sallee, not long enough in-
deed to hang a hat upon, but of such a mons-
trous size as would have amazed any in Eng-
land to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there
being none to observe my behaviour or habit.
And so, without fear and without control, I
proceeded on my journey, the prosecution of
which took me up five or six days. I first tra-
velled along the sea shore, directly to the place
where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to
get upon the rocks; but having now no boat
to take care of, I went over land a nearer way
to the same height that I was upon before; when
looking forward to the point of the rock, which
lay out, and which I was forced to double with
my boat, I was amazed to see the sea so smooth
and quiet, there being no ripling motion, nor
current, any more than in other places. This
made me ponder some time to guess the reason
of it, when at last I was convinced, that the ebb
setting from the west and joining with the cur-
rent of water from some great river on shore
must be the occasion of these rapid streams; and
that, consequently, as the winds blew more
westwardly, or more southwardly, so the cur-
rent came the nearer, or went the farther from
shore. To satisfy my curiosity, I waited there
till evening, when the time of ebb being made,
I plainly perceived from the rock the current
again as before, with this difference, that it ran
farther off, near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my expedition, it set close upon it,
furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with
it, which at another time it would not have
done. And now I was convinced, that, by ob-
serving the ebbing and flowing of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting it
in practice, the remembrance of the late dan-
ger struck me with such horror, that I changed
my resolution, and formed another, which was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was
to make another canoe, and so have one for
one side of the island, and one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the
first, my little fortification, fort, or castle, with
many large and spacious improvements: for by
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me
with several little caves, one within another, to
hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles
with which Imade my wall were grown so lof-
iy and great as obscured my habitation. And
mear this commodious and pleasant settlement,
lay my well cultivated and improved corn fields,
which kindly yielded me fruit in the proper
season. My second plantation was that near my
country-seat, or little bower, where my grapes
flourished, and where, having planted many
stakes, I made inclosures for my goats, so strong-
ly fortified by labour and time, that it was much
stronger than a wall, and consequently impos-
sible for them to break through. As for my
bower itself, I kept it constantly in repair, and
cut the trees in such a manner as made them
grow thick and wild, and form a most delight-
ful shade. In the centre of this stood my tent,
thus erected : I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship's
sail; beneath which I made me a sort of a couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
other things; and having laid thereon one of
the sailor's blankets, which I had saved from
the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with
a great watch-coat, I took up this place for my
country-retreat. - -
Very frequently from this settlement did I
use to visit my boat, and kept her in very good
order. And sometimes I would venture in her
a cast or two from shore, but no farther, lest
either a strong current, a sudden stormy wind,
or some unlucky accident, should hurry me
from the island as before. But now I entreat
your attention, whilst I proceed to inform you
of a new but most surprising scene of life which
here befell me.
You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more amaz-
ing than to see a human creature. One day it
happened, that, going to my boat, I saw the
rint of a man's naked foot on the shore, very
evident on the sand, as to the toes, heel, and
every part of it. , Had I seen an apparition in
the most frightful shape, I could not have been
more confounded. My willing ears gave the
strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but
could satisfy neither the one or the other. I pro-
ceeded alternately to every part of the shore,
but with equal effect; neither could I see any
other mark, though the sand about it was as sus-
ceptible to take impression, as that which was
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with con-
fusion and horror, I returned to my habitation,
fightened at every bush and tree, taking every
thing for men, and possessed with the wildest
ideas. That night my eyes never closed. I form-
ed nothing but the most dismal imaginations,
concluding it must be the mark of the devil's
w
foot which I had seen. For otherwise how
could any mortal come to this island? Where
was the ship that transported them? and what
signs of any other footsteps? Though these seem-
ed very strong reasons for such a supposition,
yet (thought I) why should the devil make the
print of his foot to no purpose, as I can see,
when he might have taken other ways to have
terrified me 2 VVhy should he leave his mark
on the other side of the island, and that too on
the sand, where the surging waves of the ocean
might soon have erased the impression. Surely
this action is not consistent with the subtility of
Satan, said I to myself; but rather must be
some dangerous creature, some wild savage of
the main land over-against me, that, venturing
too far in the ocean, has been driven here, ei-
ther by the violent currents or contrary winds;
and not caring to stay on this desolate island,
has gone back to sea again.
Happy indeed, thought I to myself, that none
of the savages had seen me in that place : yet
I was not altogether without fear, lest, having
found my boat, they should return in numbers
and devour me, or at least carry away all my
corn, and destroy my flock of tame goats. In a
word, all my religioWs, hopes vanished, as tho’
I thought God could not now protect me by
his power, who had so wonderfully preserved
me so long. - -
What various chains of providence are there
in the life of man! How changeable are our af-
fections, according to different circumstances !
We love to-day what we hate to-morrow; we
shun one hour what we seek next. This was
evident in me in the most conspicuous manner:
for I, who before had so much lamented my
condition, in being banished from all human-
kind, was now even ready to expire, when I
considered that a man had set his foot on this
desolate island. But, when I considered my sta-
tion of life decreed by the infinitely wise and
good providence of God, that I ought not to
dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who had an
undoubted right to govern and dispose of his
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his
justice and mercy could either punish or deliver
me: I say, when I considered all this, I comfort-
ably found it my duty to trust sincerely in him,
pray ardently to him, and humbly resign my-
self to his divine will. -
One morning, lying on my bed, these words
of the sacred writings came again into my mind:
Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
diver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. Upon this
sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed,
I offered up my prayers in the most devout
manner: and, when I had done, taking up my
Bible to read, these words appeared first in my
sight: Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,
and he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I say,
on the Lord. Such divine comfort did this give
me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon that
occasion. . .
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and
fears, for three days and nights, I at last ven-
tured out of my castle, and milked my goats,
one of which was almost spoiled for want of it.
I next (though in great fear) visited my bower,
and milked my flocks there also; when, grow-
ing bolder, I went down to the shore again,
and measuring the print of the foot to mine, to
sce perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, I found it much superior in large-
ness; and so returned home, now absolutely
convinced that either some men had been a-
shore, or that the island must be inhabited; and .
therefore that I might be surprised before I
Was aware. -
I now began to think of providing for my
security, and revolved in my mind many diffe-
rent schemes for that purpose. I first proposed
to cut down my inclosures, and turn my tame
cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy
might not find them, and frequent the island
in hopes of killing the same. Secondly, I was
for digging up my corn-fields for the very same
reason. And, lastly, I concluded to demolish
my bower, lest, seeing a place of human con-
trivance, they might come farther, and find out
and attack me in my little castle.
Such motions did the fear of danger suggest
to me; and I looked, I thought, like the un-
fortunate king Saul, when not only oppressed
by the Philistines, but also forsaken by God
himself. And it is strange that a little before,
having entirely resigned myself to the will of
God, I should now have so little confidence in
him, fearing those more who could kill this fad-
ing body, than him who could destroy my im-
mortal soul. -
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that
night; yet nature, spent and tired, submitted to
a silent repose the next morning. And then,
joining reason with my fear, I considered, that
this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entirely forsaken as I might think; but that
the inhabitants from the other * might sail,
either with design, or from necessity, by cross,
winds; and, if the latter circumstance, I had
reason to believe they would depart the first
opportunity. However, my fear made me think
of a place for retreat upon an attack. I now
repented that I had made my door to come out
beyond my fortification ; to remedy which, I
resolved to make me a second one : I fell to
work, therefore, and drove, betwixt that double
row of trees which I planted about twelve years
before, several strong piles, thickening it with
pieces of timber and old cables, and strengthen-
ing the foot of it with earth which I dug out of .
my cave; I also made myselfseven holes,wherein
I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting them
into frames resembling carriages. This being
finished with indefatigable industry for a great
way, every where I planted sticks of ozier like
a wood, about twenty thousand of them, leav-
ing a large space between them and my wall,
that I might have room to see an enemy, and
that they might not be sheltered among the
young trees, if they offered to approach the
outer wall. And, indeed, scarce two years had
passed over my head, when there appeared a
lovely shady grove, and in six years it became
a thick wood perfectly impassible. For my
safety I left no avenue to go in or out; instead
of which I set two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in,
leaving room to place another ladder, upon
that ; so that when I took those down, it was
impossible for any man to descend without
hurting himself; and if they had, they would
still be at the outside of my outer wall. But
while I took all these measures of human pru-
dence for my own preservation, I was not al-
together unmindful of other affairs. To pre-
serve my stock of tame goals, that the enemy
should not take all at once, I looked out for
the most retired part of the island, which was
the place where I had lost myself before men-
tioned, and there finding a clear piece of land,
containing three acres, surrounded with thick
woods, I wrought so hard, that, in less than
a month's time, I fenced it so well round, that
my flocks were very well secured in it, and I
ut therein two he-goats and ten she-ones.
All this labour was occasioned purely by fear-
ful apprehensions, on account of seeing the
rint of a man's foot. And not contented yet
with what I had done, I searched for another
place towards the west point of the island,
where I might also retain another flock. Then
wandering on this errand more to the west of
the island than ever I had yet done, and cast-
ing my eyes towards the sea, methought I per-
ceived a boat at a great distance; but could not
possibly tell what it was for want of my per-
spective glass. I considered then it was no
strange thing to see the print of a man's foot;
and, concluding them cannibals, blessed God
for my being cast on the other side of the island,
where none of the savages, as I thought, ever
came. But when I came down the hill to the
shore, which was the S. W. point of the is-
land, I was soon confirmed in my opinion ;
nor can any one describe my horror and amaze-
ment, when I saw the ground spread with
sculls, hands, feet, and bones of human bodies;
and particularly I perceived a space like a circle,
in the midst of which had beenÉ fire, about
º, 2
which I conjectured these wretches sat, and un-
naturally sacrificed and devoured their fellow-
creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dread-
ful spectacle, both confounded my senses, and
made me discharge from my stomach in an ex-
cessive manner. I then returned towards my
habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bend-
ed knees, gave God thanks for making my na-
iure contrary to these wretches, and delivering
me so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here
had assured me, that these savages never came
up to the thick woody parts of the country, and
that I had no reason to be apprehensive of a
discovery; yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that, for two years after, I confined my-
self only to my three plantations; I mean my
castle, country-seat, and inclosure in the woods.
And though, in process of time, my dreadful
apprehensions began to wear away, yet my eyes
were more vigilant for fear of being surprised,
and I was very cautious of firing my gun, lest,
being heard by those creatures, they should pro-
ceed to attack me. I resolved, however, man-
fully to lose my life if they did, and went arm-
ed with three pistols stuck in my girdle; which,
added to the description I have given of my-
self before, made me look with a very formi-
dable appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time re-
mained very calm and undisturbed; and when
I compared my condition to others, I found it
far from being miserable. And, indeed, would
all persons compare their circumstances, not
with those above them, but with those innu-
merable unhappy objects beneath them, I am
sure we should not hear those daily murmur-
ings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed,
the terror which the savages had put me into,
spoiled some inventions for my own convenien-
cies. One of my projects was to brew myself
some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it is considered, that I had neither casks suf-
ficient, nor could I make any to preserve it in;
neither had I hops to make it keep, yest to
make it work, nor a copper or kettle to make
it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years, I
might bring this to bear, as I had done other
things. But now my inventions were placed
another way; and day and might I could think
of nothing but how I might destroysome of these
cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody en-
tertainments, and so save a victim from be-
ing sacrificed, that he might after become my
servant. Many were my contrivances for this
purpose, and as many more objections occur-
red, after I hatched them. I once contrived to
dig a hole under the place where they made
their fire, and put therein five or six pounds
of gun-powder, which would consequently
blow up all those that were near it; but then I
was loath to spend so much upon them, lest it
should not do that certain execution I could
desire, and but only affright, and not kill
them. Having laid this design aside, I again.
proposed to myself to lie privately in ambush,
in some convenient place, with my three guns
double loaded, and let fly at them in the midst
of their dreadful ceremony; and hº killed
-
two or three of them at every shot, fall upont
the rest suddenly with my three pistols, and
not let one mother's son escape. This imagina-
tion pleased my fancy so much, that I used to
dream of it in the night time. To put my de-
sign in execution, I was not long seeking for a
place very convenient for my purpose, where
unseen I might behold every action of the sa-
wages. Here I placed my two muskets, each
of which was loaded with a brace of slugs, and
four or five smaller bullets about the size of pis-
tol bullets; the fowling-piece was charged with
near a handful of the largest swan shot; and in
every pistol were about four bullets. And thus
all things being prepared, no sooner would the
welcome light spread over the element, but,
1ike a giant refreshed with wine, as the Scrip-
ture has it, would I issue forth from my castle,
and from a lofty hill, three miles distant, view
if I could see any invaders approach unlaw-
fully to my kingdom. But having waited in.
vain two or three months, it not only grew ve-
ry tiresome to me, but brought me into some
consideration, and made me examine myself,
what right I had to kill these creatures in this
manner.
If (argued I to myself) this unnatural cus-
tom of theirs be a sin offensive to Heaven, it be-
longs to the divine Being, who alone has the
vindictive powerin his hands, to shower down,
his vengeance upon them. And perhaps he
does so, in making them become one another's
executioners. Or, if not, if God thinks these
doings just, according to the knowledge they
conceive, what authority have I to pretend to
thwart the decrees of Providence, which has.
F. these actions for so many ages, per-
aps from almost the beginning of their asso-
ciation? They never offended me; what right
have I then to concern myself in their shedding
one another's blood 7 And, indeed, I have
since known, they value no more to kill and
devour a captive taken in war, than we do to
kill an ox, or eat mutton. I then concluded,
it necessarily followed, that these º Were
no more murderers than Christians, who many
times put whole, troops to the sword, after
throwing down their arms. Again I consider-
ed, that if I fell upon them, I should be as
much in the wrong as the Spaniards, who had
committed the greatest barbarities upon those
people who never had offended them in their
whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was
eminent for a race of men without common
compassion to the miserable, a principal sign
of the most generous temper. These considera-
tions made me pause, and brought me to think
I had taken wrong measures in my resolution;
I now argued with myself, that it was better
for me never to attack, but to remain undis-
covered as long as possibly I could; that an op-
posite conduct would certainly prove destruc-
tive ; for, as it was scarcely to be supposed I
could kill them all, I might either be over-
powered by the remaining, or that some es-
caping might bring thousands to my certain
destruction. And, indeed, religion took their
part so much as to convince me how contrary
it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding hu-
man blood, innocent as to my particular, what-
ever they are to one another ; that I had no-
*hing, to do with it, but leave it to the God of
E 4.
all power and dominion, as I said before, to do
therein what seemed convenient to his heaven-
ly wisdom. And, therefore, on my knees I
thanked the Almighty for delivering me from
blood-guiltiness, and begged his protection that
I might never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had
rashly begun, I never ascended the hill on that
occasion afterwards; I only removed my boat,
which lay on the other side of the island, and
every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not be
the least shadow of discovery of any boat near,
or habitation upon the island. My castle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in it,
except when I went out to milk my she-goats,
and order my little flock in the wood, which
was quite out of danger; for sure I was, that
these savages never came here with expecta-
tions to find any thing, and consequently never
wandered from the coast ; however, as they
might have several times been on shore, as well
before as after my dreadful apprehensions, I
looked back with horror to think in what state
I might have been, had I suddenly met them
slenderly armed with one gun only loaded
with small shot; and how great would have
been my amazement, if, instead of seeing the
print of one man's foot, I had perceived fifteen
or twenty savages, who, having once set their
eyes upon me, by the swiftness of their feet,
would have left me no possibility of escaping.
These thoughts would sink my very soul, so
that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till
such time as the consideration of my gratitude
to the divine Being moved it from my heart. I
then fell into a contemplation of the secret
springs of Providence; and how wonderfully
we are delivered, when insensible of it; and
when intricated in uncertain mazes or laby-
rinths of doubt or hesitation, what secret hint
directs us on in the right way, when we intended
to go out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our
business, sense, or inclination. Upon which,
I fixed within me this as a certain rule, never
to disobey those secret impressions of mind to
the acting or not acting any thing that offered,
for which I yet could assign no reason. But
let it be how it will, the advantage of this con-
duct very eminently appeared in the latter part
of my abode on this island: I am a stranger in
determining whence these secret intimations of
Providence derive ; yet methinks they are not
only some proof of the converse of spirits, but
also of the secret communications they are sup-
posed to have with those that have not yet pas-
sed through the gloomy vale of death.
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my
preservation, put a period to all future inven-
tions and contrivances, either for accommoda-
tion or convenience. I now cared not to drive
a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire,
lest either the noise should be heard, or the
smoke discover me. And on this account I
used to burn my earthen ware privately in a
cave which I found in the wood, and which I
º
made convenient for that purpose; the princi- '
pal cause that brought me here was to make
charcoal, so that I might bake and dress my
bread and meat without any danger. At that
time a curious accident happened me, which I
shall now relate, E 5
9.
While I was cutting down some wood for
making my charcoal, I perceived a cavily be—
hind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu-
rious to look into it, I attained its mouth, and
perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright
in it. But when I had entered, and took a fur-
ther view, two rolling shining eyes, like flam-
ing stars, seemed to dart themselves at me; so
that I made all the haste out that I could, as .
not knowing whether it was the devil or a mon-
ster that had taken his residence in that place.
When I recovered a little from my surprise, I
called myself a thousand fools, for being afraid.
to see the devil one moment, who had now al-
most lived twenty years in the most retired so--
litude. And therefore resuming all the courage.
I had, I took up a flaming fire-brand, and in I,
rushed again. I had not proceeded above three-
steps, when I was more affrighted than before;
for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a.
human creature in the greatestagony, succeed-
ed with a broken noise, resembling words half
expressed, and then a broken sigh again. Step--
ping back, Lord! (thought I to myself) where
am I got? Into what inchanted place have I;
plunged myself, such as is reported to contain.
miserable captives, till death puts an end to
their sorrow 2 And, indeed, in such a great a-
mazement was I, that it struck me into a cold
sweat; and had my hat been on my head, I
believe my hair would have moved it off. But
again encouraging myself with the hopes of
God's protection, I proceeded forward, and,
by the light of my fire-brand, perceived it to be
a monstroushe-goat, lying on the ground, gasp-
ing for life, and dying of mere old age. At first.
I stirred him, thinking to drive him out, and
the poor ancient creature strove to get upon
his feet, but was not able ; so I e'en let him lie
still, to affright the savages, should they venture
into this cave. I now looked round me, and
found the place but small and shapeless. At
the farther side of it I perceived a sort of an
entrance, yet so low, as must oblige me to
creep on my hands and knees to it; so, having
no candle, I suspended my enterprise till the
mext day, and then I came provided with two-
large ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet
through this strait, I found the roof rose high-
er up, I think about twenly feet. But surely
never mortal saw such a glorious sight before
The roof and walls of this cave reflected a
hundred thousand lights to me from my two
candles, as though they were indented with
shining gold, precious stones, or sparkling dia-
monds. And indeed it was the most delight-
ful cavity or grotto of its kind that could be de-
sired, though entirely dark. The floor was dry
and level, and had a kind of gravel upon it;
no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I
could find no fault but in the entrance, and I
began to think that even this might be very me-
cessary for my defence, and therefore I resolv-
ed to make it my most principal magazine. I
brought hither two fowling-pieces and three
muskels, leaving only five pieces at my castle'
planted in the nature of cannon. In a barrel
of gun-powder, which I took up out of the sea,
P. brought away about sixty pounds of good
powder, which were not damaged gºd these,
I.
with a great quantity of lead for bullets, I re-
moved from my castle to this retreat, now for-
tified both by art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants
of old, who were said to live in caves and
holes among the rocks, inaccessible to any but
themselves, or, at least, most dangerous to at-
tempt. And now I despised both the cunning
and strength of the savages, either to find me
out, or to hurt me.
But I must not forget the old goal who caus-
ed my late dreadful amazement. The poor crea:
ture gave up his last breath the day after my dis-
covery; and it being very difficult to drag him
out, I dug his grave, and honourably intombed
him in the same place where he departed, with
as much ceremony as any Welch goat that has
been interred about the high mountain Pen-
772azz77tazz7°.
I think I was now in the twenty-third year
of my reign, and my thoughts much easier-than
formerly, having contrived several pretty a-
musements and diversions to pass away the
time in a pleasant manner. By this time my
pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and
pronounce his words very articulately and
ro8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
together after a very familiar manner; and he
lived with me no less than twenty-six years.
My dog, who was nineteen years old, sixteen
of which he lived with me, died sometime ago
of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi-
plied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive
them into the woods, except two or three,
which became my particular favourites. Be-
sides these, I continually kept two or three.
household kids about me, whom I did learn to
feed out of my hand, and two more parrots
who could talk indifferently, and call Robin-
son Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first,
as not taking that trouble with them. I had also
several sea-fowls which I had wounded and cut
their wings; and growing tame, they used to
breed among the low trees about my castle-
walls; all which made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state of life,
when we least expect them . It was now the
month of December, in the southern solstice,
and particular time of my harvest, which requir-
ed my attendance in the fields; when going out.
pretty early one morning before it was day-light,
there appeared to me, from the sea-shore, a.
flaming light about two miles from me, at the
east end of the island, where I had observed
some savages had been before, not on the other
side, but to my great affliction it was on my side
of the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled up the ladder after me, making,
all things look as wild and natural as possibly
I could. In the next place, I put myself in apos-
ture of defence, loading my muskets and pis—
tols, and committing myself to God’s protection,
I resolved to defend myself till my last breath.
Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I
set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where:
there was a flat place, and then pulling the lad-
der after me, ascended to the top, where laying
myself on my belly, with my perspective glass
I perceived no less than nine naked savages.
sitting round a small fire, eating, as I supposed,
human flesh, with their two canoes haled on
shore, waiting for the flood to carry them off
again. You cannot easily express the conster-
nation I was in at this sight, especially seeing
them near me; but when I perceived their
coming must be always with the current of
the ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts,
being very fully convinced, that I might go a--
broad with security all the time of the flood, if
they were not before landed. And, indeed, this.
proved just as I imagined ; for no sooner did
they all take boat and paddle away, but the tide
made N.W. Before they went off, they danced,
making ridiculous postures and gestures ,
for above an hour, all slark naked ; but whe-
ther men or women, or both, I could not per-
ceive. When I saw them gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple
of pistols in my belt, with my great sword hang-
ing by my side, I went to the hill, where at
first I made a discovery of these cannibals, and
then saw there had been three canoes more of
the savages on shore at that place, which, with.
the rest, were making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me,
when going to the place of sacrifice, the blood,
the bones, and other mangled parts of human
bodies appeared in my sight; and so fired was
I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to
be revenged on the first that came there, though
I lost my life in the execution. It then appear-
ed to me, that the visits which they made to
this island were not very frequent, it being fif-
teen months before they came again : but still K.
was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal ap-
prehensions I had of their surprising me una-
wares; nor dared I offer to fire a gun on that
side of the island where they used to appear,
lest, taking the alarm, the savages might return
with many hundred canoes, and then God
knows in what manner I should have made
my end. Thus was I a year or more before I
saw any of these devouring cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident,
which demands attention. for a while eluded
the force of my thoughts, in revenging myself
on those Heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my wood-
en calendar) the wind blew exceeding hard,
accompanied with abundance of lightening and
thunder all day, and succeeded by a very stor-
my night. The seeming anger of the heavens.
made me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst
I was seriously pondering upon it, I was sud-
denly alarmed with the noise of a gun, which I
conjectured was fired upon the ocean. Such an
unusual surprise made me start up in a minute,
when, with my ladder ascending the moun-
tain as before, that very moment a flash of fire
presaged the report of another gun, which I
presently heard, and found it was from that
part of the sea where the current drove me a-
way. I could not but then think, that this must
be a ship in distress, and that these were the
melancholy signals for a speedy deliverance.
Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this occa-
sion ; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. However,
I brought together all the dry wood that was
at hand, and making a pretty large pile, set is
on fire on the hill... I was certain they plainly
perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon
as it began to blaze, and after that several more
from the same quarter. All night long I kept
up my fire; and when the air cleared up, I
perceived something a great way at sea, directly
E., but could not distinguish what it was, even
with my glass, by reason the weather was so
very foggy out at sea. However, keeping my
eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceiving it
not to stir, I presently concluded it must be a
ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was to be
satisfied, that, taking my gun, I went to the S. E.
}. of the island, to the same rocks where I
ad been formerly drove away by the current;
in which time the weather being perfectly
cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived
the wreck of a ship cast away upon those hid-
den rocks I found when I was out with my
boat, and which, by making a kind of an ed-
dy, were the occasion of my preservation.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another's.
ruin; for undoubtedly this ship had been driv-
en on them in the night, the wind blowing
strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived the is—
land, as I now guessed they had not, certainly,
instead of having fired their guns for help,
they would rather have ventured in their boat,
and saved themselves that way. I then thought, .
that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing my
fire, and were cast away in the attempt; for
I perceived no boat in the ship. But then I
again imagined, that, perhaps, they had another
vessel in company, which, upon signal, saved
their lives, and took the boat up ; or that the
boat might be driven into the main ocean,
where these poor creatures might be in the
most miserable condition. But as all these con-
jectures were very uncertain, I could do no
more than commiserate their distress, and thank
God for delivering me, in particular, when so
many perished in the raging ocean.
When I considered seriously every thing
concerning this wreck, and could perceive no
room to suppose any of them saved, I cannot
explain by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt upon this sight, often
breaking out in this manner: O that there had
been but two or three, nay even one person
saved, that we might have lived together, con-
versed with, and comforted one another! And
so much were my desires moved, that when
I repeated these words : « O that there had
» been but one o' my hands would so clinch
together, and my fingers press the palms of my
hands so close, that, had any soft thing been
between, it would have crushed it involunta-
rily, while my teeth would strike together, and
set against each other so strong, that it required
some time for me to part them. -
Till the last year of my being on this island,
I never knew whether or not any had been
saved out of this ship. I had the affliction, some
time after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which
was next the shipwreck; there was nothing on
him but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt;
but no particular mark to guess what nation he
was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight,
and a tobacco-pipe, the last of which I prefered
much more than I did the first. And now
the calmness of the sea tempted me to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not only to get
something necessary out of the ship, but, per-
haps, some living creature might be on board,
whose life I might preserve. This had such an
influence upon my mind, that immediately I
went home, and prepared everything necessary
for the voyage, carrying on board my boat pro-
visions of all sorts, with a good quantity of rum,
fresh water, and a compass: so putting off, I
paddled the eanoe along the shore, till I came
at last to the north-east part of the island, from
whence I was to launch into the ocean; but
here the currents ran so violently, and appear-
ed so terrible, that my heart began to fail me;
foreseeing, that if I was driven into any of these
currents, I might be carried not only out of the
reach or sight of the island, but even inevitably
lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I
gave over my enterprise, sailing to a little creek
on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat myself
down on a rising hill, very pensive and thought-
ful. I then perceived that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, which made it imprac-
ticable for me to go out for so many hours. To
be more certain how the sets of the tides or cur-
rents lay when the flood came in, I ascended a
higher piece of ground, which overlooked the
sea both ways; and here I found, that as the
current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood
set in close by the shore of the north side; and
all that I had to do, was to keep to the north,
of the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe,
covered with my watch-coat instead of a blan-
ket, the heavens being my tester. I set out with
the first of the tide full north, till I felt the bene-
fit of the current, which carried me al a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as
before, as to take from me all government of
my canoe; so that in two hours time I came
up to the wreck, which appeared to me a most
melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish
vessel by its building, stuck fast between two
rocks; her stern and quarter beaten to pieces
by the sea; her mainmast and foremast were
brought off by the board; that is, broken short
off. As I approached nearer, I perceived a dog
on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and
cried; and no sooner did I call him, but the
poor creature jumped into the sea, out of which
I took him up, almost famished with hunger
and thirst ; so that when I gave him a cake of
bread, no ravenous wolf could devour it more.
greedily ; and he drank to that degree of fresh
water, that he would have burst himself, had. I
suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship, were:
two men drowned in the cook-room or fore-
castle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I
very probably supposed, that when the vessel
struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men,
not being able to bear it, were smothered by
the constant rushing in of the waves. There
were several casks of liquor; whether wine or
brandy I could not be positive, which lay in
the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by
the ebbing out of the water, yet were too large
for me to pretend to meddle with : likewise, I.
perceived several chests, which I supposed to
belong to the seamen, two of which I got into
my boat, without examining what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the
fore part broken off, I should have made a very
prosperous voyage; since, by what I after found
in these two chests, I could not otherwise con-
clude, but that the ship must have had abun-
dance of wealth on board; nay, if I must guess
by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la
Plata, in the southern part of America, beyond
116 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
co, and so perhaps to Spain. What became of
the rest of her sailors, I could not certainly tell ;
and all her riches signified nothing at that time
to any body.
Searching farther, I found a cask, containing
about twenty gallons full of liquor, which,
with some labour, I got into my boat; in a ca-
bin were several muskets, which I let remain
there, but took away with me a great powder-
horn, with about four pounds of powder in it.
I took also a fire-shovel and tongs, two brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a
gridiron ; all which were extremely neces-
sary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs.
And so with this cargo, accompanied with my
dog, I came away, the tide serving for that pur-
pose ; and the same evening, about an hour
within night, I attained the island, after the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my wearied limbs in
the boat, resolving the next morning to har-
bour what I had gotten in my new-found sub-
terraneous grotto , and not carry my cargo
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed
myself, and got all my effects on shore, I next
proceeded to examine the particulars; and so
tapping the cask, I found the liquor to be a kind
of a rum, but not like what we had at the Bra-
zils, nor indeed near so good. At the opening
of the chests, several things appeared very use-
ful to me; for instance, I found in one a very
fine case of bottles, containing the finest and
best sorts of cordial waters; each bottle held
about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I
found also iwo pots full of the choicest sweet-
meats, and two more which the water had ut-
ierly spoiled. There were likewise several good
shirts, exceeding welcome to me, and about
one dozen and a half of white linen handker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of
which were absolutely necessary for wiping my
face on a hot day; and, in the till, I found three
bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred
in all, in one of which, decently wrapt up in a
piece of paper, were six doubloons of gold, and
some small bars and wedges of the same metal,
which I believe might weigh near a pound.
In the other chest, which I guessed to belong
to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstan-
ces that attended it, I only found some clothes
of very little value, except about two pounds of
fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, as I
believe, for charging their fowling-pieces on
any occasion; so that, on the whole, I had no
great advantage by this voyage. The money
was indeed as mere dirt to me, useless and un-
profitable, all which I would have freely part-
ed with for two or three pair of English shoes
and stockings, things that for many years I had
not worn, except lately those which I had taken
off the feet of those unfortunate men I had found
drowned in the wreck, yet not so good as En-
glish shoes, either for ease or service. I also
found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces
of eight in rials, but no gold; so concluded that
what I took from the first belonged to an of-
ficer, the latter appearing to have a much in-
ferior person for its owner. However, as
despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lug-
ged it to my cave, laying it up securely, as I did
the rest of my cargo; and after I had done all
this, I returned back to my boat, rowing or
paddling her along till I came to my old har-
bour, where I carefully laid her up, and so
made the best of my way to my castle. When
I arrived there, every thing seemed safe and
quiet ; so that now my only business was to
repose myself after my wonted manner, and
take care of my domestic affairs. But though I
might have lived very easy, as wanting for no-
thing absolutely needful, yet still I was more
vigilant than usual upon account of the savages,
never going much abroad; or, if I did, it was
to the east part of the island, where I was well
assured that the savages never came, and where
I might not be troubled to carry that heavyload.
of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged
to do if I went the other way. -
Two years did I live in this anxious condi-
tion, in all which time, contrary to my former
resolutions, my head was filled with nothing
but projects and designs, how I might escape
from this island; and so much were my wan-
dering thoughts bent on a rambling disposition,
that, had I had the same boat that I went from
**
$allee in, I should have ventured once more to
the uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot however but consider myself as one
of the unhappy persons, who make themselves
wretched by their dissatisfaction with the sta-
tions which God has placed them in; for, not to
take a review of my primitive condition, and
my father's excellent advice (the going contra-
ry to which was, as I may say, my original sin),
the following mistakes of the same nature cer-
tainly had been the means of my present un-
happy station. What business had I to leave a
settled fortune, and well-stocked plantation, im-
proving and increasing, where, by this time, I
might have been worth a hundred thousand
moidores, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to
fetch negroes, when time and patience would
have so much enlarged my stock at home, as to
be able to employ those whose more immediate
business it was to fetch them home, even to my
own door 7
But as this is commonly the fate of young
- heads, so a serious reflection upon the folly of
it ordinarily attends, the exercise of future
years, when the dear bought experience of time
teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me;
but notwithstanding, the thoughts of my delive-
rance ran so strongly in my mind, that it seem-
ed to check all the dictates of reason and phi-
losophy. And now to usher in my kind reader
with great pleasure to the remaining part of my
relation, I flatter myself it will not be taken a-
miss, to give him an account of my first con-
ceptions of the manner of escaping, and upon
what foundation I laid my foolish schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my late
`--
voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up and se–
cured, as usual, and my condition the same as
before, except being richer, though I had as
little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru
had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came
anong them : one night in March, being the
rainy season, in the four and twentieth year of
my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well in
health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon
uneasiness, either of body or mind; yet not-
withstanding, I could not compose myself to
sleep all the night long. All this tedious while,
it is impossible to express what innumerable
thoughts came into my head. I traced quite
over the whole history of my life in miniature,
from my utmost remembrance of things till I
came to the island ; and then proceeded to
examine every action and passage that had oc-
curred since I had taken possession of my king-
dom. In my reflections upon the latter, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in
the beginning of my reign, to this of anxiety,
fear, and concern, since I had discovered the
print of a foot in the sand, that while I conti-
nuéd without apprehension, I was incapable of
feeling the dread and terror I now suffered.
How thankful rather ought I to have been for
the knowledge of my danger, since the greatest
happiness one can be possessed of, is to have
sufficient time to provide against it ! How stu-
pendous is the goodness of Providence, which
sets such narrow bounds to the sight and know-
ledge of human nature, that while men walk
in the midst of so many dangers, they are kept
serene and calm, by having the events of things
hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing of
those many dangers that surround them, till
perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away.
VVhen I came more particularly to consi-
der of the real danger I had for so many years
escaped; how I had walked about in the great-
est security and tranquillity, at a time, perhaps,
when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a
great tree, or the common approach of night,
had interposed between me and the destructive
hands of the cannibals, who would devour me
with as good an appetite as I would a pigeon
or curlieu ; surely all this, I say, could not but
make me sincerely thankful to my great Pre-
server, whose singular protection I acknow-
ledged with the greatest }. and without
which I must inevitably have fallen into the
cruel hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the
clearest manner, according to my weak under-
standing, I next proceeded to consider the
wretched nature of these destroying savages, by
seeming, though with great reverence, to in-
quire, why God should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity, even to brutality itself,
as to devour its own kind. But as this was ra-
ther matter of abstruse speculation, and as my
miserable situation made me think mine the
most uncomfortable situation in the world, I
then began rather to inquire what part of the
world these wretches lived in; how far off the
coast was from whence they came ; why they
ventured over so far from home ; what kind
of boats conveyed them hither; and why I
could not order myself and my business so, that
I might be as able to attain their country as
they were to come to my kingdom? -
But then, thought I, how shall I manage my-
self when I come thither? what will become
of me if I fall into the hands of the savages? or
how shall I escape from them, if they make an
attempt upon me? and supposing I should not
fall into their power, what shall I do for pro-
vision, or which way shall I bend my course?
These counter-thoughts threw me into the
greatest horror and confusion imaginable ;
but then I still looked upon my present con-
dition to be the most miserable that possibly
could be, and that nothing could be worse, ex-
cept death. For (thought I) could I but attain
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet
with some relief, or coast it along, as I did with
my boy Xury on the African shore, till I came
to some inhabited country, where I might meet
with some relief, or fall in with some Christian
ship that might take me in ; and if I failed,
why then I could but meet with death, which
should put an end to all my miseries. These
thoughts, I must confess, were the fruit of a
distempered mind, an impatient temper, made
desperate, as it were, by a long continuance of
the troubles and disappointments I had met
with in the wreck, . I hoped to have
found some living person to speak to, by whom
I might have known in what place I was, and
of the probable means of my deliverance. Thus,
while my thoughts were agitated, my resigna-
tion to the will of heaven was entirely suspend-
ed; so that I had no power to fix my mind to
any thing, but to the project of a voyage to the
main land. And indeed so much was I inflam-
edupon this account, that it set my blood into a
ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I
had been in a fever, till nature being, as it were,
fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts
of it, made me submit myself to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did
not dream of what I was so intent upon; but,
instead of it, my mind roved on a quite diffe-
rent thing, altogether foreign. I dreamed, that
as I was issuing from my castle one morning,
as customary, I perceived upon the shore two
canoes with eleven savages coming to land,
who had brought with them another Indian,
whom they designed to make a sacrifice of, in
order to devour; but just as they were going to
give the fatal blow, methought the poor design-
ed victim jumped away, and ran directly into
my little thick grove before my fortification to
abscond from his enemies; when perceiving that
the others did not follow him that way I ap-
peared to him; that he humbly kneeled down
before me, seeming to pray for my assistance;
upon which I shewed him my ladder, made
him ascend, carried him to my cave, and he be-
came my servant; and when I had gotten this
man, I said to myself: Now surely I may have
some hopes to attain the main land; for this
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 123
do, and where I must go for provisions; what
places to shun, where to venture to, and what
to escape. But when I awoke, and found all
these inexpressible impressions of joy entirely
vanished, I fell into the greatest dejection of spi.
rit imaginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that
one sure way of escaping was to get a savage;
that after I had ventured my life to deliver him
from the bloody jaws of his devourers, the
F 2
natural sense he might have of such a preserva-
tion, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude
and most sincere affection. But then this ob-
jection reasonably interposed : How can I ef-
fect this (thought I) without I attack a whole
caravan of then, and kill them all? why should
I proceed on such a desperate attempt, which
my scruples before had suggested to be unlaw-
ful ? and indeed my heart trembled at the
thoughts of so much blood, though it were a
means to procure my deliverance, "Tis true, I
might reasonably enough suppose these men to
be real enemies to my life, men who would de-
vour me, was it in their power; so that it was
self-preservation in the highest degree to free
myself, by attacking them in my own defence,
as lawfully as if they were actually assaulting
me. Though all these things, I say, seemed to
me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I just
said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding
human blood struck such a terror into my soul,
that it was a long time before I could recon-
cile myself to it.
But how far will the ardency of desire prompt
us on 1 For, notwithstanding the many disputes
and perplexities I had with myself, I at length
resolved, right or wrong, to get one of these
savages into my hands, cost what it would, or
even though I should lose my life in the at-
tempt. . Inspired with this firm resolution, I
set all my wits to work, to find out what me-
thods I should take to answer my design : this
indeed was so difficult a task, that I could not
pitch upon any probable means to execute it
I, therefore, resolved continually to be in a vi-
gilant posture to perceive when the savages
came on shore, and to leave the rest to the e-
vent, let the opportunities offer as they would.
Such were my fixed resolutions; and accord-
ingly I set myself upon the scout, as often as I
could, till such'time as I was heartily tired of it.
I waited for above a year and a half, the great-
est part of which time I went out to the west
and south-west corner of the island, almost eve-
ry day, to look for canoes; but none appeared.
This was a very great discouragement; yet,
though I was very much concerned, the edge
of my desire was as keen as ever, and the longer
it seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I
for it. In a word, I never before was so care-
ful to shun the loathing sight of these savages,
as I was now eager to be with them : and I
thought myself sufficiently able to manage one,
even two or three savages if I had them, so as to
make them my entire slaves to do whatsoever I
should direct them, and prevent their being
able at any time to do me a mischief. Many
times did I use to please myself with these
thoughts with long and ardent expectations;
but nothing presenting itself, all my deep pro-
jected schemes, and numerous fancies vanished
away, as though, while Iretained such thoughts,
the decree of Providence was such, that no sa-
vages were to come near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was
seriously musing of sundry other ways how I
should attain my end, one morning early I was
very much surprised by seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together on my side the is-
land, and the savages that belonged to them all
landed, and out of my sight. Such a number of
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125
F
ing so many boats, each of which would con-
tain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell
what to think of it, or how to order my mea-
sures to attack twenty or thirty men single
handed : upon which, much dispirited and
p. , I lay still in my castle ; which ,
owever, I put in a proper posture for an at-
tack; and, fº, formerly provided all that
was necessary, was soon ready to enter upon
an engagement, should they attempt it. Having
waited for some time, my impatient temper
would let me bear it no longer; I set my guns
at the foot of my ladder, and, as usual, ascend-
ed up to the top of the hill at two stages, stand-
ing, however, in such a manner, that my head
did not appear above the hill, so that they could
not easily perceive me : and here, by the as-
sistance of my perspective glass, I observed no
less than thirty in number around a fire, feast-
ing upon what meat they had dressed ; how
they cooked it, or what it was, I could not then
perfectly tell ; but they were all dancing and
capering about the flames, using many frightful
and barbarous gestures.
But while with a curious eye I was behold-
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me
when I perceived them drag two miserable crea:
tures from the boats to act afresh the dreadful
tragedy, as I supposed they had done before.
It was not long before one of them fell upon
the ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with
a club or wooden sword, for that was their
manner; while two or three others went imme-
diately to work, cutting him open fortheir cook-
ery, and then fell to roast and devour him as they
had done the former; while the last unhappy
captive was left by himself till such time as they
were ready for him. The poor creature looked
round him with a wishful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death; yet, seeing himself a little at
liberty, nature, that very moment, as it were,
inspired him with hopes of life : he started a-
way from them, and ran, with incredible swift-
ness, along the sands, directly to that part of
the coast where my ancient and venerable castle
stood. . -
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully af-
frighted upon this occasion, when, as I thought,
they pursued him in a whole body, all running
towards my palace. Andnow, indeed, I expect-
ed, that part of my dream was going to be ful-
filled, and that he would certainly fly to my
grove for protection; but, for the rest of my
dream, I could depend nothing on it, that
the savages would pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, my spirits beginning to
recover, I still kept upon my guard; and inów
plainly perceived, there were but three men
out of the number that pursued him. I was
infinitely pleased to see with what swiftness the
poor creature ran from his pursuers, gaining so
much ground of them, that I plainly perceived,
could he thus hold it for half an hour, there
was not the least doubt but he would save his
life from the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a
creek, that very same which I sailed into with
all my effects from the wreck of the ship, on
the steep banks of which I very much feared
the poor victim would be taken, if he could not
swim for his escape: but soon was I out of pain
for him, when I perceived he made nothing of
F 4
it, though at full tide, but, with an intrepid cou-
rage, spurred on by the sense of danger, he
plunged into the flood, swimming over in about
thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the
same incredible strength and swiftness as be-
fore. When the three pursuers came to the
creek, one of them, who I perceived could not
swim (happily for his part), returned back to
his company, while the others, with equal cou-
rage, but much less swiftness, attained the other
side, as though they were resolved never tº
give over their pursuit.” And now, or never, I
thought, was the time for me to procure me a
servant, companion, or assistant; and that I
was decreed by Providence to be the instru-
ment that should save this poor creature's life.
I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two guns,
which, I said before, were at the bottom of
them : and, getting up again with the same
haste towards the hill, I made nearer the sea.
In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I
interposed between the pursuers and pursued,
hallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing
to look back, was, no doubt, at first, as much
terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned to him
with my hand to come back, in the mean
time advancing towards the pursuers, and rush-
ing on the foremost, I knocked him down with
the stock of my piece, and laid him flat on the
ground. I was very unwilling to fire, lest the
rest should hear, though, at that distance, I
questioned whether they could or no; and, be-
ing out of sight of the smoke, they could not
easily have known what to make of it. The
other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as if
he had been amazed ; when, advancing to-
wards him, I could perceive him take his bow
from his back, and, fixing an arrow to it, was
preparing to shoot at me, and, without dispute,
might have lodged the arrow in my breast; but,
in this absolutely necessary case of self-preser-
vation, I immediately fired at him, and shot
him dead, just as his hand was going to draw
the fatal string. All this while, the savage who
had fled before stood still, and had the satisfac-
tion to see his enemies killed, as he thought,
who designed to take away his life: so affright-
ed was he with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood, as it were, like Lot's wife, fixed
and immoveable, without either sense or mo-
tion. This obliged me to halloo to him again,
making the plainest signs I could to him to
draw nearer. I perceived he understood these
tokens by his approaching to me a little way,
when, as if afraid I should kill him too, he
stopped again. Several times did he advance,
and as often stop in this manner, till, coming
more to my view, I perceived him trembling,
as if he was to undergo the same fate. Upon
which I looked upon him with a smiling coun-
tenance, and still beckoning to him; at length
he came close to me, and kneeled down, kiss-
ed the ground, laid his head upon it, and tak-
ing me by the foot, set it upon his head : and
this, as I understood afterwards, was a token of
swearing to be my slave for ever, I took him
up, and, making much of him, encouraged
him in the best manner'I could. But my work
was not yet finished; for I perceived the sa-
vage whom I knocked down, was not killed,
but stunned with the blow, and began to come
F
to himself. Upon which I pointed to my new
servant, and shewing him that his enemy was
not yet expired, he spoke some words to me,
but which I could not understand; yet being
the first sound of a man's voice I had heard for
above twenty-five years, they were very pleas-
ing to me. But there was no time for reflection
now, the wounded savage recovering himself
so far as to sit upon the ground, which made
my poor prisoner as much afraid as before; to
put him out of which fear, I presented my o-
ther gun at the man, with an intent to shoot
him ; but my savage, for so I must now call
him, prevented my firing, by making a motion
to me, to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side. No sooner did I
grant his request, but away he runs to his ene-
my, and at one blow cut off his head as dexte-
rously as the most accomplished executioner
in Germany could have done : for it seems
these creatures make use of wooden swords
made of hard wood, which will bear edge e-
nough to cut off heads and arms at one blow.
When this valorous exploit was done, he came
to me laughing, as a token of triumph, deliver-
ed me my sword again, with abundance of sur-
prising gestures, laying it along, with the bleed-
ing and ghastly head of the Indian at my feet.
The greatest astonishment that my new ser-
vant conceived, was the manner of killing the
savage at such a distance without a bow and
arrow ; and such was his longing desire to
know it, that he first pointed to the dead car-
cass, and then made signs to me to grant him
leave to go to it. Upon which I bid him go,
and, as well as I could, made him sensible I
granted his request. But when he came there,
how wonderfully was he struck with amaze-
ment | First he turned him on one side, then
on another, wondering he could perceive no
quantity of blood, he bleeding inwardly : and
after sufficiently admiring the wound the bul-
let had made in his breast, he took up his bow
and arrows, and came back again; upon which
I turned to go away, making many signs to him
to follow, lest the rest missing their compa-
mions, might come in pursuit of him. And this
I found he understood very well by his mak-
ing me understand that his design was to bury
them ; that they might not be seen if it hap-
pened; and which by signs again I made him
sensible Ivery much approved of Immediate-
ly he fell to work, and never was grave-digger
more dexterous in the world than he was; for
in an instant, as I might say, he scraped a large
hole in the sands with his hands, sufficient to
bury the first in ; thither he dragged him, and
without any ceremony he covered him over
in hike manner he served the other : so that I
am sure no undertaker could be more expert
in his business; for all this was done in less
than a quarter of an hour. I then called him
away, and instead of carrying him directly to
my castle at first, I conveyed him to my cave
on the farther part of the island : and so my
dream was not fulfilled in that particular, that
my grove should prove an asylum or sanctuary
to him.’ -
Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, un-
doubtedly must this poor creature be, supported
chiefly by that vivacity of spirit, and uncom-
mon transports of joy that lº ºnne
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch,
of raisins to eat, and water to drink, on which
he fed very cheerfully to his exceeding satisfac-
tion. I then made him a convenient bed, with
a bundle of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it
(a bed which I used myself sometimes), and
then pointing to it, made signs for him to lie
down to sleep, upon which the poor creature
went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very comely handsome
young fellow , extremely well made, with
straight long limbs, not too large, tall and well
shaped, and, as near as I could reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. His countenance had
nothing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort
of majesty in his face; and yet, especially when
he smiled, he had all the sweetness and soft-
ness of an European. His hair was not curled
like wool, as that of many of the blacks is, but
long and black, with the most beautiful, yet care.
less, tresses spreading over his shoulders. He
had a very high and large forehead, with a great
vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes.
His skin was not so tawny as the Virginians',
Brazilians', or other Americans', but rather of
a bright dun olive colour, that had something
agreeable in it, though not very easy to give a
description of His face was round and plump,
with a small nose, very different from the flat-
ness of the negroes', a pretty small mouth, thin
lips, fine teeth, very well set, and while as the
driven snow. In a word, such handsome fea-
tures, and exact symmetry in every part, made
me consider, that I had saved the life of an In-
dian prince, no less graceful and accomplished
than the great Oronoko, whose memorable be-
haviour and unhappy contingencies of life have
charmed the world, both to an admiration of
his person, and compassion for his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all
my happiness centered in this, that I had now
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133
e deserved, I was resolved to prove a kind
master and lasting friend. He had not, I think,
slept above an hour, when he awakened again,
and while I was milking my goats hard by, out
he runs from the cave towards me in my inclo-
sure, and laying himself down on the ground
in the lowest prostration, made all the antic ges-
tures imaginable, to express his thankfulness to
me for oeing his deliverer. I confess, though
the manner of his behaviour seemed to be lu-
dicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet I was
very much moved at his affection, so that my
heart melted within me, fearing he might die
away in excess of joy, like reprieved malefac-
tors; especially as I was incapable either to
let him blood, or administer physic. It were
to be wished, that Christians would take ex-
ample by this Heathen, to have a lasting re-
membrance of the benefits and deliverances
they have received by the kind mediation and
powerful interposition of their benefactors and
deliverers ; and it would likewise be happy
for mankind, were there no occasion to blame
many, who, instead of thankfully acknowledg-
ing favours and benefits, rather abuse and con-
temn those who have been the instruments to
save them from destruction. - -
But, leaving these just reflections, I return to
the object that occasioned them; for my man,
to conclude the last ceremony of obedience ,
*
laid down his head again on the ground close
to my foot, and set my other foot upon
it, as he had done before, making all the
signs of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me understand he would
serve me as long as his life endured. As I un-
derstood him in many things, I made him sen-
sible I was very well pleased with him ; and,
in a little time, I began to speak to him, and
learn him how to talk to me again. In the
first place, I made him understand his name
was to be Friday, because it was upon that day
I saved his life : then I taught him to say Mas-
ter, which I made him sensible was to be my
name. I likewise taught him to say Yes and
No, and to know what they meant. I gave
him some milk in an earthen pot, making him
view me while I drank it before him, and soak-
ed my bread in it; I gave him a cake, and caus-
ed him to soak it likewise, to which he readily
consented, making signs of the greatest satisfac-
tion imaginable. * , , , - ?
All that night did I keep him there; but no
sooner did the morning-light appear, when H
ordered him to arise, and come along with me,
with certain tokens that I would give him some
clothes like mine, at which he seemed very
glad, being stark naked, without the least co-
vering whatever. As we passed by the place
where the two men had been interred, my man
pointed directly to their graves, shewing me the
marks that he had made to find them again,
giving me to understand by signs, that we
should dig them up, and devour them. At this
I appeared extremely displeased, expressed my
utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the
:
apprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand
to come away, which he did with the great-
est reverence and submission. After this I
conducted him to the top of the hill to view if
the rest of the savages were yet remaining there;
but when I looked through my perspective
glass, I could see no appearance of them, nor
of their canoes; so that it was very evident
they never minded their deceased companions
whom we had slain; which if they had, they
would surely have searched for, or left one boat
behind for them to follow, after they returned
from their pursuit.
Curiosity and a desire of satisfaction ani-
mating me with courage to see this scene of
barbarity, I took my man Friday with me, put-
ting a sword into his hand, with the bow and
arrows at his back, which I perceived he could
use very dexterously, causing him to carry one
gun for me, and bearing two myself; and thus
equipped against all attacks, away we marched
directly to the place of their bloody entertain-
ment. But when I came there, I was struck
with the utmost horror at so dreadful a spec-
tacle, whilst Friday was no way concerned a-
bout it, being no doubt in his turn one of these
devourers. Here lay several human bones,
there several pieces of mangled flesh, halfeaten,
mangled and scorched, whilst streams of blood
ran promiscuously as waters from a fountain.
As I was musing on this dreadful sight, Friday
took all the pains he could, by particular signs,
to make me understand, that they had brought
over four prisoners to feast upon , three of
whom they had eaten up, and that he was the
fourth, pointing to himself: that there having
been a bloody battle between them and his
great king, in the just defence of whom he was
taken prisoner, with many others; all of these
were carried off to different places, to be de-
voured by their conquerors; and that it was
his good fortune to be brought hither by these
wretches for the same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I
caused Friday to gather those horrid remains,
and lay them together upon a heap, which I
ordered to be set on fire, and burnt them to
ashes : my man, however, still retained the na-
ture of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach
after some of the flesh : but such an extreme
abhorrence did I express at the least appear-
ance of it, that he durst not but conceal it ; for
I made him very sensible, that if he offered
any such thing, I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me
to my castle, and gave him a pair of linen
drawers, which I had taken out of the poor
gunner's chest before mentioned, and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well.
In the next place, I made him a jerkin of goal-
skin, such as my skill was able to manage, and
indeed I thought myself then a tolerable good
tailor. I gave him also a cap, which I made
of a hare's skin, very convenient and fashion-
able. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my
man was no less proud of his habit, than I was
in seeing him in it. Indeed he went very awk-
wardly at first, the drawers being too heavy
on his thighs, not used to bear any weight, and
the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders,
and the inside of his arms; but by a little eas-
ing where he complained they hurt him, and
by using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge
him ; and that I might do well by him, and
yet be perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for
him in the vacant place between my two for-
tifications, in the inside of the last, and the out-
side of the first : and as there was an entrance
, or door into my cave, I made a formal framed
door-case, and a door to open on the inside;
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my
ladders too, so that were my man to prove
treacherous, there could be no way to come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall with-
out making so much noise in getting over, that
it must needs waken me; for my first wall had
now a complete roof over it of long poles,
spreading over my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the mountain, which was again laid
across with smaller sticks instead of laths, and
thatched over a great thickness with rice-
straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at
the hole of the place, left on purpose to go in
or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of a
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on
the outside, would not have opened at all, but
have fallen down, and made a great moise; and
as to my weapons, every night I took them all
to my bed-side.
But there was no occasion for this precau-
tion; for surely never master had a more sin-
cere, faithful, and loving servant than Friday
proved to me. Without passion, sullenness,
or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his
affections were as much tied to me, as those of
a child to his parents; and I might venture to
say, he would have sacrificed his life for, the
saving of mine upon any occasion whatsoever.
And indeed the many testimonies he gave me
of this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no
occasion to use these precautions. And here
I could not but reflect, with great wonder,
that however it has pleased the Almighty in
his providence, and in the government of the
creation, to take from so great a part of the
world of his creatures, the noblest uses to
which their faculties, and the powers of their
souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed
upon them the same reason, affections, senti-
ments of kindness, and obligations, passions of
resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capa-
cities of doing and receiving good that he has
given us; and that when he is graciously pleas-
ed to offer them occasions of exerting these,
they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply
them to the proper uses for which they were
bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts
would make me melancholy, especially when
I considered how mean a use we make of all
these, even though we have these powers en-
lightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, as an addition to
our understanding; and why it has pleased
the heavenly wisdom to conceal the like saving
knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who would certainly make a much better use
of it than generally mankind do at this time.
These reflections would sometimes lead me so
far as to invade the sovereignty of Providence,
and, as it were, arraign the justice of such an
arbitrary disposition of things, that should ob-
scure that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But
I closed it up, checking my thoughts with this
conclusion: first, that we were ignorant of
that right and law by which these should be
condemned; but that as the Almighty was ne-
cessarily, and by the nature of his essence,
infinitely just and holy, so it could not be other-
wise, but that if these creatures were all sen-
tenced to absence from himself, it was on ac-
count of sinning against that light, which, as
the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would ac-
knowledge to be just, though the first founda–
tion was not discovered to us: and, secondly,
that still as we were like the clay in the hand of
the potter, no vessel could thus say to him :
Why hast thou fashioned me after this manner?
I had not been above two or three days re-
turned to my castle, but my chief design was,
how I should bring Friday off from his horrid
way of feeding; and, to take from him that in-
human relish he, by nature, had been accus-
tomed to, I thought it my duty to let him taste
other flesh, which might the rather tempt him
to the same abhorrence I so often expressed
against their accursed way of living. Upon
which, one morning I took him out with me,
with an intention to kill a kid out of the flock,
and bring it home, and dress it. As I was go-
ing, I perceived a she-goat lying down in the
shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Im-
mediately I catched hold of my man Friday,
and bidding him stand still, and not stir, I pre-
sented my piece, and shot one of the kids. My
poor servant, who had at a distance perceived
me kill his adversary, and yet did not know
by what means, or how it was done, stood
trembling and surprised, and looked so amazed,
that I thought he would have sunk into the
earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at, nor
behold I had killed it, but ripped up his waist-
coat to see if he was not wounded, thinking
my resolution was to kill him ; for coming to
me, he fell on his knees, earnestly pronouncing
many º which I did not understand the
meaning of; which at length I perceived was,
that I would not take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to see him in
that condition, where nature is upon the se–
verest trial, when the immediate hand of death
is ready to put for ever a period to this mortal
life : and indeed so much compassion had I
to this creature, that it was with difficulty I re-
frained from tears. But, however, as another
sort of countenance was necessary, and to con-
vince him that I would do him no harm, I took
him, smiling, by the hand, then laughed at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain,
made signs to him to fetch it, which accord-
ingly he did. No less curious was he in view-
ing how the creature was killed, than he had
been before in beholding the Indian; which
while he was admiring at, I charged my gun
again, and presently perceived a great fowl
like a hawk, perching upon a tree within shot;
and, therefore, to let Friday understand what
I was going to do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a
parrot. I made him understand that I would
shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I fired,
and bade him look, when immediately he saw
the parrot fall down. Again he stood like one
amazed, notwithstanding all I had said to him:
and the more confounded he was, because he
did not perceive me put anything into my gun.
Undoubtedly a thing so utterly strange, carry-
ing death along with it, far or near, either to
man or beast, must certainly create the greatest
astonishment to one who never had heard of
such a thing in his whole life : and really his
amazement continued so long, that, had I al-
lowed it, he would have prostrated himself be-
fore me and my gun, with the greatest worship
and adoration. As for the gun in particular,
he would not so much as suffer his fingers to
touch it for several days after, but j COme
and communicate his thoughts to it, and talk
to it, as if the senseless piece had understood
and answered him : all this I could perceive
him do when he thought my back was turn-
ed, the chief intent of which was to desire it
not to kill him, as I afterwards came to under-
stand. -
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor
hinder him from those comical gestures he
used on such occasions; but when his astonish-
ment was a little over, I made tokens to him to
run and fetch the parrot that I had shot;
which he accordingly did, staying some time
longer than usual, by reason the bird, not be-
ing quite dead, had fluttered some way farther
from the place where it fell. In the mean
time, as he was looking for it, I took the ad-
vantage of charging my gun again, that so I
might be ready for any other mark that offered;
but nothing more occurred at that time. So I
brought home the kid, and the same evening
took off the skin, and divided the carcass as
well as I could. Part of this flesh I stewed and
boiled in a pot I had for this purpose. An
then spreading my table, I sat down, giving
my man some of it to eat, who was wonder-
fully pleased, and seemed to like it very well ;
but what was most surprising to him was to see
me eat salt with it : upon which he made me
to understand, that the salt was very bad for
me, when putting a little into his mouth, he
seemed to nauseate it in such a manner as to
spit and sputter at it, and then washed his
mouth with fresh water; but to shew him how
contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned
to spit and sputter as much for the want of it
as he had done at it: yet all this proved of no
signification to Friday; and it was a long while
before he could endure salt in his meat or
broth, and even then but a very small quantity.
Thus, having fed him sufficiently with boiled
meat and broth at that time, the next day I
was resolved to feast him with a roasted piece
of the kid. And having no spit to fasten it, nor
jack to turn it, I made use of that common ar-
tifice which many of the people of England
have, that is, to set two poles upon each side of
the fire, and one across on the top, hanging the
meat thereon with a string, and so turning
round continually, roast it in the same manner
as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly roast-
ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great
admiration in my man Friday, being quite a-
nother way than that to which the savages were
accustomed. But when he came to taste the
sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he ex-
pressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand
different ways. And as I could not but under-
stand his meaning, you may be sure I was as
wonderfully pleased, especially when he made
it also very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It is now high time I should set my servant
to work; so, next day, I put him to beat out
some corn, and sift it in the same manner as
I had done before. And really the fellow was
very quick and handy in the execution of any
thing I ordered him to go about. I made him
understand that it was to make bread for us
to eat, and afterwards let him see me bake it.
In short, he did every thing as I ordered him
in a little time, as well as I could perform it
myself. - -
But now considering that I had two mouths
to feed instead of one, it was necessary that I
should provide more ground for my harvest,
and sow, a larger quantity of corn than I
commonly used to do; upon which I marked
out a larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the
same manner as I had done before ; in the ex-
ecution of which I must give Friday this good
word, that no man could work more hardy,
or with better will than he did : and when I
made him sensible that it was for bread to
serve him as well as me, he then very passion-
ately made me understand, that he thought I
had much more labour on his account, than I
had for myself; and that no pains or diligence
should be wanting in him, if I would but di-
rect him in those works wherein he might
proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island ; for,
after some time, Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understand the names of those things
which I was wont to call for, and the places,
where I used to send him. So that my long
silent tongue, which had been useless so many
years, except in an exclamatory manner, either
for deliverance or blessings, now began to be
occupied in teaching, and talking to my man
Friday; for indeed I had such a singular sa-
tisfaction in the fellow himself, so innocent did
his simple and unfeigned honesty appear more
and more to me every day, that I really began
entirely to love him; and for his part, I believe
there was no love lost, and that his nature had
been more charmed with my exceeding kind-
ness, and his affections more placed upon me,
than any other object whatsoever among his
own countrymen. I once had a great mind
to try if he had any hankering inclination to
his own country again : and by this time hav-
ing learned him English so well, that he could
give me tolerable answers to any question
which I demanded, I asked him, whether that
nation to which he belonged, ever conquered
in battle 7 This question made Friday to smile,
and to which he answered, Yes, yes, we always
fight the better; as much as to say, they always
got the better in fight. Upon which we pro-
ceeded in the following discourse : You say,
said I, that you always fight the better; why
then, Friday, how came you to be taken pri-
soner 7
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Master. How, say you, beat if your nation
beat them, how came you to be taken 2 -
Friday, They more many mans than my
nation in the place where me was, they take
one, two, three, and me: my nation much over-
beat them in the yonder place where me no
was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three
great tousand. ~
Master. Then why did not your men re-
cover you from the hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and
me ; they make all go in the canoo : my na-
tion have no canoo that time.
Master. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what
does your nation do with the prisoners they
take 7 Do they carry them away and eat them
as these have done? .
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too,
eat up all. -
Master. To what place do they carry them
to be devoured? - -
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Master. Do they bring them hither ?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over
other place.
Master. And have you been with them here,
Friday? -
Friday. Yes, me been here (pointing to the
north-west of the island, being the side where
they used to land). -
Thus having got what account I could from
my man, I plainly understood, that he had been
as bad as any of the rest of the cannibals, hav-
ing been formerly among the savages who used
to come on shore on the farthest part of the is—
land, upon the same bloody occasions as he
was brought hither for ; and some time after I
carried him to that place whère he pointed to ;
and no sooner did he come there, but he pre-
- G
--
sently knew the ground, signifying to me that
he was once there when they ate up twenty
men, two women, and a young child; but as
he could not explain the number in English,
he did it by so many stones in a row, making
a sign to me to count them.
This passage I have the rather mentioned,
because it led to things more important and
useful for me to know : for after I had this sa-
tisfactory discourse with him, my next ques-
tion was, how far it was from the island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often
lost in the ocean 7 to which he answered, there
was no danger; that no canoes were ever lost;
but that after a little way out to the sea, there
was a strong current, and a wind always one
way in the afternoon. This I thought at first
to be no more than the sets of the tide, of going
out or coming in ; but I afterwards understood
it was occasioned by the great draught and
reflux of the mighty river Oronoko, in the
mouth or gulf of which I imagined my king-
dom lay; and that the land which I perceived
to the W. and N. W. must be the great is-
land Trinidad, on the north of the river. A
thousand questions (if that would satisfy me)
did I ask Friday, about the nature of the coun-
try, the sea, the coast, the inhabitants, and
what nations were the nearest them; to which
questions the poor fellow declared all he
knew, with the greatest openness and utmost
sincerity. When I demanded of him the par-
ticular names of the various nations of his sort
of people, he could only answer me in gene-
ral, that they were called Carabe, Hence it
was I considered that these must be the Carib-
bees, so much taken notice of by our maps, to
be on that part of America, which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oronoko to Guia-
na, and so on to St. Martha. Then Friday pro-
ceeded to tell me, that, up a great way beyond
the moon, as much as to say, beyond the setting
of the moon, which must be W. from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, such
as I was, pointing to my whiskers, and that
they kill much mans. I was not ignorant with
what barbarity the Spaniards treated these crea-
tures; so that I presently concluded it must be
they, whose cruelties had spread throughout
America to be remembered even to succeed-
ing generations.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge,
which the imperfect information of my man
had led me to, was very comfortable to me,
and made me so curious as to ask him, how I
might depart from this island, and get among
those white men 2 He told me : Yes, yes, I
might go in two canoes. In two canoes, thought
I, what does my man mean? Surely he means
one for himself, and another for me; and if
not, how must two canoes hold me without be-
ing joined, or one part of my body being put
in one, and another in the other ? And, in-
deed, it was a long while before I understood
his meaning, which was, that it must be a large
boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with
the waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed
as one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what
may be happy, if people would but endeavour
for their part to make it so. He is not the hap-
piest man that has the most id: but he that
w - 2
is content with what he hath. Before I had
my servant, I thought myself miserable till I
had him ; and now that I enjoyed the happy
benefits of him, I still complained, and begged
a deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently
blessed me. In a word, from this time I en-
tertained some hopes, that one time or other I
might find an opportunity to make my escape
from this island, and that this poor savage might
be a great furtherance thereto.
All the time since my man became so intel-
ligent as to understand and speak to me, Ispar-
ed no pains nor diligence to instruct him, ac-
cording to my poor share of knowledge, in
the principles of religion, and the adoration
that he ought to pay to the True God. One
time, as I very well remember, I asked him
who made him? At first the innocent creature
did not understand what I meant, but rather
thought I asked him who was his father; up-
on which I took another way to make him sen-
sible, by demanding from him an answer to
this question. Friday, said I, who is it that
made the sea, this ground whereon we walk,
and all these hills and woods which we behold?
And here, indeed, I did not miss my intention;
for he told me, it was old Benamuckee (the
god whom I supposed these savages adored)
who lived a great way beyond all. But as for
his attributes, poor Friday was an utter strang-
er. He could describe nothing of this great
person; and all that he could say was, that he
was very old, much older than the sea and .
land, the moon, or the stars. Friday (said I
again), if this great and old person has made
all things in the world, how comes it to pass,
that all things, as you in particular, do not a-
dore and worship him? Upon this, looking ve-
ry grave, with a perfect sweetlook of innocence,
he replied : Master, all things say O to him;
by '. it may reasonably be supposed he
meant adoration. And where, said I, do the
people of your country go when they die?. He
answered, they all go to Benamuckee. What,
and those people that are eaten up, do they go
there 7 Benamuckee, said he, love 'em dearly ;
me pray to Benamuckee in de canoe, and Bena-
muckee wou'd love me when dey eat me all up.
Such discourses as these had I with my man,
and such made me sensible, that the true God
is worshipped, though under imperfect simili-
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149
Heathens give to their imaginary deity, is as
great an argument of the divine essence as the
most learned atheists (falsely so called) can
bring against it : for God will be glorified in
his works, let the denomination be what it
will; and I cannot be of that opinion which
some conceive, that God should decree men
to be damned for want of a right notion of
faith, in a place where the wisdom of the Al-
mighty has not permitted it to be preached;
and therefore cannot but conclude, that since
obedience is the best sacrifice, these poor crea-
tures, acting by that light and knowledge
which they are possessed with, may undoubted-
ly obtain a happy salvation, though not that
enjoyment with Christ, as his saints, confes-
sors, and martyrs must enjoy.
But laying these determinations aside, more
fit for divines than me to discuss, I began to
G 3
instruct my servant in the saving knowledge
of the true Deity, in which the directions of
God’s Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my
hands to heaven, and pointing thereto, told
him, that the great Maker of heaven and earth
lived there ; that as his infinite power fashion- .
ed this world out of a confused chaos, and
made it in that beautiful frame which we be-
hold, so he governs and preserves it by his un-
bounded knowledge, sovereign greatness, and
peculiar providence; that he was omnipotent,
could do every thing for us, give every thing
to us, and take every thing away from us ; that
he was a rewarder and punisher of good and .
evil actions ; that there was nothing but what
he knew, no thoughts so secret but what he
could bring to light ; and thus, by degrees, I
opened his eyes, and described to him the
+manner of the creation of the world, the
garden of paradise, the transgression of our
first parents, the wickedness of God’s peculiar
people, and the universal sins and abomina-
tions of the whole earth. When these things
were implanted in his mind, I told him, that
as God’s justice was equal to his mercy, he re-
solved to destroy this world, till his son Jesus
Christ interposed in our behalf; and, to pro-
cure our redemption, obtained leave of his
heavenly father to come down from heaven
into the world, where he took human mature
upon him, instructed us in our way to eternal
life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins ; that
he was now ascended into heaven, mediating
for our pardon, delivering our petitions, and
obtaining all those good benefits which we ask
in his name, by humble and hearty prayers,
all which were heard at the throne of heaven.
As very frequently I used to inculcate things
into his .. Friday one day told me, that if
our great God could hear us beyond the sun,
he must surely be a greater God than their Be-
namuckee, who lived but a little way off, and
yet could not hear them till they ascended the
great mountains where he dwelt to speak to
him. What, said I, Friday, did you go thither
to speak to him too? He answered : No, they
never went that were young men, none but
old men called their Oowakakee, meaning the
Indian priests, who went to say O (so he cal-
led saying their prayers), and they return-
ed , and told them what Benamuckee said,
From hence, I could not but observe how hap-
py we Christians are, who have God's imme-
diate revelation for our certain guide; and that
our faith is neither misled, nor our reason im-
posed upon, by any set of men, such as these
Indian impostors.
But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my
man Friday, I told him, that the pretence of
their ancient men going up to the mountain to
say O to their god Benºmicise was an impos-
ture, and that their bringing back an answer
was all a sham, if not worse; for that, if there
was any such thing spoken to them, surely it
must proceed from an infernal spirit. And here
I thought it necessary to enter into a long dis-
course with him, which I did after this manner.
Friday (said I), you must know, that before
this world was made, there was an Almighty
Power existing, by whose power all things
were made, and whose Majesty shall have no
end. To be glorified and adored by beings of
- G 4
a heavenly nature, he created angels and arch-
angels, that is, glorious spirits resembling him-
self, to encompass his throne, eternally singing
forth his praise in the most heavenly sounds
and divine harmony. And, among this heav-
enly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as be-
ing then one of the peculiar favourites of these
celestial abodes; but he, contrary to that duty
he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with un-
bounded ingratitude to his divine Creator, not
only envied him that adoration which was his
due, but thought to usurp that throne which
he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre-
tend to. He raised a dissention and civil war
in heaven, and had a number of angels to take
his part. Unbounded folly! stupendous pride!
thus to hope for victory, and aspire above his
powerful Creator The Deity, not fearful of
such an enemy, yet justly provoked at this re-
bellion, commissions his arch-angel Michael to
lead forth the heavenly host, and give him
battle ; the advantage of which was quickly
perceived, by Lucifer's being overthrown, and
the prince of the air (for so the devil was cal-
led), with all his fallen angels, driven headlong
into a dismal place, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give
the greatest attention, and he expressed a great
satisfaction by his gestures, that God had sent
the devil into the deep hole. And then I de-
sired him to give great heed to what I had fur-
ther to say.
No sooner (proceeded I) was God freed
from, and the heavens clear of this arch-traitor,
but the Father speaks to the Son and Holy Spi-
rit, who belonged to his essence, and were
equal to him in power and glory, Come let us
make man, said he, to our own image, after
our own likeness (Gen. 1, 26), to have dominion
over the creatures of the world which we have
created. And these he intended should glorify
him in heaven according to their obedience in
this state of probation on earth, which was, as
it were, to be the school to train them up for
these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan seeing
himself foiled; yet that God had not taken the
power from him as prince of the air, which
power Heaven designed he should retain,
whereby his creatures might be tried; in re-
venge for the disgrace he had received, he
tempts Adam's wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, which God had
forbidden. . He appears to her in the shape of
a serpent, then a most beautiful creature, and
tells her, that it was no better than an impo-
sition which God had put upon her and her
husband, not to eat of that fair fruit which he
had created ; that the taste thereof would make
them immortal like God himself, and conse-
quently as great and powerful as he. Upon
which she not only ate thereof herself, but
made her husband eat also, which brought
them both under the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern. Ah,
poor mans ! (cried he) naughty womans 1 naugh-
ty devil / make God not love de mans, make
mans like devil himself. -
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind; and
though the devil tempted human nature so far,
he would not suffer him to have an absolute
power over them. I have told you before of
his tender love to his people, till they, like
G 5
*
Lucifer, disobeyed his commands and rebelled
against him ; and even then, how Jesus Christ,
his only Son, came to save sinners. But still
every man that lives in the world is under temp-
tation and trial. The devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations into
our minds, and prompt us on to wicked ac-
tions, that he might glory in our destruction:
Whatever evil thoughts we have proceed
from him ; so that § , in this our #. 2.
expects we should apply ourselves to him by a
fervent prayer for speedy redress. He is not
like Benamuckee, to let none come near him
but Oowakakee, but suffers the people as well
as priests to offer themselves at his feet, thereby
to be delivered from the power and tempta-
tion of the devil.
But though at first my man Friday express-
ed some concern at the wickedness of Lucifer,
I found it not so easy to imprint the right no-
tions of him in his mind, as it was about the di-
vine essence of God: for there nature assisted me
in all my arguments, to shew him plainly the
necessity of a great first cause, and over-ruling
governing power, of a secret directing Provi-
dence, and of the equity and reasonableness of
paying adoration to our Creator; whereas there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of
an evil spirit, of his first beginning, his nature,
and, above all, of his inclination to evil ac-
tions, and his power to tempt us to the like.
And indeed this unlearned Indian, by the
mere force of nature, puzzled me with one par-
ticular question, more than ever I could have
expected. . - -
I had, it seems, one day, been talking to him
of the omnipotent power of God, and his in-
finite abhorrence of sin, insomuch that the Scrip-
tures styled him a consuming fire to all the
workers of iniquity ; and that it was in his
power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the
world in a moment, the greater part of which
are continually offending him.
VVhen , with a serious attention, he had
listened a great while to what I said, after I
had been telling him how the devil was God’s
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his
malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and destroy the kingdom of Christ
in the world, and so forth : Very well, master,
said Friday, you say God is so strong, so great,
is he not much stronger, much mightier than the
naughly devil? To be sure, Friday, said I,
God is more wise and stronger than the ser-
pent : he is above the devil, which makes us
pray to him, that he would tread down Satan
under our feet, enable us to resist his violent
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. Why
then, answered Friday quickly, if God, as you
say, has much strong, much might as the devil,
why God no kill devil, make no more tempt, no
more do wicked 2
You may be certain, I was strangely sur-
prised at this my man's question; and, though
an old man, I was but a young doctor, and
consequently very ill qualified for a casuist, or
a resolver of intricale doubts in religion. And,
as it required some time for me to study for an
answer, I pretended not to hear him, nor to
ask him what he said : but so earnest was he
for an answer, as not to forget his question,
which he repeated in the very same broken
G 6
words as above. When I had recovered my-
self a little, Friday, said I, God will at last
punish him severely, being reserved for judg-
ment, and to be cast into the bottomless pit,
to remain in fire everlasting. But all this did
not satisfy Friday; for, returning upon me,
he repealed my words, RESERVE AT LAST, me .
no understand; but, why not kill devil now,
not kill devil, great, great while ago? Friday,
said I, you may as well ask me why God does
not kill you and me, when, by our wicked ac-
tions, we so much offend his Divine Majesty 2
He gives us time to repent of our sins, that
thereby we may obtain pardon. At these words,
obtain pardon, Friday mused a great while ;
and, at last, looking me stedfastly in the face :
JWell, well, said he, that’s very well; so you,
I, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve, repent,
God pardon all. -
Indeed, here I was run down to the last ex-
tremity, when it became very evident to me,
how mere natural notions will guide reason-
able creatures to the knowledge of a Deity, and
to the homage due to the supreme being of
God; but, however, nothing but divine reve-
lation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and of a redemption purchased for us, of the
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an in-
tercessor at the footstool of God's throne ; and,
therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, that is, the Word and Spirit of
God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of
his people, are the most necessary instructors
of the souls of men, in the saving knowledge of
the Almighly, and the means to attain eternal
happiness. *-
-
And now I found it necessary to put an end
to this discourse between my man and me; for
which purpose I rose up hastily, and made as
if I had some occasion to go out, sending Fri-
day for something that was a good way off. I
then fell on my knees, and besought God that
he would inspire me so far as to guide this
poor savage in the knowledge of Christ, to an-
swer his questions more clearly, that his con-
science might be convinced, his eyes opened,
and his soul saved. VVhen he returned again,
I entered into a very long discourse with him,
upon the subject of the world's redemption by
the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repen-
tance preached from heaven, together with an
holy faith in our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ:
and then I proceeded to explain to him, ac-
cording to my weak capacity, the reason why
our Saviour took not on him the nature of an-
gels, but rather the seed of Abraham ; and how
the fallen angels had no benefit by that re-
demption; and, lastly, that he came only to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the
like. God knows I had more sincerity than
knowledge in all the ways I took for this poor
Indian's instruction ; and I must acknow-
ledge, what I believe every body that acts upon
the same principle will find, that in layin
heavenly truths open before him, I informe
and instructed myself in many things, that
either I did not know, or had not perfectly
considered before; so that, however this poor
creature might be improved by my instruction,
certain it is, that I myself had great reason to
be thankful to Providence for sending him to
me. His company allayed my grief, and made
my habitation comfortable ; and, when I re-
flected, that the solitary life to which I had been
so long confined, had made me to look further
towards heaven, by making me the instrument,
under Providence, to save the life, and for
aught I know, the soul of this poor savage, by
bringing him to the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
it caused a secret joy to spread through every
faculty of my soul; and I frequently rejoiced,
that ever I was brought to this place, which
I once thought the most miserable part of the
world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I after-
wards continue, while I abode on the island,
and for three years did my man and I live in
the greatest enjoyment of happiness. Indeed,
I believe the savage was as good a Christian as
I; and I hope we were equally penitent; and
such penitents as were comforted and restored
by God’s Holy Spirit ; for now we had the
word of the Lord to instruct us in the right
way, as much as if we had been on the English
shore. )
By the constant application I made of the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man Friday,
I earnestly endeavoured to make him under-
stand every part of them, as much as lay in my
power. He also, on the other hand, by his
very serious questions and inquiries, made me
a much better proficient in Scripture-know-
ledge, than I should have been by my own
private reading and study. I must not omit
another thing, proceeding from the experience
I had in my retirement : it was that infinite
and inexpressible blessing, the knowledge of
God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain
and easy to be understood, as immediately to
direct me to carry on the great work of sin-
- cere repentance for my sins, and laying hold
of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical stated
reformation, and obedience to all God’s insti-
tutions, without the assistance of a reverend
and orthodox divine ; and especially by this
same instruction, so to enlighten this savage
creature, as to make him so good a Christian
as very few could exceed him. And there was
only this great thing wanting, that I had no
authority to administer the holy sacrament,
that heavenly participation of Christ's body and
blood; yet, however, we rested ourselves con-
tent, that God would accept our desires, and,
according to our faith, have mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made
up in another, and that was universal peace .
in our little church. We had no disputes and
wranglings about the nature and equality of the
holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity; no nice-
ties in doctrine, or schemes of church govern-
ment; no sour and morose dissenters to im-
pose more sublimated notions upon us; no
pedant sophisters to confound us with unin-
telligible mysteries: but, instead of all this, we
enjoyed the most certain guide to heaven, that
is, the word of God; besides which, we had
the comfortable views of his Spirit leading us
to the truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of his word. As the
knowledge and practice of this are the princi-
pal means of salvation, I cannot see what it
avails any Christian church, or man, in the
world, to amuse himself with speculations and
opinions, except it be to display their particu-
lar vanity and affectation. "
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourses we had fogether, my man and I be-
came most intimately acquainted , and that
there was but very little that I could say, but
what Friday understood; and, indeed, he spoke
very fluently, though it was but broken En-
lish. I now took a particular pleasure in re-
ating all my adventures, especially those that
occurred since my being cast on this island. I
made him understand that wonderful mystery,
as he conceived, of gun-powder and bullet,
and taught him how to shoot. I also presented
to him a knife, which pleased him exceedingly,
making him a belt, with a frog hanging there-
to, like those in which we wear hangers in
England; and, instead of a hanger to put in
the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not
only a good, but even a better weapon upon
many occasions. In a word, my man thus ac-
coutred, looked upon himself as great as Don
Quixote, when that celebrated champion went
to combat the wind-mill.
I next gave him a very particular description
of the territories of Europe, and in a particular
manner of Old England, the place of my nati-
vity. I laid before him the manner of our
worshipping God, our behaviour one to ano-
ther, and how we trade in ships to every part
of the universe. I then told him my misfor-
tunes in being shipwrecked, shewing him, as
near as I could, the place where the ship lay,
which had been gone long before ; but I
brought him to the ruins of my boat, which
before my whole strength could not move, but
now was almost rotten, and fallen to pieces. I
observed my man Friday to view this boat with
an uncommon curiosity; which, when he had
done, he stood pondering a great while, and
said nothing. At last, said I, Friday, what
makes you ponder so much 7 He replied : O
master, me see like boat come to place at my
nation. - -
It was some time, indeed, before I understood
what my man meant; but examining strictly
into it, I plainly found, that such another boat,
resembling mine, had come upon the country
where he dwelt; that is to say, by his farther
explanation, that the boat was driven there
through violent storms and stress of weather.
It then came into my mind, that some Euro-
pean ship having been cast away, the poor dis-
tressed creatures were forced to have recourse
to the boat to save their lives; and being all,
as I thought, drowned, I never concerned mya
self to ask any thing concerning them, but my
only inquiry was about the boat, and what des-
cription my man could give of it.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing very plain to my un-
derstanding; but beyond measure was I satis-
fied, when he told me, with great warmth and
ardour : O master, we save white mans from
drown ; upon which I immediately asked him,
if there were any white mans, as he called
them, in the boat : Yes, yes, said he, the boat
full, very full of white mans. How many, Fri-
day? said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers,
and counted seventeen. And when I asked
him what became of them all, and whether
they lived or not, he replied : Yes, master,
they all live, they be live among my nation.
This information put fresh thoughts into my
head, that these must be those very men who
before I concluded had been swallowed up in
the ocean, after they had left their ship, that
had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom,
and after escaping the fury of the deep, landed
upon that wild shore, and committed themselves
to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another,
which, consequently, as I thought, must be
acted with greater barbarity to strangers, creat-
ed in me a great anxiety, and made me still
more curious to ask Friday concerning them.
He told me he was sure they still lived there,
having resided among them above four years,
and that the savages gave them victuals to live
upon. But pray, Friday, said I, whence pro-
ceeded all this good nature and generosity ?
How came it to pass that they did not kill and
eat them, to please their devouring appetites,
and occasion so splendid an entertainment a-
mong them? No, no, said Friday, they not kill
'em, they make brother with 'em ; by which I
understood there was a truce between them.
And then I had a more favourable opinion of
the Indians, upon Friday's uttering these words:
My nation, t'other nation no eat mans, but when
mans make war fight 5 as though he had said,
that neither those of his kingdom, nor any other
nations that he knew of, ever ate their fellow-
creatures, but such as their law of arms allowed
to be devoured ; that is, those miserable cap-
tives, whose misfortune it should be to be made
prisoners of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very
pleasant day, in most serene weather, my man
and I stood up on the top of a hill, on the east
side of the island, whence I had once before
beheld the continent of America. I could not
tell immediately what was the matter; for sud-
denly Friday fell a jumping and dancing as if
he had been mad; ...] upon my demanding
the reason of his behaviour: Ojoy, said he,
Oglad, there see my country, there my nation,
there live white mans gether. And indeed such
a rapturous sense of pleasure appeared in his
countenance, that his eyes had an uncommon .
sparkling and º , and such a strange
eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to be in
his own country again. This made me not so
well satisfied with my man Friday as before;
for, by this appearance, I made no doubt, but
that if he could get back thither again, he would
not only be unmindful of what religion I had
taught him, but likewise of the great obligation
he lowed me for his wonderful deliverance :
nay, that he would not only inform his coun-
trymen of me, but accompany hundreds of
them to my kingdom, and make me a mise—
rable sacrifice like those unhappy wretches
taken in battle. -
Indeed I was very much to blame to have
had these cruel and unjust suspicions, and must
freely own I wronged the poor creature very
much, who was of a quite contrary temper.
And had he had that discerning acuteness
which many Europeans have, he would cer–
tainly have perceived my coldness and indif-
ference, and also have been very much con-
cerned upon that account; as I was now more
circumspect, I had much lessened my kind-
- *
ness and familiarity with him, and while this
jealousy continued, I used that artful way now
too much in fashion, (the occasion of strife and
dissention) of pumping him daily, thereby to
discover whether he was deceitful in his
thoughts and inclinations: but certainly he had
nothing in him but what was consistent with
the best principles, both as a religious Chris-
tian and a grateful friend; and, indeed, I found
every thing he said was so ingenuous and in-
nocent, that I had no room for suspicion, and,
in spite of all uneasiness, he not only made me
entirely his own again, but also caused me
much to lament that I ever conceived one ill
thought of him. -
As we were walking up the same hill ano-
ther day, when the weather was so hazy at
sea, that I could not perceive the continent,
Friday, said I, don’t you wish yourself to be in
your own country, your own nation, among
your old friends and acquaintances? Yes, said
he, me much O glad to be at my own nation.
And what would you do there, Friday? Would
you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and be a
savage as you were formerly? No, no (answer-
ed he, full of concern, and shaking his head),
Friday now tell them to live good, tell them
pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle
flesh, milk, no eat man again. But surely, re-
plied I, if you should offer to do all this, they
would kill you; and to manifest their contempt
of such instruction, eat you up when they had
done. He then put on a grave, yet innocent
and smooth countenance, saying: No, they no
kill me, they willing love learn ; that is, that
they would be very willing to learn ; adding
withal: That they had learned much of the beard-
edmans that come in the boat. Will you, said I,
go back again, Friday? He smiled at that, and
told me that he could not swim so far. But,
said I, I will make a canoe for you : Yes, mas-
ter, said he, me go if you go, me no go if you
stay. I go, Friday! why, would you have them
eat me up, and devour your kind master? No,
no, said he, me make them not eat master, me
make they much love you; that is, he would tell
them how I had slain his enemies, and thereby
saved his life, for which reason he would make
them love me: and then he related to me, as well
as he was able, how exceeding kind those of his
nation were to the white, or bearded men, as he
called them, who, in their great calamity, were
driven into their country. -
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong
inclinations to venture over, and use my ut-
most efforts, if possible, to join these white
bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spa-
niards or Portuguese; for, thought I, it must
be certainly a better and safer way to escape
when there is a good company, #. for me
alone, from an island forty miles off the shore,
and without any assistance. Some days after,
Friday and I being at work, as usual, at the
same time diverting ourselves with various dis-
courses, I told him I had a boat which I would
bestow upon him, whenever he pleased to re-
turn to his own nation : and to convince him
of the truth of what I said, I took him with
me to the other side of the island, where my
frigate lay, and then taking it from under the
water (for I always kept it sunk for fear of a
discovery), we both went into it to see how it
would work on such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexte-
rous in rowing than my faithful servant, mak-
ing the boat go as fast again as I could. Well,
now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to your
so much desired nation ? But, instead of meet-
ing with that cheerfulness I expected, he looked
very dull and melancholy at my saying so;
which indeed at first surprised me, till he made
me sensible, that his concern was about the
boat's being too small to go so long a voyage.
Upon which I let him understand I had a much
bigger; and, accordingly, the next day went to
the place where the first boat lay, which I had
made, when all the strength I had, or art I
could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into
the water; but now it having lain in the sun
two and twenty years, and no care being taken
of it all that while, it became in a manner rot-
ten. My man told me, that such a boat would
do very well to the purpose, sufficient to carry
enough wittle, dring, bread, for that was his
manner of talking. In short, my mind being
strongly fixed upon my design of going over
with him to the continent, I very plainly told
him, that we would both go and make a boat
full as big, and more proportionable than that,
wherein he might safely return to his own
nation. -
These words made Friday look so very pen-
sive, that I thought he would have fallen at my
feet. It was some time before he could speak
a word; which made me ask him, what was
the matter with him 2 He replied, in a very
soft and moving tone : What has poor Friday
done 2 why are you angry mad with poor ser-
vant 2 what me done 2 O what me done P Fri-
day, said I, you never yet have offended me :
what makes you think I am angry with you,
when I am not angry at all 7 You no angry,
no angry, said he several times; if you be no
angry, why den send Friday over great water
to my own nation ? Why, surely, Friday, an-
swered I, did you not wish to be there, when,
from a mountain, you beheld the place where
you was born ? and is it not to satisfy your de-
sires that I am willing to give you leave to re-
turn thither? Yes, yes, said Friday, me wish be
there sure enough, but me den wish master there
too : no wish Friday there, no master there.
In short, he could not endure the thoughts of
going there without me. I go there, Friday,
said I, what shall I do there ?–He answered
very quickly : O master, you do great deal
much good, you teach all de wild mans to be
good tame mans : you learn dem to be sober,
live good life, to know God, and pray God.
Alas! poor Friday, said I, what can I do a-
gainst their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed
what good can I make your nation sensible of,
when I myself am but a poor ignorant man?
No, no, master, said he, you be no ignorant,
you teachee me good, you teachee dem good.
. You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I
don't care to accompany you thither: I would
rather live in this solitude than venture among
such inhuman savages. Go your way, since
you desire it, and leave me alone by myself, as
I was before I saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunder-struck
than Friday was at these words. Go me away,
Jeave master away, said he, after a long silence,
no, no, Friday die, Friday live not, mastergone;
as though he had said, I neither can nor will
live, if my master sends me from him. And
here I cannot but take notice of the strong ties
of friendship, which many times surpass those
of consanguinity: for often we find a great dis-
agreement among kindred ; and, when there
is any seeming regard for each other, it is very
seldom true, and scarce ever lasting, if power-
ful interest does not bear the sway; and that
alone is often the occasion of the greatest hat-
red in the world, which is to desire the death
of parents and relations, for the sake of acquir-
ing their fortunes. But there was no such thing
between my servant and me: instead of which
there was the greatest gratitude, and the most
sincere love; he found me not only his deli-
verer, but his preserver and comforter; not a
severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving, and
affable friend. He wanted for no manner of
sustenance; and, when he was ill, or out of
order, I was his physician, not only for his bo-
dy, but his soul ; and therefore no wonder
was it, that such an innocent creature, long
since divested of his former natural cruelty,
should have an uncommon concern at so cruel
a separation from me, which pierced him to
the very soul, and made him desire even to die,
rather than live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should be at his liberty as soon
as the boat was made, the language of his eyes
expressed all imaginable confusion; when im-
mediately running to one of his hatchets, which
he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives
it into my hand with a heart so full, that he
could scarcely speak. Friday, said I, what is
it you mean? what must I do with this 2 Only
kill Friday, said he, Friday care not live Along.
But what must I kill you for 7 replied I again.
Ah 1 dear master, what made you Friday save
from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make
Friday love God, and not love Benamickee,
and now Friday send away, never see Friday.
more. As though the poor creature had said :
Alas, my dearest kind master, how comes it to
pass, that, after having ventured your precious
life to save me from the jaws of devouring can-
nibals like myself, after such a tender regard
to provide for me such comfortable nourish-
ment, and continuing so long a kind master,
and a most sincere friend, and after making
me forsake the false notion of an Indian deity,
and worship the true God in spirit and in truth:
after all this, how comes it now, that you are
willing to send me away to my former course
of living, by which means undoubtedly we
shall be dead to each other ? but greater must
be my misfortune, that I shall never more be-
hold the best friend I have in the world. And
these undoubtedly, though he could not express
himself so clearly, must be his sentiments; for
the tears ran down his cheeks in such a plen-
tiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain
from weeping also, when I beheld the poor
creature's affection ; so that I was forced to
comfort him in the best manner I could ,
which I did by telling him, if he was content
to abide with me, I should be ever willing to
keep him. -
II.
After Friday's grief was something abated,
more fully to convince me of his affection, he
said: O master, me not care to be in my nation,
leave you here : me desire nation learn good,
that's all ; meaning, that his desire was for
the conversion of that barbarous people. But
as I had no apostolic mission, nor any concern
about their salvation, so I had not the least in-
tention or desire of undertaking it : and the
strength of my inclination, in order to escape,
proceeded chiefly from my late discourse with
Friday about these seventeen white bearded
men that had been driven upon the barbarian
coast, whom I designed to join as the only
means to further our escape. To which in-
tent my man and I went to search for a pro-
per tree to fell, whereof we might make a
large periagua or canoe to undertake the voy-
age : and, indeed, we were not long in find-
ing one fit for our purpose, there being enough
of wood in the island to build a fleet of large
vessels; but the thing we principally want-
ed was to get one so near the water, that we
might launch it afler it was finished, and not
commit so horrid a mistake as I had done once
before.
Well, after a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday at last, whose
judgment in such affairs was much superior
to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most
filting for it. To this day I cannot tell the
name of the tree, nor describe it any other
way, than only by saying, that it is very like
what we call fustic, or betwixt that and the Ni-
caragua wood, being much of the same colour
and smell. But though my man exceeded me in
the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I
shewed him a much better and cleaner way to
make a canoe than ever he knew before: for he
was for burning the hollow or cavity of the tree,
in order to make this boat; but I then told him
how we might do it with tools, learning him
at the same time how to use them, which in-
deed he did very dexterously ; so that after a
month's labour we finished it, making it very
handsome by cutting the outside into the true
shape of a boat. After this it took us a full fort-
night before we could get her into the water,
which we did, as it were, inch by inch, upon
reat rollers : but when she was in, she would
#. carried twenly men, with all the ease
imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be sure,
at the launching of this man of war of mine, I
was no less amazed to behold with what dex-
terity my man would manage her, turn her,
and paddle her along. , Well, Friday, said I,
what do you think of it now 7 Do you think
this will carry us over ? Yes, master, said he,
me venture over well, though great blow wind.
But my º was yet farther which he was
insensible of; and that was to make a mast and
sail, and to provide her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing
at all to procure ; so I fixed upon a straight
young cedar-tree, which I found near the
place, great plenty of it abounding in the is-
land; and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave
him particular directions how to shape and
order it; but as to the sail, that I managed my-
self. I very well knew I had some old ones,
or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six
II 2
and twenty years by me; but not being care-
ful to preserve them, as thinking I should have
no occasion to use them any more, when I
came to look them over, I found them almost
all rotten, except two ; and with these I went
to work, and after a great deal of pains and
awkward tedious stitching for want of needles,
at length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing,
like what we call in England a shoulder of .
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and
a little small sprit at the top, like those which
our longboats use, and which I very well knew
how to manage; especially since it was like
that which I had in my patron's fishing boat,
when, with my boy Xury, I made my escape
from the Barbarian shore.
It was near two months, I think, before I
completed this work, that is, the rigging and
fitting my mast and sails; and indeed they
were nicely done, having made a small stay,
and a sailor foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to the westward ; and, which was still
more, I fixed a rudder to her stern, to steer
with ; and though I was but a very indif-
ferent ship-wright, yet, as I was sensible of the
great usefulness and absolute necessity of a
thing like this, I applied myself to it with such
a constant application, that at last I accomplish-
ed my design : but what with the many dull
contrivances I had about it, and the failure of
many things, it cost me as much pains in or—
dering as in .#. boat. Besides, when
all this was done, I had my man to teach what
belonged to its navigation : for though he very
well understood how to paddle a canoe along,
he was an utter stranger to a sail and a rudder,
and was amazed when he saw me work the
boat to and again in the sea by them, and how
the sail j and filled this way or that way,
as the course we sailed changed. After some
time and a little use, I made all these things
very familiar to him, so that he became an ex-
pert sailor, except in relation to the compass,
and that I could make him understand but
little of. But, as it happened, there were sel
dom occasions for it, there being but little clou-
dy weather, and scarce ever any fog in those
parts; the stars were always shining in the night,
and the shore visible by day, except in the
rainy season, which confined every one to his
habitation.
Thus entered in the seven and twentieth
year of my reign, or captivity, which you please
(the last three of which, blessed with the com—
pany of my man Friday, ought not to be rec-
koned), I kept the anniversary of my landing
here, with the same thankfulness to God, for
his tender mercies, as I did before ; and cer-
tainly, as I had a great cause for a thankful ac-
knowledgment for my deliverance at first, I
had much greater now for such singular and
additional testimonies of the care of Provi-
dence over me in all my distresses both of body
and mind, and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and speedily delivered; for I had a
strong impression upon my mind, that I should
not be another year in this island. But, how-
ever, I still continued on with my husbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; ga-
thering and curing my grapes, and doing all
other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to
IH 3
come on, obliged me to keep the longer within
doors; but before this, I brought my new ves-
sel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts
from the ship, and haling her up on the shore,
I ordered my man Friday to dig a dock suffi-
cient to hold her in, and deep enough to give
her water, wherein she might float; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a strong dam
cross the end of it, to keep out the water; by
which means she lay dry, as to the tide from
the sea ; and to keep the rain from her, we
thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house; and so we waited for the
months of November and December, in which
I designed to venture over the ocean,
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin
to draw near, but so much was I elevated with
this new designed adventure, that I daily pre-
pared for the voyage. The first thing I thought
on was, to lay by a certain quantity of provi-
sions, as a sufficient store for such an expedi-
tion, intending in a week or fortnight's time to
open the dock, and launch out the boat for
that purpose. But one morning as I was very
busy upon something necessary for this occa-
sion, I called Friday to me, and bid him go
io the sea shore, and see if he could find a
turtle or tortoise, a thing which we commonly
had once a week, as much upon account of
ihe eggs as for the sake of the flesh. He had
not been long gone, but he came running back,
as though he was pursued for life, and as it
were flew over my outward wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground, or steps he set
his feet on ; and before I had time to inquire
the reason of his precipitation, he cries out : O.
dear master, O sorrow 1 sorrow ! Bad 1 O bad!
VV hy, what's the matter, Friday? said I. O,
yonder, yonder, said he, there be one, two, or
three canoes 1 two, three. Surely (thought I)
there must be six, by my man's way of reckon-
ing ; but, on a stricter inquiry, I found there
were but three. Well, Friday, said I, don't
be terrified, I warrant you we will not only de-
fend ourselves against 'em, but kill the most of
these cruel savages. But though I comforted
him in the best manner I could, the poor crea-
ture trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do
with him : O master, said he, they come look
Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up. Why,
Friday? said I : they will eat me up as well as
you, and my danger is as great as yours. But
since it is so, we must resolve to fight for our
lives. What say you? can you fight, Friday?
Yes, said he very faintly, me shoot, me kill
what I can, but there come great many number.
That's no matter, said I again, our guns will
terrify those that we do not kill ; I am very
willing to stand by you to the last drop of my
blood. Now tell me, if you will do the like
by me, and obey my orders in whatsoever I
command 7 Friday then answered : O master,
me lose life for you, me die when you bid die.
Thus concluding all questions concerning his
fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram
of rum (of which I had been a very good hus-
band), and gave it him to comfort his heart.
After he had drunk it, I ordered him to take
the two fowling pieces, which we always car-
ried, and load them with large swan shot, as
big as small pistol bullets ; then I took four
muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and
ll 4
five small bullets each, charging my two pis-
tols each with a brace.I hung my greatsword, as
customary, naked to my side, and gave Friday
his hatchet, as a most excellent weapon for
defence. w
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself
as any knight errant that ever handled a sword
and spear. I took my perspective glass, and
went up to the side of the hill, to see what I
could discover; and I perceived very soon, by
my glass, that there were one and twenty sa-
vages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and
that their chief concern seemed to be the trium-
phant banquet upon the three poor human
bodies, a thing which by this time I had ob-
served was very common with them. I also
remarked, that they did not land at that place
from whence Friday made his escape, but
nearer to the creek, where the shore was low,
and where a thick wood came very close to the
sea. My soul was then filled with indignation
and abhorrence at such inhuman wretches,
which put a period to all my former thoughts
in their vindication; neither would I give my-
self time to consider their right of conquest, as
I had done before ; but descending from the
mountain, I came down to Friday, and told
him, I was resolved to go speedily to them
and kill them all ; asking him again, in the
same breath, if he would stand by me? When
by this time being recovered from his fright,
and his spirit much cheered with the dram I
had given him, he was very pleasant ; yet se-
riously telling me, as he did before : When I
bid die, he would die.
And now it was, having fixed my resolution
in so strong a manner, that nothing could di-
vest my breast of its uncommon fury, I imme-
diately divided the loaded arms betwixt us. To
my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his
girdle, and laid three guns upon his shoulder, a
weight too great I confess to bear; but what
must a poor king do, who has but one soldier
in the world 2. But to shew I made him bear
no more than what I would lay on myself, I
stuck the other pistolin my. and put three
other guns upon my shoulders; nay something
more, but that was like AEsop's burden, a small
bottle of rum, which was soon lightened to our
exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched out,
under a ponderous load of armour, like two
invincible champions, with a quantity of pow-
der and bullets to stand our battle, and load
again, when the pieces were discharged. And
now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged
Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir,
or shoot, or attempt any thing till I command-
ed him ; and, in the interim, not to speak so
much as one word. It was in this order I fetch-
ed a compass to the right hand of near a mile,
as well to get over the creek, as to reach the
wood ; and by this, I thought to come within
shot of them before I could be discerned, which
I found by my glass would not be difficult to
accomplish. .
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of
man, even in his greatest fury and strongest
inclination! For while I was taking this march,
my resolution began to abate, not through fear
of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked
unarmed wretches, but these reflections occur-
red to my mind : What power * I copa-
H
missioned with, or what occasion or necessity
had I to go and imbrue my hands-in human
blood, and murder people that héd neither
done nor intended to do me any wrong? They
were innocent in particular as to me; and
their barbarous custom was not only their mis-
fortune, but a sign that God had left them in
the most immense stupidity; but yet did not
warrant me to be a judge of their actions, much
less an executioner of his righteous judgments:
that, on the contrary, whenever, he thought
fit, he would take vengeance on them himself,
and punish them in a national way, according
to their national crimes; but this was nothing
at all to me, who had no concern with them.
Indeed my man Friday might justify himself,
because they were his declared enemies, of
that very same nation that went to sacrifice him.
before ; and, indeed, it was lawful for him to
attack them, which I could not say was so
with respect to me. So warmly did these things.
press upon my thoughts all the way I went,
that I only resolved to place myself so as to be-
hold their bloody entertainment, without fall-
ing upon them, except something more than
ordinary, by God's special direction, should
oblige me thereto.
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into
the thick wood (my man Friday following me
close behind), when, with all possible wari-
ness and silence, I marched till I came to the
skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest
to them; for only one end of the wood inter-
posed between me and them. Upon which
I called very softly to Friday; and shewing
him a great tree, that was just at the corner of
the wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and
bring me word, if he could plainly perceive
their actions. Accordingly he did as I com-
manded him, and came back with this melan-
choly story, that they were all about their fire,
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand a little
distant from them, which they designed for
their next sacrifice; and this, he told me, was
not one of their nation, but one of those very
bearded men, who was driven by a storm into
his country, and of whom he had so often
talked to me about. You may be sure that
upon hearing this my soul was ready to sink
within me; when ascending up into a tree I
saw plainly by my glass a white man who
lay upon the beach of the sea with his hands
and feet ty'd with flags, or things resemblin
rushes, covered . clothes, and seeme
to be an European. From the tree where I
took this view, I perceived another tree, and
a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer
to them than where I was ; which, by taking
a small circle round, I might come at undis-
covered, and then l should be within half a
shot of these devourers. And this considera-
tion alone, to be more perfectly revenged upon
them, made me withhold my passion, though I
was enraged to the highest degree imaginable;
when going back about twenty paces, I got be-
hind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree; and then I ascended
to a little rising ground, not above eighteen
yards distance, and there I had a full view of
these creatures, and I could perceive all their
actions.
- IH 6
Such a sight did then appear, as obliged me
not to lose a moment's time. No less than
nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon
the ground, close huddled together, expressing
all §. delight imaginable at so barbarous an
entertainment; and they had just sent two o-
thers to murder this poor unhappy Christian,
and bring him limb by limb to their fire; for
they were just then going to untie the bands
from his feet, in order for death; as fetters are
knocked off the feet of malefactors before they
go to the place of execution. Hereupon, im-
mediately turning to my man : Now, Friday,
said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you see me do. All which he
promising he would perform, I set down one
of my muskets, and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket I took my aim at the sa-
vages, bidding him do the like: Are you ready?
said I. Yes, master, said he. VVhy then fire at
them, said I; and that very moment I gave fire
likewise."
I only killed one, and wounded two; but
my man Friday, taking his aim much better
than I, killed two, and wounded three. You
may be sure they were in a dreadful consterna-
tion, at such an unexpected disaster; and those
who yet had escaped our deadly shot, imme-
diately jumped upon their feet, but were in
such confusion that they knew not which way
to run or look, not knowing from whence
their destruction came. We then threw down
Our #. and took up others, giving a second
dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only
with swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we per-
ceived only two of them fall, though many
were wounded, who ran yelling and scream-
ing about like mad creatures. Now, Friday,
said I, lay down your piece, and take up the
musket, and follow me. He did so with great
courage, when shewing ourselves to the sa-
vages, we gave a great shout, and made direct-
ly to the poor victim, who should have been
sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged the
butchers, with three others, to jump into a ca-
noe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at
which shot I thought he had killed them all,
by reason of their falling to the bottom of the
boat; however, he killed two, and mortally
wounded a third. In the mean time, I cut the
flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor
creature, and lifting him up asked him in the
Portuguese tongue: JWhat he was 2 He answer-
ed me in Latin, Christianus ; but so very weak
and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak.
Immediately I gave him a dram, and a piece
of bread to cherish him, and asked him, what
countryman he was 7. He said, Espagnol, and
then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable
- for his deliverance. Segnor (said I, with as
much Spanish as I was master of), let us talk
afterwards, but fight now ; here, take this
sword and pistol, and do what you can. And,
indeed, he did so with such courage and in-
trepidity, that he cut two of them to pieces in
an instant, the savages not having the power
to fly for their lives. I ordered Friday to run
for those pieces we had left at the tree, which
he brought me with great swiftness, and then
I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter
between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who had made at him with one of their wooden
swords; and though the former was as brave
as could be expected, having twice wounded
his enemy in the head; yet, being weak and
faint, the Indian had thrown him upon the
ground, and was wresting my sword out of his
hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting
drew out his pistol, and shot him through the
body before I could come near him, though I
was running to his assistance. As to Friday,
he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet,
dispatching three, but the rest were too nimble
for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowl.
ing-pieces wounded two, who running into
the wood, Friday pursued and killed one; but
the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plung-
ed himself into the sea, and swam to those two
who were left in the canoe, which, with one
wounded, were all that escaped out of one and
twenty. The account is as follows:

The savages in the canoe worked very hard
to get out of our reach, and Friday was as eager
in pursuing them ; and indeed I was no less
anxious about their escape, lest, after the news
--------- a-- -
** 2:… .
had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So be-
ing resolved to pursue them, I jumped into one
of their canoes, and bid Friday follow me; but
no sooner was I in, than, to my surprise, I
found another poor creature, bound hand and
foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had
been, with very little life in him. Immediate-
ly I unbound him, and would have helped
him up; but he could neither stand nor speak,
but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was
only unbound in order to be slain. Here-
upon I bid Friday speak to him, and tell him
of his deliverance; when pulling out nly bottle,
I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which,
with the joyful news he had received, so reviv-
ed his heart, that he sat up in the boat. As soon
as Friday began to hear him speak, and look
more fully in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
transports of joy; for he kissed, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung
his hands, beat his face and head, then sung
and jumped about again, like a distracted crea-
ture: so that it was a great while before I could
make him speak to me, or tell me what was
the matter with him; but when he came to the
liberty of his speech, at last he told me it was
his father. - -
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see
that dutiful and tender affection this poor sa-
vage had to his aged parent. He would sit
clown by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish it: then he took
his arms and ankles, which were stiff and num-
bed with the binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his hand; by which means, per-
ceiving what the case was, I gave him some
rum, which proved of great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the sa-
vages had gotten almost out of sight; and hap-
py it was we did not pursue them; for there
arose from the north-west, which continued
all night long, such a violent storm, that I could
not suppose otherwise but that they were all
drowned. After this, I called Friday to me,
and asked him if he had given his father any
bread? He shook his head, and said : None,
not one bit, me eat a up all. So I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried
for this end. I likewise gave him a dram for
himself, and two or three bunches of raisins
for his father. Both these he carried to him,
for he would make him drink the dram to
comfort him. ** - - -
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he
was bewitched, with such an extraordinary
swiftness, that he was out of sight as it were in
an instant; but, at his return, I perceived him
slacken his pace, because he had something in
his hand. And this I found to be, as he ap-
proached nearer, an earthen jug with some
water for his father, with two other cakes of
bread, which he delivered inte my hands. Be-
ing very thirsty myself, I drank some of the
water, of which when his father had drunk
sufficiently, it more revived his spirits than all
the rum I had given him. . . .
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him
to carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and
some water, who was reposing himself upon a
green place under the shade of a tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which I order-
ed Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum,
as he did his father's. But every minute he was
employed in this, he would cast a wishful eye
towards the boat where he left his father sitt-
ing ; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like
lightning to him, and finding he only laid him-
self down to ease his limbs, he returned back
to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spa-
niard to let Friday help him, and lead him to
the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwell-
ing, where I would take care of him. Upon
which Friday took him upon his back, and so
carried him to the canoe, setting him close by
his father ; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the
shore faster than I could walk, though the wind
blew very hard too; and having brought them.
safe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the
other canoe, which he brought to the creek al-

ing me over, he took our new guests out of the
boat; but so weak were they that I was forced
to make a kind of a hand-barrow ; and when
I came to my castle, not being willing to make
an entrance into my wall, we made them a
handsome tent covered with old sails, and
boughs of trees, making two good beds of rice-
straw, with blankets to lie upon and cover
them. . Thus, like an absolute king over sub-
jects who owed their lives to me, I thought my-
self very considerable, especially as I had now
three religions in my kingdom, my man Friday
being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the
Spaniard a Papist : but I gave liberty of con-
science to them all.
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat;
which when he had done, I cut off the hinder
quarters, and chopping it into small pieces,
boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice
into the broth. This I carried into their tent,
set a table, dined with them myself, and en-
couraged them. Friday was my interpreter to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages pretty
well. After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch .
home all our arms from the field of battle, and
the next day to bury the dead bodies, which he
did accordingly.
And now I made Friday inquire of his fa-
ther whether he thought those savages had es-
caped the late storm in their canoe; and if so,
whether they would not return with a power-
too great for us to resist 2 He answered, that
he thought it impossible they could outlive the
storm ; or if they were driven southwardly,
they might come to a land where they should as
certainly be devoured, as if they were drown-
ed in the sea. And suppose they had attained
their own country, the strangeness of their fatal
and bloody attack would make them tell their
people, that the rest of them were killed by
thunder and lightning, not by the hand of
man, but by two heavenly spirits (meaning
Friday and me) who were sent from above
to destroy them. And this, he said, he knew,
because he heard them say the same to one ano-
ther. And indeed he was in the right on’t; for
I have heard since, that these four men gave
out, that whoever went to that inchanted island,
would be destroyed by fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing some time after, as I
expected, my apprehensions ceased : instead
of which my former thoughts of a voyage took
place, especially when Friday's father assured
me I should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard, he told me, that sixteen more
of his countrymen, and Portuguese, who had
been shipwrecked, made their escape thither;
that though they were in union with the sa-
vages, yet they were very miserable for want of
provisions and other necessaries. When I ask-
ed him about the particulars of his voyage, he'
answered that their ship was bound from Rio
de la Plata to the Havanna ; that when the
ship was lost, only five men perished in the
ocean; the rest having saved themselves in the
boat, were now landed on the main continent.
And what do they intend to do there 7 said I.
He replied, they have concerted measures to
escape, by building a vessel, but that they had
neither tools nor provisions, so that all their de-
signs came to nothing. Supposing (said I) I
should make a proposal, and invite them here,
would they not carry me prisoner to New
Spain 2 He answered, no; for he knew them
to be such honest men as would scorn to act
such inhuman baseness to their deliverer: that
if I pleased, he and the old savage would go
over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an answer: that they should all swear fide-
lity to me as their leader, upon the holy sacra-
ment; and, for his part, he would not only do
w
the same, but sland by me to the last drop of
his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose : but when every thing was
ready, the Spaniard raised an objection, which
carried a great deal of weight in it: You know,
Sir, said he, that having been some time with
you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of
rice and corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at pre-
sent, but not for them, should they come over
presently; much less to victual a vessel for an
intended voyage. Want might be as great an
occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the
children of Israel did against God himself,
when they wanted bread in the wilderness.
And, therefore, my advice is to wait another
harvest, and in the mean time cultivate and im—
prove some more land, whereby we may have
plenty of provisions, in order to execute our
design. -
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved ex-
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
that Iesteemed him ever after. And thus we all
four went to work upon some more land, and
against seed-time we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, sufficient to sow 22 bushels
of barley on, and 16 jars of rice, which was in
short all the seed we had to spare. As we
were four in number, and by this time all in
good health, we feared not a hundred Indians,
should they venture to attack us ... and while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some
trees, fit to build us a large vessel, in case the
Spaniards came over ; which being marked,
I ordered Friday and his father to cut them
down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now
my privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the
work. I likewise increased my flocks of goats,
‘by shooting the wild dams, and bringing home
their kids to my inclosure. , Nor did I neglect
the grape-season, but cured them as usual, tho’
I had such a quantity now as would have filled
8o barrels with raisins. And thus, all of us
being employed, they in working, and I in
providing for them, till harvest came, God Al-
mighty blessed the increase of it so much, that
from twenty-two bushels of barley, we thresh-
ed out two hundred and twenty, and the like
quantity of rice, sufficient to victual a ship fit
to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part
of America,
Thus the principal objection being answer-
ed by a sufficient stock of provisions, I sent m
two ambassadors over to the main-land, wit
a regal authority to administer the oaths of al-
legiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never ask-
ed whether they had pen, ink, or paper; when
giving each of them a musket, eight charges
of powder and ball, and provisions enough for
eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head,
but, impatient for their return, I laid me down
to sleep one morning, when a strange accident
happened, which was ushered in by my man's
coming running to me, and calling aloud: Mas-
ter, master, they are come, they are come. Up-
on which, not dreaming of any danger, out I
jumped from my bed, put on my clothes, and
hurried through my little grove; when look-
ing towards the sea I perceived a boat about a
league and a half distant standing in for the
shore with the wind fair. I beheld they did
not come from the side where the land lay on,
but from the southermost end of the island. So
these being none of the people we wanted, I
ordered Friday to lie still, till such time as I
came down from the mountain, which, with
my ladder, I now ascended, in order to dis-
cover more fully what they were : and now,
with the help of my perspective glass, I plainly
perceived an English ship, which I concluded
it to be by the fashion of its long boat, and
which filled me with such uncommon trans-
ports of joy, that I cannot tell how to describe;
and yet some secret doubts hung about me,
proceeding from I know not what cause , as
though I had reason to be upon my guard.
And, indeed, I would have no man contemm
the secret hints and intimations of danger,
which very often are given, when he may ima-
ine there is no possibility of its being real; for,
ad not I been warned by this silent admoni-
tion, I had been in a worse situation than be-
fore, and perhaps inevitably ruined. *
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat
to approach the shore, as though they looked
for a place where they might conveniently land;
and at last they ran their boat on shore upon
the beach, about half a mile's distance; which
proved so much the happier for me, since, had
they come into the creek, they had landed just
at my door, and might not only have forced
me out of my castle, but plundered me of all I
had in the world. Now I was fully convinced
they were all Englishmen, three of which were
unarmed and bound ; when immediately the
first four or five leaped on shore, and took those
three out of the boat as prisoners; one of whom
I could perceive used the most passionate ges-
tures of entreaty, affliction and despair, while
the others, in a less degree, shewed abundance
of concern. …
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very
much astonished, and I beckoned to Friday,
who was below, to ascend the mountain, and
likewise view this sight : O master, says he to
me, you see English mans eat prisoners as well
as savage mans. And do you think they will
eat them, Friday? said I. Yes, said Friday, they
eat a all up. No, no, said I, Friday, I am much
more concerned lest they murder them ; but
as for eating them up, that I am sure they will
never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfor-
tune in not having the Spaniard and Savage
with me, but also that I could not come within
shot of them unperceived (they having no fire
arms among them), and save these three men,
whom I thought they were going to kill with
their swords. But some comfort it was to me,
that I perceived they were set at liberty to go
where they pleased, the rascally seamen scat-
tering about as though they had a mind to see
the place ; and so long did they negligently
ramble, that the tide had ebbed so low as to
leave the boat aground. Nor were the two men
that were in her more circumspect : for hav-
ing drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast
asleep ; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move it, he hallooed out to
the rest, who made all possible expedition to
come to him : but, as Providence ordered it,
all their force was ineffectual to launch her,
when I could hear them speak to one another:
JWhy, lether alone, Jack, can’t ye, she'll float
next tide. By which words I was fully con-
vinced they were my own countrymen. All
this while I lay very quiet, as being fully sen-
sible it should be no less than ten hours before
the boat could be afloat, and then it should be
so dark, as that they could not easily perceive
me, by which means I should be at more liberly
to hear their talk, and observe all their motions:
not but that I prepared for my defence; yet as
I had now another sort of enemies to combat
with, I acted with more caution. I took two
fusees on my shoulders, and gave Friday three
muskets; besides, my formidable goat-skin coat,
and monstrous cap, made me look as fierce and
terrible as Hercules of old, especially when two
pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make any at-
tempt till it was dark; but it being now two
o'clock, in the very heat of the day, the sailors
were all straggling into the woods, and un-
doubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three
poor distressed creatures, too anxious to get any
repose, were, however, seated under the shade
of a great tree, about a quarter of a mile from
me. Upon which, without any more ado, I ap-
proached towards them, with my man follow-
ing behind me, and, before I was perceived,
I called aloud to them in Spanish : What are
ye, Gentlemen 2
At these words, they started up in great con-
fusion, when they beheld the strange figure I
made; they returned no answer, but seemed as
if they would fly from me : Gentlemen, said I
in English, don’t be afraid, perhaps you have
a friend nearer than you expect. He must be
from Heaven, said one of them, gravely pull-
ing off his hat, for we are past all help in this
world. All help is from Heaven, said I; but,
Sir, as I have perceived every action between
you and these brutes since your landing, only
inform me how to assist you, and I will do it
to the utmost of my power. -
Am I talking with God or man? said he in
melting tears. Are you of human kind, or an
angel ? Sir, said I, my poor habit may tell you
I am a man, and an Englishman, willing to
assist you, having but this servant only ; here
are arms and ammunition : tell freely your
condition, ean we save you? The story, said he,
is too long to relate since our butchers are so
near : but, Sir, I was master of yon ship, my
men have mutinied, and it is by favour they have
put my mate, this passenger and me on shore
without murdering us, though we expect no-
thing but perishing here. Are your enemies
ne? said I. No, replied he (pointing to a
thicket), there they lie, while my heart trembles,
lest, having seen and heard us, they should
murder us all. Have they fire-arms 2 said I.
They have but two pieces, said he, one of which
is left in the boat. He also told me, there were
two rascally villains among them, that were
the authors of this mutiny, and were they
killed or seized on it might induce the rest to
return to their obedience. Well, well, said I,
let us retire farther under the coºns of the
woods; and there it was I made these condi-
tions with him:
I. That, while they staid in the island, they
should not pretend to any authority ; but
should entirely conform to my orders, and re-
turn me the arms which I should put into their
hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they
should afford Friday and myself our passage
gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave him and his two compa-
nions each of them a gun, with powder and
ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon them
as they lay sleeping. The captain modestly said,
that he was sorry to kill them ; though, on the
other hand, to let these villains escape, who
were the authors of his misery, might be the
ruin of us all. VVell, said he, do as you think
fit : and so accordingly I fired, killing one of
the captain's chief enemies, and wounding
the other, who eagerly called for assistance; but
the captain (who had reserved his piece) com-
ing up to him : Sirrah, said he, ’tis too late to
call for assistance, you should rather cry to
God to pardon your villany; and so knocked
him down with the stock of his gun : three
others were also slightly wounded, who, at my
approach, cried out for mercy. This the cap-
tain granted, upon condition that they would
swear to be true to him in recovering the ship,
which they solemnly did : however, I obliged
the captain to keep them bound. After which
I sent Friday and the captain's mate to secure
the boat, and bring away the oars and sail ;
when, at their return, three men coming back,
*
and seeing their late distressed captain now
their conqueror,"submitted to be bound also.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I
related the adventures of my whole life, which
he heard with a serious and wonderful atten-
tion. After this, I carried him and his two
companions into my little fortified castle, shew-
ed them all my conveniencies, and refreshed
them with such provisions as I could afford.
VVhen this was over, we began to consider
about regaining the ship : he said, that there
were twenty-six hands on board, who, know-
ing their lives were forfeited by the law for
conspiracy and mutiny, were so very harden-
ed, that it would be dangerous for our small
company to attack them. This was a reason-
able inference, indeed; but something we must
resolve on, and immediately put in execution:
we, therefore, heaved the boat upon the beach
so high, that she could not shoot off at high wa-
ter mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to
be stopped ; so that all the signals they gave
for the boat to come on board were in vain.
This obliged them to send another boat a-shore,
with ten men armed, whose faces the captain
plainly descried, the boatswain being the chief
officer; but he said there were three honest
lads among them, who were forced into the
conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh cou-
rage (for I had perceived he was in concern); in
the mean while securing our prisoners, except
two, whom we took to our assistance, we
thought ourselves able enough to adventure a
battle. VVHen the sailors landed, and beheld
their boat in that condition, they not only hal-
looed, but fired, for their companions to hear,
I 2 .
yet they received no answer. This struck them
with horror and amazement: thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if
they would return to the ship. I could per-
ceive the captain's countenance change at this,
till of a sudden three men were ordered to
look after the boat, while the other seven leapt
on shore, in order to search for their compa-
nions : and, indeed, they came to the brow of
the hill, near my ancient castle, from whence
they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under
a spreading tree. My opinion was, that no-
thing could be done till night, when I might
use some artifice to get them all out of the boat;
but of a sudden they started up, and made to
the sea side; hereupon I ordered Friday and
the captain's mate to go over the creek, and hal-
loo as loud as they could, and so decoying them
into the woods, come round to me again. And
this, indeed, had a good effect; for they followed
the noise, till coming westward to the creek,
they called for their boat to carry them over,
and taking one of the men out of her, left two
to look after her, having fastened her to the
stump of a little tree on shore, Hereupon im-
mediately the captain and our party passing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised them both,
by the captain's knocking down one, and or—
dering the other to surrender upon pain of
death, and who, being the honestest of them
all, sincerely joined with us By this time it
was pretly late ; when, the rest returning to
their boat, which they found aground in the
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran
about, wringing their hands, crying it was an
inchanted island, and that they should be all
murdered by spirits or devils. My men would
willingly have fallen upon them, but I would
not agree to hazard any of our party. But, to
be more certain, Friday and the captain crawl-
ed upon their hands and feet as near as pos-
sible ; and, when the boatswain approached
in sight, so eager was the captain, that he fired,
and killed him on the spot ; Friday wounded
the next man, and a third ran away. Here-
upon I advanced with my whole army ; and,
it being dark, I ordered the man we had sur-
prised in the boat, to call them by their names,
and to parley with them. Accordingly he call-
ed out aloud : Tom Smith, Tom Smith ! He an-
swered: VVho's that ? Robinson 1 answered the
other. For God’s sake, Tom, surrender imme-
diately, or you're all dead men. VVho must we
surrender to ? says Smith. To our captain and
fifty men here, who have taken me prisoner,
wounded Will. Frye, and killed the boatswain.
Shall we have quarter then 2 said he. Here-
upon the captain calls out : You, Smith, you
know my voice, surrender immediately, and you
shall all have your lives granted, except // ill.
Atkins. Hereupon Atkins cries out: What have
I done, captain, more than the rest, who have
been as bad as I? But that was a lie, for he
was the person that laid hold of him, and bound
him. However, he was ordered to submit to
the governor's mercy, for such was I called:
And so laying down their arms, we bound
them all, and seized on their boat.
After this, the captain expostulated with
them, telling them, that the sovernºye all
- . I
Englishman, who might execute them there ;
but he thought they should be sent to England,
except Will. Atkins, who was ordered to pre-
pare for death next morning. Hereupon At-
kins implored the captain to intercede for his
life, and the rest begged that they might not be
sent to England. This answered our project for
seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins, and
two of the worst, fast bound to the cave, and
the rest being committed to my bower, I sent
the captain to treat with them in the governor's
name, offering them pardon if they would as-
sist in recovering the ship. Upon which they
all promised to stand by him till the last drop
of their blood; and whoever acted treacherous.
ly, should be hanged in chains upon the beach.
They were all released on these assurances, and
then the captain repaired the other boat, mak-
ing his passenger captain of her, and gave him
our men well armed; while himself, his mate,
and five more, went in the other boat. By mid-
night they came within call of the ship, when
the captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and
tell them, that with great difficulty they had
found the men at last. But while they were
discoursing, the captain, his mate, and the rest
entered, and knocked down the sécond mate
and carpenter, secured those that were upon
the deck, by putting them under hatches, while.
the other boat's crew entered and secured the
forecastle; they then broke into the round-
house, where the mate, after some resistance,
shot the pirate captain through the head, upon
which all the rest yielded themselves prisoners,
And thus the ship being recovered, the joyful
signal was fired, which I heard with the great-
est joy imaginable: nor was it long before they
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's
mouth, where coming to me unawares : There,
says he, my dearest friend and deliverer, there
is your ship , and we are your servants , a
comfort so unspeakable as made me swoon in
his arms, while, with gratitude to Heaven, we
were tenderly embracing each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it was not safe to take on board. Here-
upon, concerting, with the captain, I dressed
myselfin one of his suits, and sending for them,
told them, that as I was going to leave the island
with all my people, if they would tarry there,
their lives should be spared; if not, they should
be hanged at the first port they came at. They
agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole
story, charging them to be kind to the Spa-
niards that were expected, gave them all my
arms, and informing them of every thing ne-
cessary for their subsistance, I and my man
Friday went on board. But the next morning
two of the men came swimming to the ship's
side, desiring the captain to take them on board,
though he hanged them afterwards, complain-
ing mightily how barbarously the others used
them. Upon which I prevailed with the cap-
tain to take them in; and being severely whipt
and pickled, they proved more honest for the
future. And so I bid farewell to this island,
carrying along with me my money, my parrot,
umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting sail De-
cember 12th 1686, after twenty-eight years two
months and nineteen days residence; that same
day and month that I escaped from Sallee; land-
- I 4
ing in England, June 11th 1687, after five and
thirty years absence from my own country;
which rendered me altogether a stranger there.
Here I found my first captain's widow alive,
who had buried a second husband, but in very
mean circumstances, and whom H made migh-
ty easy as much as I could. Soon after I went
down to Yorkshire, where all my family were
expired, except two sisters, and as many of one
of my brother's children. I found no provi-
sion had been made for me, they concluding I,
had been long since dead; so that I was but in
a very slender station. Indeed the captain did
me a great kindness by his report to the own-
ers, how I had delivered their ship at the de-
solate island, upon which they made me a
present of 200 l. Sterling. I next went to Lis-
bon, taking my man Friday with me, and there
arriving in April, I met the Portuguese cap-
tain who had taken me on board on the Afri-
can coast; but being ancient, he had left off
the sea, and resigned all his business to his son,
who followed the Brazil-trade. So altered both
of us were, that we did not know each other
at first, till I discovered myself more fully to
him. After a few embraces, I began to in-
quire of my concerns; and then the old gentle-
man told me, that it was nine years since he
had been at Brazil, where my partner was then
living, but my trustees were both dead; that
he believed I should have a good account of
the product of my plantation; that the imagi–
nation of my being lost had obliged my trus-
tees to give an estimate of my share to the pro-
curator-fiscal, who, in case of my not return-
ing, had given one third to the king, and the
º
-
rest to the monastery of St. Augustin ; but if I
put in my claim, or any one for me, it would
be returned, except the yearly product, which
was given to the poor. I then desired him to
tell me what improvement he thought had been
made on my plantation, and whether he ima-
gined it was worth my while to look after it?
He answered, he did not know how much it
was improved; but this he was certain of, that
my partner was grown vastly rich upon his
half of it; and that he had been informed, that
the king had 200 moidores per annum for his
third part. He added, that the survivors of my
trustees were persons of an ingenuous charac-
ter; that my partner could witness my title,
my name being registered in the country, by
which means I should indisputably recover
considerable sums of money. But, answered
I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects,
when I made you only my heir 2 This, he said,
was true; but, there being no affidavit made
of my death, he could not act as my executor.
However, he had ordered his son (then at Bra-
zil) to act by procuration upon my account,
and he had taken possession of my sugar-house,
having accounted himself for eight years with
my partner and trustees for the profits, of which
he would give me a very good account. . .
And, indeed, this he performed very faith-
fully in a few days, making himself indebted
to me 470 moidores of gold, over and above
what had been lost at sea, after I had left the
place. And then he recounted to me what mis-
fortunes he had gone through, which forced my
money out of his hands to buy part in a new
ship : But, says he, you shall not want, take
- I
this, and when my son returns, every farthing
shall be paid you. . Upon which he put into
my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as
likewise the instrument containing the title to
the ship which his son was in, and which he
offered as security for the remainder. But
really when I saw so much goodness, genero-
sity, tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the
heart to accept it, for fear he should straiten
himself upon my account. It is true, said he,
it may be so; but then the money is yours, not
mine, and you may have a greater occasion
for it. However, I returned fifty of them back
again, promising that I would freely give him
the other hundred when I got my effects in to
my hands, and that I designed to go myself for
that purpose. But he told me he could save
me that trouble, and so caused me to enter my
name with a public notary, as likewise my af-
fidavit, with a procuration affixed to it; and
this he ordered me to send in a letter to one of
his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil : and,
indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and
honourably observed ; for, in seven months
time, I had a very faithful account of all my
effects, what sums of money were raised, what
expended, and what remained for my use : in
a word, I found myself to be worth 5oool.
Sterling, and 1 oool, per annum. Nor was this
all; for my partner congratulated me upon my
being alive, telling me how much my plan—
tation was improved, what negroes were at
work, and how many Ave Marias he had said
to the virgin Mary for my preservation, desir-
ing me to accept kindly some presents he had
sent me, which I found shewed the greatest
generosity. - -
No sooner did the ship arrive, but I reward-
ed my faithful captain by returning him the
hundred moidores; and not only forgiving
him all he owed me, I allowed him yearly a
hundred more, and fifty to his son, during
their lives. And now being resolved to go to
England, I returned letters of thanks to the
prior of St. Augustin's, and in particular to my
old partner, with very suitable presents. By
the captain's advice, I was persuaded to go by
land to Calais, and there take passage for En-
gland ; when, as it happened, I got a young
English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon,
to accompany me, together with two English
and two Portuguese gentlemen; so that with a
Portuguese servant, an English sailor, and my
man Friday, there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out and
came to Madrid, when the summer decaying,
we hastened to Navarre, where we were in-
formed, that there was scarcely any passing by
reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so
that we were obliged to abide near twenty days
at Pampeluna, and at last to take a guide to
conduct us safe towards Toulouse. And now
twelve other gentlemen joining with us, toge-
ther with their servants, we had a very jolly
company. Away our guide led us by the fright-
ful mountains, and j, so many intri-
cate mazes and windings, that we insensibly
passed them, which, as we travelled along,
ushered us into the prospect of the fruitful and
charming provinces of Languedoc and Gas-
cogne. -
I 6
But now came on two adventures, both tra-
gical and comical. First, our guide was en-
countered by three wolves and a bear, who set
upon him and his horse, and wounded him in
three places ; upon which my man, riding up
to his assistance, shot one of them dead upon
the spot, which made the others retire to the
woods. But the pleasantest adventure was, to
behold my man attack the bear. "Tis such a
creature, that if you let him alone, he will never
meddle with you : and this my man very well
knew, and so begging leave of me in broken
English, he told us he would make good laugh.
Why, you silly fool, said I, he'll eat you up at
a mouthful. Eatee me up, replied he, by way
of scorn, me not only eatee him, but make much.
good laugh. Upon which, pulling off his boots,
he claps on his pumps, and running after the
monstrous beast, he called out, that he wanted
o discourse with him ; and then throwing
stones on purpose to incense him, the beast
turns about in a fury, and with prodigious strides
shuffles after him. But though he was not swift
enough to keep up pace with Friday, who
made up to us as it were for help, yet being
angry: You dog, said I, immediately take horse,
and let us shoot the creature. But he cried :
Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh.
much. And so he turned about, making him
signs to follow, while the bear ran after him, till
coming to a great oak, he ascended in a mi
nute, leaving his gun at the foot of it. Nor did
the bear make any difficulty of it, but ascend-
ed like a cat, though his weight was very great.
You must consider I was not a little amazed at
the folly of my man, as not perceiving any
thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as
we rode up nearer, and beheld the beast mount-
ed upon the oak, on the beginning of the same
branch to which Friday clung at the farther
end, where the bear durst not come. Here-
upon Friday cried out : Now inaster, me make
much laugh, me make de bear dance. Upon
which he fell a shaking the bough, which made.
the creature look behind him, to see how he
could retreat. Then, as if the bear had under-
stood his stammering English : Why you no
come farther, Mr. Bear 2 said he pray, Mr.
Bear, come farther ; and then, indeed, we all
burst into laughter, especially when we per-
ceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the
ground, leaving the beast to make the best of
his way down the tree. And now thinking it
the most convenient time to shoot the creature,
Friday cried out, O dear master, no shoot, me
shoot by and by ; when taking up the gun, Me
no shoot yet, said he, me make once more much
baugh. And, accordingly, he was as good as
his word; for the creature descending back-
wards from the tree very leisurely, before he
could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot
him through the ear, stone dead : and looking
to see whether we were pleased, he burst out
into a hearly laughter, saying : So we kill de
bear in my country, not with the gun, but with
much long arrows. Thus ended our diversion
to Our #. satisfaction, especially in a place
where the terrible howlings struck us with a
continual terror. But the snows now growing
very deep, particularly on the mountains, the
ravenous creatures were obliged to seek for sus-
tenance in the villages, where coming by sur-
prise on the country people, they killed several
of them, besides a great number of their sheep
and horses.
Our guide told us, we had yet one more dan-
gerous place to pass by; and if there were any
more wolves in the country, there we should
find them. This was a small plain, encompass-
ed with woods, to get through a long narrow
defile, to the village where we were to lodge.
When we entered the wood, the sun was with-
in half an hour of setting; and a little after it
was set, we came into the plain, which was not
above two furlongs over, and then we perceived
five great wolves cross the road, without taking
notice of us, and so swift as though they were
pursuing their prey. Hereupon our guide,
believing there were more coming, desired us
to be upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes
were very circumspect, till about half a league
farther, we perceived a dead horse, and near a
dozen of wolves devouring its carcass. My
man Friday fain would have fired at them, but
I would not permit him; nor had we gone half
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings
in a wood on our left, when presently we saw
an hundred come up against us, as though they
had been an experienced army. This obliged
us to form ourselves in the best manner; and
then I ordered that every other man should
fire, that those who did not might be ready to
give a second volley, should they advance upon
us; and then every man should make use of
his pistols. But there was no necessity for this;
for the enemy being terrified, stopped at the
noise of the fire ; four of them were shot dead,
and several others being wounded, went bleed-
ing away, as we could very plainly discover by
the snow. And now remembering what had
been often told me, that such was the majesty
of a man's voice as to strike terror even into
the fiercest creatures, I ordered all our compa-
mions to halloo as loud as possible : and in this
notion I was not altogether mistaken, for they
immediately turned about upon the first halloo,
and began to retire; upon which, ordering a
second volley in their rear, they galloped into
the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our
pieces again, and then made all the haste we
could on our way; but we had not rode far,
before we were obliged to put ourselves in a
posture of defence as before, being alarmed
with a very dreadful noise in the same wood
on our left hand, the same way we were to
pass, only that it was at some distance from us.
By this time the darksome clouds began to
spread over the firmament, and the night grow-
ing very dusky, made it so much the more to
our disadvantage; but still the noise increasing,
we were fully assured, that it was the howling
and yelling of those ravenous creatures; when
presently three troops of wolves, on our front,
appeared to our sight, as though a great number
of them had a design to surround us and devour
usin spite of fate. But as they did not fall upon
us immediately, we proceeded on our journey
in as swift a manner as the roads would permit
our horses, which was only a large trot. It was
in this manner we travelled, till such time as
we discovered another wood, and had the pro-
spect of its entrance through which we were to
Pass, at the farthest side of the plain. But sure-
ly none can express the terror we were in ,
when, approaching the defile, we perceived a
confused number of the fiercest wolves stand-
ing, and, as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor
were we long in this amazement, before ano-
ther occasion of horror presented itself; for sud-
denly we heard the report of a gun at another
opening into the wood, and, looking that way,
out ran a horse bridled and saddled, flying with
the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen
or seventeen wolves pursuing him, in order
to devour the poor creature : and unques-
tionably they did so, after they had run him
down, not being able to hold out that swiftness
with which he at first escaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from
whence the horse came forth, there lay the car-
cases of another horse and two men, mangled
and torn by these devouring wolves : and un-
doubtedly one of these men was the person
who fired the gun which we had heard, for the
piece lay by him; but, alas! most of the upper
part of his body and his head were entombed
in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or
retreat, we could not tell; but it was not long
before the wolves themselves made us come to
a resolution: for such numbers surrounded us,
every one of which expected his prey, that,
were our bodies to be divided among them,
there could not be half a mouthful a piece.
But happy, very happy it was for us, that but
a little way from the entrance, there lay some
very large timber trees, which I supposed had
been cut down and laid there for sale; amongst
which I drew my little troop, placing ourselves
in a line behind one long tree, which served us
for a breast-work, when desiring them to a-
light, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, in-
closing our horses in the centre, the only place
where we could preserve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious
charge than what the wolves made upon us in
this place ; and the sight of the horses, which
was the principal prey they aimed at, provok-
ed their hunger, and added to their natural
fierceness. They came on us with a most dread-
ful noise, that made the woods ring again;
and beginning to mount the pieces of timber,
I ordered every other man to fire as before di-
rected : and, indeed, so well did they take their
aim, that they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley; but still we were obliged to keep,
a continual firing, by reason they came on like
devils, pushing one another with the greatest
fury. But our second volley something abated
their courage, when, stopping a little, we hop-
ed they would have made the best of their way;
however, it did not prove so, for others made
a new attempt upon us ; and though in four
firings we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
laming twice as many, yet they several times
- successively came on, as though they valued
not their lives for the sake of their prey.
Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too
suddenly, and therefore called my other ser-
vant, and giving him a horn of powder, bid.
him lay a large train quite along the timber,
which he did, while Friday was charging my
fusee and his own with the greatest dexterity.
By this time the wolves coming up the timber,
I set fire to the train by snapping a discharged
pistol close on the powder. This so scorched
and terrified them, that some fell-down, and
others jumped in among us; but these we im—
mediately dispatched, when all the rest, fright-
ed with the light, which the darksome night
caused to appear more dreadful, began at
length to retire; upon which, ordering our last
pistols to be fired at once, giving at the same
time a great shout, the wolves were obliged to
have recourse to their swiftness, and turn tail;
and them we sallied out upon twenty lame ones,
cutting them in pieces with our swords, which
obliged them to howl lamentably, to the terror
of their fellows, who resigned to us the field
as victorious conquerors. And, indeed, I ques-
tion whether Alexander king of Macedonia, in
any of his conquests, had more deserved a
triumph than we had; for he was but attacked
by numerous armies of soldiers; whereas our
little army was obliged to combat a legion of
devils, as it were, worse than the cannibals,
who, the same moment had they slain us, would
have sacrificed us, to satisfy their voracious ap-
petites. -
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts,
having killed threescore of them, and saved our
lives from their fury. We still had a league far-
ther to go, when, as we went on, our ears were
saluted with other unwelcome howlings, and we
expected every moment another attack. But
in an hour's time we arrived at the town
where we were to lodge ; and here we found
the place strictly guarded, and all in terrible
confusion, as well they might, for fear of the
bears and wolves breaking into the village, in
order to prey upon their cattle and people.
The next morning we were obliged to take a
new guide, by reason the other grew very ill of
his wounds, which he had received, as before
mentioned. After we had reached Toulouse,
we came into a warm, pleasant and fruitful
country, not infested with wolves, nor any sort
of ravenous creatures; and when we told our
story there, they much blamed our guide, for
conducting us through the forest at the foot of
the mountains in such a severe season, when
the snow obliged the wolves to seek for shelter
in the woods. When we informed them in
what manner we placed ourselves, and the
horses in the centre, they exceedingly repre-
hended us, and told us, it was an hundred to
one, but we had all been destroyed ; for that
it was the very sight of the horses, their so much
desired prey, that made the wolves more rag-
ingly furious than they would have been, which
was evident by their being at other times really
afraid of a gun ; but then being exceeding
hungry and furious, upon that account, their
eagerness to come at the horses made them in-
sensible of their danger ; and that, if we had
not, by a continual fire, and at last by the cun-
ning stratagem of the train of powder, got the
better of them, it had been great odds if their
number had not overpowered us; besides, it
was a great mercy we alighted from our horses,
and fought them with that courage and con-
duct, which had we failed to do, every man
of us, with our beasts, had been devoured :
and, indeed, this was nothing but truth ; for
never in my life was I so sensible of danger
as when three hundred devils came roaring up-
on us, to shun whose unwelcome company, if
~ ~
I was sure to meet a storm every week, I would
rather go a thousand leagues by sea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my pas—
sage through France to take notice of, since
other travellers of greater learning and inge-
nuity have given a more ample account than
my pen is able to set forth. From Toulouse I
travelled to Paris, from thence to Calais, where
I took shipping, and landed at Dover the 14th
of January, in a very cold season.
Thus come to the center of my travels, I had
my new discovered estate safe about me; and
all the bills of exchange I had brought were cur-
rently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy counsellor, thought no pains nor care too
great to procure my advantage; nor had I ever
occasion to blame her fidelity, which drew
from me an ample reward. I was for leaving
my effects in her hands, intending to set out
for Lisbon, and so to the Brazils; but as in the
Desolate Island I had some doubts about the
Romish religion, so I knew there was little en-
couragement to settle there, unless I would
apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in
continual fear of the inquisition. Upon this
account, I resolved to sell my plantation ; and,
for that intent, I wrote to my old friend at
Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my
great satisfaction; which was, that he could sell
it to good account : however, if I thought it
convenient to give him liberty to offer it in my
name to the two merchants, the survivors of
my trustees, residing at the Brazils, who con-
sequently understood its intrinsic value, having
lived just upon the spot, and who I was sen-
sible were very rich, and therefore might be
the more willing to purchase it, he did not in
the least doubt, but that I should make four or
five thousand pieces of eight more of it than I
could do, if I disposed of it in any other man-
ner whatsoever. - -
You may be sure I could not but agree with
this kind and ingenuous proposal; and imme-
diately I sent him an order to offer it to them,
which he accordingly did; so that, about eight
months after, the ship being in that time re-
turned, he gave me a satisfactory account, that
they not only willingly accepted the offer, but
that they had also remitted 53,000 pieces of
eight to a correspondent of their own at Lis-
bon, in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon, in return, I signed the instru-
ment of sale according to form, which they had
sent from Lisbon, and returned it again to my
old friend, he having sent me, for my estate,
bills of three hundred twenty-eight thousand
#. of eight, reserving the payment of one
hundred moidores per annum, which I had al-
lowed him during life, likewise fifty to his son
during life also, according to my faithful pro-
mise, which the plantation was to make good
as a rent-charge.
And thus having led my reader to the know-
ledge of the first part of my life, so remarkable
for the many peculiar providences that at-
tended it, floating in an ocean of uncertainly
and disappointment, of adversity and prospe-
rity, beginning foolishly, and yet ending hap-
pily; methinks, now that I am come to a safe
and pleasant haven, it is time to cast out my
anchor, and, laying up my vessel, bid, for a
while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no
other concerns to look after, but the care of my
brother's two sons, which, with the good wi-
dow's persuasions, obliged me to continue at
home seven years. One of these children I bred

sailor, remarkable for his courage and bravery.
Besides this, I married a virtuous young gentle-
woman, of a very good family, by whom I
had two sons and one daughter. But my dear
and tender wife leaving this earthly stage (as
in the second part of my life you will hear),
which rent my soul as it were asunder, my na-
tive country became weary and tiresome to
me : and my nephew happening to come from
sea, tempted me to venture another voyage to
the East Indies, which I did in the year 1634,
at which time I visited my island, and inform-
ed myself of every thing that happened since
my departure.
One might reasonably imagine, that what I
had suffered, together with an advanced age,
and the fear of losing, not only what I had got-
ten, but my life also, might have choaked up
all the seeds of youthful ambition and curio-
sity, and put a lasting period to my wandering
inclinations. But as nothing but death can ful-
ly allay the active part of my life, no less re-
markable for the many various contingencies
of it; you will next perceive how I visited my
little kingdom, saw my successors the Spa-
niards, had an account of the usage they met
with from the Englishmen, agreeing and dis-
agreeing, uniting and separating, till at last
they were subjected to the Spaniards, who yet
used them very honourably, together with the
wonderful and successful battles over the In-
dians, who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their
invincible courage and bravery, having taken
eleven men and five women prisoners, by
which, at my return, I found about twenty
young children on my little kingdom. Here I
staid twenty days, left them supplies of all né-
cessary things, as also a carpenter and smith,
and shared the island into parts, reserving the
whole property to myself. Nor will you be
insensible, by the account of these things, to
several new adventures I have been engaged
in, the battles I have fought, the deliveran-
ces I have met with: and while, in the surpris-
ing relation of such remarkable occurrences, I
shall describe many of God's kindest provi-
dences to me in particular, no less conspicu-
ous in the same goodness, power and majesty
of our great Creator, shewn, one way or other,
over the face of the earth, if duly adverted to,
The further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,
wherein are contained several strange and
surprising accounts of his travels, and the
most remarkable transactions both by sea and
1and ; with his wonderful vision of the An-
gelic World.
WHEN we consider the puissant force of Na-
ture, and what mighly influence it has many
times over the temper of the mind, it will
be no such great wonder to think, that my
strong reason should be overcome by a much
stronger inclination. My late acquired king-
dom ran continually in my thoughts all the day,
and I dreamed of it in the night; nay, I made
it the continual subject of my talk, even to im-
pertinence, when I was awake. I had such
vapours in my head, that I actually supposed
myself at my castle; that I not only perceived
Friday's father, but the old Spaniard, and the
wicked sailors, but that I talked and discoursed
with them about their manner of living; that I
heard these things related to me, which I found
afterwards to be but too true; and that I exe-
cuted my judgments with the greatest severity
upon the offenders. And, indeed, this eclipsing
all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afford-
ed me one pleasant hour: my dear and tender
wife could not but take notice of it, which
drew these affectionate speeches from her: My
dear, said she, I am really persuaded that some
secret impulse from heaven occasions in you a
determination to see the island again : nor am
I less sensible, but your being engaged to me,
and these dear children, is the only hinderance
of your departure. I know, my dear, if I was
in my grave, you would not long continue at
home ; prevent not your happiness upon my ac-
count, whose only comfort centers in you. All
that I can object is, that such an hazardous
undertaking is no way consistent with a per-
son of your years ; but if you are resolved to go,
added she, weeping, only permit me to bear you
company, and that is all that I desire.
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the
most innocent and yet most powerful charms,
brought me insensibly into my right under-
standing; and when I considered all the trans-
actions of my life, and particularly my new
engagement ; that I had now one child alrea-
a G LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I had no occasion to seek for more riches, who
already was blessed with sufficiency; with much
struggling I altered my resolutions at last, re-
solving to apply myself to some business or
other, which might put a period to such wan-
dering inclinations. Hereupon I bought a
little farm in the county of Bedford, with a re-
solution to remove thither: upon this there was a
pretty convenient house, surrounded with land
very capable of improvement, which suited my
temper as to planting, managing and cultival-
ing. Nor was I long before I entered upon
my new settlement, having, bought ploughs,
harrows, carts, waggons, horses, cows, and
sheep; so that I now led the life of a coun-
try gentleman, and as happy in my retirement
as the greatest monarch in the world. And
what made me think my happiness the greater
was, that I was in that middle state of life,
which my father had so often recommended,
much resembling the felicity of a rural retire-
ment, which is elegantly described by the poet
in these lines: -
- - º
Free from all vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare,
But, in the midst of this my happiness, f
was suddenly plunged into the greatest sorrow
that I could possibly endure: for, when I least
expected it, my dear and tender wife was forc-
ed to submit to the irresistible power of death,
leaving this transitory life for a better. It is
impossible for me to express the beauties of her
mind, or the loveliness of her person; neither
can I too much lament her loss, which my
latest breath shall record : her influence was
greater over me than the powers of my own
reason, the importunities of friends, the instruc-
tions of a father, or the melting tears of a ten-
der and disconsolate mother : in a word, she
was the spirit of all my affairs, and the centre
of my enterprises. But now, since the cruel
hand of death had closed my dearest's eyes, I
seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world;
my privy counsellor being gone, I was like a
ship without a pilot, that could only run be-
fore the wind. And when I looked around
me in this busy world, one part labouring for
bread, and the other squandering away their
estates, this put me in mind how I had lived
in my little kingdom, where both reason and
religion dictated to me, that there was some-
thing that certainly was the reason and end of
life, which was far superior to what could be
hoped for on this side of the grave. My coun-
try delights were now as insipid and dull as
music or science to those who have neither
taste nor knowledge of it. In short, resolving to
leave off house-keeping, I left my farm, and,
in a few months, returned to London. .
But neither could that great city, so famous
for its variety of entertainment, afford me any
agreeable delight; a state of idleness I found to
be the very dregs of life, and most hurtful to
body and soul. It was now the beginning of
the year 1694, at which time my nephew (who,
as I before observed, had been brought up to
the sea, and advanced to be captain of a ship)
was returned from a short voyage to Bilboa,
the first he had made in that station. He comes
to me one morning telling me, that some mer-
chants of his acquaintance had proposed to him
to go on a voyage for them to the East Indies
and China, in the manner of private traders ;
and now, uncle, said he, if you'll accompany
me thither, I’ll engage to land you upon your
old island to visit the state of your little
kingdom.
Just before he came in, my thoughts were
fixed to get a patent for its possession, and then
to fill it with inhabitants. After I had paused
a little while, and looked stedfastly on him :
J/hat devil, or ºpiº said I, sent you with this
unlucky errand 2 He started at first ; but reco-
vering himself when he perceived I was not
offended; Sir, replied he, what I have pro-
posed cannot, I hope, be styled unlucky, since
certainly you must be desirous to see your little
territory, where you reigned with more con-
tent than any of your brother-kings in the uni-
verse. Nephew, said I, if you will leave me
there, and call for me as you come back, I
care not if I give my consent. But he answer-
ed, that the merchants would not allow their
vessel, loaden with an infinite value, to return
there again, which was a month's sail out of
the way. Besides, Sir, said he, if I should mis-
carry, were your request granted, why then,
you should be locked up as before. This, in-
deed, carried a great deal of reason in it; but
we found out a remedy, and that was to carry
a framed sloop on board, ready to be set up in
the island by the assistance of some carpenters,
which we should carry with us, that might be
fitted in a few days to go to sea. I was not
long in forming my resolution, which over-
swayed my good friend the wº persua-
2
~
sions, and the natural affection I bore to my
young children. ... I made my will, and settled
my estate in such a manner that I was per-
fectly sure my poor infants should have jus-.
tice done them. The good widow not only
undertook to make provision for my voyage,
but also took the charge of my domestic af-
fairs, and to provide for my childrens educa-
iion ; and indeed no mother could take more
care, or understood that office better ; for
which I lived to reward, and return her my
hearly thanks.
The beginning of January 1694–5, my ne-
phew being ready to sail, Friday and I went
on board in the Downs on the 8th, having, be-
sides that sloop already mentioned, a very con-
siderable cargo for my new colony. First, I
had some servants, whom I proposed to leave
there as inhabitants, or to work while I staid
there, as they should appear willing : there
were two carpenters, a smith, and a very in-
genious fellow who was Jack of all trades; for
he was not only a cooper by trade, but also he
was dexterous at making wheels and hand-
mills to grind corn, likewise a good turner,
and a good pot-maker, I also carried a tailor,
who consented to stay in my plantation, and
proved a most necessary fellow in the island,
As to my cargo, it consisted of a sufficient quan-
tity of linen, and English stuffs for clothing
the Spaniards that I expected to find there; as
likewise gloves, hats, shoes, stockings; together
with beds, bedding, and household stuff, es—
pecially kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles,
pewter, brass, etc. also nails, tools of all sorts,
Staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things ne-
cessary; all which, I think, cost me about three
hundred pounds. Nor was this all; for I car-
ried an hundred spare-arms, muskets and fu-
sees, besides some pistols, a considerable quan-
tity of several sorts of shot, two brass cannon,
besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part for
some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew
take with us two small quarter-deck guns, more
than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave
behind, if there was a necessity; that so we
might build a fort there, and man it against all
opposers whatsoever.
Well, we put out to sea; and though I can't
say this voyage was so unprosperous as my
others had been, yet contrary winds drove us
so far northward, that we were obliged to put
in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two and twenty days. Here indeed our
provisions were very cheap, and we added to
our ship's stores by taking in several live hogs,
two cows and calves, which I then resolved to
put on shore in my island, if our necessities did
not call for them. On the 5th of February we
sailed from Ireland with a very fair gale,
which lasted for some days; and I think it was
about the 20th of the same month, late in the
evening, when the mate informed us that he
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and
when he was speaking, a boy came in, and
told us that the boatswain had heard another.
Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck,
from whence in a few moments we perceived
a terrible fire at a distance. We had imme-
diately recourse to our reckonings, in which
we were all of opinion that there could be no
land that way, it appearing to be *N . N. VV.
K. -
Hereupon we concluded that some ship had
taken fire at sea, and that it could not be far
off, by the report of the guns which we had
heard. We made up directly to it, and in
half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we
could plainly perceive a great ship on fire in
the middle of the sea. Touched with this un-
happy disaster, and considering my former cir-
sumstances, when the Portuguese captain took
me up, I immediately ordered five guns to be
fired, that the poor creatures, not seeing us, it
being dark (though we could perceive their
flame), might be sensible that there was deli–
verance at hand, and consequently mighter-
deavour to save themselves in their boat. Nor
was it long before the ship blew up in the air,
and the fire was extinguished in the ocean. But
supposing them all to be in their boats, we hung
out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o'clock
in the morning; when, with our perspectives
we beheld two boats full of people making to-
wards us, though the tide was against them :
then spreading out our ancient, and hanging
out a waft, as a signal for them to come on
board, in half an hour's time we came up to
them, and took them all in, there being no less
than sixty-four men, women, and children.
It was a French merchant ship of 3oo tons,
homeward bound from Quebec, in the river of
Canada. The master informed me how, by
the negligence of the steersman, the steerage
was set on fire : that, at his outcry for help, the
232 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
but that some sparks getting between the tim-
ber, and within the ceiling, it proceeded into
the hold, where there was no resisting it : that
then they got into their boats, as creatures in
the last extremity, with what provision they
had, together with oars, sails, and a compass,
intending to go back to Newfoundland, the
wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though there
were several chances against them, as storms to
overset and founder them, rains and cold to
benumb and perish their limbs, and contrary
winds to keep them back and starve them; but,
said he, in this our great distress, we heard the
welcome report of your guns, when, with un-
speakable joy, taking down our masts and sails,
we were resolved to lie by till morning ; but
perceiving your light, we set our oars at work
to keep our boat a-head, the sooner to attain
your ship, the happy instrument of our deli-
Verance. -
Indeed, no one can express the joy of these
poor creatures on this occasion; fear and grief
are easily set forth; sighs and tears, with a few
motions of the hands and head, are all the de-
monstrations of these passions; but an excess of
joy carries in it a thousand extravagancies; espe-
cially, I think, amongst the French, whose tem-
per is allowed to be more volatile, passionate,
sprightly, and gay, than that of other nations.
Some were weeping, tearing themselves in the
greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark
mad about the ship, while the rest were stamp-
ing with their feet, wringing their hands, sing-
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223
ing, with a few returning hearty thanks to the
Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think,
if I am not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged
to let thirty of them blood. But among the
passengers, there were two priests, the one an
K. 4
old, and the other a young man; but what a-
mazed me more was, that the elder was in the
worst plight ; for no sooner did he perceive
himself freed from danger, but he dropt down
as it were without life, and, to every one's ap-
pearance, quite dead; but the surgeon, chafing
and rubbing his arm, opened a vein, which at
first dropped, and then flowing more freely,
the old man began to open his eyes, and in a
quarter of an hour was well again. But soon
remembering his happy change, the joy of
which whirled his blood about faster than the
vessels could convey it, he became so feverish,
as made him more fit for Bedlam than any
other place ; but the surgeon giving him a
sleepy dose, he was perfectly composed the next
morning, - -
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of
the young priest. At his entrance on board
the ship, he fell on his face in the most humble
rostration to the Almighty. I thought, indeed,
}. had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help
him up; but he modestly told me, he was re-
turning his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me
to leave him a few moments, and that, next to
his Creator, he would return me thanks also.
And, indeed, he did so in some minutes
after , with great seriousness and affection ,
while the tears stood in his eyes, which con-
vinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor
did he less shew his piety and wisdom, in ap-
plying himself to his country people, and la-
bouring to compose them by the most power-
ful reasons, arguments, and persuasions. And
when, indeed, these P. had taken their
might's repose in such lodgings as our ship "
could allow, we found nothing but the best of
manners, and the most civil acknowledge-
ments, for which the French are eminently re-
markable. The next day the captain and one
of the priests desired to speak with me, and
my nephew the commander. They told us,
that they had saved some money and valuable
things out of the ruined vessel, which was at
our service : only that they desired to be set
on shore some where in our way. At the first,
my nephew was for accepting the money; but
I (who knew how hard my case would have
been, had the Portuguese captain served me so)
ersuaded him to the contrary; and therefore
told them, that as we had done nothing but
what we were obliged to do by nature and
humanity, and what we ourselves might ex-
pect from others in such a calamity, so we took
them up to save them, not to plunder them,
or leave them naked upon land, to perish for
want of subsistence, and therefore would not
accept their money; but as to landing them,
that was a great difficulty; for, being bound to
the East Indies, it was impossible wilfully to
change our voyage upon their particular ac-
count, nor could my nephew (who was un-
der charter - parly to pursue it by way of
Brazil) answer it to the freighters. All that we
could do, was to put ourselves in the way of
meeting some ships homeward bound from the
VVest Indies, that, if possible, they might get a
passage to France or England. Indeed, they
were very thankful for our first kindness; but
were under great concern, especially the pas-
sengers, at their being carried to the East In-
dies. They begged, therefore, I would keep
- K. 5
on the banks of Newfoundland, where, pro-
bably, they might meet with some ship or sloop
to carry them to Canada, whence they came.
As this was but a reasonable request, I was in-
elined to grant it, since it was no breach of
charter-party, and that the laws of God and na-
ture obliged us to do what good we could to
our fellow-creatures ; besides, we ourselves
might be in danger for want of provisions.
So we consented to carry them to Newfound-
land, if wind and weather would permit; if
not, that we should carry them to Martinico
in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in
a week's time, we made the banks of New-
foundland, where the French people hired a
bark to carry them to France. But the young
priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, I
readily agreed to it, because I liked his conver-
sation, and two or three of the French sailors.
also entered themselves on board our ship.
Now, directing our course for the West In-
dies, steering S. and S. by E. about twenty days
with little wind, another adventure happened,
to exercise our humanity. In the latitude of 27
degrees 5 minutes north, the 19th of March.
1694-5, we perceived a sail (our course S. E.
and by S.) which bore up to us, and then she
appeared to be a large vessel, having lost her
main top-mast, fore-mast and boltsprit ; when
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N.
N.W. we soon came to speak with her. She
was a ship of Bristol bound home from Barba-
does, out of which road she had been forced
by a hurricane to the westward, in which they
lost their masts. -
They told us, their expectations were to see
the Bahama islands, but were driven away
by a strong wind at N. N. W. and having no
sails to work the ship with, but the main course,
and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-
mast, because they could not come near the
land, were endeavouring to stand for the Ca-
naries; nay, what was worse, besides all their
fatigue, they were almost starved for want of
provision, having ate nothing for eleven days;
all that they had aboard was sugar, a barrel of
fresh water, and seven casks of rum. In this
ship were three passengers, a youth, his mo–
ther, and a maid servant, who were in a most
deplorable condition for want of food. If I
had not gone on board their ship, the know-
ledge of their misery had been concealed from
me, and they would have inevitably perished,
though, indeed, their second mate (who was
captain, by reason the true captain was not on
board when the hurricane happened) had be-
fore informed me that there were such persons
on board, whom he supposed to be dead, be-
ing afraid to inquire after them, because he had
- nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we
resolved to let them have what we could spare,
ordering the mate to bring some of his men on
board us, which he did accordingly; as he and
they looked i. skeletons, when meat was set
before them, I ordered them to eat sparingly.
But, however, they soon fell sick; which o-
bliged the surgeon to mix something in their
broth, which was to be to them both food and
physic. When they were fed, we ordered
our mate to carry them a sack of bread; and
, four or five pieces of beef; but the surgeon
charged them to see it boiled, gº." keep a
- K -
guard on the cook-room, to prevent the men
from eating it raw, and consequently killing
themselves with what was designed for their
relief. But, particularly, I desired the mate to
see what condition the poor passengers were
in, and the surgeon gave him a . of the
same broth which he had prepared for the men.
And being curious to see this scene of misery
myself, I took the captain (as we called the
mate of the ship) in our own boat, and sailed
after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed I scarce were
the victuals half boiled in the pot, but they
were ready to break open the cook-room door.
To stay their stomachs, the mate gave them bis-
cuits, which were dipped in, .# softened with
the liquor of the meat, which they call Breuise;
telling them it was for their own safety that
he was obliged to give them but a little at a time:
and so feeding them gradually, their bellies were
*comfortably filled, and the men did very well
, again. But when they came to the poor gentle-
'woman in the cabin, who for several days
had continued without food, giving what she
had to her son, they found her as it were in
the arms of death. She was sitting upon the
"floor of the deck, with her back up against the
sides, between two chairs, which were lashed
fast, and her head shrunk between her shoul-
ders, like a senseless corpse. Nothing was want-
ing in my mate to revive and encourage her ;
opening her lips, and putting some broth into
her mouth with a spoon. But not having
strength to speak, she lifted up her head with
much difficulty, intimating that it was now too
late, at the same time pointing to the youth her
son, as though she desired him to do what he
could to save the lad; and in a little while af-
ter she died. -
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet
lay stretched out in a cabin bed like one that
had scarce any life. In his mouth was a piece
of an old glove, the rest of which he had eaten
up. At first he vomited what the mate had
given him ; but at length began sensibly to re-
vive, though in the greatest concern for the
death of his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress,
like one in the last pangs of death : her limbs
were distorted, one of her hands was clasped
round the frame of a chair, which she griped
so hard, that it was with some difficulty we
separated her from it: her other arm lay over
her head, and her feet lay both together, set fast
against the frame of the cabin table : not only
being starved with hunger, but overcome with
grief for the loss of her mistress, whom she lov-
ed most tenderly. It was a great while before
the surgeon could bring her to life, and a much
longer time before she came to her senses.
After we had sailed with them some days,
we sent them five barrels of beef, one of pork,
two hogsheads of biscuit, with pease, flower,
and other things ; taking three casks of sugar,
some rum, and some pieces of eight for satisfac-
tion, we left them, but took the youth and
maid with us, with all their goods. The lad
was about seventeen years old, very handsome,
modest, sensible, and well bred, but mightily
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother,
having lost his father at Barbadoes but a few
months before. He besought the surgeon to
intercede with me to take him out of the ship;
for that the sailors, not sparing a small suste-
nance, had starved his mother. But hunger has
no bounds, no right, and consequently is inca–
pable of any compassion. When the surgeon
told him that our voyage might put him in bad
circumstances, and farther off from his friends,
he answered, he did not care, so he was deli-
vered from that terrible crew : that as the ca
tain (meaning me) had saved him from death,
so he was sure he would do him no harm";
and as for the maid, when she should be restored
to her senses, she would be no less thankful, let
us carry them where we would. And, indeed,
the surgeon so represented their case to me,
that I consented, and took them on board
with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads
of sugar; but the youth having a bill of lad-
ing, I made the commander oblige himself to
deliver a letter and the deceased widow's goods
to Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Bristol; but I
believe the ship was lost at sea, for we could
never, hear what became of her afterwards.
We were now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32
min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage.
But, passing by several little incidents relating
to wind and weather, I shall relate what is
most remarkable concerning my little king-
dom, to which I was then drawing near. I
had great difficulty in finding it: for as I came
to, and went from it before, on the south and
east side of the island, as coming from the Bra-
zils ; so now approaching between the main
and the island, not having any chart for the
coast, nor land-mark, it obliged us to land
on several islands on the mouth of the river
*
Oroonoko, but to no purpose. This I perceiv-
ed, that what I thought was a continent before,
was no such thing, but a long island, or rather
a ridge of sands. On one of these islands I
found some Spaniards, but they belonged to
the Isle de Trinidad, who came hither in a
sloop to make salt, and to try to find some pearl
muscles. But, at length, I came fair on the
south side of my island, and then I presently
knew the countenance of my little kingdom;
so we brought the ship safe to an anchor, broad-
side within the little creek, where stood my an-
cient and venerable castle. ,
No sooner did I see the place, but calling
for Friday, I asked him where he was 7 But
when he looked a little, he clapped his hands,
crying: Ojoy, Othere, Oyes, Othere 4 pointin
to our old ... and then fell a dancing an
capering as if he was mad, and I had . ado
to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim
a-shore. Friday, said I, what do you think, shall
we go and see your father? At the mention-
ing his father's name, the poor affectionate crea-
ture fell a weeping: No, no, says he, me see him
no more, never see poor father more 1 he long
ago die, die long ago; he much old man. You
don’t know that, Friday, said I; but shall we
see any body else?. He looks about, and point-
ing to the hill above my house, cries out : We
see, we see, there much men and there! which,
though I could not perceive them with my per-
spective glass, was true, by what the men them-
selves told me the next day.
When the English ancient was spread, and
three guns fired as a signal of friendship, we
perceived a smoke rise from the creek; upon
which I ordered the boat out, taking Friday
with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce,
I went on shore, accompanied also by the
young friar, to whom I had related the history
of the first part of my life: besides we had six-
teen men well armed, in case we had met with
any opposition.
After we had rowed directly into the creek,
the first man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spa-
niard, whose life I had saved, and whose face
I perfectly well knew. I ordered them all to
stay in the boat for a while; but Friday, per-
ceiving his father at a distance, would have
jumped into the sea, had they not let the boat
go. No sooner was he on shore, but he flew
like a swift arrow out of a bow to embrace
his aged father. Certainly it should melt a man
of the firmest resolution into the soflest tears
to see with what uncommon transports of joy
he saluted him; he first kissed him, then stroked
his face, took him in his arms, laid him under
a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as
-earnest at him as one would do at a picture,
for a quarter of an hour together. After this,
he would lie upon the ground, stroke his legs,
and kiss them, then get up and stare at him,
as though he was bewitched; but the next day
one could not forbear laughter to see his beha-
viour, for he would walk several hours with
his father along the shore, leading him by the
hand, as though he was a lady; while, every
now and then he would run to the boat, to get
something for him, as a lump of sugar, dram,
biscuit, or something or other that was good.
His frolics ran in another channel in the af-
ternoon; for when he set old Friday on the
ground, he would dance round him, making
comical postures and gestures, and all this
while would be telling him one story or other
of his travels and adventures.
It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695, that
I set my foot upon the island a second time.
When my faithful Spaniard, accompanied by
one more, approached the boat, he little knew
who I was, till I discovered myself to him :
Senhor, said I in Portuguese, don’t you know
me? He spoke never a word, but giving his
musket to his attendant, extended his arms, and
saying something in Spanish, that I did not
then understand, he came forward, and em-
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to
know his deliverer, who, like an angel sent
from heaven, had saved his life. He then
beckoned to the man to call out his compa-
nions, asking me, if I would walk to my own
habitation, and take possession, where I should
find some mean improvements : but indeed
they were extraordinary ones ; for they had
planted so many trees so close together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none could
find out, except themselves, who knew its in-
tricate windings. I asked him the meaning of
all these fortifications; he told me he would
give me a large account of what had passed
since my departure to this time, and how he
had subdued some English, who thought to be
their murderers, hoping I would not be dis-
pleased, since necessity compelled them to it.
As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told
him, that I was not only far from finding fault
with it, but was rather heartily glad that they
had subdued them. VVhile we were thus talk-
ing, the man whom he had sent returned, ac-
companied by eleven more, but in such habits,
that it was impossible to tell what nations they
were of. He first turned to me, and pointing
to them : These, Sir, said he, are some of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to your good-
ness. Then turning to them and pointing to
me, he made them sensible who I was ; and
then indeed they saluted me one by one ; not
as ordinary men, but as though they had been
ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumphant
conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed
with a manlike majestic gravity, but at the same
time was so obliging and courteous, as made
them admirable to the last degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions
of my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's
own mouth, I must here insert what I omitted
in my former relation. The matter is thus :
Just before we weighed anchor to set sail, there
happened a quarrel on board the ship, which
had like to have occasioned a second mutiny,
till such time as the courageous captain, taking
two of the most refractory prisoners, laid them
in irons, threatening, as they were concerned
in the former disorders, to have them hanged
in England for running away with the ship.
This frightened some of the rest, as thinking
the captain would serve them in the same man-
mer, though he seemed to give them good
words for the present. But the mate having
intelligence of this, made me acquainted with
their fears; so that, to make them more easy,
and ourselves more safe from their conspira-
cies, I was obliged to go down, and pass my
honour's word for it, that, upon their good he-
*
haviour, all that was past should be pardoned;
in testimony of which I ordered the two men's
irons to be taken off, and themselves forgiven.
But as this had brought us to an anchor that
might, in which there was a calm, the two men
that had been in irons, stole each of them a
musket, and some other weapons, and taking
the ship's pinnace, not yet haled up, ran away
to their brother rogues. The next morning
we sent the long boat, with men to pursue
them ; but all in vain : the mate, in revenge,
would have demolished my little castle, burnt
its furniture, and destroyed their plantations;
but having no orders for it, he did not put it
in execution. And thus there were five En-
glishmen in the island, which caused great dif-
ferences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a
perfect account of it in the following manner.
You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy
you sent me about, and what a disappointment
we met with, by your absence, at our return.
There is but little variety in the relation of our
voyage, being blessed with calm weather, and
smooth sea. Great, indeed, was the joy of my
countrymen to see me alive, having acted as
the principal man on board, the captain of the
shipwrecked vessel dying, before ; nor was
their surprise less, as knowing I was taken pri-
soner by the savages of another nation, they
thought me long since entombed in their mon-
strous bowels... But when I shewed them the
arms, ammunition and provisions I had brought
for them, they looked upon me as a second Jo-
seph advanced in Pharaoh's court, and imme-
diately prepared to come along with me. In-
deed, they were obliged to trespass upon their
friendly savages by borrowing two of their
canoes, under a pretext for fishing : and they
came away the next morning, but without any
provisions of their own, except a few roots,
which served them instead of bread. After
three weeks absence, we arrived at your habi-
tation. Here we met with three English sai-
lors, who, I confess, gave us provisions, and
that letter of directions you had left for us,
which informed us how to bring up tame goats,
blant corn, cure grapes, make pots; and, in
short, every thing that was necessary for our
use ; as, in particular, I knew your method
best, so taking Friday's father to assist me, we
managed all the affairs; nor were the rest of
the Spaniards wanting in their kind offices.
dressing food for the Englishmen, who did
nothing but ramble and divert themselves in
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catch-
ing tortoises. But we had not been long a-
shore, before we were informed of two more
Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their
common place of residence by the three others
above mentioned : this made my Spaniards
and me (whom they now looked upon as
their governor in your absence) endeavour to
persuade them to take them in, that we might
be as one family; but all our entreaties were
in vain; so that the poor fellows, finding no-
thing to be done without industry, pitched
their tents on the north side of the island, a
little inclining to the west, for fear of savages.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge, and
the other to lay their stores in ; for my good na-
tured Spaniards giving them some seeds, they
dug and planted as I had done, and began to
live prettily. But while they were thus com-
fortably going on, the three unnatural brutes,
their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour,
insulted them, by saying, the governor (mean-
ing you) had given them possession of the is—
land, and d-mn 'em, they should build no
houses upon their ground, without paying rent,
The two honest men (for so let me now dis-
tinguish them ) thought their three country-
men only jested, and one of them invited them
in, to see their fine habitations; while the other
facetiously told them, that since they built tene-
ments with great improvements, they should,
according to the custom of landlords, give
them a longer lease ; at the same time desiring
them to fetch a scrivener to draw the writings,
One of the wretches swearing he should pay
for the jest, snatched up a fire-brand; and clap-
ping it to the outside of their hut, very fairly
set it on fire, which would soon have consum-
ed it, had not the honest man thrust him away,
and trod it out with his feet. Hereupon the
fellow returns with a pole, with which he
would have ended his days, had not the poor
man avoided the blow ; when, fetching his
musket, he knocked down the villain that be-
gan the quarrel. The other two coming to assist
their fellow, obliged the second honest man to
take his musket also, and both of them present-
ing their pieces, bid the villains stand off; and
if they did not lay down their arms, death
should decide the dispute one way or other,
This brought them to a parley, in which they
agreed to take their wounded man and be gone
but they were in the wrong that they did not
disarm them when they had the power, and
them make their complaint to me and my Spa-
niards for justice, which might have prevenied
their further designs against them. "And in-
deed so many trespasses did they afterwards
commit, by treading down their corn, shoot-
ing their young kids and goats, and plaguing
them night and day, that they resolved to come
to my castle, challenge all the three, and decide
their right by one plain battle, while the Spa-
niards stood by to see fair play. One day it
happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of
whom understood English ) being in the
woods, were met by one of the honest men,
who complained how barbarous their coun-
trymen had been in destroying their corn, kill-
ing their milk-goats, and three kids, which de-
prived them of their subsistence ; that if we
did not grant them relief, they must be inevita-
bly starved ; and so they parted : but when
my Spaniards came home at night, and supper
being on the table, one of them began to re-
prehend the Englishmen, but in a very man-
herly way; which they resenting, replied :
What business had their countrymen there
without leave, when it was none of their
ground 7 Why, said my Spaniard calmly,
Inglese, they must not starve. But they re-
plied : Let them starve and be d-mn’d; they
should neither plant nor build; and d-mn them,
they should be their servants, and work for
them; for the island was theirs, and they would
burn all the huts they should find in the land.
By this rule, said my Spaniard smiling, we
shall be your servants too. Aye, by G-d, and
so you shall, replied the impudent rascal. Up-
on which, starting up, Will. Atkins cries :
z
Come, Jack, let's have t'other brush with them;
who dare to build in our dominions? Thus
leaving us something heated with a just passion,
away they trooped, every man having a gun,
pistol, and sword, muttering some threatening
words, that we could then but imperfectly un-
derstand. That night they designed to mur-
der their two companions, and slept till mid-
night in the bower, thinking to fall upon them
in their sleep : nor were the honest men less
thoughtful concerning them; for, at this junc-
ture, they were coming to find them out, but in
a much fairer way. As soon as the villains
came to the huts, and found nobody there, they
concluded that I and my Spaniards had given
them notice, and therefore swore to be reveng-
ed on us. Then they demolished the poor mens
habitation; not by fire, as they attempted be-
fore, but pulled down their houses, limb from
limb, not leaving stick nor stone on the ground
where they stood ; broke their household stuff
in pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their in-
closures, and, in short, quite ruined them of
every thing they had. Had these people met
together, no doubt but there should have been
a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for
the better; for just as the three were got thi-
ther, the two were at our castle; and, when
they left us, the three came back again, but in
a great rage, scoffingly telling us what they had
done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's
hat, twirls it round, saying : And you, Senhor,
Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if
3 ou don’t mend your manners. My Spaniard,
a grave, but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his fist, at which ano-
ther villain fired his pistol, and narrowly miss-
ed his body, but wounded him a little in the
ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes up
the fellow's musket whom he had knocked
down, and would have shot him, if I and the
rest had not come out, and taken their arms
from every one of them. *.
- These Englishmen , perceiving they had
made all of us their enemies, began to cool; but,
notwithstanding their better words, the Spa-
niards would not return them their arms again,
telling them, they would do them no manner
of harm, if they would live peaceably; but, if
they offered any injury to the plantation or
castle, they would shoot them as they would
do ravenous beasts. This made them so mad,
that they went away raging like furies of hell.
They were no sooner gone, but in came the
two honest men, fired with the justest rage, if
such can be, having been ruined as aforesaid.
And, indeed, it was very hard, that nineteen of
us should be bullied by three villains, conti-
nually offending with impunity.
It was a great while, Sir, before we could
persuade the two Englishmen from pursuing,
and undoubtedly killing them with their fire-
arms; but we promised them justice should
be done them, and in the mean time they
should reside with us in our habitation. In
about five days after, these three vagrants, al-
most starved with hunger, drew near our
grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and
two others, walking by the side of the creek,
they very submissively desired to be received
into the family again. We told them of their
great incivility to us, and of their unnatural bar.
barity to their countrymen; but yet we would
see what the rest agreed to, and in half an
hour's time would bring them word. After
some debate we called them in, where their
two countrymen laid a heavy charge against
them for not only ruining, but designing to
murder them, which they could not deny. But
here I was forced to interpose as a mediator b
obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt them,
being naked and unarmed, and that the other
three should make them restitution by build-
ing their two huts, and fencing their ground
in the same manner as it was before. Well, be-
ing in a miserable condition, they submitted to
this at present and lived some time regularly
enough, except as to the working part, which
they did not care for; but the Spaniards would
have dispensed with that, had they continued
easy and quiet. Their arms being given them
again, they scarce had them a week, when they
became as troublesome as ever; but an acci-
dent happening soon after, obliged us to lay
aside private resentments, and look to our com-
mon preservation.
One night, Sir, I went to bed perfectly well
in health, and yet by no means could I com—
pose myself to sleep. Upon which, being very
uneasy I got up and looked out ; but, be-
ing dark, I could perceive nothing but the
trees around our castle. I went to bed again;
but it was all one I could not sleep; when
one of my Spaniards hearing me walk about,
asked who was up 7 I answered, it is I.
When I told him the occasion; Sir, said he,
such things are not to be slighted; for certainly
there is some mischief plotling near us. Where
L
are the Englishmen? said I. He answered, In
their huts; for they lay separate from us, Sir,
since the last mutiny, Kºi. said I, some kind
spirit gives this information for our advan-
tage. Come, let us go abroad, and see if any
thing offers to justify our fears. Upon which
I and some of my Spaniards went up the moun-
tain, not by the ladder, but through the grove;
and then we were struck with a panic fear on
seeing a light, as though it were a fire, at a very
little distance, and hearing the voice of several
men. Hereupon we retreated immediately,
and raising the rest of our forces, made them
sensible of the impending danger; but, with
, all my authority, I could not make them stay
where they were, so earnest were they to see
how things went. Indeed, the darkness of the
night gave them opportunity enough to view
them (by the light of the fire) undiscovered.
As they were in different parties, and strag-
gling over the shore, we were much afraid
that they should find out our habitations, and
destroy our flocks of goats, To prevent which,
we sent an Englishman and two Spaniards to
drive the goals into the valley where the cave
lay; or, if there was occasion, into the cave
itself. As to ourselves, resuming our native
courage and prudent conduct, had we not
been divided, we durst venture to attack an
hundred of them ; but before it was yet light
we resolved to send out Friday's father as a spy,
who immediately stripping himself naked,
gets among them undiscovered, and in two
hours time brings word that they were two
parties of two different nations, who lately hav-
sing a bloody battle with one another, happened
to land by mere chance in the same island
to devour their miserable prisoners: that they
were entirely ignorant of any person's inha-
biting here; but rather, being filled with rage
and fury againstone another, he believed, that,
as soon as day-light appeared, there would be
a terrible engagement. Old Friday had scarce
ended his relation, when we heard an uncom-
mon noise, and perceived that there was a
horrid engagement between the two armies.
Such was the curiosity of our party, espe-
cially the Englishmen, that they would not lie
close, though Old Friday told then their safety
depended upon it ; and that, if we had pa -
tience, we should behold the savages kill one
another. However, they used some caution
by going further into the woods, and placin
themselves in a convenient place to behold the
battle. w
Never could there be a more bloody en-
gagement, nor men of more invincible spirits
and prudent conduct, according to their way
and manner of fighting. It lasted near two
hours, till that party which was nearest to our
castle began to decline, and, at last, to fly from
their conquerors. We were undoubtedly put
into a great consternation on this account, lest
they should run into our grove, and consequent.
ly bring us into the like danger. Hereupon,
we resolved to kill the first that came, to pre-
vent discovery; and that too with our swords
and the butt end of our muskets, for fear the
report of our guns should be heard.
And so indeed, as we thought, it happened:
for three of the vanquished army crossing the
creek, ran directly to the place, I." to a thick
2
wood, for shelter ; nor was it long before our
scout gave us notice of it; as also, that the vic-
tors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon
this I would not suffer them to be slain, but
had them surprised and taken by our party :
and afterwards they proved very good servants
to us, being stout young creatures, and able to
do a great deal of work. The remainder of
the conquered savages fled to their canoes and
put out into the ocean, while the conquerors
joining together shouted by way of triumph,
and about three in the afternoon they also em-
barked for their own nation. Thus we were
244 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
not perceiving any of these creatures for some
considerable time after. VVe found two and
thirty men dead in the field of battle ; some
were slain with long arrows, which we found
sticking in their bodies; and the rest were kill-
ed with great unwieldy wooden swords, which
denoted their vast strength, and of which we
found seventeen, besides bows and arrows :
but we could not find one wounded creature
among them alive; for they either kill their
enemies quite, or carry those wounded away
with them.
This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for
some time, considering how unfortunate they
might have been had they fallen into their
hands, who would not only kill them as ene-
mies, but also for food, as we do cattle; and,
indeed, so much did this nauseate their sto-
machs, that it not only made them very sick,
but more tractable to the common necessary
business of the whole society, planting, sowing,
and reaping, with the greatest signs of amily
º
and friendship : so that now, being all good
friends, we began to consider of circumstances
in general ; and the first thing we thought of
was, whether as we perceived the savages
haunted that side of the island, and there be-
ing more retired parts of it, and yet as well
suited to our manner of living, and equally
to our advantage, we oughl not rather to change
our place of residence, and plant it in a much
safer place, both for the security of our corn
and cattle. º
After a long debate on this head, it was re-
solved or rather voted, nemine contradicente,
not to remove our ancient castle, and that for
this very good reason, that some time or other
we expected to hear from our supreme gover-
nor (meaning you, Sir), whose messengers not
finding us there, might think the place demo-
lished, and all his subjects destroyed by the
savages. -wº
As to the next concern relating to our corn
and cattle, we consented to have them removed
to the valleywhere the cave was, that being most
proper and sufficient for both. But yet, when
we considered further, we altered one part of
our resolution ; which was, to remove part of
our cattle thither, and plant only part of our
corn there ; so that in case one part was de-
stroyed, the other might be preserved. Ano-
ther resolution we took, which really had a
great deal of prudence in it; and that was, in
not trusting the three savages, whom we had
taken prisoners, with any knowledge of the
plantalions which we had made in that valley,
of what number of cattle we had there, much
less of the cave, wherein were kept several
- I, 3
arms, and two barrels of powder you left for
us, at your departure from this island. But
though we would not change our habitation,
we resolved to make it more fortified arid
more secret. To this end, Sir, as you had
planted trees at some distance before the en-
trance of your palace ; so we, imitating your
example, planted and filled up the whole space
of ground, even to the banks of the creek, nay,
into the very ooze, where the tide flowed, not
leaving a place for landing : and among those
I had planted, they had intermingled so many
short ones, all of which growing wonderfully
fast and thick, a little dog scarcely could find a
passage through them. Nor was this sufficient,
as we thought; for we did the same to all the
ground to the right and left hand of us, even
to the top of the hill, without so much as leav-
ing a passage for ourselves, except by the lad-
der : which being taken down, nothing but
what had wings or witchcraft could pretend
to come near us. And, indeed, this was ex-
ceedingly well contrived, especially to serve
that occasion, for which we afterwards found
it necessary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retire-
ment, having all this time not one visit from
the savages. Indeed one morning we had an
alarm which put us in some amazement; for
a few of my Spaniards being out very early,
perceived no less than twenty canoes as it
were coming on shore; upon which, returning
home with great precipitation, they gave us
the alarm, which obliged us to keep at home
all that day and the next, going out only in
the night-time to make our observations: but,
as good luck would have it, they were upon
another design, and did not land that time up-
on the island.
But now there happened another quarrel
between the three wicked Englishmen and
some of my Spaniards. The occasion was this:
One of them being enraged at one of the sa-
vages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not
being able to comprehend something which he
was shewing him, snatched up a hatchet in a
great fury, not to correct, but to kill him; yet
missing his head, gave him such a barbarous
cut in the shoulder, that he had like to have
struck off his arm ; at which one of my good-
natured Spaniards interposed between the En-
glishman and savage, besought the former not
to murder the poor creature; but this kind-
ness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life,
for the Englishman struck at him in the same
manner; which he nimbly and wisely avoid-
ing, returned suddenly upon him with his sho-
vel (being all at work about their corn-land),
and very fairly knocked the brutish creature
down. Hereupon, another Englishman, com-
ing to his fellow’s assistance, laid the good Spa-
niard on the earth; when immediately two
others coming to his relief were attacked by
the third Englishman armed with an old cut-
lass, who wounded them both. This uproar
soon reached our ears, when we rushing out
upon them took the three Englishmen priso-
ners ; and then our next question was, what
should be done to such mutinous and impu-
dent fellows, so furious, desperate, and idle,
that they were mischievous to the highest de-
L 4
gree, and consequently not safe for the society
to let them live among them.
Now, Sir, as I was governor in your ab–
sence, so I also took the authority of a judge ;
and, having them brought before me, I told
them, that if they had been of my country, I
would have hanged every mother's son of them;
but, since it was an Englishman ( meaning
you, kind Sir) to whom we were indebted for
our preservation and deliverance, I would in
gratitude use them with all possible mildness;
but, at the same time, leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who, I hop-
ed., forgetting their resentments, would deal
impartially by them.
Hereupon, one of his countrymen stood up:
Sir, said he, leave it not to us, for you may be
sensible we have reason to sentence them to the
gollows : besides, Sir, this fellow, Will. At-
kins, and the two others, proposed-to us, that
we might murder you all in your sleep, which
we would not consent to ; but, knowing their
inability and your vigilance, we did not think
fit to discover it before now.
How, Seignior, said I, do you hear what is
alledged against you ? VVhat can you say to
justify so horrid an action as to murder us in
cold blood 7 So far, Sir, was the wretch from
denying it, that he swore, d-mn him but he
would do it still. But what have we done to you,
Seignior Atkins, said I, or what will you gain
by killing us? What shall we do to prevent
you ? Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why
will you, Seignior Atkins ( said I smiling),
put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a
fatal necessity? But so great a rage did my scof-
fing and yet severe jest put him into, that he
was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had
attempted to kill me if he had been possessed
of weapons, and had not been prevented by
three Spaniards. This unparalleled and villain-
ous carriage made us seriously consider what
was to be done. The two Englishmen and the
Spaniard, who had saved the poor Indian's
life, mightily petitioned me to hang one of
them for an example to the others, which
should be he that had twice attempted to com-
mit murder with his hatchet, it being at that
time thought impossible the poor slave should
recover. But they could never gain my con-
sent to put him to death, for the reasons above
mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even
yourself) who was my deliverer: and as mer-
ciful counsels are most prevailing, when ear-
nestly pressed, so I got them to be of the same
opinion as to clemency. . But to prevent their
doing us any further mischief, we all agreed
that they should have no weapons, as sword,
gun, powder, or shot, but be expelled from
the society to live as they pleased by themselves;
that neither the two Englishmen, not the rest
of the Spaniards, should have conversation
with them upon any account whatsoever: that
they should be kept from coming within a cer-
tain distance of our castle; and if they dared
to offer us any violence, either by spoiling,
burning, killing, or destroying any of the corn,
plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging
to the society, we would shoot them as freely
as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever
places we should find them.
This sentence seemed very jº,” all but

25o LIFE AND ADVENTURES
called out to the two honest Englishmen, say—
ing : You must consider they ought not to be
starved neither; and since it will be some time
before they can raise corn and cattle of their
own, let us give them some corn to last them.
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which
time they'll raise some for themselves : let us
also bestow upon them six milk-goats, four
he-ones, and six kids, as well for their pre-
sent support as for a further increase ; with
iools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an
axe, saw, and other things convenient to build
them huts : all which were agreed to; but be—
fore they took them in possession, I obliged
them solemnly to swear, never to attempt any
ihing against us or their countrymen for the
future. Thus dismissing them from our so-
ciety, they went away sullen and refractory, as
though neither willing to go nor stay: how-
ever, seeing no remedy, they took what pro-
vision was given them, proposing to chuse a
convenient place where they might live by
ihemselves. -
About five days after, they came to those li-
imits appointed in order to get more victuals, and
sent me word by one of my Spaniards, whom
ihey called to, where they had pitched their
tents, and marked themselves out an habita-
tion and plantation at the N. E. and most re-
mole part of the island. And, indeed, there
they built themselves two very handsome col--
tages, resembling our little castle, being under
the side of a mountain, with some trees al-
ready growing on three sides of it; so that
planting a few more, it would be obscured
from sight, unless particularly sought for.
VVhen these huts were finished, we gave them
some dry goat-skins for bedding and cover-
ing ; and upon their giving us fuller assu-
rances of their good behaviour for the future,
we gave them some pease, barley, and rice for
sowing, and whatever tools we could spare.
Six months did they live in this separate con-
dition, in which they got their first harvest in,
the quantity of which was but small, because
they had planted but little land: for indeed, hav-
ing all their plantations to beformed, made it the
more difficult, especially as it was a thing out
of their element; and when they were obliged
io make their boards and pots, etc. they could
make little or nothing of it. But the rainy sea-
son coming on, put them into a greater per-
plexity for want of a cave to keep their corn
dry, and prevent it from spoiling; and so much
did this humble them, that they begged of my
Spaniards to help them, to which the good-
natured men readily consented, and in four
days space worked a great hole in the side of
the hill for them, large enough for their pur-
pose, to secure their corn and other things from
the rain, though not comparable to ours, which
had several additional apartments.
But a new whim possessed these rogues a-
bout three quarters of a year after, which had
like to have ruined us, and themselves too: for,
it seems being tired and weary of this sort of
living, which made them work for themselves,
without hopes of changing their condition, no-
thing would serve them, but they would make
a voyage to the continent, and try if they could
seize upon some of the savages, º º g thern
over as slaves, to do their drudgery, while they
lived at ease and pleasure.
Indeed the project was not so preposterous,
if they had not gone farther; but they neither
did nor proposed any thing, but what had mis-
chief in the design, or the event. One morning,
these three fellows came down to the limited
slation, and humbly desired to be admitted to
talk with us, which we readily granted; they
told us in short, that being tired of thºr man-
ner of living and the labour of |...". in
such employments, not being sufficient to pro-
cure the necessaries of life, they only desired
one of the canoes we came over in, with some
arms and ammunition for their defence, and
they would seek their fortunes abroad, and
never trouble us any more. To be sure, we
were glad enough to get rid of such wretched
plagues; but yet honesty made usingenuously
represent to them, by what we ourselves had
suffered, the certain destruetion they were run-
ning into, either of being starved to death, or
murdered by the savages. To this they very
audaciously replied, that they neither could
nor would work; and consequently, that they
might as well be starved abroad as at home :
and as to their falling into the hands of the sa-
vages, why, if they were murdered, that was
nothing to us, there was an end of them ; nei-
ther had they any wives or children to cry after
them; nay, so intent were they upon their
voyage, that if the Spaniards had not given
them arms, so they had but the canoe, they
would have gone without them.
Theugh we could not well spare our fire-
arms, rather than they should go like maked

men, we let them have two muskets, a pistol, a
cutlass, and three hatchets, which were thought
very sufficient : we gave them also goats flesh,
a great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh
butter, a young live kid, and a large canoe suf-
ficient to carry twenty men. “And thus, with
a mast made of a long pole, and a sail of six
large goat-skins dried, having a fair breeze,
and a flood tide with them, they merrily sailed
away, the Spaniards calling after them Bueno
viage , no man ever expecting to see them
more. --
When they were gone, the Spaniards and
Englishmen would often say one to another :
O how peaceably do we now live, since those
turbulent fellows have left us / Nothing could
be farther from their thoughts than to behold
their faces any more ; and yet scarce two and
twenty days had passed over their heads, but
one of the Englishmen, being abroad a plant-
ing, perceived at a distance three men well
armed approaching towards him. Away he
flies with speed to our castle, and tells me and
the rest, that we were all undone, for that
strangers were landed upon the island, and
who they were he could not tell ; but ad-
ded, that they were not savages, but men ha-
bited, bearing arms. Why then, said I, we
have the less occasion to be concerned, since
if they are not Indians they must be friends;
for I am sure there is no Christian people upon
earth, but what will do us good . than
harm. But while we were considering of
the event, up came the three Englishmen,
whose voices we quickly knew, and so all our
admiration of that nature ceased at once. And
our wonder was succeeded by another sort of
inquiry, which was, what could be the occa-
sion of their returning so quickly to the island,
when we little expected, and much less desir-
ed their company? But as this was better to be
related by themselves, I ordered them to be
brought in, when they gave me the following
relation of their voyage.
After two days sail, or something less, they
reached land, where they found the people
coming to give them another sort of reception
than what they expected or desired : for as the
savages were armed with bows and arrows,
they durst not venture on shore, but steered
northward six or seven hours till they gained
an opening, by which they plainly perceived,
that the land that appeared from this place,
was not the main land, but an island. At
their entrance into the opening of the sea, they
discovered another island on the right hand
northward, and several more lying to the west-
ward; but being resolved to go on shore some
where or other, they put over to one of the
western islands. Here they found the natives
very courteous to them, giving them several
roots and dried fish ; nay, even their women
too were as willing to supply them with what
they could procure them to eat, bringing it a
great way to them upon their heads. Among
these hospitable Indians they continued some
days, inquiring by signs and tokens, what na-
tions lay around them; and were informed,
that there were several fierce and terrible peo-
ple lived every way, accustomed to eat man-
kind; but for themselves they never used such
diet, except those that were taken in battle, and
of them they made a solemn feast.
The Englishmen inquired how long it was
since they had a feast of that kind 2 they an-
swered, about two moons ago, pointing to the
moon, and then to two fingers; that, at this
time, their king had two hundred prisoners,
which were fattening up for the slaughter. The
Englishmen were mighty desirous of seeing the
prisoners, which the others mistaking, thought
that they wanted some of them for their own
food : upon which they beckoned to them,
pointing to the rising, and then to the setting of
the sun; meaning that by the time that it ap-
peared in the east next morning, they would
bring them some : and indeed they were as
good as their word ; for by that time they
brought eleven men and five women, just as
so many cows and oxen are brought to sea-
port towns, to victual a ship. But as brutish
as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turn-
ed at the sight. What to do in this case, they
could not tell : to refuse the prisoners, would
have been the highest affront offered to the sa-
vage gentry; and to dispose of them, they knew
not in what manner: however, they resolved
to accept them, and so gave them in return
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and
six or seven of their bullets: things which tho’
they were wholly ignorant of, yet seemed en-
tirely contented with ; and dragging the poor
wretches into the boat, with their hands bound
behind them, delivered them to the English-
men. But this obliged them to put off as soon
as they had these presents, lest the donors should
have expected two or three of them to be kill-
r
ed, and to be invited to dinner the next day :
and so taking leave with all possible respect
and thanks, though neither of them under-
stood what the others said, they sailed away
back to the first island, and there set eight of
the prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they
endeavoured to comfort, and have some con-
versation with the poor captives; but it was
impossible to make them sensible of anything;
and nothing they could say, or give, or do for
them, could make them otherwise persuaded,
but that they were unbound only to be devour-
ed: if they gave them any food, they thought
it was only to fatten them for the slaughter;
or looked at any one more particularly, the
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sa-
crifice; and even when we brought them to
our island, and began to use them with the
greatest humanity and kindness, yet they ex-
pected every day that their new masters would
devour them.
And thus, Sir, did these three strange wan-
derers conclude their unaccountable relation
of the voyage, which was both amazing and
entertaining. Hereupon, I asked them, where
their new family was 2 They told me, they had
put them into one of their huts, and they came
to beg some victuals for them. This, indeed,
made us all long to see them ; and taking
Triday's father with us, leaving only two at
our castle, we came down to behold these poor
Creatures.
When we arrived at the hut (they being
bound again by the Englishmen, for fear of es-
caping), we found them stark naked, expect-
ing their fatal tragedy; there were three lusty
men, well shaped, with straight and fair limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old ;
and five women, two of them might be from
thirty to forty, two more not above four and
twenly, and the last a comely tall maiden of
about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were
very agreeable, both in their proportion and
features, except that they were tawny, which
their modest behaviour and other graces made.
amends for, when they afterwards came to be
clothed. - *
This naked appearance, together with their
miserable circumstances, was no very com—
fortable sight to my Spaniards, who, for their
parts I may venture to say without flattery,
Sir, are men of the best behaviour, calmest
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly
be ; for they immediately ordered Friday's fa-
ther to see if he knew any of them, or if he un-
derstood what they could say. No sooner did
the old Indian appear, but he looked at them
with great seriousness ; yet, as they were not
of his nation, they were utter strangers to him,
and none could understand his speech or signs,
but one woman. This was enough to answer
the design, which was to assure them they
should not be killed, being fallen into the hands
of Christians, who abhorred, such barbarily.
VVhen they were fully satisfied of this, they
expressed their joy by such strange gestures
and uncommon tones as it is not possible for
rue to describe. But the woman, their inter-
preter, was ordered next to inquire, whether
they were content to be servants, and would
work for the men who had brought them hi-
ther to save their lives 7 Hereupon (being at
this time unbound) they fell a capering and
dancing, one taking this thing upon his shoul-
ders, and the other that, intimating, that they
were willing to do any thing for them. But
now, Sir, having women among us, and dread-
ing that it might occasion some strife, if not
blood, I asked the three men what they would
do, and how they intended to use these crea—
iures, whether as servants or women 7 One of
them very pertly and readily answered, they
would use them as both. Gentlemen, said I,
as you are your own masters, I am not going
to restrain you from that ; but, methinks, for
avoiding dissentions among you, I would only
desire you to engage, that none of you will take
more than one for a woman or a wife, and
that having taken this one, none else should
presume to touch her ; for though we have
not a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is
but reasonable, that whoever thus takes a wo—
man, should be obliged to maintain her, since
nobody else has any thing to do with her: and
this, indeed, appeared so just to all present, that
it was unanimously agreed to. The English-
men then asked my Spaniards, whether they
designed to take any of them 7 but they an-
swered, No; some declaring they had already
wives in Spain; and others, that they cared
not to join with infidels. On the reverse, the
Englishmen took each of them a temporary
wife, and so set up a new method of living.
As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the
three savage servants we had taken in the late
battle, they all lived with me in our ancient
castle; and indeed we supplied the main part
of the island with food, as necessity required.
But the most remarkable part of the story is,
how these Englishmen, who had been so much
wt variance, should agree about the choice of
these women; yet they took a good way enough
to prevent quarreling among themselves. They
set the five women in one of their huts, and
going themselves to the other, drew lots which
should have the first choice. Now, he that had
the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out
her he chose, and it is remarkable, that he took
her that was the most homely and eldest of
the number, which made the rest of the En-
glishmen exceeding merry ; the Spaniards
themselves could not but smile at it : but, as
it happened, the fellow had the best thought,
in chusing one fit for application and business:
and indeed she proved the best wife of all the
parcel. ~ *-
But when the poor creatures perceived them-
selves placed in a row, and separated one by
one, they were again seized with an unspeak-
able terror, as now thinking they were going
to be slain in earnest: and when the English-
man came to take the first, the rest set up a la-
mentable cry, clasped their arms around her
- meck, and hanging about her, took their last
farewell, as they thought, in such tremblin
agonies and affectionate embraces as woul
have softened the hardest heart in the world,
and made the dryest eyes melt into tears; nor
could they be persuaded, but that they were go-
ing to die, till such time as Friday's father made
them sensible that the Englishmen had chosen
ihem for their wives, which ended all their ter-
ror and concern upon this occasion.
Well, after this, the Englishmen went to
work, and being assisted by my good-natured
Spaniards, in a few hours they erected every
one of them a new hut or tent for their sepa-
rate lodging, since those they had already were
filled with tools, household stuff, and provision.
They all continued on the north shore of the
island, but separate as before ; the three wick-
ed ones pitching farther off, and the two ho-
nest men nearer our castle; so that the island
seemed to be peopled in three places, three
towns beginning to be built for that pyrpose.
And here I cannot but remark, what is very
common, that the two honest men had the
worst wives (I mean as to industry, cleanli-
ness, and ingenuity), while the three reprobates
enjoyed women of quite contrary qualities.
But another observation I made was in fa–
vour of the two honest men, to shew what dis-
parily there is between a diligent application to
business on the one hand, and a slothful, ne—
gligent and idle temper on the other. Both
of them had the same parcel of ground laid out,
and corn to sow, sufficient for them ; but both
did not make the same improvements, either
in their cultivation or in their planting. The
two honest men had a multitude of young trees
planted about their habitations, so that when
you approached near them, nothing appeared
but a wood, very pleasing and delightful. Eve-
ry thing they did prospered and flourished ;
their grapes planted in order seemed as though
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely
preferable to any of the others. Nor were they
wanting to find out a place of retreat, but dug
a cave in the most retired part of a thick wood
to secure their wives and children, with their
provision and chief goods, surrounded with
innumerable stakes, and having a most subtle
entrance, in case any mischief should happen,
either from their fellow countrymen, or the
devouring savages.
As to the reprobates (though I must own
they were much more.civilized than before),
instead of a delightful wood surrounding their
dwellings, we found the words of King Solo-
mon too truly verified : I went by the vineyard
of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with
thorns. In many places their crop was ob-
scured by weeds; the hedges having several
gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and
eaten up the corn, and here and there was a
dead bush to stop up those gaps for the pre-
sent, which was no more than shutting the
stable-door after the steed was stolen away.
But as to their wives, they (as I observed be-
fore) were more diligent, and cleanly enough,
especially in their victuals, being instructed by
one of the honest men, who had been a cook's
mate on board a ship: and very well it was so;
for as he cooked himself, his companion and
their families lived as well as the idle husbands,
who did nothing but loiter about, fetch turtles'
eggs, catch fish and birds, and do any thing
but work, and lived accordingly; while the di-
ligent lived very handsomely and plentifully
in the most comfortable manner.
And now, Sir, I come to lay before your
eyes a scene quite different from any thing that
ever happened to us before, and perhaps ever
befel you in all the time of your residence on
this island. I shall inform you of its origin
in the following manner. -
One morning, Sir, very early, there came
five or six canoes of Indians on shore, in-
disputably upon their old custom of devour-
ing their prisoners. All that we had to do
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed,
that they, not having any notice of inhabitants,
might depart quietly, after performing their
bloody execution : whoever first discovered
the savages, was to give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and then a
proper scout was to be placed to give intelli–
gence of their departure. But, notwithstand-
ing these wise measures, an unhappy disaster
discovered us to the savages, which was like to
have caused the desolation of the whole island:
for, after the savages were gone off in their ca-
noes, some of my Spaniards and I looking a-
broad, and being inflamed with a curiosity to
see what they had been doing, to our great
amazement, beheld three savages fast asleep on
the ground, who, either being gorged, could
not awake when the others went off, or hav-
ing wandered too far into the woods, did not
come back in time.
VVhat to do with them at first, we could not
tell; as for slaves, we had enough of them al-
ready ; and as to killing them, neither Chris–
tianity nor humanity would suffer us to shed
the blood of persons who never did us wrong.
VVe perceived they had no boat left them to
transport them into their own nation ; and
that, by letting them wander about, they might
discover us, and inform the first savages that
-should happen to land upon the same bloody
occasion, which information might entirely
ruin us; and therefore I counselled my Spa-
niards to secure them, and set them about some
work or other, till we could better dispose of
them.
Hereupon we all went back, and making
them get up, took them prisoners. It is im-
possible to express the horror they were in,
especially when bound, as thinking they were
going to be murdered and eaten; but we soon
eased them of their fear as to that point. We
first took them to the bower, where the chief
of our country-work lay, as keeping goats,
planting corn, etc, and then carried them to
the two Englishmens habitation, to help them
in their business: but happy it was for us all, we
did not carry them to our castle, as by the se—
quel will appear. The Englishmen, indeed,
found them work to do : but whether they did
not guard them strictly, or that they thought
they could not better themselves, I cannot tell;
but certainly one of them ran away into the
woods, and they could not hear of him for a
long time after.
Undoubtedly, there was reason enough to
suppose he got home in some one of the canoes,
the savages returning in about four weeks time,
and going off in the space of two days, You
may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but
terrify us exceedingly, and make us justly con-
clude, that this savage would inform his couns
trymen of our abode in the island, how few
and weak we were in comparison to their
numbers ; and we expected it would not be
long before the Englishmen should be attacked
in their habitations : but the savages had not
seen their places of safety in the woods, nor
w

our castle, which it was a great happiness they
did not. -
Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts up-
on this occasion; for, about eight months after
this, six canoes, with about ten men in each
canoe, came sailing by the north side of the is-
land, which they were never accustomed to
do before, and landed about an hour after sun-
rise, near a mile from the dwelling of the two
Dnglishmen, who, it seems, had the good for-
tune to discover them about a league off; so
that it was an hour before they could attain
the shore, and some longer time before they
could come at them. And now, being con-
firmed in this opinion, that they were certainly
betrayed, they immediately bound the two
slaves which were left, causing two of the three
men, whom they brought with the women,
and who proved very faithful, to lead them
with their wives and other conveniences into
their retired cave in the wood, and there to
bind the two fellows hand and foot, till they
had further orders. They then opened their
fences, where they kept their milk-goats, and
drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to
ramble in the woods, to make the savages be-
lieve that they were wild ones; but the slave
had given a truer information, which made
them come to the very inclosures. The two
frighted men sent the other slave of the three,
who had been with them by accident, to alarm
the Spaniards, and desire their assistance; in the
mean time, they took their arms and ammu-
mition, and made to the cave where they had
sent their wives, and securing their slaves, seat-
cd themselves in a private place, from whence
they might behold all the actions of the sayaggs,
Nor had they gone far, when ascending a list
ing ground, they could see a little army of In-
dians approaching to their beautiful dwelling,
and in a few moments more perceive, the
same and their furniture, to their unspeakable
grief, burning in a consuming flame : and
when this was done, they spread here and there,
searching every bush and place for the people,
of whom, it was very evident, they had infor-
mation. Upon which the two Englishmen, not
thinking themselves secure where they stood,
retreated about half a mile higher into the coun-
try, rightly concluding that the farther the sa-
vages strolled, there would be fewer numbers
together upon which they next took their
stand by the trunk of an old tree, very hollow
and large, whence they resolved to see what
would offer; but they had not stood long there,
before two savages came running directly to-
wards them, as though having knowledge of
their being there, who seemed resolved to at-
tack them; a little farther were three more,
and five more behind them again, all running
the same way. It cannot be imagined what
perplexity the poor men were in at this sight,
thinking that if assistance did not speedily come,
their cave in the wood should be discovered
and consequently all therein lost : so they re-
solved to resist them there, and, when over-
powered, to ascend to the top of the trees,
where they might defend themselves as long as
their ammunition lasted, and sell their lives as
dear as possible to those devouring savages,
Thus fixed in their resolution, they next con-
sidered, whether they should fire at the first two,
N.I.
or wait for the three, and so take the middle
party, by which the two first and the five last
should be separated. In this regulation the two
savages also confirmed them by turning a little
to another part of the wood ; but the three,
and the five after them, came directly towards
the tree. Hereupon they resolved to take them
in a direct line, as they approached nearer,
because perhaps the first shot might hit them
all three; and, upon this occasion, the man
who was to fire, charged his piece with three or
four bullets. And thus, while they were wait-
ing, the savages came on ; one of them was the
runaway who had caused all the mischief; so
they resolved he should not escape, if they both
fired at once. But however, though they did
not fire together, they were ready charged ;
when the first thatlet fly, was too good a marks-
man to miss his aim ; for he killed the foremost
outright; the second (who was the runaway
Indian) fell on the ground, being shot through
the body, but not dead, and the third was a little
wounded on the shoulder, who, sitting down
on the ground, fell a screaming in a most fear-
ful manner. The noise of the guns, which not
only made the most resounding echoes from
one side to another, but raised the birds of all
sorts, fluttering with the most confused noise,
so much terrified the five savages behind, that
they stood still at first like so many inanimate
images. But when all things were in profound
silence, they came to the place where illeir com-
panions lay; and here, not being sensible that
they were liable to the same fate, stood over the
wounded man, undoubtedly inquiring the oc-
casion of his sad calamity ; and ’tis as reason-
able to suppose, he told them that it came by
thunder and lightening from the gods, having
never seen nor heard of a gun before in the
whole course of his life. By this time the
Englishmen, having loaded their pieces, fired
both together a second time, when seeing them
all fall immediately on the ground, they thought
they had killed every creature of them. This
made them come up boldly before they had
charged their guns, which, indeed, was a
wrong step; for, when they came to the place,
they found four alive, two of them very little
wounded, and one not at all, which obliged
them to fall upon them with their muskets :
they first knocked the runaway savage on the
head, and another that was but a little wound-
ed in the arm; and then put the other languish-
ing wretches out of their pain : while he that
was not hurt, with bending knees and uplifted
hands, made piteous moans, and signs to them
to spare his life : nor, indeed, were they un-
merciful to the poor wretch, but pointing to
him to sit down at the root of a tree hard by ;
and then one of the Englishmen, with a piece
of rope twine he had in his pocket by mere
chance, tying his two feet fast together, and his
two hands behind him, they left him there,
making all the haste they could after the other
two, fearing they should find out their cave ;
but though they could not overtake them, they
had the satisfaction to perceive them, at a dis-
tance, cross a valley towards the sea, a quite
contrary way to their retreat; upon which they
returned to the tree to look after their prisoner;
but when they came there, he was gone, leav-
- - - - 2
ing behind him the piece of rope-yarm where-
with he was bound.
Well, now they were as much concerned as
ever, as not knowing how near their enemies
might be, or in what numbers. Immediately
they repaired to their cave to see if all was well
there, and found every thing safe except the
women, who were frighted upon their hus-
bands' account, whom now they loved entirely.
They had not been long here, before seven of
my Spaniards came to assist them ; while the
other ten, their servants, and Friday's father
were gone to defend their bower, corn and
eattle, in case the savages should have rambled
so far. There accompanied the seven Spa-
niards one of the three savages that had for-
merly been taken prisoner ; and with them
also that very Indian whom the Englishmen
had, a little before, left under the tree; for, it
seems , they passed by that way where the
slaughter was made, and so carried along with
them that poor wretch that was left bound.
But so many prisoners now becoming a bur-
den to us, and fearing the dreadful conse-
quence of their escaping, most of the Spaniards.
and English urged the absolute necessity there
was of killing them for our common preserva–
tion: but, Sir, the authority I bore as a gover-
nor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and then
I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the old
cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, with
two Spaniards to guard them.
So much encouraged were the Englishmen
at the approach of the Spaniards, and so great
was their fury against the savages for destroy-
ing their habitations, that they had not patience
to stay any longer; but, taking five Spaniard
along with them, armed with four muskets, a
pistol, and a quarter-staff, away they went in
pursuit of their enemies. As they passed by the
place where the savages were slain, it was very
easy to be perceived that more of them had
been there, having attempted to carry off their
dead bodies, but found it impracticable. From .
a rising ground, our parly had the mortifica-
tion to see the smoke that proceeded from the
ruins ; when coming farther in sight of the
shore, they plainly perceived that the savages
had embarked in their canoes, and were putt-
ing out to sea. This they were very sorry for,
there being no coming at them to give them a
parting salute; but, however, they were glad
enough to get clear of such unwelcome guests.
Thus the two honest but unfortunate En-
glishmen, being ruined a second time, and their
improvements quite destroyed, most of my
good-natured Spaniards helped them to re-

supplies; nay, what is more remarkable, their
three mischievous countrymen, when they
heard it (which was after all these disasters
were over, they living remote eastward ) very
friendly sympathised with them, and worked
for them several days : so that in a little time
their habitation was rebuilt, their necessities
supplied, and themselves restored to their for-
mer tranquillity. -
Though the savages had nothing to boast of
in this adventure (several canoes being driven
a-shore, followed by two drowned creatures,
having undoubtedly met with a storm at sea
that very night they departed), yet ".was natu-
- M
ral to be supposed, that those whose better for-
tune it was to attain their native shore would
inflame their nation to another ruinous attempt,
with a greater force, to carry all before them.
And, indeed, so it happened; for, about seven
months after, our island was invaded with a
most formidable navy, no less than eight and
twenty canoes full of savages, armed with
wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and
arrows, and such like instruments of war, land-
ing at the east side of the island.
You may well, Sir, imagine what consterna-
tion our men were in upon this account, and
how speedily they were to execute their reso-
lution, having only that night's time allowed
them. They knew, that since they could not
withstand their enemies, concealment was the
only way to procure their safety; and, there-
fore, they took down the huts that were built
for the two Englishmen, and drove their flock
of goats, together with their own at the bower,
io the old cave in the valley, leaving as little ap-
pearance of inhabitants as possible; and then
posted themselves with all their force at the
plantation of the two men. As they expected,
so it happened ; for, early the next morning,
the Indians, leaving their canoes at the east end
of the island, came running along the shore,
about two hundred and fifty in number, as
near as could be guessed. Our army was but
little indeed ; and what was our greater mis-
fortune, we had not arms sufficient for them.
The account, as to the men, Sir, is as follows:

niards. &
As to our slaves, we gave three of them hal-
berts, and the other three long staves with
great iron spikes at the end of them, with hat-
chets by their sides : we also had hatchets slick-
ing in our girdles, besides the fire-arms : nay,
two of the women, inspired with Amazonian
fortitude, could not be dissuaded from fighting
along with their dearest husbands, and if they
died, from diyng with them. Seeing their resolu-
tion, we gave them hatchets likewise; but what
pleased them best, were the bows and arrows.

that the Indians had left behind them, after,
their memorable battle one against another.
Over this army, which, though little, was of
great intrepidity, I was constituted chief ge—
neral and commander; and knowing Will."
Atkins, though exceeding wicked, yet a man
of invincible courage, I gave him the power
of commanding under me : he and six men,
with their muskets loaded with six or seven
bullets a-piece, were planted just behind a
small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard,
having orders to let the first pass by ; and .
then, when he fired into the middle of then),
M 4
make a nimble retreal round a part of the
wood, and so come in the rear of the Spa-
niards, who were shaded by a thicket of trees:
for though the savages came on with the fierce-
mess of lions, yet they wanted the subtility of
foxes, being out of all manner of order, and
straggling in heaps every way : and, indeed,
when Will. Atkins, after fifty of the savages
had passed by, had ordered three of his men
to give fire, so great was their consternation to
see so many men killed and wounded, and
hear such a dreadful noise, and yet not know
whence it came, that they were frightened to
the highest degree ; and when the second vol-
Iey was given, they concluded no less but that
their companions were slain by thunder and
lightening from heaven. In this notion they
would have continued, had VVill. Atkins and
his men retired as soon as they fired, according
to order : or had the rest been near them to
our in their shot continually, there might have
{. a complete victory obtained; but staying
ió load their pieces again discovered the whole
matter. They were perceived by some of the
scattering savages at a distance, who let fly their
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himself,
and killed his fellow Englishman, and one of
ihe Indians taken with the women. Our par-
iy did not fail to answer them, and in their re-
ireat killed about twenty savages. Here I can-
not but take notice of our poor dying slave,
who, though stopt from his retreat by a fatal
arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet desperate-
ly and gallantly assailed the pursuers, and killed
five of the savages, before his life submitted to
a multiplicity of his wounds. Nor is the cruelty
er malice of the Indians to be less remarked,
in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of the
two dead bodies with their clubs and wooden
swords, after a most wretched manner. As At-
kins retreated, our party advanced to inter-
pose between him and the savages; but, after
three volleys, we were obliged to retreat also :
for they were so numerous and desperate, that
they came up to our very teeth, shot their ar-
rows like a cloud, and their wounded men,
enraged with cruel pain, fought like madmen.
They did not, however, think fit to follow us;
but drawing themselves up in a circle, they
gave two triumphant shouts in token of victory,
though they had the grief to see several of their
wounded men bleed to death before them.
After I had, Sir, drawn up our little army
together upon a rising ground, Atkins, wound-
ed as he was, would have had us attack the
whole body of the savages at once. I was ex-
tremely well pleased with the gallantry of the
man; but, upon consideration, I replied : You
perceive, Seignior Atkins, how their wounded
men fight; let them alone till morning, when
they will be faint, stiff, and sore, and then we
shall have fewer to combat with. To which
VVill. Atkins smiling replied : That’s very
true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that's
the reason I would fight them now I am warm.
We all answered : Seignior Atkins, for your
part, you have behaved very gallantly; and,
if you are not able to approach the enemy in
the morning, we will fight for you, till then we
think it convenient to wait; and so we tarried.
By the brightness of the moon that night we
perceived the savages in great disºlºr about
M 5
their dead and wounded men. This made us
change our resolution, and resolve to fall upon
them in the night, if we could give them one
volley undiscovered. This we had a fair op-
portunity to do by one of the two Englishmen
leading us round between the woods and the
sea-side westward, and turning short south we
came privately to a place where the thickest of
them were. Unheard and unperceived, eight
of us fired among them, and did dreadful exe-
cution; and, in half a minute after, eight more
of us let fly, killing and wounding abundance
of them; and then dividing ourselves into three
bodies, eight persons in each body, we marched
from among the trees to the very teeth of the
enemy, sending forth the greatest shouts and
acclamations. The savages hearing a different
moise from three quarters at once stood in the
utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us,
let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor
Old Friday, yet happily it did not prove mor-
tal. We did not, however, give them a se-
cond opportunity; but rushing in among them,
we fired three several ways, and then fell to
work with our swords, staves, hatchets, and the
butt-end of our muskets, with a fury not to be.
resisted ; so that, with the most dismal scream-
ing and howling, they had recourse to their
feet to save their lives by a speedy flight. Nor
must we forget the valour of the two women; for
they exposed themselves to the greatest dangers,
killed many with their arrows, and valiantly
destroyed several more with their halchets.
In fighting these two battles, we were so
much tired, that we did not then troubleour-
selves to pursue them to their canoes, in which
we thought they would presently put to the
ocean ; but there happening a dreadful storm
at sea, which continuing all that night, it not
only prevented their voyage, but dashed seve-
ral of their boats to pieces against the beach,
and drove the rest iºn upon the shore, that
it required infinite pains to get them off. After
our men had taken some refreshment and a
little repose, they resolved early in the morn-
ing to go towards the place of their landing, and
see whether they were gone off, or in what
posture they remained. This necessarily led
them to the place of battle, where several of the
savages were expiring: a sight no way pleas--
ing to generous minds to delight in their mi-
sery, though obliged to conquer them by the
law of arms; but our own Indian slaves put
them out of their pain by dispatching them
with their hatchets. At length, coming in view
of the remainder of their army, we found them
leaning upon their knees, which were bended
towards §. mouth, and the head belween
the two hands. Hereupon, coming within
musket-shot of them, I ordered two pieces to be
fired without ball, in order to alarm them, that
we might plainly know whether they had the
courage to venture another battle, or were ut-
terly dispirited from such an attempt, that so
we might accordingly manage them. And,
indeed, the project took very well; for no
sooner did the savages hear the first gun, and
perceive the flash of the second, but they sud-
denly started upon their feet, in the greatest
consternation ; and when we approached to-
wards them, they ran howling and screaming
away up the hill into the country.
We could rather, at first, have wished, that -
the weather had permitted them to have gone
off to sea ; but when we considered, that their
escape might occasion the approach of mul-
titudes to our utter ruin and dissolution, we
were very well pleased the contrary happened :
and Will. Atkins (who, though wounded,
would not part from us all this while) advised
us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping
between them and their boats, deprive them of
the capacity of ever returning to plague the is—
land : I know, said he, there is but one ob-
jection you can make, which is, that these crea-
tures living like beasts in the wood, may make
excursions, rifle the plantations, and destroy
the tame goats : but then consider, we had bet-
ter to do with an hundred men, whom we can
kill, or make slaves º: deisure, than with an
hundred nations, whom it is impossible we
should save ourselves from, much less subdue.
This advice and these arguments being approv-
ed of, we set fire to their beats ; and though
- /
they were so wet that they could not burn en-
tirely, yet we made them incapable for swim-
ming in the seas. As soon as the Indians per-
ceived what we were doing, many of them ran
out of the woods in sight of us, and, kneel-
ing down piteously, cried out: Oa, Oa, Wara-
makoa, intimating, I suppose, that if we would
but spare their canoes, they would never trou-
ble us again.
But all their complaints, submissions, and en-
treaties were in vain : for self-preservation
obliging us to the contrary, we destroyed eve-
ry one of them that had escaped the fury of
the ocean. When the Indians perceived this,
they raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the
woods, where they continued ranging about,
making the woods ring with their lamentation.
Here we should have considered, that making
these creatures thus desperate, we ought, at the
same time, to have set a sufficient guard upon
the plantations : for the savages, in their rang-
ing about, found out the bower, destroyed the
fences, trod the corn down under their feet,
and tore up the vines and grapes. It is true,
we were always able to fight these creatures;
but, as they were too swift for us, and very nu-
merous, we durst not go out single for fear of
them; though that too was needless, they hav-
ing no weapons, nor any materials to make
them ; and, indeed, their extremity appeared
in a little time after.
Though the savages, as already mentioned,
had destroyed our bower and all our corn,
grapes, etc. yet we had still left our stock of
cattle in the valley by the cave, with some little
corn that grew there, and the plantation of
Will. Atkins and his companions, one of whom
being killed by an arrow, they were now re-
duced to two : it is remarkable, that this was
the fellow who cut the poor Indian with his
hatchet, and had a design to murder me and
my countrymen the Spaniards. As our con-
dition was so low, we came to the resolution to
drive the savages up to the farther part of the
island, where no Indians landed; to kill as ma-
my of them as we could, till we had reduced
their number; and then to give the remainder
some corn to plant, and to teach them how to
live by their daily labour. Accordingly, we
pursued them with our guns, at the hearing of
º
which they were so terrified, that they would
fall to the ground. Every day we killed and
wounded some of them, and many we found
starved to death, so that our hearts began to re-
lent at the sight of such miserable objects. . At
last, with great difficulty, taking one of them
alive, and using him with kindness and ten-
derness, we brought him to Old Friday, who
talked to him, and told him how good we
would be to them all, giving them corn and
land to plant and live in, and present nourish-
ment, provided they would keep within such
bounds as should be alloted them, and not do
prejudice to others : Go then, said he, and in-
jorm your countrymen of this ; which if they
will not agree to, every one of them shall be
slain.
The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled,
being reduced to about thirty-seven, joyfully ac-
cepted the offer, and earnestly begged for food;
hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards and two
Englishmen well armed, together with Old
Friday and three Indian slaves who marched to
the place where they were. The slaves were
loaded with a large quantity of bread, and rice
cakes, with three live goats, and the poor In-
dians being ordered to sit down on the side of
the hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully,
and have proved faithful to the last, never tres-
passing beyond their bounds, where, at this
day, they quietly and happily remain, and
where we now and then visit them. They are
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a
half broad, and three or four in length, on the
south-east corner of the island, the sea being
before, and lofty mountains behind them, free
from the appearance of canoes, and indeed
their countrymen have never made any in-
quiry after them. We gave them twelve hat-
chets, and three or four knives; have taught
them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant
corn, make bread, breed tame goats, and milk
then, as likewise to make wicker-work, in
which, I must ingenuously confess, they infi-
mitely outdo us, having made themselves seve-
ral pretty necessaries and fancies, as baskets,
sieves, bird-cages, and cupboards, as also stools,
beds, and couches, no less useful than delight-
ful ; and now they live the most innocent and
inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in
the world, wanting nothing but wives to make
them a nation.
Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according
to my ability, an impartial account of the vari-
ous transactions that have happened in the is—
land since your departure to this day: and we
have great reason to acknowledge the kind pro-
vidence of heaven in our merciful deliverance.
When you inspect your little kingdom, you will
find in it some little improvement, your flocks
increased, and your subjects augmented: so that
from a desolate island, as this was before your
wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a visible
prospect of its becoming a populous and well
governed little kingdom, to your immortal fame
and glory.
The end of the Spanish governor's relation.
The continuation of the life of Robinson Cru-
soe , both those passages that happened dur-
ing the time of his continuance on the island,
and after his departure, till he arrived again
in his native country.
THERE is no doubt to suppose, but that the
precedent relation of my faithful Spaniard was
very agreeable, and no less surprising to me,
to the young priest, and to all who heard it :
nor were these people less pleased with those
necessary utensils that I brought them, such as
the knives, scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-
axes, with which they now adorn their habi-
tations. So much had they addicted them-
selves to wicker-work, prompted by the inge-
niousness of the Indians, who assisted them, that
when I viewed the Englishmens colonies, they
seemed at a distance as though they had lived
like bees in a hive : for VVill. Atkins, who was
now become a very industrious and sober man,
had made himself a tent of basket-work round
the outside; the walls were worked in as a bas-
ket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two
in number, standing about seven feet high: in
the middle was another, not above twenty-two
paces round, but much stronger built, being
of an octogonal form, and in the eight corners
stood eight strong posts, round the top of which
he laid strong pieces, pinned with wooden
pins, from which he raised a pyramid for the
roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined
very well together with iron spikes, which he
made himself; for he had made himself a forge,
with a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal
for his work, forming an anvil out of one of
the iron crows to work upon, and in this man-
ner would he make himself hooks, staples,
spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched
the roof of his innermost tent, he made it so
firm between the rafters with basket-work,
thatching that over again with rice-straw, and
over that a large leaf of a tree, that his house
was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. The
outer circuit was covered as a lean-to quite
round this inner apartment, laying long rafters
from the thirty-two angles, to the top-post of
the inner house, about twenty feet distant : so
that there was a space like a walk betwixt the
outer and inner wall, near twenty feet in
breadth. The inner place he partitioned off
with the same wicker-work, dividing it into
six meat apartments, every one of which had
a door, first into the entry of the main tent;
and another into the space and walk that was
round it, not only convenient for retreat, but
for family, necessaries. Within the door of
the outer circle, there was a passage directly to
the door of the inner house; on either side was
a wicker partition, and a door, by which you go
first into a large room twenty-two feet wide, and
about thirty long, and through that into ano-
, ther of a smaller length, so that in the outward
circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which
were only to be come at through the apart-
ments of the inner tent, serving as retiring
rooms to the respective chambers of the inner
circle, and four large ware-houses, which went
in through one another, two on either hand of
the passage that led through the outward door
to the inner tent. In short, nothing could be
"built more ingeniously, kept more meat, or have
‘better conveniencies; and here lived the three.
families, Will. Atkins, his companion, their
wives and children, and the widow of the de-
ceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught
their wives the knowledge of God, any more
than the sailors' custom of swearing by his
name. The greatest improvement their wives
had, was, they taught them to speak English so
as to be understood. -
None of their children were then above six
years old ; they were all fruitful enough; and,
I think, the cook's mate's wife was big of her
sixth child. -
When I inquired of the Spaniards about
their circumstances while among the savages,
they told me that they abandoned themselves to
despair, reckoning themselves a poor and mi-
serable people, that had no means put into
their hands, and consequently must soon be
starved to death. They owned, however, that
they were in the wrong to think so, and for
refusing the assistance that reason offered for
their support, as well as future deliverance,
confessing that grief was a most insignificant
passion, as it looked upon things as without
remedy, and having no hope of good things to
come; all which verified this noted proverb :
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
Nor did his remarks end here : for, making
observations upon my improvements, and on
my condition at first, infinitely worse than theirs,
he told me, that Englishmen had, in their dis—

tress, greater presence of mind than those of
any other country that he had met with ; and
that they and the Portuguese were the worst
men in the world to struggle under misfor-
tunes. When they landed among the savages,
they found but little provision, except they
would turn cannibals, there being but a few
roots and herbs, with little substance in them,
and of which the natives gave them but very
sparingly. Many were the ways they took to
civilize and teach the savages, but in vain : for
they would not own them to be their instruc-
tors, whose lives were owing to their bounty.
Their distresses were very great, many days
being entirely without food, the savages there
being more indolent and less devouring than
those who had better supplies. When they
went out to battle, they were obliged to assist
these people, in one of which my faithful Spa-
niard being taken, had like to have been de-
voured. They had lost their ammunition,
which rendered their fire-arms useless ; nor
could they use the bows and arrows that were
iven them : so that while the armies were at a
distance, they had no chance; but when close,
then they could be of service with halberts and
sharpened sticks, put into the muzzles of their
muskets. They made themselves targets of
wood, covered with the skins of wild beasts ;
and when one happened to be knocked down,
the rest of the company fought over him till he
recovered : and then standing close in a line,
they would make their way through a thousand
savages. At the return of their friend, who
they thought had been entombed in the bowels.
of their enemies, their joy was unconceivable-
Nor were they less surprised at the sight of the
loaves of bread I had sent them, things that
they had not seen for several years, at the same
time crossing and blessing it, as though it was
manna sent from heaven: but when they knew
the errand, and perceived the boat which was
to carry them to the person and place from
whence such relief came, this struck them with
such a surprise of joy as made some of them
faint away, and others burst out into tears.
This was the summary account that I had
from them. I shall now inform the reader
what I next did for them, and in what condi-
tion I left them. As we were all of opinion
that the savages would scarce trouble them any
more, so we had no apprehensions on that
score. I told them I was come purely to esta-
blish, and not to remove them ; and, upon
that occasion, had not only brought them ne—
cessaries for convenience and defence, but also
artificers, and other persons, both for their ne-
cessary employments, and to add to their num-
ber. They were all together when I thus talk-
ed to them ; and before I delivered to them
the stores I had brought, I asked them one by
one, if they had entirely forgot their first ani-
mosities, would engage in the strictest friend-
ship, and shake hands with one another ? On
this Will. Atkins with abundance of good
humour, said, they had afflictions enough to
make them all sober, and enemies enough to
make them all friends: as for himself, he would
live and die among them, owning, that what
the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad
humour had made necessary for them to do.
Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify their
proceeding to me; but they told me, that, since
Will. Atkins had behaved himself so valiantly
in fight, and at other times shewed such a re-
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285
ad not only forgotten all that was past, but
thought he ought as much to be trusted with
arms and necessaries as any of them, which
they testified by making him next in command
to the governor; and they most heartily em-
braced the occasion of giving me this solemn
assurance, that they would never separate their
interest again as long as they lived. -
After these kind declarations of friendship,
we appointed all of us to dine together the next
day; upon this I caused the ship's cook and his
mate come on shore for that purpose, to assist
in dressing our dinner. We brought from the
ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, to-
gether with our punch-bowl, and materials to
fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten bot-
tles of French claret, and ten of English beer,
which was very acceptable to them. The Spa-
niards added to our feast five whole kids, which
being roasted, three of them were sent as fresh
meat to the sailors on board, and the other two
we ate ourselves. After our merry and inno-
cent feast was over, I began to distribute my
cargoe among them. First, I gave them linen
sufficient to make everyone of them four shirts,
and at the Spaniards’ request made them up
six. The thin English stuffs I alloted to make
every one a light coat like a fock, agreeable to
the climate, and left them such a quantity as
to make more upon their decay; as also pumps,
shoes, hats, and stockings. It is not to be ex-
pressed the pleasing satisfaction which sat up-
on the countenances of these poor men, when
they perceived what care I took of them, as if
I had been a common father to them all ; and
they all engaged never to leave the island, till I
gave my consent for their departure. I then
presented to them the people I brought, to wit,
the tailor, smith, and the two carpenters; but my
Jack of all trades was the most acceptable pre-
sent I could make them. My tailor fell imme-
diately to work, and made every one of them a
shirt; after which, he learned the women how
to sew and stitch, thereby to become the more
helpful to their husbands. Neither were the
carpenters less useful, taking into pieces their
clumsy things, instead of which they made con-
venient and handsome tables, stools, bedsteads,
cupboards, lockers and shelves. But when I
carried them to see Will. Atkins's basket-house,
they owned they never saw such a piece of na-
tural ingeniousness before : I am sure, said one
of the carpenters, the man that built this has
no need of us; you need, Sir, do nothing but
give him tools.
I divided the tools among them in this man-
ner : to every man I gave a digging spade, a
shovel and a rake, as having no harrows or
ploughs; and to every separate place a pick-
axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with
a store for a general supply, should any be
broken, or worn out. I left them also nails,
staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scis-
sars, and all sorts of tools and iron work; and,
for the use of the smith, gave them three tons of
unwrought iron for a supply: and as to arms
and ammunition, I stored them even to pro-
fusion, or, at least, to equip a sufficient little
army against all opposers whatsoever. -
The young man (whose mother was unfor-
tunately starved to death'), together with the
maid, a pious and well educated young wor
man, seeing things so well ordered on shore
(for I made them accompany me), and consi-
dering they had no occasion to go so far a voy-
age as to the East-Indies, they both desired of
me, that I would leave them there, and enter
them among my subjects. This Ireadily agreed
to, ordering them a plat of ground, on which
were three little houses erected, environed with
basket-work, palisaded like Atkins', and ad-
joining to his plantation. So contrived were
their tents, that each of them had a room apart
to lodge in, while the middle tent was not only
their store-house, but their place for eating and
drinking. At this time the two Englishmen
removed their habitation to their former place;
‘so that now the island was divided into three
colonies; first, those I have just now mention-
ed; secondly, that of Will. Atkins, where there
were four families of Englishmen, with their
wives and children, the widow and her chil-
dren; the young man, and the maid, who, by
the way, we made a wife of before our depar-
ture; three savages, who were slaves; the tai-
lor, smith (who served also as a gun-smith),
and my other celebrated person called Jack of
all trades. Thirdly, my chief colony, which
consisted of the Spaniards, with Old Friday,
who still remained at my old habitation, which
was my capital city ; and surely never was
there such a metropolis, it now being hid in so
obscure a grove, that a thousand men might
have ranged the island a month, and looked
purposely for it, without being able to find it,
though the Spaniards had enlarged its bounda-
ries, both without and within, in a most sur-
rising manner. - -
But now I think it high time to speak of the
young French priest of the order of St. Bene-
dict, whose judicious and pious discourses up-
on sundry, occasions, merit an extraordinary
observation; nor can his being a French Pa-
pist priest, I presume, give offence to any of my
readers, when they have this assurance from
me, that he was a person of the most courteous
disposition, extensive charity, and exalted piety.
His arguments were always agreeable to rea-
son, and his conversa on the most acceptable
of any person that I had ever yet illet with in
my life.
Sir, said he to me one day, since under God
(at the same time crossing his breast) you have
not only saved my life, but, by permitting me
to come this voyage, have granted me the hap-
piness of free conversation, I think it my duty,
as my profession obliges me, to save what souls
I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of
some Catholic doctrines, necessary to salvation;
and, since these people are under your imme-
diate government, in gratitude, justice, and de-
cency for what you have done for me, I shall
offer no further points in religion than what
shall merit your approbation. Being pleased
with the modesly of his carriage, I told him he
should not be the worst used for being of a
different persuasion, if, upon that very account,
we did not differ in points of faith, not proper
in a part of the country, where the poor In-
dians ought to be instructed in the knowledge
of the true God and his son Jesus Christ. To
this he replied, that conversation might easily
be separated from disputes; that he would dis-
course with me rather as a gentleman than a
religious; but that if we did enter upon re-
ligious arguments, upon my desiring the same,
I would give him liberty to defend his own
principles. He farther added, that he would
do all that became him in his office, as a priest
as well as a Christian, to procure the happiness
of all that was in the ship: that though he could
not pray with, he would *. for us, on all
occasions ; and then he told me several extra-
ordinary events of his life within a few years
past, but particularly in this last, which was
the most remarkable : that in this voyage he
had the misfortune to be five times shipped and
unshipped : his first design was to have gone
to Martinico; for which taking ship at St. Malo,
he was forced into Lisbon by bad weather,
the vessel running aground in the mouth of the
Tagus: that from thence he went on board a
Portuguese ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose
master being but an indifferent mariner, and
out of his reckoning, they were drove to Fial,
where selling their commodity, which was
corn, they resolved to take in their loading at
the isle of May, and to sail to Newfoundland;
at the banks of which, meeting a French ship
bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and
from thence to Martinico, in this ship he em-
barked ; the master of which dying at Quebec,
that voyage was suspended : and lastly, shipping
himself for France, this last ship was destroyed
by fire, as before has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but ano-
ther morning he comes to me, just as I was go-
ing to visit the Englishmens colony, and tells
me, that as he knew the prosperily of the island
was my principal desire, he had something to
communicate agreeable to my design, by which
perhaps he might put it, more than he yet
thought it was, in the way of the benediction
of heaven. How, Sir 2 said I in a surprise :
are we not yet in the way of God's blessing,
after all these signal providences and delive-
rances, of which you have had such an ample
relation ? He replied: I hope, Sir, you are in
the way, and that your good design will pros-
per ; but still there are some among you that
are not equally right in their actions : and re-
member, I beseech you, Sir, that Achan by his
crime removed God’s blessing from the camp
of the children of Israel; that though six and
thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became
the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the
weight of the punishment accordingly.
So sensibly was I touched with this discourse,
and so satisfied with that ardent piety that in-
flamed his soul, that I desired him to accompa-
ny me to the Englishmens plantations, which
he was very glad of, by reason they were the
subjects of what he designed to discourse with
me about ; and while we walked on together,
he began in the following manner:
Sir, said he, I must confess it is a great un-
happiness that we disagree in several doctrinal
articles of religion; but surely both of us ac-
knowledge this, that there is a God, who having
given us some stated rules for our service and
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowing-
ly to offend him, either by neglecting what he
has commanded, or by doing what he has for-
bidden. This truth every Christian owns, that
whenever any one presumptuously sins against
God's command, the Almighty then withdraws
his blessing from him ; every good man there-
fore ought certainly to prevent such neglect of,
or sin against God and his commands. I thank-
ed the young priest for expressing so great a
concern for us, and desired him to explain the
particulars of what he had observed, that,
according to the parable of Achan, I might
remove the accursed thing from among us.
Why then, Sir, said he, in the first place you
have four Englishmen, who have taken savage
women to their wives, by whom they have
several children, though none of them are le-
gally married, as the law of God and man re-
quires; they, I say, Sir, are no less than adul-
terers, and as they still live in adultery, are
liable to the curse of God. I know, Sir, you
may object the want of a priest, or clergyman
of any kind; as also, pen, ink, and paper to
write down a contract of marriage, and have
it signed between them. But neither this, nor
what the Spanish governor has told you of their
chusing by consent, can be reckoned a mar-
riage, nor any more than an agreement to keep
them from quarrelling among themselves; for,
Sir, the essence or sacrament of matrimony (so
he called it) not only consists in mutual con-
sent, but in the legal obligation which compels
them to own and acknowledge one another
to abstain from other persons, the men to pro-
vide for their wives and children, and the wo—
, men to the same and like conditions, mutatis
N a
mutandis, on their side : whereas, Sir, these
men upon their own pleasure, on any occa-
sion, may forsake those women, and marry
others, and by disowning their children suffer
them utterly to perish." Now, Sir, added he,
can God be honoured in such an unlawful li-
berty as this 2 how can a blessing succeed the
best endeavours, if men are allowed to live in
so licentious a way? I was indeed struck with
the thing myself, and thought that they were
much to blame, that no formal contract had
been made, though it had been but breaking a
stick between them, to engage them to live as
man and wife, never to separate, but love, che-
rish and comfort one another all their lives.
Yet, Sir, said I, when they took these women,
I was not here; and if it is adultery, it is past
my remedy, and I cannot help it. True, Sir,
answered the young priest, you cannot be charg-
ed with that part of the crime which was done
in your absence ; but I beseech you, don’t flat-
ter yourself, that you are under no obligation.
now to put a period to it; which if you neglect
to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone,
since it is certainly in nobody’s power but yours
to alter their condition. I must confess, I was
so dull, that I thought he meant I should part
them, and knowing that this would put the
whole island in confusion, I told him I could
not consent to it upon any account whatsoever.
Sir, said he in a great surprise, I do not mean
that you should separate, but marry them by
a written contract, signed by both man and
awoman, and by all the witnesses present, which
all the European laws decree to be of sufficient
efficacy, Amazed with such true piety and
sincerily, and considering the validity of a
written contract, I acknowledged all that he
said to be very just and kind, and that I would
discourse with the men about it; neither could
I see what reason they could have not to let
him marry them, whose authority in that affair
is owned to be as authentic as if they were
married by any of our clergymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me
was this, that though these English subjects of
mine had lived with these women seven years,
and though they were of good understanding,
and capable of instruction, having learned not
only to speak, but to read English, yet all this
while they had never taught them any thing of
the Christian religion, or the knowledge of God,
much less in what manner he ought to be serv-
ed. And is not this an unaccountable neglect 2
said he warmly. Depend upon it, God Al-
mighty will call them to account for such con-
tempt. And though I am not of your religion,
yet I should be glad to see these people releas-
ed from the devil’s power, and be saved by the
principles of the Christian religion, the know-
Jedge of God, of a Redeemer, the resurrection,
and of a future, state. But, as it is not too
tate, if you please to give me leave to instruct
them, I doubt not but I shall supply this great
defect, by bringing them into the great circle of
Christianity, even while you continue in the
island. -
I could hold no longer, but embracing him
told him with a thousand thanks, I would
grant whatever he requested, and desired him
to proceed in the third article, which he did in
the following manner : 3 -
IN
Sir, said he, it should be a maxim among all
Christians, that Christian knowledge ought to
be propagated by all possible means, and on all
occasions. Upon this account our church sends
missionaries into Persia, India, and China ;
men who are willing to die for the sake of God
and the Christian faith, in order to bring poor
infidels into the way of salvation. Now, Sir,
as here is an opportunity to convert seven and
thirty poor savages, I wonder how you can pº
by such an occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the expence of a man's whole life.
I must confess I was so confounded at this
discourse, that I could not tell how to answer
him. Sir, said he, seeing me in disºr:der, I
294 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
No, Sir, said I, I am rather confounded; and
you know my circumstances, that, being bound
to the East Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot
wrong the owners so much as to detain the ship
here, the men lying at victuals and wages on
their account. If I stay above twelve days, I
must pay 3 l. Sterling per diem demurrage, nor
must the ship stay above eight days more ; so
that I am unable to engage in this work, unless
I would leave the ship, and be reduced to my
former condition. The priest, though he own-
ed this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my
conscience, whether the blessing of saving se-
ven and thirty souls was not worth venturing
all that I had in the world 7 Sir, said I, it is
very true : but as you are an ecclesiastic, it na-
turally falls into your profession : why, there-
fore, don't you rather offer to undertake it
yourself, than press me to it? Upon this he
turned about, making a very low bow: I most
humbly thank God and you, Sir, said he, for
so blessed a call ; and most willingly under-
take so glorious an office, which will sufficient-
ly compensate all the hazards and difficulties I
have gone through in a long and uncomforta-
ble voyage.
While he was thus speaking, I could disco-
ver a rapture in his face, by his colour going
and coming ; at the same time his eyes spark-
led like fire, with all the signs of the most zea-
lous transports. And when I asked whether
he was in earnest? Sir, said he, it was to preach
to the Indians, I consented to come along with
you ; these infidels, even in this little island,
are infinitely of more worth than my poor life:
if so that I should prove the happy instrument
of saving these poor creatures souls, I care not
if I never see my native country again. One
thing I only beg of you more, is, that you would
leave Friday with me to be my interpreter,
without whose assistance neither of us will un-
derstand each other. w
This request very sensibly troubled me, first,
upon Friday's being bred a Protestant; and,
secondly, for the affection I bore to him for his
fidelity: but, immediately the remembrance of
Friday's father coming into my head, I recom-
mended him to him as having learned Spanish,
which the priest also understood, and so was
thoroughly satisfied with him. -
When we came to the Englishmen, after I
had told them what necessary things I had done
for them, I talked to them of the scandalous life
they led, told them what notice the clergyman
had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or batchelors ? They answered,
N 4
two of them were widowers, and the other
three single men. But, said I, with what con-
science can you call these your wives, by whom
you have so many children, and yet are not
lawfully married? They all said, that they took
them before the governor as such, having no-
body else to marry them, which they thought
as legal as if they had had a parson. No doubt,
said I, but in the eye of God you are so : but
unless I am assured of your honest intent ne—
ver to desert these poor creatures, I can do no-
thing more for you, neither can you expect
God’s blessing while you live in such an open
course of adultery. Hereupon, Will. Atkins,
who spoke for the rest, told me, that they be-
lieved their wives the most innocent and virtu-
ous creatures in the world : that they would
never forsake them while they had breath; and
that, if there was a clergyman in the ship, they
would be married to them with all their heart.
I told you before, said I, that I have a minister
with me, who shall marry you to-morrow
morning if you are willing; so I would have
you consult to-night with the rest about it. I
told him the clergyman was a Frenchman, and
knew not a word of English, but that I would
act as a clerk between them. And indeed this
business met with such speedy success, that
they all told me in a few minutes after, that
they were ready to be formally married as
soon as I pleased; with which informing the
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced. -
Nothing now remained, but that the women
should be made sensible of the meaning of the
thing ; with which being well satisfied, they
with their husbands attended at my apartment
the next morning: there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassoc, with
a sash round it, much resembling a minister,
and I was his interpreter. But the seriousness
of his behaviour, and the scruples he made of
marrying the women, who were not baptized,
gave them an exceeding reverence for his per-
son; nor indeed would he marry them at all,
till he obtained my liberty to discourse both
with the men and women, and then he told
them, that in the sight of all indifferent men,
and in the sense of the laws of society, they had
lived in open adultery, which nothing now
but their consent to marry, or final separation,
could put an end to; and even here was a dif-
ficulty with respect to the laws of Christian ma-
trimony, in marrying a professed Christian to
a heathen idolater, unbaptized ; but yet there
was time enough to make them profess the
name of Christ, without which nothing could
be done : that, besides, he believed themselves
very indifferent Christians, and consequently
had not discoursed with their wives upon that
subject; and that unless they promised him to
do so, he could not marry them, as being ex-
pressly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned
readily. But, Lord, Sir, said Will. Atkins to
me, how should we teach them religion, who
know nothing of it ourselves 2 How can we
talk to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, heaven
and hell ? why they would only laugh at us,
who never yet have practised religion, but on
the contrary, all manner of wickedness. Will.
Atkins, said I, cannot you tell your wife she is
in the wrong, and that her gods "g º, which
can neither hear, speak nor understand ; but
that cºur God, who has made, can destroy all
things; that he rewards the good, and punishes
the wicked ; and at last will bring us to judg-
ment? cannot you tell her these things? That's
true, said Atkins; but then she'll tell me, it is
utterly false, since I am not punished and sent to
the devil, who have been such a wicked crea-
ture. These words I interpreted to the priest.
O ! said he, tell him, his repentance will make
him a very good minister to his spouse, and
qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-
suffering of a merciful Being, who desires not
the j, of a sinner, and even defers damna-
tion to the last judgment; this will lead him to
the doctrine of, and will make him an excel-
lent preacher to his wife. I repeated this to
Atkins, who, being more than ordinarily affect-
ed with it, replied: I know all this, Sir, and a
great deal more ; but how can I have the im–
pudence to talk thus to my wife, when my con-
science witnesses against me? ALAS! said he
(with tears in his eyes, and giving a great sigh),
as for repenting, that is for ever past me. Past
you! Atkins, said I, what do you mean? You
know well enough, said he, what I mean ; I
mean it is too late.
When I told the priest what he said, the poor
affectionate man could not refrain from weep-
ing ; but recovering himself : Pray, Sir, said
he, ask him if he is contented that it is too late;
or is he concerned, and wishes it were not so 2
This question I put fairly to Atkins, who re-
plied in a passion : How can I be easy in a
state which I know must terminate in my ruin 2
jor I really believe, some time or other, I shall
cut my throat to put a period both to my life
and to the terrors of my conscience.
At this the clergyman shook his head. Sir,
said he, pray tell him it is not too late : Christ
will give him repentance, if he has recourse to
the merits of his passion. Does he think he is
beyond the power of divine mercy 2 there may
indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no
longer spare, but never too late for men to re-
pent in this world. I told Atkins every word
the priest had said, who then parted from us
to talk to his wife, while we discoursed with
the rest. But these were very stupid in religi-
ous matters, yet all of them promised to do
their endeavours to make their wives turn
Christians ; and upon which promises the
priest married the three couples. But as Atkins
was the only sincere convert, and of more sense
than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly in-
quiring after him : Sir, said he, let us walk out
of this labyrinth, and I dare say we shall find
this poor man preaching to his wife already.
And indeed we found it true ; for coming to
the edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins
and his savage wife sitting under the shade of
a bush, in very earnest discourse ; he pointed
to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to him-
self, to her, the woods, and the trees. Imme-
diately we could perceive him start upon his
feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both
his hands; at which the tears ran down my
clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune
was, we could not hear one word that passed
between them. Another time he would em-
brace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kiss-
ing her with the greatest transports, and then
N T

both kneel down for some minutes together.
Such raptures of joy did this occasion in my
young priest, that he could scarcely contain
himself. And a little after this, we observed
by her motion, as frequently lifting up her
hands, and ‘. them on her breast, that
she was mightily affected with his discourse, and
so they withdrew from our sight. -
When we came back, we found them both
waiting to be called in; upon which we agreed
to examine him alone, and so I began thus to
discourse him. Prithee, VVill. Atkins, said I,
what education had you? What was your fa-
iher ? -
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be ;
he was, Sir, a clergyman, who gave me good
instruction and correction, which I despised,
like a brute as I was. I murdered my poor
father.
Ar. Ha! a murderer! -
[Here the priest started and looked pale,
as thinking he had really killed his father. I
F. C. What did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke
his heart by the most unnatural turn of diso-
bedience to the tenderest and best of fathers.
R. C. Well, I pray God grant you repen-
iance. I did not ask you to extort a confes-
eion ; but I asked you, because I see you have
more knowledge of what is good, than your
companions. -
MW. A. O, Sir, whenever I look back upon
imy past life, conscience upbraids me with
my father : the sins against our parents make
the deepest wounds, and their weight lies the
heaviest upon the mind.
/
R. C. You talk, Will. too feelingly and sen-
sibly for me ; I am not able to bear it.
º A. You bear it, Sir, you know nothing
of it. \
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every shore,
valley, and tree in this island witness the an-
#. of my soul for my undutifulness to my
ind father, whom I have murdered likewise;
yet my repentance falls infinitely short of yours.
But, VVill. how comes the sense of this matter
to touch you just now? -,
W. A. Sir, the work you have set me about
has occasioned it; for talking to my wife about
-God and religion, she has preached me such
a sermon, that I shall retain it in lasting re-
membrance.
R. C. No, no; it is your own moving pious
arguments to her has made conscience fling
them back upon you. But pray, Atkins, in-
form us what passed between you and your
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3ol
AV. A. I talked to her of the laws of mar-
riage, the reason of such compacts, whereby
order and justice is maintained; without which,
men would run from their wives and chil-
dren to the dissolution of families or inhe-
ritances.
R. C. Well, and what did she say to all this?
W. A. Sir, we began our discourse in the
following manner, which I shall exactly repeat
according to my mean capacity, if you think it
worth your while to honour it with your at-
tention, -
The DIALOGUE between Will. Atkins and
his Wife in the wood.
302 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
you God in your country 7
/W. A. Yes, child, God is in every nation.
Wife. No ; great old Benamuckee god is in
my country, not yours.
//. A. My dear, God is in heaven, which he
made ; he also made the earth, the sea, and all
that is therein. -
Aºife. Why you not tell me much long ago?
W. A. My dear, I have been a wicked
wretch, having a long time lived without the
knowledge of God in the world.
h'ife. What, not know great God in own
nation ? No do good ting 7 No say O to him?
that's strange |
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there
was no God in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suffer this? why makee
not live well? .
M. A. It is our own faults, child.
JWife. But if he much great, can makee kill,
why no makee kill when no serve him 2 no be
good mans, no cry O to him 7
W. A. That's true, my dear, he may strike
us dead, but his abundant mercy spareth us.
Aºife, Did not you tell God tankee for that?
/7. A. No ; I have neither thanked him for
his mercy, nor feared him for his power. -
Wife. Then me not believe your God be
good, nor makee kill, when you makee him
angry.
W. A. Alas! must my wicked life hinder
you from believing in him? -
Wife. How can me tink your God live
there? (pointing to heaven.) Sure he no ken
what you do here. - - -
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he hears us speak,
sees what we do, and knows what we even
think.
Wife. Where then makee power strong,
when he hears you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My dear, this shews he is indeed a
God and not a man, who has such tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy! what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and spares us: as he is our
great Creator, so is he also our tender father.
Wife. So God never angry, never kih wick-
ed, then he no good, no great mighly.
W. A. O my dear, don't say so, he is both;
and many times he shews terrible examples of
his judgment and vengeance. - - -
Wife.Then you makee debargain with him;
you do bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other
Inarls,
... W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presump-
tions upon his goodness. .
Wife. Well, and yet no makee you dead
and you give him no tankee neither? -
W. A. It is true, I am an ungrateful, un-
thankful dog, that I am. .. - -
Wife. Why, you say he makee you, why
makee you no much better then. . .
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myself,
and abused his goodness. * • * :
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no
makee him angry, no do bad ting.
h’. A. You mean, my dear, that you desire
I would teach you to know God : alas ! poor
dear creature he must teach thee, and not I.
But I’ll pray earnestly to him to direct thee,
and to forgive me, a miserable sinner. (Here-
wpon he went a little distance, and kneeling
down prayed earnestly to God to enlighten her
mind, and to pardon his sins ; when this was
done, they continued their discourse thus.)
Wife. What you put down knee for 7 For
what hold up hand? Who you speak to?
W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of sub-
mission to him that made me, and prayed that
he would open your eyes and understanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? And will he
hear what you say? . . * :
W. A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and
has given us promise that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray ? What,
do you hear him speak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken
formerly to:good men from heaven ; and by
divine revelation they have written all his laws
down in a book.
Wife. O where dat good book?
W. A. I have it not now by me : but one
time or other Ishall get it for you to read. (Then
he embraced her with great affection.)
Wife. Pray tell a mee did God teachee them
write that book 2 º, “ . .
j/W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him
to be God. . . . . . . .
, , Æife. What way, what rule you know
him 2 * *
..., M.A., Because he teaches what is good, just,
and holy; and forbids all wicked and abomi-
nable actions that incur his displeasure.
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he
do all things you say he do, surely he hear me
say O to him ; he makee me good if I wish to
be good; he no kill me if I love him ; me tink,
believe him great God; me say O to him along
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and
made her kneel down by him, praying with the
greatest fervency that God would instruct her
by his Holy Spirit ; and that God by his pro-
widence would send them a Bible for both their
instructions. And such was the early piety of
this new convert, that she made him promise
never to forsake God any more, lest, being
made dead, as she called it, she should not only
want her instructor, but himself be miserable
in a long eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, prov-
ed very affecting to us both, but particularly to
the young clergyman, who was mightily con-
cerned he could not talk to her himself. Sir,
said he, there is something more to be done to
his woman than to marry her : I mean that
she ought to be baptized. To this I presently
agreed. Pray, said he again, ask her husband,
whether he has ever talked to her of Jesus
Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature of
faith, and redemption in and by him, of the
Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judg-
ment, and a future state : but the poor fellow
melted into tears at this question, saying, that he
had said something to her of these things; but
his inability to talk of them made him afraid
lest her knowledge of them should rather make
her contemn religion than be benefited by it :
but that, if I would discourse with her, it would
be very evident my labour would not be in
vain. Accordingly I called her in, and plac-
ing myself as interpreter between the religious
priest and the woman, I entreated him to go
on : but surely never was such a sermon preach:
ed by any clergyman in these latter days with
so much zeal, knowledge and sincerity. In
short, he brought the woman to embrace the
knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by
him, with so surprising a degree of understand-
ing, that she made it her own request to be
baptized.
He then performed his office in the sacra-
ment of baptism, first, by saying some words
over to himself in Latin, and then asking me
to give her a name as being her godfather,
and pouring a whole dish full of water upon
the woman's head, he said : MARY, I baptize
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost ; so that none could
know of what religion he was. After this he
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus
the woman being made a Christian, he married
her to Will. Atkins; which being finished, he
affectionately exhorted him to lead a holy life for
the future; that since the Almighty, by the con-
victions of his conscience, had honoured him
to be the instrument of his wife's conversion,
he should not dishonour the grace of God, that
while the savage was converted, the instrument
should be cast away. Thus ended a ceremony
to me the most pleasant and agreeable I ever
saw in my life.
The affairs of the island being settled, I was
preparing to go on board, when the young
man (whose mother was starved) came to me,
saying, that as he understood I had a clergy-
man with me, who had married the English-
men with savages, he had a match to make be-
tween two Christians which he desired might
be finished before I departed. . Thinking that
it was he himself that had courted his mother's
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing
rashly upon the account of his solitary circum-
stances; that the maid was an unequal match
for him both in respect to substance and years;
and that it was very probable he would live
to return to his own country, where he might
have a far better choice. At these words smil-
ing he interrupted me thanking me for my
good advice; that as he had nothing to beg of
me but a small settlement with a servant or
two, or some few necessaries, so he hoped I
would not be unmindful of him when I re-
turned to England, but give his letters to his
friends; and that when he was redeemed, the
plantation, and all its improvements, however
valuable, should be returned to me again. But,
as for the marriage he proposed, that it was not
himself, but that it was between my Jack of all
trades and the maid Susan. -
'I was indeed agreeably surprised at the men-
tioning this match, ...}, seemed very suitable,
the one being a very ingenious fellow, and
the other an excellent, dexterous and sensible
house-wife, fit to be governess of the whole is-
land : so we married them the same day; and
as I was her father, and gave her away, so
I gave her a handsome portion, appointing her
and her husband a convenient large space of
ground for their plantation. The sharing out
of the land I left to Will. Atkins, who really
*
divided it very justly, to every person's satisfac-
tion : they only desired one general writing
under my hand for the whole, which I caused
to be drawn up, signed and sealed to them,
setting out their bounds, and giving them a right
to the whole possession of their respective plan-
tations, with their improvements, to them and
their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for
every particular plantation after eleven years.
As to their laws and government, I exhorted
them to love one another and as to the In-
dians who lived in a nook by themselves, I al-
loted three or four of them plantations, and
the rest willingly chose to become servants to the
other families, by which means they were em-
ployed in useful labour, and fared much bet-
ter than they did before. Besides, the savages
being thus mixed with the Christians, the work
of their conversion might be set on foot by the
latter in the clergyman's absence to our equal
satisfaction. The young priest, however, was
a little anxious lest the Christians should not be
willing to do their parts in instructing those
poor Indians: I therefore told him, we should
call them all together; that he should speak to
the Spaniards who were Papists, and I to the
English who were Protestants, and make them
promise that they would never make any dis-
inction in religion, but teach the general true
knowledge of God, and his son Jesus Christ,
in order to convert the poor savages. And
ihis, indeed, they all promised us accordingly.
When I came to Will. Atkins's house, I
found his baptized wife, and the young woman
newly married to my Jack of all trades, were
become great intimates, and discoursing of
religion together. O, Sir, says Will. Atkins,
when God has sinners to reconcile to himself,
he never wants an instructor : I knew I was
unworthy for so good a work, and therefore
this young woman has been sent hither as it
were from heaven, who is sufficient to convert
a whole island of savages. The young woman
blushed, and was going to rise : but I desired
her to sit still, and hoped that God would bless
her in so good a work, and then, pulling out
a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my
pocket for him), Here, Atkins, said I, here is
an assistant that perhaps you had not before.
So confounded was the poor man, that it was
some time before he could speak; at last, turn-
ing to his wife : My dear, }. said, did I not
tell you that God could; hear what we said 7
Here's the book I prayed for, when you and
I kneeled under the bush : God then heard us,
and now has sent it. The woman was sur-
prised, and thought really God had sent that
individual book from heaven ; but I turned to
the young woman, and desired her to explain
to the new convert, that God may properly be
said to answer our petitions, when, in the
course of his providence, such particular things
come to pass as we petitioned for. This the
young woman did effectually: but surely Will.
Atkins's joy cannot be expressed ; no man be-
ing more thankful for any thing in the world,
than he was for his Bible, nor desired it from a
better principle,
After several religious discourses, I desired
the young woman to give me an account of
the anguish she felt when she was starving to
death with hunger; to which she readily con-
sented, and began in the following manner:
« Sir », said she, & all our victuals being gone,
after I had fasted one day, my stomach was
very sickish, and at the approach of night, I
was inclined to yawning, and sleepy. When
I slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked
a little refreshed : three hours after, my sto-
mach being more and more sickish, Ilay down
31o LIFE AND ADVENTURES
and ill. Thus I passed the second day with a
strange variety, hungry, then sick again,
with reachings to vomit: that night I dreamed
I was at Barbadoes, buying plenty of provi-
sions, and dined heartily. But when I awaked,
my spirits were exceedingly sunk to find my-
self in the extremity of famine. There was
but one glass of wine, which being mixed with
sugar, I drank up; but for want of substance
to digest upon, the fumes of it got into my
head, and made me senseless for some time.
The third day I was so ravenous and furious,
that I could have eaten a little child if it had
come in my way; during which time I was as
mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of
these fits I fell down, and struck my face a-
gainst the corner of a pallet bed, where my
mistress lay : the blood gushed out of my nose;
but by my excessive bleeding, both the violence
31o LIFE AND ADVENTURES
ger abated. After this I grew sick again, strove
to vomit, but could not ; then bleeding a se-
cond time, I swooned away as dead; when I
came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing pain
in my stomach, which went off towards night,
with a longing desire for food. I took a draught
of water and sugar, but it came up again; then
I drank water without sugar, and that slaid
with me. I laid me down on the bed, pray-
ing God would take me away ; after I had
slumbered, I thought myself a-dying, therefore
recommended my soul to God, and wished
somebody would throw me into the sea. All
this while my departing mistress lay by me;
the last bit of bread she had, she gave it to her
dear child, my young master. The mornin
after, I fell into a violent passion of crying, an
after that into hunger. I espied the blood that
came from my nose in a bason, which I im—
mediately swallowed up. At night I had the
usual variations, as pain in the stomach, sick,
sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought
but that I should die before morning. In the
morning came on terrible gripings in my bow-
els. At this time I heard my young master's
lamentations, by which I understood his mo–
ther was dead. Soon after, the sailors cried :
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 511
tracted for joy of that relief which afterwards
we received from your hands, 5,
Surely never was a more distinct account of
starving to death than this. But to return to
the disposition of things among my people, I
did not take any notice to them of the sloop.
that I had framed, neither would I leave them
the two pieces of brass cannon, or the two
quarter-deck guns that I had on board, lest,
upon any disgust, they should have separated,
or turned pirates, and so made the island a den
of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober pious
people : but leaving them in a flourishing con-
dition, with a promise to send them further
relief from Brazil, as sheep, hogs, and cows
(being obliged to kill the latter at sea, having
no hay to feed them), I went on board the ship
again the first of May 1695, after having been
twenty days among them : and next morning,
giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we
set sail for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the cur-
rent being very strong, we were drove to the
N. N. E. towards the land. Some hours after
we perceived the sea covered as it were with
something very black, not easily at first to be
discovered: upon which our chief mate ascend-
ing the shrouds a little way, and taking a view
with a perspective glass, he cries out, An ar-
my! An Army, you fool, said I, what do you
mean? Nay, Sir, said he, don't be angry, I
assure you it is not only an army, but a fleet
too ; for I believe there are a thousand canoes
paddling along, and making with great haste
towards us,
Indeed every one of us were surprised at this
relation ; and my nephew the captain could
not tell what to think of it, but thought we
should all be devoured. Nor was I free from
concern, when I considered how much we
were becalmed, and what a strong current set
towards the shore: however, I encouraged him
not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an an-
chor, as soon as we were certain that we must
engage them. Accordingly we did so, and furl-
ed all our sails : as to the savages, we feared
nothing, but only that they might set the ship
on fire; to prevent which I ordered them to
get their boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the head, and the other by the stern, well
~
manned, with skeets and buckets to extinguish
the flames, should it so happen. The savages
soon came up with us ; but there were not so
many as the mate had said; for instead of a
thousand canoes, there were only one hundred
and twenty; too many indeed for us, several
of their canoes containing about sixteen or
Seventeen men.
As they approached us, they seemed to be in
the greatest amazement, not knowing what to
make of us. They rowed round the ship, which
occasioned us to call to the men in the boats
not to suffer them to come near them. Here-
upon they beckoned to the savages to keep back,
which they accordingly did ; but at their re-
treat they let fly about fifty arrows among us,
and very much wounded one of our men in
the long-boat. I called to them not to fire upon
any account; but handing them down some
deal-boards, the carpenters made them a kind
of a fence to shield them from the arrows. In
half an hour after they came so near astern of
us, that we had a perfect sight of them; then
they rowed a little farther out, till they came
directly along side of us, and then approached
so near as they could hear us speak: this made
me order all our men to keep close, and get
their guns ready. In the mean time I ordered
Friday to go out upon deck, and ask them in
his language what they meant? No sooner did
he do so, but six of the savages, who were in
the foremost canoes, stooping down, shewed us
their naked backsides, as much as to say in En-
glish, kiss our — ; but Friday quickly knew
what this meant, by immediately crying out
they were going to shoot; unfortunately for
him, poor creature who fell under the cloud
of three hundred arrows, no less than seven
piercing through his body, killing one of the
514 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
in all my solitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Fri-
day, that the guns, which before were charged
with only powder to frighten them, I ordered
to be loaded with small shot; nor did the gun-
ners fail in their aim, but at this broadside split
and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes,
which killed numbers of them, and set the rest
a-swimming: the others, frightened out of their
wits, little regarding their fellows drowning,
scoured away as fast as they could. One poor
wretch our people took up, swimming for his
life, an hour after. He was very sullen at first,
so that he would neither eat nor speak : but I
took a way to cure him, by ordering them to
throw him into the sea, which they did, and
then he came swimming back like a cork; call-
ing in his tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So
we took him on board, but it was a long time
before we could make him speak or under-
stand English; yet when we had taught him,
he told us, they were going with their kings to
fight a great battle ; and when we asked him,
what made them come up to us? he said, to
makee de great wonder look ; where it is to be
noted, that those natives, and those of Africa,
always add two e's at the end of English words,
as makee, takee, and the like, from which it is
a very difficult thing to make them break off.
Being now under sail, we took our last fare-
well of poor honest Friday, and interred him
with all possible decency and solemnity; putt-
ing him into a coffin, and committing him to
the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns
to be fired for him. Thus ended the life of one
of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and aflec-
tionate servants, that ever any man was blessed
with in the world. -
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about
twelve days time we made land in the latitude
of five degrees south of the line. Four days we
kept on S. by E. in sight of shore, when we
made cape St. Augustine, and in three days we
came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints.
I had great difficulty here to get leave to hold
correspondence on shore ; for neither the fi-
gure of my partner, my two merchant trustees,
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 315
the island, could procure me the favour, till
such time as the prior of the monastery of the
Augustines (to whom I had given 5oo moi—
dores) obtained leave from the governor, for
me personally, with the captain and one more,
together with eight sailors, to come on shore;
upon this condition, that we should not land
any goods out of the ship, or carry any person
away without licence: I found means however
to get on shore three bales of English goods,
such as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen,
which I brought as a present for my partner,
who had sent me on board a present of fresh
provisions, wine, and sweatmeats, worth above
thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and
three or four fine gold medals.
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the
value of lool. Sterling, and obliged him to fit
up the sloop I bought, for the use of my island,
in order to send them refreshments : and so.
O a
active was he in this matter, that he had the
vessel finished in a few days, to the master of
which I gave particular instructions to find the
place. I soon loaded him with a small cargo:
and one of our sailors offered to settle there,
upon my letter to the Spanish governor, if I
would allot him tools and a plantation. This I
willingly granted, and gave him the savage we
had taken prisoner to be his slave. All things
being ready for the voyage, my old partner told
me, there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil
planter, who having fallen under the displea-
sure of the church, and in fear of the inquisi-
tion, which obliged him to be concealed, would
be glad of such an opportunity to make his
escape, with his wife and two daughters; and
if I would allot them a plantation in my island,
he would give them a small stock to begin with,
for that the officers had already seized his ef-
316 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
household stuff, and two slaves. This request I
presently granted, concealing him and his fa-
mily on board our ship, till such time as the
sloop (where all the effects were) was gone out
of the bay, and then we put them on board,
who carried some materials, and plants for
planting sugar-canes, along with them. By this
sloop, among other things, I sent my subjects
3 milk-cows and five calves, about 22 hogs,
3 sows big with pig, two mares and a stone-
horse. I also engaged three Portuguese women
§§ for the sake of the Spaniards, which, with
ibó persecuted man's two daughters, were suf-
ficient, since the rest had wives of their own,
though in another country; all which cargo
arrived safe, no doubt, to their exceeding com-
º
fort, who, with this addition, were about sixty
or seventy people, besides children. .
At this place, my truly honest and pious cler-
gyman left me ; for a ship being ready to set
sail for Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither;
but I assure you, it was with the greatest reluc-
tancy I parted from a person, whose virtue and
piety merited the greatest esteem.
From the Brazils, we made directly over the
Atlantic ocean to the Cape of Good-Hope, hav-
ing a tolerable good voyage, steering for the
most part S. E. We were on a trading voy-
age, and had a supercargo on board, who was
to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived
at the Cape ; only being limited to a certain
number of days, or stay, by charter-parly, at
the several ports she was to go to. At the Cape,
we only took in fresh water, and then sailed-
for the coast of Coromandel; we were there
informed that a French man of war of 50 guns,
and two large merchant ships, were sailed for
the Indies; but we heard no more of them.
In our passage, we touched at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the inhabitants are
naturally fierce and treacherous, and go con-
stantly armed with bows and lances, yet for
some time they treated us civilly enough ; and;
in exchange for knives, scissars, and other tri-
fles, they brought us eleven good fat bullocks,
which we took partly for present fresh victuals,
and the remainder to salt for the ship's use.
So curious was I to view every corner of the
world where I came to, that I went on shore
as often as I could. One evening, when on
shore, we observed numbers of the people stand
gazing at us at a distance. We º our-
selves in no danger, as they had hitherto used
us kindly. However, we cut three boughs out
of a tree, sticking them at a distance from us,
which, it seems, in that country, is not only a
token of truce and amity, but when poles or
boughs are set up on the other side, it is a sign
the truce is accepted. In these treaties, how-
ever, there is one principal thing to be regarded,
that neither party come beyond one another's
three poles or boughs; so that the middle space
is not only secure, but is also allowed as a mar-
ket for traffic and commerce : when the truce
is thus accepted, they stick up their javelins and
lances at the first poles, and come on unarmed;
but, if any violence is offered, away they run
to their poles, take up their weapons, and then
the truce is at an end. This evening it hap-
pened that a greater number of people than
usual, both men and women, i. among
us for such toys as we had, with such great ci-
vility, that we made ourselves a little tent of
large boughs of trees, some of the men resolv-
ing 'o lie on shore all that night. But, for my
part, I and some others took our lodging in the
'boat, with boughs of trees spread over it, having
a sail spread at the bottom to lie upon. About
two o'clock in the morning, we were awaken-
ed by the firing of muskets, and our men crying
out for help, or else they would all be murder-
ed. Scarce had we time to get the boal a-shore,
when our men came plunging themselves into
the water, with about four hundred of the is—
landers at their heels. We took up seven of
ihe men, three of them very much wounded,
and one left behind killed, while the enemy
poured their arrows so thick among us, that we
t;#
>
were forced to make a barricade with boards
lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from
danger; and, having got ready our fire-arms,
we returned them a volley, which wounded
several of them, as we could hear by their cries,
In this condition we lay till break of day, and
then making signals of distress to the ship,
which my nephew the captain heard and un-
derstood, he weighed anchor, and stood as near
the shore as possible, and then sent another boat
with ten hands in her to assist us; but we call-
ed to them not to come near, informing them
of our unhappy condition. However, they
ventured ; when one of the men taking the
end of a tow-line in his one hand, and keep-
ing our boat between him and our adversaries,
swam on board us, and made fast our line io
the boat; upon this, slipping our cables, they
towed us out of the reach of their arrows, and
quickly after, a broadside was given them from
the ship, which made a most dreadful havock
among them. When we got on board, we exa-
mined into the occasion of this fray; the men
who fled informed us, that an old woman, who
sold milk within the poles, had brought a young
woman with her, who carried roots or herbs,
the sight of whom so much tempted our men,
that they offered rudeness to the maid, at which
the old woman set up a great cry; nor would
the sailors part with the prize, but carried her
among the trees, while the old woman went
and brought a whole army down upon them.
At the beginning of the attack, one of our men
was killed with a lance, and the fellow who
began the mischief, paid dear enough for his
mistress, though as yet we did not know what
O 4
had become of him; the rest luckily escaped.
The third night after the action, being curious
to understand how affairs stood, I look the su-
percargo, and twenty stout fellows with me,
and landed about two hours before midnight,
at the same place where those Indians stood
the night before, and there we divided our men
into two bodies, the boatswain commanding
one, and I another. It was so dark, that we
could see nobody, neither did we hear any
voice near us; but by and by the boatswain fall-
ing over a dead body, we agreed to halt till the
moon should rise, which we knew would be
in an hour after. We perceived here no fewer
than two and thirty bodies upon the ground,
whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied
with this discovery, I was for going on board
again; but the boatswain and the rest told me,
they would make a visit to the Indian town,
where those dogs, so they called them, resided,
asking me at the same time to go along with
them ; for they did not doubt, besides getting
a good booty, but they should find Tom Jeffery
there, for that was the unhappy man we missed.
But I utterly refused to go, and commanded
them back, being unwilling to hazard their
lives, as the safety of the ship wholly depended
upon them. Notwithstanding all I could say
to them, they all left me but one, and the su-
percargo : so we three returned to the boat,
where a boy was left, resolving to stay till they
returned. At parting I told them I supposed
most of them would run the same fate with
Tom Jeffery. To this they replied: Come, boys,
come along, we'll warrant we’ll come off" safe
enough , and so away they went, notwithstand-
*
ing all my admonitions, either concerning their
own safety, or the preservation of the ship. In-
deed, they were gallantly armed, every man
having a musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides
cutlasses, hangers, pole-axes, and hand-grana-
does. They came to a few Indian houses at
first, which not being the town they expected,
they went farther, and finding a cow tied to
a tree, they concluded that she would be a suf-
ficient guide, and so it proved; for, after they
untied her, she led them directly to the town,
which consisted of above two hundred houses,
several families living in some of the huts to—
gether. . At their arrival, all being in a pro-
found sleep, the sailors agreed to divide them-
selves into three bodies, and set three parts of
the town on fire at once, to kill those that were
escaping, and plunder the rest of the houses.
Thus desperately resolved, they went to work;
but the first party had not gone far, before they
called out to the rest, that they had found Tom
Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to the
place, and found the poor fellow indeed hang-
ing up naked by one arm, and his throat cut
almost from ear to ear : in a house that was
hard by the tree they found sixteen or seven-
teen Indians, who had been concerned in the
fray, two or three of them being wounded,
who were not gone to sleep ; this house they
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 521
five or six places more in the town appeared in
flames. The conflagration spread like wild fire,
their houses being all of wood, and covered
with flags or rushes. The poor affrighted in-
habitants endeavoured to run out to save their
lives, but they were driven **** flames
by the sailors, and killed without mercy. At
the first house above mentioned, after the boat-
swain had slain two with his pole-axe, he threw
a hand-granado into the house, which burst-
ing, made a terrible havock, killing and wound-
ing most of them ; and their king and most of
his train, who were then in that house, fell vic-
tims to their fury, every creature of them being
either smothered or burnt. All this while they
never fired a gun, lest the people should awak-
en faster than they could overpower them. But
the fire awakened them fast enough, which
obliged our fellows to keep together in bodies.
By this time the whole town was in a flame,
yet their fury rather increased, calling out to
one another to remember Tom Jeffery. The
terrible light of this conflagration made me
very uneasy, and roused my nephew the cap-
tain, and the rest of his men, who knew no-
thing of the matter. When he perceived the
dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go off, he
readily concluded his men were in danger; he,
therefore, takes another boat, and comes a-
shore himself, with thirteen men well armed.
He was greatly surprised to see me and only
two men in the boat, but more so when I told
him the story ; but though I argued with him,
as I did with his men, about the danger of the
voyage, the interest of the merchants and own-
ers, and the safety of the ship, yet my nephew,
like the rest, declared, that he would rather lose
the ship, his voyage, his life, and all, than his
men should be lost for want of help : and so
away he went. For my part, seeing him re-
solved to go, I had not power to stay behind.
He ordered the pinnace i. again for twelve
men more, and then we marched directly as
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 323
such a scene of horror beheld, or more dismal
cries heard, except when Oliver Cromwell took
Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither spared
man, woman, or child. -
The first object, I think, we met with was
the ruins of one of their habitations, before
which lay four men and three women killed,
and two more burnt to death among the fire,
which was now decaying. Nothing could ap-
pear more barbarous than this revenge : none
more cruel than the authors of it. As we went
on, the fire increased, and the cry proceeded
in proportion. We had not gone much far-
ther, when we beheld three naked women,
followed by sixteen or seventeen men, flying
with the greatest swiftness from our men, who
shot one of them in our sight. When they per-
ceived us, whom they supposed also their mur-
derers, they set up a most dreadful shriek, and
both of them swooned away in the fright.
This was a sight which might have softened the
hardest heart; and, in pity, we took some ways
to let them know we would not hurt them,
while the poor creatures, with bended knees,
and lifted up hands, made pileous lamenta-
tions to us to save their lives. I ordered our
men not to hurt any of the poor creatures what-
soever; but being willing to understand the
occasion of all this, I went among these unhap-
py wretches, who neither understood me, nor
the good I meant them. However, being re-
solved to put an end to this barbarity, I order-
ed the men to follow me. We had not gone
£fy yards before we came up * the boat-
O
swain, with four of our men at his heels, all
of them covered with blood and dust, and in
search of more people to satiate their vengeance.
As soon as we saw them we called out, and
made them understand who we were; upon
which they came up to us, setting up a halloo
of triumph, in token that more help was come.
Noble captain, said he to my nephew, I’m glad
you’re come: we have not half done with these
villainous hell-hound dogs, we'll root out the
very nation of them from the earth, and kill
more than poor Tom has hairs upon his head :
and thus he went on till I interrupted him.
Blood-thirsty dog' said I, will your cruelty
never end ? I charge you touch not one crea—
ture more; stop your hands and stand still, or
you're a dead man this moment. Why, Sir,
said he, you neither know whom you are pro-
tecting, nor what they have done : but, pray,
come hither, and behold an instance of com—
passion, if such can merit your clemency; and
with that he shewed me the poor fellow with
his throat cut, hanging upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breasts
with rage, which, however, I thought had gone
too far, agreeable to these words of Jacob to
his sons Simeon and Levi: Cursed be their an–
ger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for it
was cruel. But this sight made my nephew
and the rest as bad as they; nay, my nephew
declared his concern was only for his men;
as for the people, not a soul of them ought to
live. Upon this, the boatswain and eight more
directly turned about, and went to finish the
intended tragedy ; which being out of my
power to preyent, I returned back both from the
dismal sight, and the piteous cries of those un-
fortunate creatures, who were made vic-
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 525
piece of folly in me to relurn to the boat with
but one attendant; and I had very near paid
for it, having narrowly escaped forty, armed
Indians, who had been alarmed by the con-
flagration ; but having passed the place where
they stood, I got to the boat accompanied with
the supercargo, and so went on board, sending
the pinnace back again to assist the men in
what might happen. When I had got to the
boat, the fire was almost extinguished, and the
noise abated ; but I had scarce been half an
hour on board the ship, when I heard another
volley given by our sailors; and a great smoke,
which, as I afterwards found, was our men
falling upon those houses and persons that stood
between them and the sea; but here they spar-
ed the wives and children, and killed only the
men, to the number of about sixteen or seven-
teen. By the time they got to the shore, the pin-
nace and the ship's boat were ready to receive
them, and they all got safe on board, not a man
of them having received the least hurt, except
two, one of whom strained his foot, and the
other burnt his hand a little; for they met with
no resistance, the poor Indians being unpre-
pared, amazed, º confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of
them, but particularly with the captain, who,
instead of cooling the rage of the men, had
prompted them on to further mischief : nor
could he make me any other excuse, but that
as he was a man, he could not master his pas—
sions at the sight of one of his men so cruelly
murdered. As for the rest, knowing they were
not under my command, they took no notice
of my anger; but rather boasted of their re-
venge. According to all their accounts, they
killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty
men, women, and children, besides burning
the town to ashes. They took their companion
Tom Jeffery from the tree, covered him with
some of the ruins, and so left him. But, how-
ever this action of our men might seem to them
justifiable, yet I always openly condemned it
with the appellation of the Massacre of Mada-
gascar. For, though they had slain this Jef-
fery, yet certainly he was the first aggressor by
attempting to violate the chastity of a young
innocent woman, who ventured down to them
on the faith of the public capitulation, which
was so treacherously broken.
While we were under sail, the boatswain
would often defend this bloody action by say-
ing, that the Indians had broke the truce the
night before by shooting one of our men with-
out just provocation ; and what if the poor fel-
low had taken a little liberty with the wench,
he ought not to have been murdered in so villai-
nous a manner and that they had acted no-
thing but what the divine laws commissioned
to be done to such homicides. However, I was
in the same mind as before, telling them that
they were murderers, and bid them depend
upon’t, that God would blast their voyage for
such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came into the gulf of Persia, five
ofour men, who ventured on shore, were either
killed or made slaves by the Arabians, the rest
of them having scarce time to escape to their
boat. This made me upbraid them afresh with
the just reiribution of heaven for such actions;
upon which the boatswain very warmly asked
me, whether those men on whom the tower
of Siloam fell, were greater sinners than the rest
of the Galileans? and besides, Sir, said he, none
of these five poor men that are lost, were with
us at the massacre of Madagascar, as you call
it ; and, therefore, your reprehension is very
unjust, and your application improper. Be-
sides, added he, you are continually using the
men very ill upon this account, and being but
a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to
bear it ; nor can we tell what ill designs you
may have to bring us to judgment for it in En-
gland; and, therefore, if you do not leave these
discourses, as also not concern yourself with
any of our affairs, I will leave the ship, and
not sail in such dangerous company.
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being
often repeated, I at length told him, the con-
cern I had on board was none of his business:
that I was a considerable owner in the ship,
and therefore had a right to speak in common,
and that I was no way accountable to him, nor
to any body else. As no more passed for some
time after, I thought all had been over. At this
time we were in the road of Bengal, where
going on shore with the supercargo one day,
in the evening as I was preparing to go on
board, one of the men came to me, and told
me, I need not trouble myself to come to the
boat, for that the cockswain and others had
ordered him not to carry me on board any
more. This insolent message much surprised
me; yel I gave him no answer to it, but went
directly and acquainted the supercargo, en-
treating him to go on board, and, by acquaint-
ing the captain with it, prevent the mutiny
which I perceived would happen. But before
I had spoken this, the matter was effected on
board ; for no sooner was he gone off in the
boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and
all the inferior officers came to the quarter-
deck, desiring to speak with the captain; and
there the boatswain made a long harangue, ex-
claiming against me, as before mentioned, that,
if I had not gone a-shore peaceably for my
own diversion, they by violence would have
compelled me for their satisfaction : that, as
they had shipped with the captain, so they
would faithfully serve him; but, if I did not
quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to it,
they would leave the ship immediately : here-
upon, turning his face about by way of signal,
they all cried out : ONE and ALL, ONE and
ALL.
You may be sure, that though my nephew
was a man of great courage, yet he could not
be but surprised at their sudden and unexpect-
ed behaviour; and, though he talked stoutly
to them,and afterwards expostulated with them,
that, in common justice to me, who was a con-
siderable owner in the ship, they could not turn
me, as it were, out of my own house, which
might bring their lives in danger, should they
ever be taken in England; nay, though he in-
vited the boatswain on shore to accommodate
matters with me, yet all this, I say, signified
nothing : they would have nothing to do with
me; and they were resolved to go on shore, if
I came on board. Well, said my nephew, if
you are so resolved, permit me to talk with him,
and then I have done : and so he came to me,
giving me an account of their resolution, how
one and all designed to forsake the ship when
I came on board, for which he was mightily
concerned. I am glad to see you, nephew, said
I, and rejoice it is no worse, since they have
not rebelled against you : I only desire you to
send my necessary things on shore, with a suf-
ficient sum of money, and I will find my way
to England as well as I can. Though this
grieved my nephew to the heart, yet there was
no remedy but compliance; in short, all my
necessaries were sent me, and so this matter
was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues far-
ther off England by sea than at my little king-
dom, except this difference, that I might travel
by land over the Great Mogul’s country to Su-
rat, from thence up to Bassora, by sea up the
Persian gulf, then take the way of the caravans
over the Arabian desert to Aleppo and Scande-
roon, there take shipping to Italy, and so travel
by land into France, and from thence cross the
sea to England.
My nephew left me two persons to attend
me; one of them was his servant, and the other
clerk to the purser, who engaged to be mine.
I took lodgings in an English woman's house,
where several French, one English, and two
Italian merchants resided. The handsome en-
tertainment I met with here, occasioned me to
stay nine months, considering what course I
should take. Some English goods I had with
me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of
eight, and a letter of credence for more, if there
|
was such necessity. The goods I soon disposed
of to advantage, and bought here several good
530 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
with me. One morning the English merchant
came to me, as being very intimate together :
Countryman, said he, I have a project to com—
municate to you, which, I hope, will suit to
both our advantage. To be short, Sir, we are
both in a remote part of the world from our
country, but yet in a place where men of busi-
mess may get a great deal of money. Now, if
jou will put a thousand pounds to my thou-
sand pounds, we will hire a ship to our satis-
faction : you shall be captain, I will be mer-
chant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China:
for why should we lie still like drones, while
the whole world is in a continual motion ?
This proposal soon got my consent, being
very agreeable to my rambling genius; and
the more so because I looked upon my coun-
tryman to be a very sincere person: it required
some time before we could get a vessel to our
mind, and sailors to man it accordingly; at
length, we bought a ship, and got an English
mate, boatswain, and gunner, a Dutch carpen-
ter, and three Portuguese foremast-men; and,
for want of others, made shift with Indian sea-
men. We first sailed to Achin in the island
of Sumatra, and then to Siam, where we bar-
tered our wares for some arrack and opium;
the last of which bore a great price among the
Chinese. In a word, we went up to Suskan,
making a very great voyage; and, after eight
months time, I returned to Bengal, very well
satisfied with this adventure, having not only
got a sufficient quantity of money, but an in-
sight of getting a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend proposed to me
was to go among the Spice islands, and bring
home a load of cloves from the Manillas, or
thereabouts, islands belonging partly to Spain,
but where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long preparing for this voyage,
which we made no less successful than the last,
touching at Bornea, and several other places
which I do not perfectly remember, and re-
turning home in about five months time. We
soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves,
and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants,
who carried them away for the gulf; and, in
short, making five to one advantage, we were
loaded with money. -
Not long after my friend and I had made
up our accounts, to our entire satisfaction, there
came in a Dutch coaster from Batavia of about
two hundred tons. The crew of this vessel:
pretended themselves so sickly, that there were
not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage ;
and the caplain having given out that he in-
tended to go to Europe, public notice was
given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the
ship, paid the master, and took possession. We
would also have very willingly entertained
some of the men : but they having received
their share of booty were not to be found,
being altogether fled to Agra, the great city of
the Mogul's residence; and from thence were
to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Persian
gulf. And indeed they had reason to fly in this
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 531
captain was the gunner only, and not the com"
mander: that having been on a trading voyage,
they were attacked on shore by the Malayans,
who killed three men, and the captain; after
whose death the other eleven men ran away
with the ship to the bay of Bengal, and left the
mate and five men more on shore; but of this
affair we shall have occasion to speak at more
length hereafter,
However they came by the ship, methought
we bought it honestly; neither did we suspect
any thing of the matter; when the man shew-
ed us a bill of sale for the ship (undoubtedly
forged) to one Emanuel Clostershoven, which
name he went by. And so without any more
to do, we picked up some Dutch and English
seamen, resolving for another voyage for cloves
among the Philippine and Molucca islands; in
short, we continued thus five or six years,
trading from port to port with extraordinary
success; in the seventh year we undertook a
voyage to China, designing to touch at Siam,
and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage,
contrary winds beat us up and down for a con-
siderable time among the islands in the straits
of Molucca. No sooner were we clear of those
rugged seas, but we perceived our ship had
sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the
gulf, and goes up to Siam.
One day as I was on shore refreshing myself,
there comes to me an Englishman, who was a
gunner's mate on board an English East India
ship, riding up the river, near the city of Cam-
bodia. Sir, said he, you may wonder at my
business, having never seen me in your life;
but though I am a stranger, I have something
to tell you that very nearly concerns you ; and
indeed it is the imminent danger you are in, has
moved me to give you this timely notice. Dan-
ger! said I, what danger? I know of none, ex-
cept my ship being leaky, for which I design
to have her run aground to-morrow morn-
ing. , Sir, said he, I hope you will be better
employed, when you shall hear what I have to
say to you. You know the town of Cambodia
is about 15 leagues up this river ; about three
leagues on this side of it, there lies two Dutch
and three English ships. And would you ven-
ture here, without considering what strength
you had to engage them 2 I knew not what he
meant by this discourse, and turning short up-
on him, Sir, said I, I know no reason I have to
be afraid either of any English or Dutch ships,
I am no interloper, and what business have
they then with me? Well, Sir, said the man,
if you do think yourself secure, all that I can
say, you must take your chance ; however, I
am very sorry you are so deaf to good advice ;
but I assure you, if you do not put to sea imme-
diately, you will be attacked by five long boats
• full of men, hanged yourself for a pirate, if
gou are taken, and the particulars examined
afterwards. I thought, Sir, added he, I might
have met with better reception for such a sin-
gular piece of service. Sir, said I, I was never
ungrateful to any man; but pray explain your-
self, and I'll go on board this minute, whether
the leak be stopped or no. Why, Sir, said he,
to be short, because time is precious, the mal-
ter is this: You know well enough that you was
with the ship at Sumatra, where your captain
was murdered by the Malayans, with three of
his sailors ; and that either you, or some who
were on board you, ran away with the ship,
and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir,
this is the sum of what I had to say ; and I
can positively assure you, that if you be taken,
you will be executed without much ceremony;
jor undoubtedly you cannot but be sensible
what little law merchant ships shew to pirates,
whenever they fall into their unmerciful hands.
Sir, said I, I thank you for your kind infor-
mation; and though, I am sure, no man could
come more honestly by the ship than I have
done, yet knowing their enterprise, and being
satisfied of your honest intention, I’ll be upon
my defence. Prithee, Sir, said the man, don't
talk of being upon your defence, the best that
you can make is to be out of danger; and there-
jore, if you have any regard to your life, and
the lives of your men, take the advantage with-
out fail, and put out to sea at high water;
by which means, as you have a whole tide be-
jore you, you will be gone too far out of their
reach before they can come down.
I am mighty well satisfied, said I, in this par-
ticular, and of your kindness, which merits my
greatest esteem : pray, Sir, what amends shall I
make you? He replied : I know not what a-
mends you are usilling to make, because you
may have some doubts of its certainty: but, to
convince you of the truth of what I say, I have
one offer to make to you. On board one of the
English ships, I have nineteen months pay due
to me, and this Dutchman that is with me has
seven months pay due to him, which if you will
make good to us, we will go along with you. If
you shall find, that there is nothing in what
we have said, then we shall desire nothing :
but, when you are convinced that we have saw-
ed the ship, your life, and the lives of the men,
we will leave the whole to your generosity.
So reasonable did this every way appear,
that I immediately consented, and we went di-
rectly on board. As soon as we came on board,
my partner calls joyfully out, that they had
stopped the leak. Well, thank God, said I, but
pray let us weigh anchor forthwith. Weigh'
said he, what is the meaning of this hurry 2
Pray, ask no questions, said I, but all hands to
work without losing a moment's time. Upon
which, in great surprise, the captain was called,
who immediately ordered the anchor to be got
up ; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet being assisted with a little land breeze, we
stood out to sea. I then called my partner into
the cabin, and related the story at large, which
was confirmed and more amplified by the two
men I had brought on board. Scarce had we
finished our discourse upon this head, but a
sailor came to the cabin door with a message
from the captain, that we were chased by five
sloops full of armed men. Very well, said I,
it is plain now there is something in it. And
so going upon deck, I told all the men there
was a design for seizing the ship, and of exe-
cuting us for pirates; and asked them whether
they would faithfully stand by us, and by one
another? To which they unanimously replied,
that they would fight to their last drop of blood.
I then asked the captain, which way he thought
best for us to manage the battle 2 Sir, said he,
the only method is to keep them off with our
great shot as long as we are able, and then
have recourse to our small arms : and when
both these fail us, then retire to close quarters,
when perhaps the enemy, wanting materials,
can neither break open our bulk heads, nor get
in upon us. Mean time the gunner was or—
dered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft
out of the steerage, and so load them with mus-
ket bullets and small pieces of old iron ; and
the deck being cleared, we prepared for the
engagement, still, however, keeping out at sea.
The boats followed us with all the sail they
could make, and we could perceive the two
foremost were English, which outsailed the rest
by two leagues, and which we found would
come up with us : hereupon, we fired a gun
without ball, intimating that they should bring
to, and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal
for parley; but, finding them crouding after
us, till they came within shot, we took in our
white, and hanging out thered flag, immediate-
ly fired at them wit, ball : we then called to
them with a speaking trumpet, bidding them at
their peril keep off.
But all this signified nothing; for, depend-
ing upon the strength that followed them, they
were resolutely bent for mischief: hereupon,
I ordered them to bring the ship to, by which
means they lying upon our broadside, we let
fly at them at once, one of whom carried away
the stern of the hindermost boat, and obliged
them not only to take down their sail, but made
them all run to the head of the boat, to keep
them from sinking ; and so she lay by, having
enough of it. In the mean time, we prepared
to welcome the foremost boat in the same man-
While we were doing this, one of the three
hindermost boats came up to the relief of that
which was disabled, and took the men out of
her. We again called to parley with them;
but, instead of an answer, one of the boats
came close under our stern : whereupon our
gunner let fly his two chace-guns; but missing,
the men in the boat shouted, and waving their
caps, came on with greater fury. To repair this:
seeming disgrace, the gunner soon got ready,
and, firing the second time, did a great deal of
mischief among the enemy. We waved again,
and, bringing our quarter to bear upon them,
fired three guns more, when we found the boat
a-sinking, and several men already in the sea;
hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders
to save as many as they could, and instantly
to come on board, because the rest of their
boats were approaching : accordingly they did
so, and took up three of them, one of whom
was almost past recovery; and then crouding
all the sail we could, after our men came on
board, we stood out farther to sea, so that the
other three boats gave over their chace, when
they came up to the first two. Thus delivered
from imminent danger, we changed our course
to the eastward, quite out of the course of all
European ships.
Being now at sea, and inquiring more par-
ticularly of the two seamen the meaning of all
this, the Dutchman at once let us into the se–
cret. He told us, that the fellow who sold us the
ship was an arrant thief, who had run away
with her; that the captain was treacherously
murdered on the coast of Molucca by the na-
tives there, with three of his men; that he, the
P
Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to
have recourse to the woods for their safety, at
length escaped by means of a Dutch ship in
its way to China, which had sent their boat on
shore for fresh water : that, after this, he went
to Batavia, where two of the seamen belong-
ing to the ship (who had deserted the rest in
their travels) arrived, and there gave an ac-
count that the fellow who ran away with the
ship had sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates
who went a cruising, and had already taken
one English and two Dutch ships richly laden.
Now, though this was absolutely false, yet,
concerning us directly, my pariner truly said,
that our deliverance was to be esteemed so
much the more, by reason, had we fallen into
their hands, we could have expected nothing
from them but immediate death, considering
our accusers would have been our judges: and,
therefore, his opinion was to return directly
to Bengal, where, being known, we could
prove how honestly we came by the ship, of
whom we bought her, and the like, and where
we were sure of some justice; at least would
not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. I
was at first of my partner's opinion; but when
I had more seriously considered of the matter,
I told him we ran a great hazard in attempting
to return, being on the wrong side of the straits
of Molucca, and that if, upon alarm given, we
should be taken by the Dutch of Batavia or En-
glish elsewhere, our running away would be a
sufficient evidence to condemn us. This dan-
ger indeed startled not only my partner, but
likewise all the ship's company; so we chang-
ed our former resolution, and resolved to go
to the coast of Tonquin, and so to that of China,
where, pursuing our first design as to trade, we
might likewise have an opportunity to dispose
of the ship some way or other, and to return
to Bengal in any country vessel we could pro-
cure. This being agreed to, we steered away
N. N. E. about 50 leagues off the usual course
to the east, which put us to some inconvenien-
cies. As the wind blew steadily against us, our
voyage became very tedious, and we began to
be afraid of want of provision; and what was
still worse, we apprehended, that as those ships,
from whose boats we had escaped, were bound
to China, they might get before us, and have
given fresh information, which might create
another vigorous pursuit. Indeed, I could not
help being grieved, when I considered that I,
who had never wronged or defrauded any
person in my life, was now pursued like a com-
mon thief; and, if taken, to run the greatest
danger of being executed as such; and, though
innocent, I found myself under the necessity
of flying for my safety, and thereby to escape
being brought to shame, of which I was even
more afraid than of death itself. It was easy
to read my dejection in my countenance. My
mind was oppressed, like those unhappy in-
nocent persons, who, being overpowered by
blasphemous and perjured evidences, wicked-
ly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin
their reputation, have no other recourse in this
world to ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers,
and tears. My partner seeing me so concern-
ed, encouraged me as well as he could ; and,
after describing to me the several ports of that
coast, he told me, he would either F'. me in ou.
* 52.
the coast of Cochinchina, or else in the bay of
Tonquin, from whence we might go to Macao,
a town once possessed by the Portuguese, and
where still many European families resided.
To this place we steered, and early next
morning came in sight of the coast; but thought
it adviseable to put into a small river where we
could, either over land, or by the ship's pin-
nace, know what vessels were in any ports
thereabouts. This happy step proved our de-
liverance ; for next morning there came to
the bay of Tonquin two Dutch ships, and a
third without any colours ; and in the even-
ing two English ships steered the same course.
The river where we were was but small, and
ran but a few leagues up the country north-
ward : the country was wild and barbarous,
and the people thieves, having no correspon-
dence with any other nation, dealing only in
fish, oil, and such gross commodities; and one
barbarous custom they still retained, that when
any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked upon
their coast, they make the men prisoners or
slaves; so that now we might fairly say we were
surrounded by enemies both by sea and land.
As the ship had been leaky, we took the op-
portunity in this place to search her, and to
stop up the places which let in the water. We
accordingly lightened her, and bringing our
guns and other moveable things to one side,
we essayed to bring her down, that we might
come at her, bottom ; but upon second consi-
deration we did not think it safe to let her fie
on dry ground, neither indeed was the place
convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used
to such a sight as to see a ship lie down on one
side, and heel in towards the shore, not per-
ceiving her men, who were at work on her
bottom, with stages and boats on the off-side,
presently imagined the ship had been cast a-
way, and lay fast on the ground. Agreeable
to this supposition, they surrounded us with
ten or twelve large boats with a resolution,
undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and to carry
away those they found alive for slaves to their
king. But when they perceived our men hard
at work on the ship's bottom and side, wash-
ing, graving, and stopping her, it filled them
all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as
though they were confounded. Nor could we
imagine what their design was ; however, for
fear of danger we handed down arms and am-
munition to those at work, in order to defend
themselves : and indeed this precaution was
absolutely necessary ; for in a quarter of an
hour after, the natives concluding it was really
a shipwreck, and that we were saving our lives
and goods, which theyhought belonged to them-
selves, came down upon our men, as though it
had been in a line of battle. We lay at pre-
sent but in a very unfit posture to fight ; and
before the stages could be got down, or the men
in the boat come on board as they were order-
ed, the Cochinchineses were upon them, and
two of their boats boarding our long boat, they
began to lay hold of our men as prisoners.
The first they seized was a stout English sailor,
who never fired his musket like a fool, as I
imagined, but laid it down in the boat: but he
knew what he was doing; for, by main force,
he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out
P 3
against the boat's gunnel : a Dutchman that
was next him snatched up the musket, and
knocked down five more with the but-end of
it; however, this was doing very little to their
number ; but a strange unexpected accident,
which rather merits laughter than any thing
else, gave Óur men a complete victory over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing
to grave the outside of the ship, as well as to
ay the seams, where he calked to stop the
leaks, had gotten two kettles just let down in
the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as
the shipwrights use : the carpenter's man had
a great iron ladle with which he used to sup-
ply the workmen with hot stuff, and as two of
the enemies entered the boat where the fellow
stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the
hot boiling liquor, which, the poor creatures
being half naked, made them roar out, and
jump into the sea. Well done, Jack, says the
carpenter, give them the other dose ; and so
stepping forward himself takes a mop, and dip-
ping it into the pitch-pot, he and his man so
plentifully flung it among them, as that none
escaped being scalded : upon which, they all
made the best of their way, crying and howl-
ing in such a frightful manner, that in all my
adventures I never heard the like. And, in-
deed, never was I better pleased with any con-
quest than I was with this, there being so little
bloodshed and having an aversion to killing
such savage wretches (more than was neces-
sary), as knowing they came on errands, which
their laws and customs made them think were
just and equitable. By this time, all things be-
-
ing in order, and theship swimming, they found
their mistake, so they did not venture a second
attack. Thus ended our merry fight; and, hav-
ing got some rice, bread, roots, and sixteen
good hogs on board the day before, we set sail,
not daring to go into the bay of Tonquin, but
steered N. E. towards the isle of Formosa, or as
though we would go to the Manillas, or Phi-
lippine islands, for fear of meeting with any
European ships. When we anchored at the
isle Formosa, the inhabitants not only courte-
ously supplied us with provisions and fresh wa-
ter, but dealt very fairly and honestly with us
in their bargains and agreements. From this
place we steered north, keeping still off the
coast of China, till we were beyond all its ports
where European ships usually come; and, at
length, being come to the latitude of thirty de-
grees, we resolved to put into the first trading
port we should come at; and standing for the
shore, a boat came off two leagues to us with
an old Portuguese pilot on board, who offered
his service; we very gladly accepted him, and
sent the boat back again. And now, having
the old man on board, I talked to him of going
to Nanquin, the most northward part of the
coast of China. What will you do #. ? said
he, smiling. I told him we would sell our car-
go, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought
silks, tea, etc. and so return the same way back.
O, said he, you had better put in at Macao,
where you may buy China wares as cheap as
at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater
advance. But, said I, we are gentlemen as well
as merchants, and design to see the great city
of Pekin, and the magnificent court of the mo-
P 4.
march of China. Why then, said he, you should
go to Ningpo, where there is a navigable river
that goes through the heart of that vast empire
two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea,
which crosses all the rivers, passes considerable
hills by the help of the sluices and gates, and goes
even up to the city of Pekin. You may go to
Nanquin if you please, and travel to Pekin, and
there is a Dutch º just before bound that way.
At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I was
struck with confusion; they being as great a
terror to me in this vessel as an Algerine man
of war is to them in the Mediterranean. The
old man finding me troubled, Sir, said he, I
hope the Dutch are not now at war with your
nation. No, said I, but God knows what liber-
ty they may take when out of the reach of the
law. VV hy, says he, what occasion is there
for peaceable merchants to fear 2 For, believe
me, they never meddle with any but PIRATEs.
At the mentioning of the word pirates, my
countenance turned to that of scarlet; nor was
it possible for me to conceal it from the old pi-
lot; who taking notice of it: Sir, said he, take
what course you please, I’ll do you all the ser-
vice I can. Seignior, said I, I am a little con-
cerned at your mentioning pirates ; I hope
there are none such in these seas, because
you see in what a weak condition we are to de-
fend ourselves. O, Sir, said he, if that’s all,
don’t be concerned, I don't remember one in
these seas these fifteen years, except about a
month ago that one was seen in the bay of Siam,
but she is gone to the southward; neither was
she built for a privateer, but was run away
with by a reprobate captain, and some of his
~
men, the right captain having been murdere
by the Malayans. -
What said I (as though ignorant of what
had happened), did they kill the captain 7 No,
said he, it is generally thought the Mala-
jans murdered him ; but perhaps they might
procure them to do it, and therefore they justly
deserve hanging. The rogues were lately dis-
covered in the bay of Siam, in the river of Cam-
bodia, by some Dutchmen who belonged to the
ship, and had much ado to escape the five boats
that pursued them: but they have all given such
an exact description of the ship, that where-
ever they find her, they will be sure to know
her ; and they have solemnly swore to give no
quarter to the captain or the seamen, but hang
them every one up at the yard-arm, without
any formal business of bringing them to a court
of judicature. - -
Being sensible, that, having the old man on
board, he was incapable of doing me any mis-
chief, Well, Seignior, said I, it is for this very
reason I would have you carry us up to Nan-
quin, where neither English nor Dutch ships
come : and I must tell you, their captains are a
parcel of rash, proud, insolent rascals, that nei-
ther know what belongs to justice, nor how
to behave themselves as the laws of God or
nature direct; fellows that would prove mur-
derers to punish robbers, and take upon them
to adjudge innocent men to death, without any
proof to prove them guilty; but perhaps I may
live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to
be executed. And so I told him all the story of
buying the ship, and how we *: saved by
9
the means of two men : that the murder of the
captain by the Malayans, as also the running
away with the ship, I believed to be true ; but
that we, who bought it, were turned pirates,
was a mere fiction to cover their cowardice
and foolish behaviour, when they attacked us,
and the blood of those men we killed in our
own just defence, lay at their door, who sent to
attack us by surprise. -
Sir, said the old man amazed, you have tak-
en the right course to steer to the north; and if
I might advise you, I would have you sell your
ship in China, and buy or build another in that
country, and I’ll procure people to buy the
one and sell the other. Well, but, Seignior, said
I, if I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring
some innocent persons into the same danger
as I have gone through, perhaps worse, even
death itself, whereby Ishould beas guilty of their
murder as the villainous executioners. That
need not trouble you, says the old man; I'll
find a way to prevent that; for these command-
ers you talk of I know very well, and will in-
form them rightly of the matter as you have
related, and I am persuaded they will not only
believe me, but act more cautiously for the fu-
ture. And will you deliver one message from
me to them 2 Yes, said he, if you will give it
under your hand, that I may prove it is not of
my own production. Hereupon I wrote a large
account of their attacking me in their long boat,
the pretended reason and unjust design of it;
that they had done what they might be asham-
ed of, and could not answer for at any tribu-
mal in England. But this letter was writ in
vain. Providence ordered things another way.
VVe sailed directly for Nanquin, and in about
thirteen days sail came to anchor at the south-
west point of the great gulf of that place ,
where we learned that two Dutch ships were
gone that length before us, and that we should
certainly fall into their hands. We were all at
a great loss in this exigency, and would very
i. have been on shore almost any where ;
ut our old pilot told me, that if I would sail
to the southward about two and forty leagues,
there was a little port called Quinchange, where
no European ships ever came, and where we
might consider what was further to be done.
Accordingly, we weighed anchor the next day,
calling only twice on shore by the way to get
fresh water. The country people very cour-
teously sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other
provisions. After five days sail we came to
the port, and landed with unspeakable joy.
We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects
in any other way possible than enter on board
that ill-fated vessel more ; for no state can be
more miserable than a continued fear, which
“is a life of death, a confounder of our under-
standings, that sets the imagination at work to
form a thousand frightful things that may never
happen. And we scarce slept one night with-
Out Hºmº of halters, yard-arms, or gibbets,
of fighting, being taken, and being killed; nay,
so violent were our apprehensions, that we
would bruise our hands and heads against the
sides of the cabin, as though actually engaged.
The story of the Dutch cruelly at Amboyna
often came into our thoughts when awake;
and for my part, I thought my condition very
hard, that after so many diºd such
P 6-
signal deliverances, I should be hanged in my
old age, though innocent of any crime that de-
served such punishment; but then religion
would seem to represent to me, as though the
voice of it had said: Consider, O man' what
sins you have been formerly guilty of, which
now thou art called to an account for, to ex-
piate with thy blood And as to thy innocence,
what art thou more innocent than thy blessed
Redeemer Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy
offences, and to whose providence you ought
518 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
tural courage would inspire me to resist to the
last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer my-
self to be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen,
who had arts to torment beyond death itself.
But now, thank kind Heaven, being a-shore,
our old pilot procured us a lodging and a ware-
house for our goods; it was a little hut with a
large warehouse joining to it, all built with
canes, and palissadoed round with large ones,
to keep out pilfering thieves, which are very nu-
merous in that country. The magistrates allow-
ed us a little guard during the night, and we
employed a centinel with a kind of halbert
for three pence a day. The fair or mart, we
found, had been over for some time; however,
there remained in the river four junks and two
Japan ships, the merchants of the latter being on
shore. In the first place, our old pilot brought
us acquainted with the missionary Roman
priests, who were converting the people to
Christianity: two of them were reserved, rigid,
and austere, applying themselves to the work
they came about with great earnestness : but
the third, who was a Frenchman, called father
Simon, was of a freer conversation, not seem-
ingly so serious and grave, yet no worse Chris-
tian than the other two, one of whom was a
Portuguese, and the other a Genoese. Father
Simon, it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin,
the royal seat of the Emperor of the Chinese ;
and he only waited for another priest, who was
ordered from Macao to accompany him. We
never met together, but he was prompting me
to keep him company in that journey: Sir, said
he, I will shew you the glorious things of this
mighly empire, and a city, the city of Pekin,
far exceeding London or Paris, put them both
together. One day in particular, being at din-
ner with him, Ishewed some inclination to go;
which made him press the more upon me and
my partner, to gain our perfect consent : But,
jather Simon, said my partner, what satisfac-
tion can you have in our company, whom you es-
teem as heretics, and consequently objects not
worthy your regard? Oh! said he, you may be
as good Catholics in time as those I hope to con-
vert to our religion. And so, said I, we shall
have you preaching to us all the way, instead
of pleasing us with a description of the coun-
try. Sir, said he, however our religion may be
vilified by some people, it is very certain it nei-
ther divests us of good manners or Christian
charity; and as we are gentlemen, as such we
may converse together, without making one
another uneasy.
But we shall leave him a while to consider
our ship and the merchandise which we had
- to dispose of . There was but very little trade
in the place where we were; and I was once
resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam,
and so to the city of Nanquin : but Providence
ordered it otherwise by our old pilot's bring-
ing a Japan merchant to us to see what goods
we had. He immediately bought our opium,
for which he gave us a very good price in gold
by weight, some wedges of which were about
ten or eleven ounces. It came into my head,
that perhaps he might buy the ship too; and I
ordered his interpreter to propose it to him.
He said nothing then, but shrunk up his shoul-
ders; yet in a few days after he came accom-
panied by a missionary priest, who was his
interpreter, with this proposal: That as he had
bought a great quantity of our goods, he had
not money enough to purchase our ship ; but if
I pleased, he would hire her with all my men
to go to Japan, and from thence with another
loading to the Philippine islands, the freight of
both which he would very willingly pay to us
before ; and at their return to Japan, would
buy the ship. Upon this we asked the captain
and his men, if they were willing to go to Japan;
to which they unanimously agreed. While
this was in agitation, the young man my ne–
phew left to attend me, told me: That as I did
not care to accept this prospect of advantage,
he would manage it for me as I pleased, and
render me a faithful account of his success,
which should be wholly mine. Indeed I was
very unwilling to part with him; but consider-
ing it might be for the young man's good, I dis-
coursed my partner about it, who, of his own
generosity, gave him his share of the vessel, so
that I could do no otherwise than give him
mine ; but, however, we let him have but the
property of half of it, and preserved a power,
that when we met in England, if he had ob-
tained success, he should account to us for one
half of the profits of the ship's freight, and the
other should be his own. Thus having taken
a writing under his hand, away he sailed to
Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly
by him, got him a licence to come on shore, sent
him loaded to the Philippines with a Japanese
supercargo, from whence he came back again
loaded with European goods, cloves, and other
spiceries. By this voyage he cleared a consider-
able sum of money, which determined him not
to sell his ship, but to trade on his own account:
so he returned to the Manillas, where, getting
acquaintance, he made his ship free, was hired
by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in
America, on the Mexican coast, with a licence
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 351
fic turned out greatly to account, and my friend
finding means to get to Jamaica, returned nine
years after exceeding rich into England.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course
to consider of those men who had saved our
lives when in the river of Cambodia ; and
though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves,
yet we paid them what they had before de-
manded, and gave each of them a small sum of
money, making the Englishman a gunner, and
the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they
were very well contented.
VVe were now above a looo leagues farther
from home than when at Bengal. All the
comfort we could expect was, that there being
another fair to be kept in a month's time, we
might not only purchase all sorts of that coun-
*
try's manufactures, but very possibly find some
Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin to be
sold, which would carry us and our goods
wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes,
we resolved to continue ; and to divert our-
selves, we took several little journiès into the
country. About ten days after we parted with
our ship, we travelled to see the city of Nan-
quin. This city lies in latitude 30 deg. north
of the line; it is regularly built, and the streets
are exactly straight, and cross one another in
direct lines, which sets it out to the greatest ad-
vantage. At our return, we found the priest
was come from Macao that was to accompany
father Simon to Pekin. That father earnestly
solicited me to accompany him, and I referred
him to my partner. In short, we both agreed and
prepared accordingly ; and we were so lucky
as to have liberty to travel among the retinue of
one of their Mandarins, who is a principal ma-
gistrate, and much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling
through this miserable country, infinitely po-
pulous, but as indifferently cultivated; and yet
their pride is infinitely greater than their po-
verty, insomuch that the priests themselves de-
rided them. As we passed by the house of one
of their country gentlemen, two leagues off of
Nanquin, we had the honour, forsooth, to
ride with the Chinese squire about two miles.
Never was Don Quixote so exactly imitated
Never such a compound of pomp and poverly
seen before -
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy,
and very proper for a Merry Andrew or Sca---
ramouch, with all its tawdry trappings, as hang-
‘ing sleeves, tassels, etc. though torn and rent in
almost every part: his vest underneath it was no
less dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most
exquisite sloven, or greasy butcher. His horse
(worse than Rosinante, or the famous steed of
doughly Hudibras) was a poor starved, decre-
pit thing, that would not sell for thirty shill-
ings in England; and yet this piece of worship-
ful pomp was attended with ten or twelve
slaves, who guarded their master to his country-
seat. We stopped at a little village for refresh-
ment; and when we came by the country-seat
of this great man, we found him sitting under
a tree before his door, eating a mess of boiled
rice, with a great piece of garlick in the middle,
and a bag filled with green pepper by him, and
another plant like ginger, together with a piece
of lean mution : this was his Worship's re-
past ; but pray observe the slate of the fool!
two women slaves brought him his food, which
being laid before him, two others appeared to
perform their respective offices; one fed him
with a spoon, while the other scraped off what
fell upon his beard and taffely vest, and gave it
to a particular favourite to eat. And thus we
left the wretch pleased with the conceit of our
admiring his magnificence, which rather me—
rited our scorn and delestation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pe-
kin, accompanied by two servants, and the old
Portuguese pilot, whose charges we bore, and
who served us as an interpreter by the way.
We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he
comes laughing to us : Ah! Seignior Inglese,
said he, me something tell you make your heart
glad, but make me sorry; for you bring me
here 25 days journey, and now you leave me go
back alone : and which way shall I make my
port after, without de ship, without de horse,
without pecume? so he called money in his brok-
en Latin. He then informed me, that there
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish
merchants in the city, who were preparing to
set out for Muscovy by land within six weeks;
and that he was certain we would take this
opportunity, and consequently that he must go
home by himself. Indeed this news infinitely
surprised and pleased me. Are you certain of
this? said I. Yés, Sir, said he, me sure it’s true.
And so he told me, that having met an old ac-
quaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street,
who was among them, and who had come from
Astracan, with a design to go to Tonquin, but
for certain reasons having altered his re-
solution, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to
Astracan. Well, Seignior, said I, don't be dis-
contented about your returning alone; and, if
by this means I can find a passage to England,
it will be your own fault if you return to Ma-
cao at all. And so consulting with my part-
ner what was best to be done, he referred it
to me as I pleased, having our affairs so well
settled at Bengal, that, if we could convert the
good voyage we had made into China silks,
wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to
England, and so return to Bengal in the Com-
pany's ships. Thus resolved, we agreed that
if our pilot would go with us, we would bear
his charges either to Muscow or England; and
to give him as a present the sum of 170 pounds
Sierling. Hereupon we called him in, and told
him the cause of his complaint should be re-
moved, if he would accompany us with the
caravan ; and, therefore, we desired to know
his mind. At this he shook his head. Great
Jong journey, said he, me no pecume, carry me
to Muscow, or keep me there. But we soon
put him out of that concern, by making him
sensible of what we would give him here to lay
out to the best advantage; and as for his charges,
we would set him safe on shore, God willing,
either in Muscovy, or England, as he pleased,
at our own charge, except the carriage of his
goods. At this proposal he was like a man
fransported, telling us he would go with us all
the world over; and we made preparations for
our journey, but it was near four months be-
fore all the merchants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot
went on purpose to the port where we first put
in to dispose of what goods had been left there,
while I accompanied a Chinese merchant, who
was going to Nanquin, and there bought 29
pieces of damask, with about 3oo more of other
fine silks; and, by the time my partner return-
ed to Pekin, I had them all carried thither: our
cargo in silks amounted to 45oo l. Sterling,
which, together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs,
and cloves, loaded 18 camels for our share,
besides what we rode upon, with two or three
spare horses, and two more loaden with pro-
visions: the company now was very great, mak-
ing about 4oo horses, and above 120 men, well
armed and provided. We were of several na-
tions, among whom were five Scots merchants
inhabiting in Muscow, and well experienced
in trade. -
VVe set out from Pekin the beginning of
February our style; and in two days more we
passed through the gate of the great China wall,
which was erected as a fortification against the
Tartars, being loo English miles long. VVe
then entered a country not near so populous,
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars,
several companies of whom we perceived rid-
ing on poor starved horses, contemptible as
themselves, without order or discipline. One
time our leader for the day gave us leave to go
a-hunting. But what do you think we hunted?
only a parcel of sheep, which indeed exceeded
any in the world for wildness and swiftness;
but while we were pursuing this game, it was
our chance to meet with about forty Tartars,
who no sooner perceived us, but one of them
blew a horn, at the sound of which there soon
appeared a troop of forty or fifty more, at about
a mile's distance. Hereupon, one of the Scots
merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us
to advance towards them, and attack them im-
mediately. As we advanced, they let fly a vol-
ley of arrows, which happily fell a little short
of us : this made us halt a little to return the
compliment with bullets ; and then being led
up by the bold Scot, we fired our pistols in
their faces, and drew out our swords: but there
was no occasion; for they flew like timorous
sheep, and only three of them remained, beck-
oning to the rest to come back. But our brave
commander gallops up to them by himself, shot
one dead, knocks another off his horse, while
the third ran away : and thus ended our battle
with the Tartars.
We travelled a month more through the
Emperor of China's dominions; and at length
coming to one of their towns about a day and
a half’s journey from the city of Naum, I want-
, ed to buy a camel. The person I spoke to
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I
must go along with him, about two miles from
the village. My old pilot and I walked on foot,
forsooth, for some variety, when coming to the
place where the camels were kept as in a park
guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed
and bought one, which the Chinese man that
came with me led along the road. But we had
not gone far, before we were attacked by five
Tartars, mounted on horseback, two of whom
seized the man, took the camel from him, and
rode away, while the other three approached
us, the first of whom suddenly seized me as I
was drawing my sword, the second knocked
me down ; but my old trusty Portuguese, tak-
ing a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew
nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that
struck me, he with one hand pulled him off
his horse, and then shot him dead upon the
spot; then taking his scymiter, he struck at the
man that stopt us, but missing him, cut off one
of his horse's ears, the pain of which made him
throw his rider to the ground. The poor Chi-
nese, who had led the camel, seeing the Tartar
down, runs to him, and seizing upon his pole-
axe, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked
his brains out. But there was another Tartar to
deal with, who seeming neither inclined to fight
nor fly, and my old man having begun to charge
his pistol, the very sight of it struck such a ter-
ror into the wretch, that away he scoured, leav-
t
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and de- -
fender, an absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance
I began to open my eyes, wondering where I
was, having quite forgot all that passed; but
my senses returning, and feeling a great pain
in my head, and seeing the blood was running
over my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my
feet, and grasped my sword in my hand with
a resolution to take revenge; but no enemies
now remained, except the dead Tartar, with
his horse standing by him. The old man see-
ing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran
towards me, and embraced me with greatest
tenderness, at the same time examining into my
wound, which was far from being mortal ;
when we returned to the village, the man de-
manded payment for his camel, which I refus-
ing, we brought the cause before a Chinese
judge, who acted with great impartiality. Hav-
ing heard both sides, he asked the Chinese man
that went with me, whose servant he was 7 Sir,
said he, I am nobody's, but went with the
stranger at his request. Why then, said the
judge, you were the stranger's servant for the .
time, and the camel being delivered to his ser-
vant, it is the same as though delivered to him-
self, and accordingly he must pay for it. In-
deed, the case was so fairly stated that I had
nothing to object to it; so, having paid for what
I was robbed of, I sent for another, but did not
go myself to fetch it, as I had enough of that
sport before.
Naum is a frontier-city of the Chinese em-
ire, so fortified, as some will tell you, that
inillions of Tartars cannot batter down the
walls; yet certainly one single cannon of our
might do more execution than all their le-
gions.
When we were within a day's march of that
city, we had information that the governor had
sent messengers to every part of the road to in-
form the travellers and caravans to halt, till a
guard was sent to protect them from the mu-
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared
about the city. This news put us into great
consternation ; but, obeying the orders, we
stopt; and, two days after, there came two
hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chi-
nese, and three hundred more from Naum:
thus guarded both in the front and rear, with
our own men on the flanks, we boldly advanc-
ed, thinking we were able to combat with ten
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
- Early next morning in our march from
a little well situated town called Changu, af-
ter having passed a river, and entered upon
a desert of about 15 or 16 miles over, we soon
beheld by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy was approaching. This much dis–
pirited the Chinese. My old pilot took notice
of it, and called out, Seignior Inglese, those fel-
lows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us
all : and I am afraid, if the Tartars attack us,
they will all run away. Why, Seignior, said I,
what shall be done in this case? Done, says he,
why, let fifty of our men advance, and flank
them on each wing. I know the fellows will
fight well enough in company. We accord-
ingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the
right wing, and the same number to the left,
and with the rest made a line of reserve, leaving
the last two hundred men to guard the camels,
or to assist us as occasion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came
forward, viewing our posture, and traversing
the ground on the front of our line. Hereupon,
we ordered the two wings to move on, and give
them a salute with theirshot; which according-
ly was done. This put a stop to their proceed-
ings; for immediately wheeling off to their left,
they all marched away, and we saw no more
of them. They had undoubtedly given an ac-
count to their companions of what reception
they might expect, which made them so easily
give over their enterprise.
When we came to the city of Naum, we re-
turned the governor hearly thanks, and dis-
persed a hundred crowns among the soldiers
that guarded us. We rested there one day,
and then proceeded on our travels, passing se–
veral great rivers and deserts, and "on the 15th
of April we came to the frontiers of Muscovy,
the first town of which was called Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming
into a Christian country, made me congratulate
the Scots merchant upon it. He smiled at that,
telling me not to rejoice too soon ; for, said he,
except the Russian soldiers in garrison, and a
few inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all
the rest of this country, for above a thousand
niles, is inhabited by the most ignorant and
barbarous Pagans.
We advanced from the river Arguna by
moderate journeys, and found convenient gar-
risons on the road filled with Christian sol-
diers for the security of commerce, and for the
convenient lodgings of travellers; but the inha-
bitants of the country were mere Pagans wor-
shipping the sum, moon, and stars. We par-
ticularly observed this idolatry near the river
Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Rus-
sians, called Nerisinkey. Being curious to see
their way of living, while the caravan continued
to rest themselves in that city, I went to one of
their villages, where there was to be one of
their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld upon
the stump of an old tree an idol of wood, more
ugly than the representation of the devil him-
self: its head resembled no living creature; its
ears were as big and as high as a goat's horns, a
crooked nose, four cornered mouth, and hor-
rible teeth; it was clothed in sheep-skins, had
a great Tartar bonnet with two horns grow-
ing through it, and was eight foot high, without
feet, legs, or proportion. Before this idol there
lay 16 or 17 people, who brought their offer-
ings, and were making their prayers, while at
a distance stood three men, and one bullock,
as victims to this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing
the true God of his honour, filled me with the
greatest astonishment and reflection ; which
soon turning to rage and fury, I rode up to the
image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was
upon his head with my sword, so that it hung
down by one of the horns, while one of my
men that was with me, pulled at it by his sheep-
skin garment. Immediately an hideous howl-
ing and outcry ran through the village, and
two or three hundred people coming about
our ears, we were obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monster; for
the caravan being to rest three nights in the
Q
town, I told the Scots merchant what I had
seen, and that I was resolved to take four or
five men well armed with me, in order to des-
troy the idol, and shew the people how little
reason they had to trust in a God who could
not save himself. At first he laughed at me, re-
presenting the danger of it; and when it was
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them
better things, whose zeal and ignorance was in
the highest degree, and both unparalleled ?
that if I should be taken by them, I should be
362 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied
to the top of the idol, there shot at with arrows
till my body was full of them, and then burnt
as a sacrifice to the monster. But, Sir, said he,
since your zeal carries you so far, rather than
you should be alone I will accompany you,
and bring a stout fellow equal to yourself, if
you will, to assist you in this design : and ac-
oordingly he brought one captain Richardson,
who, hearing the story, readily consented; but
my partner declined it, being altogether out of
his way: and so we three, and my man-ser-
vant, resolved to execute this exploit about mid-
night; but, upon second thoughts, we deferred
it to the next night, by reason that the caravan
being to go from thence next morning, we
should be out of the governor's power. The
better to effectuate my design, I procured a
Tartar's sheep-skin robe, a bonnet, with bow
and arrows, and every one of us got the like ha-
bits. The first night we spent in mixing com-
bustible matter with aqua vitae, gun-powder,
etc. having a good quantity of tar in a little pot:
pext night we came up to the idol about elevel;
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none
guarding it; but we perceived a light in the
house, where we had seen the priests before.
One of our men was for firing the hut, another
for killing the people, and a third for making
them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed.
We agreed to the latter; so knocking at the
door, we seized the first that opened it, and
stopping his mouth, and tying his feet, we left
him. VVe served the other two in the like
manner; and then the Scots merchant set fire
to the composition, which frightened them so
much, that we brought them all away prisoners
to their wooden god. There we fell to work
with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes,
ears, and mouth full of gun-powder, with a
great piece of wild-fire in his bomnet, and en-
vironed it with dry forage. All this being done,
we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and
set the idol on fire, which the gun-powder
blowing up, the shape of it was deformed, rent,
and split, which the forage utterly consumed ;
for we staid to see its destruction, lest the igno-
rant idolatrous people should have thrown
themselves into the flame. And thus we came
away undiscovered, in the morning appearing
so busy among our fellow-travellers, as nobod
could have suspected any other but that we had
been in our beds all night. -
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a
small distance from the city, when there came
a multitude of the people of the country to the
gates of the city, demanding satisfaction of the
Russian governor for insulting their priests,
and burning their great Cham-Chi-Thaungu,
- Q z
who dwelt in the sun ; and whose image, no
other mortal would violate, but some Christian
miscreants; and being already no less than
thirty thousand strong, they announced war
against him and all his Christians. -
The governor assured them that he was ig-
morant of the matter, and that none of his gar-
rison had been aboad; that indeed there was
a caravan that went away that morning, and
that he would send after them to inquire into
it; and whoever were the offenders should be
delivered into their hands. This satisfied them,
for the present; but the governor sent to inform
us, that if any of us had done it, we should
make all the haste away possible, while he kept
them in play as long as he could. Upon this
we marched two days and two nights, slop-
ping but very little, till at last we arrived at a
village called Plothus, and hasted to Jarawena,
another of the Czar's colonies. On the third
day, having entered the desert, and passed the
lake called Shaks Oser, we beheld a numerous
body of horse on the other side of it to the north,
who supposed we had passed on that side of
the lake; but having either found their mis-
take, or being certainly informed of the way
we took, they came upon us towards the dusk
of the evening,just as we had pitched our camp
between two little but very thick woods, with
a little river running before our front, and
some felled trees with which we covered our
rear; a precaution we always took, and which
we had just finished, when the enemy came up.
They did not fall on us immediately, but sent
three messengers, demanding the men who had
insulted their priests, and burnt their god Cham:
z
Chi-Thaungu, that they might be burnt with
fire; that if this was complied with, they would
peaceably depart ; but if not, they would des-
troy one and all of us. Our men stared at one
another on receipt of this message; but Nobody
was the word, as indeed nobody knew it but
he who did it. Upon which the leader of the
caravan returned for answer, that they were
peaceable merchants, who meddled with none
of their priests and gods; and therefore desir-
cd them not to disturb us, and put us to the
necessity of defending ourselves. But so far
was this from satisfying them, that the next
morning, coming to our right, they let fly a
volley of arrows among us, which happily did
not hurt any, because we sheltered ourselves
behind our baggage. We expected however
to come to a closer engagement; but were hap-
pily saved by a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who
obtaining leave of the leader to go out, mounts
his horse, rides directly from our rear, and tak-
ing a circuit, comes up to the Tartars, as though
he had been sent on purpose, and tells them a
formal story, that the wretches who had burnt
the Cham-Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Siheilka,
with a resolution to burn the god Shal-Isar,
belonging to the Tongueses. Upon which, be-
lieving this cunning Tartar, who was servant
to our Muscovites, away they drove to Si-
heilka, and in less than three minutes were out
of our sight, nor did we ever hear of them
palore.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we
rested five days, and then entered into a fright-
ful desert, which held us twenty-three days
march, infested with several small companies
Q 3
of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had
the courage to attack us. After we had passed
over this desert, we found several garrisons to
defend the caravans from the violence of the
Tartars. In particular, the governor of Adins-
koy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next
station, if we apprehended any danger. The
people here retained the same paganism and
barbarity, only they were not so dangerous, be-,
ing conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth-
ing both of men and women is of the skins of
beasts, living under the ground in vaults and
caves, which have a communication with one
another. They have idols almost in every fa-
mily; besides, they adore the sun and stars,
water and snow; and the least uncommon
thing that happens in the elements, alarms them
as much as thunder and lightning does the un-
believing Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march.
through this country. When we had got
through the desert, after two days farther tra–
vel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, on
the great river so called, which, we were told,
lº Europe from Asia. The inhabitants
here were very little better, though intermixed
with the Muscovites; but the wonder will
cease, when I inform my reader of what was
observed to me, that the Czar rather converts
the Tartars with soldiers than clergymen, and
is more proud to make them faithful subjects
than good Christians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travell–
ed over a pleasant, fruitful, but very unculti-
vated country, for want of good management
and people, and those few are mostly Pagans,
This is the place where the Muscovite crimi-
mals are banished to, if they are not put to death.
The next city we came to, was the capital city
of Siberia, called Tobolsky, when, having been
almost seven months on our journey, and win-
ter drawing on apace, my partner and I con-
sulted about our particular affairs, in what
manner we should dispose of ourselves. We
had been told of sledges and rein-deer to carry
us over the snow in the winter season, the snow
being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run
upon the surface without any danger of going
down. As I was bound to England, it now
behoved me either to go with the caravan to
Jeroslaw, from thence west to Narva, and the
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Den-
mark; or else I must leave the caravan at a
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 567
where I was certain of shipping either to En-
gland, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night I
happened to get into the company of an illus-
trious but banished prince, whose company
and virtues were such as made me propose to
him a method how he might obtain his liberty.
My dear friend, said he, as I am here happily
free from my miserable greatness with all its
attendants of pride, ambition, avarice, and
luxury, if I should escape from this place, those
pernicious seeds may again revive to my last-
ing disquietude ; therefore let me remain in a
blessed confinement; for I am but flesh, a mere
man with passions and affections as such ; O'
be not my friend and tempter too ! Struck dumb
with surprise, I stood silent a while; nor was
he in less disorder, by which perceiving he
wanted to give vent to his mind, I desired him
Q 4.
to consider of it, and so withdrew. But, about
two hours after, he came to my apartment :
Dear friend, said he, though I cannot consent
to accompany you, I shall have this satisfaction
in parting, that you leave me an honest man
still; but as a testimony of my affection to you,
be pleased to accept this present of sables.
In return for his compliment, I sent my ser-
vant next morning to his Lordship, with a
small present of tea, two pieces of China da–
mask, and four little wedges of gold; but he
only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and
a piece of gold, for the curiosily of the Japan
stamp that was upon it. Not long after he
sent for me and told me, that what he had re-
fused himself, he hoped, upon his account, I
would grant to another, whom he should name.
In short, it was his only son, who was about
200 miles distance from him on the other side
of the Oby, whom he said he would send for
if I gave my consent. This I soon complied
with ; upon which he sent his servants next
day for his son, who returned in twenty days
time, bringing seven horses loaded with valu-
able furs. At night, the young lord was con-
ducted incognito into our apartment, where
his father presented him to me. We then con-
certed the best ways for travelling, and after
having bought a considerable quantity of sables,
black fox-skins, fine ermines, etc. (which I sold
at Archangel at a good price), we set out from
this city the beginning of June, making a small
caravan, being about thirty-two horses and
camels, of which I represented the head. My
young lord had with him a very faithful Sibe-
rian servant, well acquainted with the roads.
We shunned the principal towns and cities, as
Tumen, Soloy-Kamoiskoi, and several others, by
reason of their strictness in examining travellers,
lest any of the banished persons of distinction
should escape. Having passed the river Kama,
we came to a city on the European side, called
Soloy Kamoiskoi, where we found the people
mostly Pagans, as before. We then passed a
desert of about two hundred miles over; but in
other places it is near seven hundred. In pass-
ing this wild place, we were beset by a troop
of men on horseback, and about five and forty
men armed with bows and arrows. At first
they looked earnestly on us, and then placed
themselves in our way. We were above six-
teen men, and drew up a little line before our
camels. My young lord sent out his Siberian
servant to know who they were; but, when
he approached them, he neither knew a word
they said, nor would they admit him to come
near them at his peril, but prepared to shoot
him. At his return, he told us he believed them
to be Calmuck Tartars, and that he thought
here were more of them upon the desert. This
was but a small comfort to us; yet seeing a
little grove about a quarter of a mile's distance,
we moved to it by the old Portuguese pilot's
advice, without meeting with any opposition.
Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and
a spring of water running into a little brook
on one side, which joined another like it a little
farther off, and these two formed the head of
the river called Writska. As soon as we ar-
rived, we went to work, cutting down great
arms off the trees, and laying them hanging
(not quite off) from one tree to another. In
Q 5
this situation we waited the motions of the enes-
my, without perceiving any advancement they
made towards us. About two hours before
night being joined by some others, in all about
fourscore horse, among whom we fancied
were some women, they came upon us with
great fury. We fired without ball, calling to
them in the Russian tongue to know their bu-
siness : but they, either not knowing, or seem-
ing not to understand us, came directly to the
wood-side, not considering that we were so
570 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
old pilot the Portuguese proved both our cap-
tain and engineer, and desired us not to fire,
till they came within pistol-shot; and when
he gave the word of command, then to take the
surest aim : but he did not bid us give fire
till they were within two Pike; length of us,
and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded
several, as also their horses, having every one
of us loaded our pieces with two or three bul-
lets at least. So much were they surprised at
our undauntedness, that they retired about an
hundred roods from us. In the mean while,
we loaded our pieces again, and sallying out,
secured four or five of their horses, whose rid-
ers we found were killed, and perceived them
to be Tartars. About an hour after, they made
another attempt, to see where they might break
in ; but finding us ready to receive them, they
retired.
All that night we wrought hard-in strength-
ening our situation, and barricading the en-
trances into the woods; but when §
came, we made a very unwelcome discovery ; ;
for the enemy being encouraged by their as-
ay-light
sistance had set up eleven or twelve tents in
form of a camp about three quarters of a mile
from us. I must confess, I was never more
concerned in my life, giving myself and all that
F had over for lost. And my partner declared,
that as the loss of his goods would be his ruin,
before they should be taken from him, he
would fight to the last drop of his blood. As
we could not pretend to force our way, we had
recourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large
fire which burnt all night; and no sooner was
it dark but we pursued our journey towards
the pole, or north star, and travelling all night,
by six o'clock in the morning we came to a
Russian village, called Kertza, and from thence
came to a large town named Ozonoys, where
we heard that several troops of Calmuck Tar-
tars had been abroad upon the desert, but that
we were past all danger. In five days after we
came to Veuslima upon the river VVitzedga;
from thence we came to Lawrenskoy, on the
third of July, where, providing ourselves with
two luggage boats, and a convenient bark,
we embarked the seventh, and arrived at Ar-
changel the eighteenth, after a year five months
and three days journey, including the eight
months and odd days at Tobolski. We came
from Archangel the twentieth of August in the
same year, and arrived at Hamburgh the thir-
tieth of September. Here iny partner and I
made a very good sale of our goods, both those
of China and Siberia; when dividing our ef-
fects, my share came to 3474 l. 17 s. 3 d. after
all the losses we had sustained, and charges we
had been at. Here the young lord took his
leave of me, in order to go to the º: of Wien-
na, not only to seek protection, but to corres-
pond with his father's friends. After we had
staid four months in Hamburgh, I went from
thence over land to the Hague, where embark-
ing in the packet, I arrived in London the
tenth of January 1705, after ten years and nine
months absence from England.

Chap. I. Of SOLITUDE.
However solitude is looked upon as a re-
straint to the pleasures of the world in compa-
my and conversation, yet it is a happy state of
exemption from a sea of trouble, an inunda–
tion of vanity and vexation, of confusion and.
disappointment. While we enjoy ourselves,
meither the joy nor sorrow of other men affect
us : we are then at liberty with the voice of
our soul to speak to God. By this we shun.

an obstruction to virtue : and how often do we
find that we had reason to wish we had not.

impiety of our discourse, or lay ourselves open.
to the violence of designing people by our un-
guarded expressions; and frequently feel the
coldness and treachery of pretended friends,
when once involved in trouble and affliction ;
of such unfaithful intimates (I should say ene-
mies) who rather by false innuendoes would ac-
cumulate miseries upon us than honestly assist
us when suffering under the hard hand of
adversity. But in a state of solitude when our
tongues cannot be heard except by the great
Majesty of Heaven, how happy are we in the
blessed enjoyment of conversing with our Mak-
er It is then we make him our friend, which
sets us above the envy and contempt of wicked
men. When a man converses with himself,
he is sure that he does not converse with an
enemy. Our retreat should be to good com-
pany, and good books. I mean not by solitude,
that a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or
a monastery ; which would be altogether an
useless and unprofitable restraint: for as men
are formed for society, and have an absolute
necessity and dependence upon one another,
so there is a retirement of the soul, in which
it converses with heaven, even in the midst of
men; and indeed no man is more fit to speak.
freely than he who can, without any violence
to himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence
altogether. As to religion, it is by this the soul
gets acquainted with the hidden mysleries of the
holy writings; here she finds these floods of
tears, in which good men wash themselves day
and night, and only makes a visit to God and
his holy angels. In this conversation the truest.
peace and most solid joy are to be found ; it
is a continual feast of contentment on earth,
and the means of attaining everlasting happi-
ness in heaven.

to all mankind is the chancery-law of hones-
ty ; and this chancery-court is in every man's
breast, where his conscience is a lord chancellor.
Hence it is that a miser, though he pays every
body their own, cannot be an honest man
when he does not discharge the good offices that
are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and gene-
rous person: for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap.
xxxii, ver. 7, 8, The instruments of a churl are
evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the
poor with lying words, even when the needy
speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth
tiberal things, and by liberal things shall he
stand. It is certainly honesty to do every thing
the law requires; but should we throw every
poor debtor into prison till he has paid the ut-
most farthing, hang every malefactor without.
mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and
the forfeiture of every indenture, this would
be downright cruelly, and not honesty : and
it is contrary to that general rule, To do unto
another that which you would have done unto
you. Sometimes necessity makes an honest .
man a knave; and a rich man an honest man-
because he has no occasion to be a knave. The
trial of honesty is this: Did you ever want bread,
and had your neighbour's loafin keeping, and
would starve rather than eat it 2 were you
ever arrested having in your custody another
man's cash, and would rather go to goal than
break it?" if so, this indeed may be reckoned.

Chap. III. Of suffering AFFLICTIONS.
AFFLICTIONs are common to all mankind;
and whether they proceed, from losses, disap-
pointments, or the malice of men, they often
bring their advantages along with them : for
this shews man the vanity and deceitfulness of
this life, and is an occasion of rectifying our
measures, and bringing us to a more modest
opinion of ourselves : it tells us how necessary
the assistance of divine grace is unto us, when
life itself becomes a burden, and death even
desirable ; but when the greatest oppression
comes upon us, we must have recourse to pa-
tience, begging of God to give us that virtue ;
and the more composed we are under any
trouble, the more commendable is our wisdom,
and the larger will be our recompense. Let
the provocation be what it will, whether from
a good-natured and conscientious, or wicked,
perverse, and vexatious man, all this we should
take as from the over-ruling hand of God, as a
punishment for our sins. Many times injured
innocence may be abused by false oaths, or the
power of wicked, jealous, or malicious men;
but we often find it like the palm-tree, rise the
higher the more it is depressed; while the jus-
tice of God is eminently remarkable in punish-
ing those, one way or other, who desire to:
endeavour to procure the downfall of an in-
nocent man : nor does God fail comforting an:
afflicted person, who, with tears and prayers,
solicits the throne of Heaven for deliverance:
and protection. David says, that his soul was ful:-
of trouble, and his life drew near unto the grave.

mently remarkable, as particularly when pur-
sued by King Saul, and hunted as a partridge
over the mountains. But one thing which
stands by innocence is the love of God ; for,
were we to suffer disgrace, nay, an ignomini-
ous death itself, what consolation does our in-
nocence procure at our latest conflict, our last
moments
Chap. IV. Of the immorality of conversation,
and the vulgar errors of behaviour.
As conversation is a great part of human
happiness, so it is a pleasant sight to behold a
sweet-tempered man, who is always fit for it,
to see an air of humour and pleasantness sit
ever upon his brow, and even something an-
gelic in his very countenance : whereas if we
observe a designing man, we shall find a mark
of involuntary sadness break in upon his joy,
and a certain insurrection in the soul, the na-
tural concomitant of profligate principles.
They err very much who think religion, or
a strict morality, discomposes the mind, and
renders it unfit for conversation; for it rather
inspires us to innocent mirth, without such a
counterfeit joy as vicious men appear with ;
and indeed wit is as consistent with religion,
as religion is with good manners; nor is there
anything in the limitation of virtue and religion
that should abate the pleasures of this world,
but on the contrary rather serves to increase
them. . -
On the other hand many men by their own
vice and intemperance disqualify themselves
for conversation. Conversation is immoral,
where the discourse is indecent, immodest, scan-
dalous, slanderous, and abusive, How great is
their folly, and how much do they expose them-
selves, when they affront their best friend, even
God himself, who laughs at the fool when his
fear cometh -
The great scandal atheistical and immoral
discourse gives to virtue ought, methinks, to be
punished by all good magistrates: make a man
once cease to believe a God, and he has nothing
left to limit his soul. How incongruous is it to
good government, that a man shall be punished
for drunkenness, and yet have liberty to affront,
and even deny the Majesty of Heaven 7 when
if, even among men, one gives the lie to a gen-
tleman in company, or perhaps speaks an
affronting word, a quarrel will ensue, and a
combat, and perhaps murder be the conse-
quence : at the least he will prosecute him at
law with the utmost virulence and oppression.
The next thing to be refrained is obscene
discourse, which is the language only of profi-
cients in debauchery, who never repent but in
a goal or hospital ; and whose carcasses relish
no better than their discourse, till the body be-
comes too nasty for the soul to stay any longer
in it.
Noris false talking to be less avoided : for ly-
ing is the sheep's clothing hung upon the wolf’s
back. It is the Pharisee's prayer, the whore's
buss, the hypocrite's paint, the murderer's
smile, the thief's cloak; it is Joab's embrace, and
Judas' kiss. In a word, it is mankind's darling
sin, and the devil's distinguishing character.
Some add lies to lies till it not only comes to
be improbable, but even impossible too. Others'
lie for gain, to deceive, delude, and betray: and
a third lies for sport, or for fun. There are
other liars who are personal and malicious ;
who foment differences, and carry tales from
one house to another in order to gratify their
own envious tempers without any regard or
reverence to truth.
Chap. V. Of the present state of religion in
the world.
f doubt, indeed, there is much more devo-
tion than religion in the world, more adoration
than supplication, and more hypocrisy than
sincerity; and it is very melancholy to consi-
der, what numbers of people there are fur-
nished with the powers of reason and gifts of
nature, and yet abandoned to the grossesi igno-
rance and depravily. But it would be uncha-
ritable for us to imagine (as some Papists
abounding with too much ill-nature, the only
scandal to religion, do) that they will certainly
be in the state of damnation after this life; for
how can we think it consistent with the mercy
and goodness of an infinite Being to damn
those creatures, when he has not furnished them
with the light of his gospel ? or how can such
proud, conceited, and cruel bigots prescribe
rules to the justice and mercy of God 2. -
We are told by some people that the great
image, which King Nebuchadnezzer set up to.
be adored by his people, held the representation
of the sun in its right hand, as the principal
object of adoration. But io wave this discourse.
ef Heathens, how many self-contradicting prin-
"h
eiples are there held among Christians? and
how do we doom one another to the devil,
while all profess to worship the same Deity, and
to expect the same salvation ?
When I was in Portugal, there was held at
that time a court of justice of the Inquisition.
All the criminals were carried in procession.
to the great church, where eight of them were
j. gowns and caps of canvass, where-
on the torments of hell were displayed, and
they were condemned and burnt for crimes
against the catholic faith and blessed Virgin.
I am sorry to make any reflection upon Chris-
tians: but, indeed, in Italy the Roman religion
seems the most cruel and mercenary upon earth;
and a very judicious person, who travelled
through Italy from Turkey, tells us, «That there
» is only the face and outward pomp of religion
» there; that the church protects murderers and
» assassins,and then deliversthe civil magistrates.
» over to Salan for doing justice; interdicts
» whole kingdoms, and shuts up the churches
» for want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues,
» and so puts a stop to religion for want of
» their money ; that the court of Inquisition
» burnt two men for speaking dishonourably
» of the blessed Virgin : and the missiona-
» ries of China tolerated the worshipping of

» was the theatre, where religion was the grand
» opera; and that the Popish clergy were no
» other than the stage-players. 2
As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to
be the Messiah, or that the Messiah has come
in the flesh. And as to their protestants, they
are the followers of Laelius Socinus, who denied.

our Saviour's divinity; and have no concern
about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
In Muscovy their churches are built of
wood, and, indeed, they have but wooden
priests, though of the Greek church: they pray
as much to S. Nicholas, as Papists do to the Vir-
gin Mary, for protection in all their difficulties
or afflictions.
As to the Lutherans, they only differ from
the Romans in believing consubstantiation in-
stead of transubstantiation , but like them
they are much pleased with the external gal-
lantry and pomp more than the true and real
practice of it. . . -
In France I found a world of priests, the
streets every where crouded with them, and
the churches full of women ; but surely never
was a nation so full of blind guides, so igno-
rant of religion, and even as void of morals as
those people who confess their sins to them.
Does it not seem strange, that, while all men
own the Divine Being, there should be so ma-
ny different opinions as to the manner of pay-
ing him obedience in the Christian church 7. I
know not what reason to assign for this, except
it be their different capacities and faculties.
And indeed upon this account we have
perceived in all Christian countries what mor-
ial feuds have been about religion : what wars
and bloodshed have molested Europe till the
general pacification of the German troubles at
the treaty of Westphalia ; and since those
times what persecution in the same country
among the churches of the Lutherans : and
should I take a prospect at home, what un-
happy divisions are between Christians in this-
kingdom about Episcopacy and Presbytery,
the church of England men and the Dissenters;
opposing one another like St. Pauland St. Peter,
even to the face, that is, they carry on the dis-
pute to the utmost extremity.
It might be a question, why there are such
differences in religious points, and why these
breaches should be so very hot and irreconcil-
able 7 All the answer I can give to this, is, that
we inquire more concerning the truth of re-
ligion than any other nation in the world; and
the anxious concern we have about it makes
us jealous of every opinion, and tenacious of
our own : and this is not because we are more
furious and rash than other people; but the
truth is, we are more concerned about them,
and being sensible that the Scripture is the great
rule of faith, the standard for life and doctrine,
we have recourse to it ourselves, without sub-
mitting to any pretended infallible judge upon.
earth. º -
There is another question pertinent to the
former, and that is, what remedy can we ap-
ply to this malady? And to this I must nega-
tively answer. Not to be less religious, that we
may differ the less. This is striking at the very
root of all religious differences; for, certainly,
were they to be carried on with a peaceable
spirit, willing to be informed, our variety of
opinions would not have the name of diffe-
rences; nor should we separate in communion
of charity, though we did not agree in several
articles of religion.
Nor is there a less useful question to start,
namely, Where will our unhappy religious
differences end? To which, I hope, I may an-
swer: In heaven. There all unchristian and
unbrotherly differences will find a period;
there we shall embrace many a sinner, that
here we think it a dishonour to converse with;
and perceive many a heart we have broken
here with censures, reproachings, and revilings,
made whole again by the balm of the same Re-
deemer's blood. Here we shall perceive there
have been other flocks than those of our fold ;
that those we have excommunicated, have been
taken into that superior communion ; and in
a word, that those contradicting notions and
principles which we thought inconsistent with
true religion, we shall then find reconcilable
to themselves, to one another, and to the foun-
tain of truth. If any man ask me, why our
differences cannot be ended on earth 2 I an-
swer, were we all thoroughly convinced that
then they would be reconciled we would put
an end to them before ; but this is impossible
to be done : for as men's certain convictions .
of truth are not equal to one another, or to the
weight or significancy of such veracity, so nei-
ther can a general effect of this affair be expect-
ed on this side of time, on this side of the grave.
Before I conclude this chapter, I shall beg
leave to discourse a little of the wonderful ex-
cellency of negative religion and negative vir-
tue. The latter sets out like the Pharisee with:
God, I thank thee; it is a piece of religious
pageantry ; the hypocrite's hope ; and in a
word, it is positive vice : for it is either a mask
to deceive others, or a mist to deceive ourselves.
A man that is clothed with negatives, thus ar—-
gues: I am not such a drunkard as my landlord
such a thief as my tenant, such a swearer as
my neighbour: neither am I a cheat, an atheist,
a rakish fellow, nor a highwayman : no! I live
a sober, regular, retired life: I am a good man,
I go to church; God, I thank thee. Now, tho’
a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction to
the vices mentioned, yet a person had better
have them altogether, than to be the man he is;
for he is so full of himself, so persuaded that
he is good and religious enough already, that
he has no thoughts of any thing, except it be to
pull off his hat to God Almighty new and then,
and thank him, that he has no occasion for him;
and has the vanity to think that his neighbours
must imagine well of him too.
The negative man, though he is no drunk-
ard, is yet intoxicated with the pride of his own
worth : a good neighbour and peace-maker in
other families, but a tyrant in his own : ap-
pears in church for a show, but never falls upon
his knees in his closet; does all his alms before
men to be seen of them; eager in the duties of
the second table, but regardless of the first; ap-
pears religious to be taken notice of by men,
but without intercourse or communication be—
tween God and his own soul. Pray, what is
this man 2 or what comfort is there of the life
he lives 2 he is insensible of faith, repentance,
and a Christian mortified life ; in a word, he
is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of
religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and
retired part of his conversation. What notions
has he of his mis-spent hours, and of the pro-
gress of time to the great centre and gulf of
life, eternity? does he know how to put a right
value on time, or esteem the life-blood of his
-
*
soul, as it really is, and act in all the monients
of it, as one that must account for them 7 If
then you can form no equality between what
he can do, and what he shall receive; less can
it be founded upon his negative virtue, or what
he has forborn to do; and if neither his negative
nor positive piety can be equal to the reward,
and to the eternity that reward is to last for,
what then is to become of the Pharisee, when
he is to be judged by the sincerity of his repen-
tance, and rewarded, according to the infinite
grace of God, with a state of blessedness to an
endless eternity?
When the negative man converses with the
invisible world, he is filled with as much hor-
ror and dread as Felix, when St. Paul reasoned
before him of temperance, righteousness, and of
judgment to come : for Felix, though a great
philosopher, of great power and reverence, was
a negative man, and he was made sensible by
the apostle, that as a life of virtue and tempe-
rance was its own reward by giving a healthy
body, a clear head, and a composed life, so
eternal happiness must proceed from another
spring; namely, the infinite, unbounded grace
of a provoked God, who having erected a right-
eous tribunal, Jesus Christ would separate such
as by faith and repentance he had brought
home, and united to himself by the grace of
adoption, and on the foot of his having laid
down his life as a ransom for them, and ap-
pointed them to salvation, when all the philo-
sophy, temperance, and righteousness in the
world besides had been ineffectual. And this,
I say, was what made Felix, this negative man,
tremble.
chap. VI. Of listening to the voice of Provi-
- dence.
TH E magnificent and wise king Solomon
bids us cry after knowledge, and lift up our
voice for understanding; by which is meant,
religious knowledge; for it follows: Then shale
thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find
the knowledge of God. By which undoubtedly
he meant, to inquire after every thing that he
has permitted us to know, and not to search
into those ways that are unsearchable, and
are effectually locked up from our knowledge.
Now, as listening to the voice of providence is
my present subject, I intend, in the first place,
to write to those who own, 1. That there is a
God, a first great moving cause of all things,
an eternal power, prior, and consequently su-
perior to all created power or being; 2. That
this eternal power, which is God, is the sove-
reign creator and governor of heaven and earth.
To avoid all needless distinctions, what per-
sons in the Godhead exercise the creating, and
what the governing power, I offer that glo-
rious text, Psal. xxiii, 6, where the whole Tri-
nity is entitled to the whole creating work;
and therefore, in the next place, I shall lay
down these two propositions: -
I. That the eternal God guides by his provi-
dence the whole universe, which was created by
his power.
II. That this providence manifests a parti-
cular care over, and concern in, the governing
and directing man, the most noble creature up-
an earth.
R
It is plain that natural religion proves the
first, by intimating the necessity of a providence
guiding and governing the world from the
consequence of the wisdom, justice, prescience,
and goodness of the Almighty Creator : for
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God
should create a world without any care or pro-
vidence over it in guiding the operations of na-
ture, so as to preserve the order of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us, a light into the
care and concern of his providence, by the cli-
mate's being made habitable, the creatures sub-
jected and made nourishing, and all vegetative
life made medicinal; and all this for the sake
of man, who is made viceroy to the King of the
earth. The short description I shall give of pro-
vidence is this : that it is that operation of the
power, of the wisdom, justice, and goodness of
God, by which he influences, governs and di-
rects not only the means, but the events of all
things, which concern us in this sublunary
world; the sovereignty of which we ought al-
ways to reverence, obey its motions, observe its
dictates, and listen to its voice. The prudent
man forseeth the evil, and hideth himself; that
is, as I take it, there is a secret providence inti-
mates to us, that some danger threatens, if we
strºve not to shun it. . . . .
The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out
Hull against the royal martyr King Charles I,
the same day Sir John Hotham was put to
death by the parliament for that very action;
the same day ibat the King himself signed the
warrant for the execution of the Earl of Straf-
ford, the same day of the month was he barba-
rously murdered by the blood-thirsty Oliverian
crew ; and the same day that King James II
came to the crown against the bill of exclusion,
the same day he was voted abdicated by the
parliament, and the throne filled with King
William and Queen Mary.
The voice of signal deliverances from sud-
den dangers, is not only a just call to repen-
tance, but a caution against falling into the like
danger; but he who is utterly careless of him-
self afterwards, shews a lethargy of the worst
nature, which seems to me to be a kind of prac-
tical atheisin, or at least a living in a con-
tempt of Heaven, when he receives good at the
hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from
whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful
hand that gave it; neither, when he receives
evil, does it alter his manner of life, or bring
him to any state of humiliation.
We have a remarkable story of two soldiers
being condemned to death in Flanders. The
general being prevailed upon to spare one of
them, ordered them to cast dice upon the drum-
head for their lives; the first having thrown
two sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands,
having so poor a chance to escape : however,
having thrown, he was surprised when he also
threw two sixes more. The officer appointed
to see the execution ordered them to throw
again; they did so, and each of them threw
fives; at which the soldiers that stood round,
shouted, and said neither of them was to die.
Upon this, the officer acquainted the council
of war, who ordered them to throw a third
time, when they threw two fours; the general
being acquainted with it, sent for the men, and
pardoned them : I love, said he, in such extra-
R 2
ordinary cases, to listen to the voice of provi-
dence. -
We read in the holy writings how Godspeaks
to men by the intercourse of angels, or by
dreams and visions of the night. As God ap-
peared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob, so an–
gels have appeared to many in other cases, as
to Manoah and his wife, Zachariah, the Virgin
Mary, and to the apostles; others have been
warned in a dream, as king Abimelech, the
false prophet Balaam, and many others.
It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry,
what we shall be after this life 2 for there is
scarce a doubt that there is a place reserved for
the reception of our souls after death: for if we
are to be, we must have a where, which the
Scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and
Lazarus. The doctrine of spirits was long be-
lieved before our Saviour's time; for when the
disciples of the blessed Jesus perceived our Sa-
viour walking on the sea, they were much
surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay,
in those ages of the world it was believed that
spirits intermedled in the affairs of mankind,
and, throughout the Old Testament, I do not
find any thing that in the least contradicts it,
All the pains and labour that some learned
men have taken to confute the story of the
witch of Endor, and the appearance of an old
man personating Samuel, cannot make such ap-
paritions inconsistent with nature or religion :
and it is plain that it was either a good or bad
spirit that prophetically told the unfortunate
king what should happen the next day; for,
said the spirit, The Lord will deliver thee in-
-: * * * *
to the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow
shalt thou and thy sons be with me.
Abundance of strange notions possessed me,
when I was in the desolate island; especially
on a moonshining night, when every bush seem-
ed a man, and every tree a man on horseback.
When I crept into the dismal cave, where the
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans
even resembled those of a man, how was I
surprised my blood chilled in my veins, a cold
sweaty dew sat on my forehead, my hair stood
upright, and my joints, like Balthazzar's knees,
struck against one another, And, indeed, tho’
I afterwards found what it was, the remains of
this surprise did not wear off for a great while;
and I had frequently reiurns of those vapours
on different occasions, and sometimes without
any occasion at all. - .
One night after having seen some appear-
ance in the air, as I had just lain down in my
bed, one of my feet pained me; after that came
a numbness, succeeded with a tingling in my
blood; when Gis a sudden I thought something
alive lay upon me, from my knee to above half
my leg. Upon this I flung myself out of bed
where I thought the creature lay : but finding
nothing, Lord, deliver me from an evil spirit,
said I, what can this be? When I lighted a
candle, I could perceive no living creature in
the place with me but the poor parrot, who

was then mad at the bird, and putting on my
clothes, cried, I am terribly frighted. What's
the matter with you ? says Poll. You toad, said
I, I’ll knock your brains out. Hold your tongue,
cried he again, and so fella chattering, and call-
ing Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But,
after I had composed myself, and went to bed
again, I began plainly to see it was a distemper
that affected my nerves, and so my terrors va-
mished at once.
How intelligences are given or received we
do not know; nor are we sensible how they
are conveyed from spirits unembodied to ours
that are in life, or, on the contrary, from us
to them : the latter is certainly done without
the help of the organs, and the former is con-
veyed by the understanding, and the retired
faculties of the soul.
The spirits without the help of voices con-
verse, and the more particular discoveries of
the converse of spirits seem to me as follows ;
to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses, hints,
apprehensions, involuntary sadness, etc.
Dreams of old were the ways by which God
himself was pleased to warn men what services
to perform, and what to shun. Joseph was
directed of God in a dream to go to Egypt; and
so were the wise men warned in a dream to
depart into their own country another way to
avoid the fury of Herod. I am not like those
who think dreams are the mere dosings of a
delirious head, or the relics of a day's perplexi-
ties or pleasures ; but, on the contrary, I must
beg leave to say, I never met with any capital
mischief in my life, but I had some notice of it
by a dream; and had I not been a thoughtless
unbelieving creature, I might have taken many
a warning and avoided many of the evils I af.
terwards fell into merely by a total neglect of
those dreams.
I was once present at a dispute between a
layman and a clergyman upon the subject of
dreams. The first thought no regard should be
given unto them : that their communication
from the invisible to the visible world was a
mere chimera; without any solid foundation.
For, 1. said he, if dreams were from the agency
of any prescient being, the motives would be
more direct, and the discoveries more plain ;
and not by allegories and emblematic fancies,
expressing things imperfect and obscure.
2. Since with the notice of evil, there was not
a power given to avoid it, it is not likely to
roceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous.
3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cases
equally important, proves they did not proceed
from any such agent. 4. That as our most dis-
tinct dreams had nothing in them of any signi-
ficancy, it would be irrational and vain to think
that they came from heaven. And, 5. that as
men were not always thus warned or sup-
plied with notice of good or evil, so all men
are not alike supplied with them; and what
reason could we give why one man or one
woman should not have the same hints as ano-
ther.
To all this the clergyman gave answer ;
1. That, as to the signification of dreams, and
the objections against them as being dark and
doubtful, they are expressed generally by hiero-
glyphical representations, similies, allusions, and
figurative emblematic ways, by which means,

R 4
for want of interpretation, the thing was not
understood, and, consequently, the evil not
shunned. 2. That we charge God foolishly, by
saying, that he has given the notice of evil with-
out the power to avoid it; for if any one had
not power to avoid the evil, it was no notice to
him; and it was want of giving due heed to
that notice that men first neglected themselves,
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with
injustice. 3. That we ought not to find fault
with the inconstancy of these notices, but ra-
ther with our weak understandings, by pre-
tending dreams were not to be regarded, and
negligent when the voice really spoke to us for
our good. 4. It is a mistake to say, dreams have
no import at all : we might with more reason.
have said, none that we could perceive the rea-
son of, owing to our blindness and supine ne–
gligence, too secure at one time, and too much
alarmed at another; so that the spirit, which
we might be said to be conversing with in a
dream, was constantly and equally kind and
careful ; but our powers are not always in dig
... ame state of action, not equally attentive to, or
retentive of the hints that were given. And,
5. to answer the last question : VVhy people
are not equally supplied ? This seemed to be
no question ; for providence itself might have
some share in the direction of it, and then that
providence might be swayed by some other
motives : that as to the converse of spirits, he
could not callit a stated converse; such a thing
there was, but why there was so much of it,
and no more, was none of his business, and
that no such discovery had ever yet been made
to mankind, Nor were we to imagine less of
-
waking dreams, trances, visions, noises, hints,
impulses, and all the waking testimonies of an
invisible world, and of the communication that
there is between us and them, which common-
ly entertain us with our eyes open.
One time my fancy soared on high to see
what discoveries I could make in those clearer
regions. I found that such immense bodies as
the sun, stars, planets, and moon in the great
circle of the lower heaven, are far from being
found in the study of nature on the surface of
the earth. Here I saw many things that we
can entertain little or no notion of in a slate
of common life, and the emptiness of our no-
tion, that the planets are habitable worlds; that
is, created like ours for the subsistence and
existence of man and beast, and the preser-
vation of the vegetative and sensitive life : no,
mo, this is, I assure you, a world of spirils; for
here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan be—
ing the prince of the power of the air, keep-
ing his court or camp with innumerable an-
gels to attend him. But his power is not so
great as we imagine; he can tempt us to the
crime, but cannot force us to commit it : Hu-
manum est peccare. Neither has the devil power
to force the world into a rebellion against hea-
ven, though his legions are employed among
savage nations to set up their master for a god,
who make the heathens either worship him in
person, or by his representatives, idols and
monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of human'
blood. Now, as to the limitations of the de-
vil's power, you must understand, that, as there
are numbers of evil spirits employed in mis-
chief, so there are numbers of sº :* Sent-
from the higher and blessed abodes to discon-
cert and oppose their measures; and this every
Christian, I hope, believes, when he prays to
God, the father of spirits, to give his angels
charge over him while he slumbereth and
sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers
the devil was not restrained, the earth should
be subjected to dearth, droughts, and famine;
the air infected with noxious fumes; and in a
word mankind should be utterly destroyed,
which might oblige our Maker (if I may be al-
lowed the expression) to the necessity of a new
fiat, or else have no more creatures to honour
and worship him.
As the devil never wanted insinuators, I
shall observe, that I learned a way how to make
a man dream of what I pleased. For instance,
let us suppose one to be sound asleep ; let ano-
ther lay his mouth close to his ear, and whisper
any thing so softly as not to awake him, the
sleeping man shall dream of what has been so
whispered in his ear; nay, I can assure you,
those insinuating devils can do this even when
we are awake, which I call impulses of the
mind : for from whence but from these insi–
nuators come our causeless passions, invo-
luntary wickedness, or sinful desires 7 Who
else form ideas in the mind of man when he
is asleep, or present terrible or beautiful fi—
gures to his fancy? Milton represents the devil
tempting Eve in the shape of a toad lying just
at her ear, when in her bower she lay fast
asleep ; and brings in Eve telling Adam what
an uneasy night's rest she had, and relating her
dream to him. And likewise I believe that good
spirits have the same intercourse with us, in
warning us against these things that are evil,
and prompting us to that which is good.
VVere we to have the eyes of our souls open-
ed through the eyes of our bodies, we should
see this very immediate region of air, which we
breath in, thronged with spirits now invisible,
and which otherwise would be the most terrible:
we should view the secret transactions of those
messengers who are employed when the parting
soul takes its leave of the reluctant body, and per-
haps see things nature would shrink back from
with the utmost terror and amazement. In a
word, the curtain of providence for the disposi-
tion of things here, and the curtain of judgment
for the determination of the state of souls hereaf.
ter, would be alike drawn back; and what heart
could support here its future state in life, much
less that of its future state after life, either good
or bad.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being a-
‘bout seven miles distant from London, a friend
that came to dine with him solicited him to go
to the city. VVhat, said the gentleman, is there
any occasion for me 7 No, Sir, said the other,
nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your
good company; and so gave over importuning
him. Just then a strong impulse of mind urg-
ed the gentleman, and pursued him like a voice,
with : Go to London, Go to London. Hark ye,
says he to his friend, is all well at London? Am
I wanted there? Or did you ask me to go with
you on any particular account 2 Are all my
family well ? Yes, indeed, Sir, said he, I per-
ceived them all very hearly; and I did not ask
you to go to London upon any particular ac-
count whatsoever, except it was for the sake of
your good company. Again he put off his re-
solution : but still the impulse suggested to him,
Go to London; and at length he did so. When
he came there, he found a letter and messenger
had been there to seek him, and to tell him of
a particular business, which was first and last
above a thousand pounds to him, and which
might inevitably have been lost, had he not
gone to London that night.
The obeying of several hints, or secret im-
pulses, argues great wisdom. I knew a man.
that was under misfortunes, being guilty of
misdemeanours against the government; when,
absconding for fear of his ruin, all his friends
advising him not to put himself in the hands of
the law, one morning as he awoke he felt a.
strong impulse darling into his mind thus,
hºrite a letter to them and this was repeated
several times to his mind, and at last he answer-
ed to it, as if it had been a voice, Whom shall
I write to? Immediately it replied, MWrite to the
judge ; and this impulse pursued him for seve-
ral days, till at length he took pen, ink, and
paper; and sat down to write to him; when
immediately words flowed from his pen, like
streams from a fair fountain, that charmed even
himself with hopes of success. In short, the
letter was so strenuous in argument, so pa-
thetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively mov-
ing, that when the judge had read it, he sent
him an answer he might be easy, he would en-
deavour to make that matter light to him; and,
indeed, never left exerting himself, till he had
stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his
liberty and family.
I know a person who had so strong an im-
*
pression upon her mind, that the house she
was in should be burnt that very night, that she
could not sleep; the impulse she had upon her
mind pressed her not to go to bed, which, how-
ever, she got over, and went to bed; but was
so j with the thought which ran in her
mind, that the house should be burnt, that she
could not sleep; but communicating her ap-
P. to another in the family, they were
oth in such a fright, that they applied them-
selves to search from the top of the house to the
bottom, and to see every fire and candle safe
out, so that, as they all said, it was impossible
any thing could happen in the house, and they
sent to the neighbours on both sides to do the
like. Thus far they did well ; but had she o-
beyed the hint which pressed upon her strange-
ly not to go to bed, she had done much better;
for the fire was actually kindled at that very
time, though not broken out. About an hour
after the whole family was in bed, the house
just over the way, directly opposite, was all in
flames, and the wind which was very high,
blowing the flame upon the house this gentle-
woman lived in, so filled it with smoke and
fire in a few moments, the street being narrow,
that they had not air to breath, or time to do
any thing, but jump out of their beds, and save
their lives. Had she obeyed the hint given,
and not gone to bed, she might have saved se-
veral things ; but the few moments she had
spared to her were but just sufficient to leap
out of bed, put some clothes on, and get down
stairs; for the house was on fire in half a quar-
ter of an hour.
While I am mentioning these things, me-
thinks it is very hard, that we should obey the
whispers of evil spirits, and not much rather re-
ceive the notices which good ones are pleased
to give. We never perceive the misfortune of
this, but when in real danger ; and then we
cry, My mind misgave me when I was going
about it : but if so, why do you slight the cau-
tion ? why not listen to it as to a voice 2 and
then there had been no reason to make this
complaint.
I remember about 14 or 15 years ago (as to
time I cannot be very positive), there was a
young clergyman in the city of Dublin in Ire-
land, who dreamed a very uncommon dream,
That a gentleman had killed his wife, a rela-
tion of his, by stabbing her in several places ;
the fright of this awoke him : but finding it a
dream, he composed himself again to sleep,
when he dreamed a second time the same
dream. This made him a little uneasy; but
thinking it proceeded from the impression made
on his mind by the former, he went to slee
again, and dreamed the same dream a j
time also. So troubled was he at this, that he
arose, and knocked at his mother's chamber,
told his concern, and his apprehensions that all
were not right at his relation's house. Dear
son, says the good old gentlewoman, do not
mind these foolish dreams : and I very much
wonder, that you, being a person in holy or-
ders, should have regard to such illusions. Up-
on this he went to bed again, fell asleep, and
dreamed a fourth time as before. And then in-
deed he put on his night-gown, and went to
Smithfield, the place where his relation dwelt.
Here it was, alas! he perceived his dream too
sadly fulfilled, by seeing his relation, the youn
lady, who was a Protestant, and big with child,
stabbed in seven places by her barbarous hus-
band Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, only for
some discourses of religion that happened the
day before. After the wretch had stabbed her
in three places, he went to make his escape out
at a window ; but she cried out, My dear !
don't leave me, come back, and I shall be well
again. At which he returned in a hellish rage,
and gave her four wounds more; when, even
in this condition, rising from her bed, she wrap-
ped herself in her night-gown, and went to the
Lord Bishop of Rapho's chamber-door (the
bishop lodging at that time in the house), My
Lord, said she, O, My Lord, make haste to me;
but as soon as his Lordship came she expir–
ed in his arms, resigning her precious soul in-
to the hands of Almighty God. The cruel
wretch her husband was shot by the pursuers,
too good a death for one who deserved the gib-
bet; and the lady was universally lamented by
all tender and religious people. And this tra-
gical relation I have mentioned upon the ac-
count of that impulse, or dream, that the cler-
gyman had at the fatal time of the bloody action.
It might be expected I should enter upon the
subject of apparitions, and discourse concern-
ing the reality of them; and whether they can
revisit the place of their former existence, and
resume those faculties of speech and shape they
had when living; but, as these are very doubt-
ful matters, I shall only make a few observa-
tions upon them.
I once heard of a man that would allow the
reality of apparitions, but laid it all upon the
devil, thinking that the souls of men departed,
or good men, did never appear. To this very
man something did appear: he said, he saw the
shape of an old man pass by him in the dusk,
who holding up his hand in a threatening pos.
fure, cried out, O, wicked man, repent, repent {
Terrified with this apparition, he consulted
several friends, who advised him to take the
advice. But, after all, it was not an appari-
tion, but a grave and pious gentleman, who
met him by mere accident, and had been sen-
sible of his wickedness, and who never unde-
ceived him, lestit should hinder his reformation.
Were we always willing to make good use of
Satan's real appearances, I know not but it
would go a great way to banish him from the
visible world; for I am very positive, he would
seldom visit us, if he thought his coming would
do us any good : but so absolutely is he at the
command of heaven, that he must go, even to
do the work he abhors.
Some people make a very ill use of the gene-
ral notion, that there are no apparitions her
spirits at air; which is worse than those who
fancy they see them upon every occasion : for
those carry their notions farther, even to an-
nihilate the devil, and believe nothing about
him, neither of one kind or other: the next step
they come to, is to conclude, There is no God,
and so atheism takes its rise in the same sink,
with a carelessness about futurity. But there
is no occasion to enter upon an argument to
3rove the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate
}. power by words, who has so many unde-
niable testimonies in the breast of every ra–
tional being to prove his existence : and we
have sufficient proofs, enough to convince us of
the great superintendency of divine providence
in the minutest affairs of this world; of the
manifest existence of the invisible world; of
the reality of spirits, and intelligence between
us and them. What I have said, I hope, will
not mislead any person, or be a means whereby
they may delude themselves; for I have spoken
of these things with the utmost seriousness of
mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire for
- the general good and benefit of the world,
