Louis Francqjur had for thirty years served
his country with honour; his bravery and good
conduct had acquired him the esteem of his
officers, while his frankness and gaiety had
endeared him to his comrades. Covered with
wounds, and at the age of forty-six, he began to
feel himself in need of repose, and his feeling
heart sighed for those tender ties, which, in
honouring the man with the title of husband

and of father, bestow on him, in the bosom
of a beloved family, all the happiness he is.
capable of enjoying in this world.
Louis arrived at his birth-place with the rank
of sergeant. He enjoyed a pension of four
hundred francs, with which the king had recom-
pensed his services, and an income of eight
hundred left him by his parents. He was
received in his native village, situated a league
from Brest, with joy and affection. A young
and handsome peasant girl did not disdain the
offer of his hand, and the laurels which covered
the brows of the soldier concealed from her eyes
the disparity of their years. This union was
propitious. Francreur, always satisfied and
joyous, because his conscience was pure, wished
that all around hiin should feel pleasure. The
happiness of his wife constituted an essential
part of his own. Susan was an excellent house-
wife, kept order and neatness in the house, pro-
vided for all the wants of her husband with a
tender solicitude, listened with interest to the
recital of the battles in which he had been engaged,
and when the warrior painted in lively colours
the dangers he had been exposed to, Susan folded
him in her arms, as if to assure herself of his
having escaped them Soon a new tie was added
to strengthen this happy union ; the birth of 4

son crowned the vows of the married pair. « He
shall be named Felix," said Francceur, "for I
hope he will be as fortunate as his father, who
would not exchange his lot for that of a kina;."
Felix never quitted the bosom of his mother,
except to be received into the arms of Francceur,
and was lulled to sleep by the tune of a war
song, which he hummed to him, while Susan,
softly rocked this beloved child.
How many projects did this happy couple
form for the education of their dear Felix. «• I
will make him an honest man," said Francceur,
"a good citizen, and a brave defender of his
country;" in pronouncing which, a ray of pride
sparkled in the eyes of the veteran. "I," replied
Susan, "desire above all things, that he should be
a good Christian : that will, 1 hope, accord with
what you propose for him." "Perfectly well,
my dear wife. I will some day relate to you the
history of the valiant Bayard, who was surnamcd
'the Knigltf without fear and without reproach.'
You will see whether or not he was a religious
character. I think you will be satisfied with the
manner of his death, which was that of a true
Christian. Many others of our heroes have set us
the same example. Inspire our son then with
that piety which renders you so amiable, and
B 2
^ THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
causes you to find such pleasure in fulfilling your
duties."
At five years of age Felix was sent to school; his
father superintended his studies, made him every
day repeat his lessons, and do, under his inspec-
tion, a page of writing: his mother also taught him
to read the Evangelists, and to pray to God.
His memory and capacity filled his good parents
with joy; nevertheless, an extreme heedlessness
and giddiness were not his only defects. He
showed amongst his playfellows a quarrelsome
disposition, which often procured him a beating;
and, at eight years of age, he seldom returned
home without a black eye or a torn ear; however,
he made no complaints of any one, he had taken
his revenge, and that satisfied him. Felix would
have been a very bad boy if the fear of his father
had not restrained him: but the sergeant brought
him up with a wise severity, which was but too
much counteracted by the excessive tenderness
of his mother. It was at this period that an
epidemic fever carried off" honest Francceur from
his disconsolate wife, and entirely set free their
son from that salutary restraint so necessary to
such a disposition as his. From that time he
gave himself up entirely to his love of pastime
, and diversion, neglected his studies, and dis-
regarded the gentle reproofs of Susan.
His Desire for a Sea-faring Life. 9
The vicinity of a sea-port town had been the
means of inspiring Felix with a strong inclination
for a seafaring life : he often withdrew himself
from home unknown to his mother, hurried to
Brest, rambled over every part of the port, went
on board the ships, and amused himself with
climbing up the ropes. His boldness and agility
attracted the observation of the officers, who
encouraged him by their applause. Sometimes
he passed the whole day in this favourite amuse-
ment, and night alone forced him to return home
to his mother, breathless, overheated, and ex-
hausted by hunger, not having taken any food
since the morning. Poor Susan, weeping and
disconsolate, told her son, that he would break
her heart; but he replied, "that she would do
well to accustom herself to these things, because
that, as soon as he was old enough, he was deter-
mined to embark on board the first ship that
would receive him."
About four years passed in this manner. The
widow of Francreur, fearing that her son,who was
become a tall, stout lad, would quit her the first
opportunity that should present itself, wrote to
Captain Sinval, the youth's god father, to beg
him to take him on board his ship, in order
that he might be under his own protection and
guidance, since she found it impossible to oppose
his inclinations. His answer was favourable; he
sent her money to pay the travelling expenses of
Felix, who was to join hira at l'Orient, where the
vessel which he commanded was then lying, and
which was about to sail in a short time.
Susan, in informing Felix of the steps she had
taken, and the success, which had attended them,
blended many tender reproofs with her maternal
advice. "My son," said she, "you have by
your conduct added a thousand poignant griefs
to those already inflicted by the loss of your
father. A spirit of disobedience has taken
possession of your mind; you have braved the
authority of your mother, and formed the re-
solution of abandoning her; but what would
have become of you if I had not been careful to
make proper arrangements for you? Mr. Sinval
will supply the place of your father; he will
watch over you, and accustom you to that subor-
dination so necessary in every situation of life;
your attention to your duty, and your obedience
to your officers, may procure you success in that
which you have chosen. My heart trembles at
the many dangers you will there be exposed to;
I pray Heaven to protect you, and to avert from
you the punishment threatened to disobedient
children. May God pardon you as I do, and
may his blessing accompany mine."
His Mother's affectionate Counsel. 11
Felix had a tender heart—the discourse of his
mother, her tears and sobs, aft'ected him sensibly;
he threw himself at her feet, tenderly kissed her
hand, and testified the most bitter repentance for
his past conduct. The good mother clasped him
to her bosom, reminded him in a simple and
touching manner of the religious principles
which she had endeavoured to instil into him
from his earliest infancy, and exhorted him, in
whatever situation he might be cast, to rely on
the care of Providence, and never to despair of
its assistance.
The days following this conversation were
occupied in arranging the apparel of Felix, and
adding to it such articles as were necessary.
Felix, on the point of separation from his mother,
scarcely quitted her an instant, and seemed
desirous of making amends for the pain he had
occasioned her. Susan might have conceived a
hope of retaining him with her, had not the boy,
in the midst of his caresses, often thanked her
for her condescension in permitting him to go to
sea- "What a pleasure it will be, my dear
mother," said he, "when I shall return to you;
I shall be so much bigger and stronger, you
will hardly know me again. I shall tell you all
about my voyages, and will bring you home
curiosities from all the countries I shall hav&

travelled over." Susan sighed deeply. "God
only knows,'" said she, "if I shall ever see thee
again; but life will have lost all charms for me
when I am bereaved of my only child."
At length the day of departure arrived; Susan,
accompanied her son to Brest, paid his fare in the
Diligence to 1'Orient, and recommended him to
the care of the conductor, whom she interested in
his favour by a handsome gratuity. It was
necessary to tear Felix from the arms of his
mother. She followed the carriage with her eyes
as long as it wa8 in sight, and then, with a heavy
heart, retraced her steps to her own village.
Felix, bathed in tears, participated in the grief
of his mother, but he was soon diverted from it
by a change of scene, and by the novelty of the
objects that presented themselves to him. How
amusing soever this first journey he had ever
taken must have appeared to him, his natural
impatience made him think it tedious, and he
wished himself arrived at the end of it as soon as
it was commenced. When the Diligence stopped
for refreshment, he eat at the table d' hole, swal-
lowed his food with the utmost avidity, in order
to be the sooner ready to remount the vehicle,
and was impatient with the other passengers,
whom he accused of delaying its departure by
their tardiness. At length he perceived the

tower 1'Orient: Felix clapped his hands, shouted
for joy, and when the Diligence stopped, he
rushed to the door, jostling; his fellow-travellers,
and made but one leap into the street. A female
exclaimed, "What an ill bred little boy!" «• My
conscience, Madam," replied the lad, "1 am
sorry if I haTe offended you; 1 am a sailor, I am
going to join my ship, and I should not like it to
sail without me." Nevertheless, he was under
the necessity of learning patience, and of waiting
till the conductor had disposed of the luggage of
the travellers. This man had undertaken to
conduct Felix himself to the house of Mr. Sinval,
and to deliver him a letter from Susan.
The captain gave a very kind reception to
his godson, whom he had not seen since the day
of his christening; the pleasing countenance of
the youth, his free and unconstrained deport-
ment, prepossessed him in his favour. * My
young friend," said he to him, "for your first
voyage 1 can give you no better station than that
of a cabin boy; but, if you do your duty well,
and endeavour to become a good seaman, I
promise to advance you rapidly. In two days
time we are going to the roadsted of Port Louis,
from whence we shall depart with the first fair
wind. Make the best use of this short time to
view the town and the port, and do not forget
14
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY;
to write to your good mother, whose affection
demands your utmost gratitude." Felix kissed
his god-father's hand, and retired to the little
closet allotted to him for a sleeping apartment.
He was burning with impatience to go out and
examine the port of 1' Orient, and to see two tine
eighty-gun ships which were on the stocks, and
which were to be launched in a few days. But
an idea suggested itself to his mind, to which all
others gave place. "1 know," said he to
himself, "that if once I go out, so many things
will engage my curiosity, that I shall perhaps
not think of writing to my mother; and if she
receives no letter from me, she will think me an
ungrateful child. 1 have given her already but
too much occasion for affliction; I will not add
this to her grief." Felix then seated himself at
a.little table, and began a very affectionate
epistle; as he wrote, fresh ideas crowded on his
mind, and, imperceptibly, he filled three large
pages with expressions of his respect and love.
Thus satisfied with himself, he sealed his letter,
and begged Lapierre, Mr. Sinval's servant, to
show him the way to the post-office. The boy
offered to conduct him to it, and accompany
him to all the places he wished to visit; a
prososal which Felix accepted with much pleas-
ure. ,
Sails for the East Indies. * 15
No doubt, my young friends, you are 'pleased
with the conduct of our hero, and that the
sacrifice which he made to filial piety has obtained
your approbation. The natural effect of good
actions is, to excite a desire of imitating them.
I hope, then, that you will all bear in mind, that
duty should take the precedence of pleasure,
which is the only way to enjoy the latter unalloyed
by pain and regret.
We shall not follow Felix through all his
walks, in which he saw much to gratify his
curiosity, and from which he might have derived
much instruction, but he saw them only with
the eyes of a child; and you will perceive, in the
sequel, how much cause he had to regret having
paid so little attention to them. At length, then,
behold him on board of ship bound to the East
Indies; the anchors are weighed, a favourable
wind swells the sails, and the coast of France
disappears from the astonished eyes of Felix.
I wish I could trace out to you the ship's course;
but our young, noviciate was so heedless, that
though he has recounted his own adventures, he
has never been able to give any account of that.
He has only informed us, that for two months
they had a favourable passage, and afterwards
he has been able to speak of nothing but his own
personal concerns. He was very much caressed
c
by bis god father, whose heart he had gained by
his attentions and his engaging manners. His
frolics amused Mr. Sinval; and when he had
deserved punishment, be extricated himself by
some merry conceit, and in exciting laughter he
disarmed anger. The title of captain's cabin-boy
gave him a great predominance over his com-
panions, and he abused this advantage even to
tyranny; they paid a kind of court to him—he
had his favourites whom he allowed to do what
they pleased, but those who offended him, or
opposed his inclinations, he often ill treated, and
they could obtain no redress from the captain,
who was too much prejudiced in favour of his
protegee. On one occasion only he made a good
use of his power. A passenger had lately died,
and had left a dog which no one noticed, except
the young cabin boys, who amused themselves
with tormenting him. Sometimes they fastened
to his tail a paper or something to make a
clatter. The poor frightened Castor ran about
howling, and getting kicked by the sailors, who
were enraged at bis noise. Another time these
mischievous lads put crackers in his ears, which
terrified him dreadfully. Felix stood fortif as
the protector of the poor dog, and, throwing
down his hat, said that he would fight any one
who ill used Castor. This threat was sufficient
Castor, the faithful dog of Felix. 17
to restrain his persecutors. Felix did not stop
here; but, having protected him from their
malice, he took upon himself the care of his
subsistence ; he divided his meals with him, and
by his many little engaging ways, he coaxed the
cook to give him some additional scraps for his
dog, who, grateful for so many kindnesses, at-
tached himself to his benefactor; he followed
him every where, slept under his hammock, and
showed his teeth at those who made a feint of
attacking his young master. Felix congratulated
himself at finding a friend to his mind, that is
to say, tractable to all his wishes, and submissive
to all his caprices, and he preferred him to his
companions, who still sometimes took the liberty
to contradict him.
In the mean time the weather changed on a-
sodden; a thick fog arose, which continued
several days, during which the ship drifted so
far out of her course towards the south-east, that
they knew not in what part of the world they
were. A dreadful tempest succeeded, the ship
was in the greatest danger, and the masts were
carried overboard. They passed three days and
three nights in this terrible situation; the vessel
6prang a leak in several places: the water gained
so fast upon her that the pumps could not keep
it under. The crew were exhausted with fatigue

and quite disheartened. To complete their mis-
fortunes, the captain, who was.in the act of giving
his orders and encouraging his men, was swept
overboard by a wave; the second in command,
on whom the charge of the vessel devolved,
possessed neither his presence of mind nor his
authority.
At day-break they perceived land at about a
league distant; the crew were clamorous to take
to the boats in order to endeavour to reach it;
and, notwithstanding the refusal of the com-
manding officer, the seamen launched them, and
he thought himself fortunate that they allowed
him to come on board one of them. All the
men got into the boats, the cabin boys threw them-
selves after them ; tviix wished to do so likewise,
but there was no more room, and they appeared
overloaded ; he had lost his protector, and his
conduct had not gained him any friends—he was
repulsed and thrown down on the deck nearly
senseless, and when he recovered he found him-
self alone with his dog, and perceived the boats
at a great distance straggling with the waves.
It is not possible, my little friends, to describe
the despair of this poor child, with the prospect
of immediate death before his eyes. He tore his
hair,rent the air with his cries,and wickedly dared
to reproach Divine Providence for having a ban-
A dangerous Storm. 19
doned him, though so many others were saved.
While uttering these complaints, he beheld the
boats upset one after another, and swallowed in
the depths of the sea. This terrible spectacle
completely overwhelmed him; he fell on his face
in dreadful agonj, expecting every instant that
the ship would go to pieces, and that he should
share the fate of his unhappy companions. But
the idea occurred to him, that he should not perish
entirely, since he possessed an immortal soul,
which God had created,accountable to him at some
future day. This consoling thought revived him
a little—" My God," cried he, <; take pity on a
helpless child; I submit to thy will; pardon my
murmuring; 1 well know that J must one day
die ; if it be thy will that this should be the
day, let thy will be done : but when my body
shall be buried in the sea, do thou receive
my soul; afford also consolation to my dear moth-
er, who will lament the death of her only child,
and re-unite us in thy happy abodes. After this
fervent prayer Felix arose more calm; but the
sight of the foaming billows beating against the
sides of the ship, the frightful how lings of the
winds, and the dreadful claps of thunder, re-
newed all his terrors. In this situation he
remained for two long hours; the vessel, in the
meantime, continuing to drive before the wind
C 2
and tide towards land. At length she struck
upon a rock—a horrible crash announced her
complete destruction, and she went entirely to
pieces. Felix was precipitated into the sea;
he sunk immediately to the bottom, but soon
rose to the top of the water, and having been
accustomed to swimming, he exerted his utmost
strength, to keep himself afloat, and to direct his
course towards the shore. Sometimes the waves
carried him towards it, but others coming in a
contrary direction, drove him back again, and
overwhelmed him with a mountain of waters.
After some time, exhausted by his fruitless efforts,
his strength forsook him, his arms and legs became
motionless, and he was on the point of being swal-
lowed up by the sea, when his faithful dog, Castor,
who was swimming near him, seized his clothes
in his mouth, and bore him up with extraordinary
vigour. He stemmed the force of the waves with
iiis burden, and, with equal strength and dexte-
rity, gained the shore where access was easy; he
there deposited his dear master, and, seeing him
incapable of helping himself, he drew him so far
on the sand as to be out of the reach of the
water.

tree—The agouti—Felix sleeps in a tree—The river—

I suppose, young friends, (hat you are very well
pleased at seeing our friend Felix s^fe on shore.
I shall now leave him to speak for himself, and to
give his own account of his thoughts and actions
when he recovered the use of his senses, of which
fear had deprived him. He has written a rela-
tion of all that befel him from the time of his
shipwreck till that of his restoration to society.
I have had this relation in my possession, and
made from it an extract for your benefit. "I
was," says he, "extended on the sand without
sense or motion, the caresses of my faithful Gas-
tor recalled me to life. This affectionate animal,
overcome by the exertions he had made in saving
me, was licking my hands and face, and appeared
rejoiced when he saw me open my eyes. The
first thoughts of my heart were directed to the
God of Mercy, who Bad just delivered me from a
death apparently inevitable. I threw myself on
my knees to return him thanks for his great
goodness; for some time 1 felt nothing but joy
at being still in existence; with tears of gratitude
1 embraced the faithful animal to whom 1 owed
my life. The winds were calmed, the waves
began to subside, and the thunder was only heard
at a distance, and afer long intervals. The
beams of the sun, which now began to shine in
its full splendour, soon dispersed the clouds, and
its genial warmth completed the restoration of ray
faculties, an^ dried my clothes; but I was tor-
mented by a violent thirst. Castor, who suffered
the like distress, lay panting by my side with
his parched tongue hanging out of his mouth.
I cast around me looks of anguish, and dis-
covered on ail sides of the sandy beach on which
I had been cast, nothing but the steep rocks
which it appeared impossible for me to surmount.
All at once Castor ran swiftly away; I called to
him as loud as I was able, but in vain; he seemed *
not to hear my voice, and suddenly he disappeared
entirely. I now thought myself abandoned by
my companion, and my tears flowed abundantly.
Almost dying with hunger and thirst, which I saw
no means of satisfying, I ceased to regard life as
a blessing from heaven, and murmurs escaped me

against that God, who seemed only to have saved
me from the fury of the waves to let me perish just-
ly with famine on this barren coast. I passed an
hoar in this dreadful situation; from which I was
at length aroused by the return of Castor, who
.ran to me, refreshed and active. In leaping upon
me to caress me, he shook his long ears, and my
hands were sprinkled with water; I easily guess-
ed that this animal, guided by instinct, had dis-
covered a spring behind the rocks. Thirst was
then the most pressing of my wants; I rose hastily,
and patting my companion, went towards the
place where I had so suddenly lost sight of him:
he appeared much rejoiced, and ran on before me,
then returned and seemed to invite me to follow
him. At last he led me to the entrance of a sort
of cavern, the opening to which appeared too nar-
row to admit us. Castor crept in first, without
any difficulty; I entered after him, crawling on
my hands and knees: I was struck with fear at
the silence and darkness of this subterraneous
route, which were sufficient to terrify a child. I
expected to meet with serpents, and other veno-
mous creatures, and the dread of being devoured
by them made me tremble all over. Had it not
been for the burning thirst which afflicted me, I
should have very soon turned back again. At
tength I perceived a feeble light which penetrated
24

through the clefts of the rock, and discovered to
me a long passage under ground; it enlarged im-
perceptibly; the farther I advanced, the more lofty
the vault became. At length I was able to walk
upright and follow Castor, who served as my
guide. Having proceeded about a quarter of an
hour, I perceived a large opening, and hastened
to it, anxious to escape from so dismal a place.
I cannot express my surprise and joy, at seeing
a fine plain covered with herbs and plants which
were unknown to me, -and surrounded by trees
of a prodigious size. A brook ran winding
through the midst of a green turf covered with
flowers; I flew to it, and taking up the water
with my hands plentifully, relieved my thirst:
I then washed my face, and this refreshment
greatly alleviated my sufferings, and rendered
me capable of reflecting on my situation: it
was already less painful; this charming place
promised many resources for my subsistence,
for which I could not have hoped on the barren
coast on which I had been thrown. In admiring
the bounty of Providence I could not help
bitterly reproaching myself for my murmurs,
and implored God to pardon me, and to continue
his gracious care over a poor, unprotected child,
that had no hope but in him.
The evening was far advanced, I was starving
His excessive Thirst and Hunger. 25
with hunger, but saw nothing fit to eat. I had
gathered some herbs, but they were tough and
bitter, and. it was impossible to swallow them.
Castor felt the same wants as myself, and we
both lay down on the grass weak and exhausted.
At length sleep took possession of us, and sup-
plying the place of food, repaired our wasted
strength. We slept the whole night, and in the
-morning awoke to feel again the pressing calls
of hunger. I drew near to some trees, and found
the happy effects of having accustomed myself to
exhibit my dexterity in' climbing up the masts
without the help of the ropes; it enabled me, by
clinging with my knees to the trunk, with the
assistance of my hands and feet to ascend to the
top of a tree whose thick foliage I thought might
conceal some kind of fruit; but my toil was
unrewarded; I found no fruit on it, and discou-
raged by disappointment, came down and began
weeping; but reflecting that tears availed mo
nothing, I resumed my courage and mounted
several other trees with the same ill success; at
length, on the last which I ascended, I discovered
a very large nest curiously constructed, in which
I found seven eggs much larger than those of our
hens. I broke one of them and eat it immedi-
ately, but found it not at all to my taste, it was
very different from the omelets which my mother
used to make, and the hard eggs with which she
furnished the table along with a delightful salad.
"And what," said I to myself, "prevents my
cooking them? I have a steel and some tinder in
my pocket, and can pick up dry wood to make a
fire; I will place my eggs in the ashes, and they
will soon be roasted. Delighted with this idea,
I folded the eggs in my handkerchief, that I
might not break them, and descending carefully,
arrived safe at the bottom with my little store of
provisions. I seated myself on the grass and
- examined my pockets, which I had not hitherto
thought of doing; I there found my steel and
some tinder, which being shut in a tinder box had
escaped being wetted, a pretty strong knife, a
large ball of pack-thread, and a top, which was
my favourite plaything; but at this time I
scarcely deigned to look at it; I had plenty to
do without thinking of diversions. I searched
about for dry leaves and dead sticks; struck a
light, kindled a fire and blew it with my breath;
a sparkling flame arose and soon formed a heap
of ashes, in which I buried my eggs, and tried to
restrain my impatience till they were cooked; I
then first perceived the absence of Castor, and
concluded that he was also in search of food,
and doubted not that he would soon come back
to me. In a little time the eggs were roasted; I

devoured four of them with an appetite which
made them highly relishing, though I had
nothing to serve as seasoning. I was going to
eat the two last, but I considered, that perhaps
I should not be fortunate enough to find others
on the same day, and that it would be prudent
to reserve these for my supper: I laid tnem by
carefully, and had the forbearance to restrain jpy
appetite, which was very far from being satisfied.
Many hours were passed in these employments,
and the sun darting its beams on my bare head,
I sought shelter under the large trees which sur-
rounded the plain, and amused myself in exam-
ining them. I discovered one whose trunk
was covered with a large fruit resembling pump-
kins; I beat down one of them with a great
branch which I had picked up; the rind of it was
so hard, that I could scarcely cut a piece of it
with my knife; the inside was soft and yellowish,
but the taste so unpleasant that I threw it from
me in anger, aud remained in a very ill humour,
when I perceived my Castor, who was returning
from the chase, his mouth was bloody, and he
was dragging the body of an animal which he
had killed, and of which he had already eaten a
part; this sight filled ine with joy. I fondled

the animal as well as I was able—it was about
the size of a hare, but had a head somewhat
resembling that of a pig. Having finished this
work, I returned to my fire; it was still burning
beneath the ashes; 1 collected together the
largest embers and broiled a leg of the creature;
its flesh was white like a rabbit's, but very dry,
and had a rank flavour, which prevented my
eating enough to satisfy my hunger. I allayed
my thirst with the water from the brook, but
having nothing but my hands to dip it with,
only a few drops at a time reached my mouth.
A happy thought struck me, I ran to pick up
the gourd wtich I had thrown away with so
much contempt: I enlarged the opening with
my knife, and taking out all the pulp, scrapped
out the inner skin-, and then had a drinking
vessel larger than a bottle: I ran to fill it at the
brook, and slaked my thirst very conveniently.
I was the more pleased with my contrivance,
thinking I should be able to make of this fruit,
utensils of various kinds which would be very
useful to me.
The great heat and the solid meal I had just
made, inclined me to sleep. I stretched myself
under a tree, and Castor laid down at my feet;
I know not how long I slept, but on waking
I found myself quite recovered from my fatigue.
Reproaches his Disobedience to his Mother. 29
I now began to consider what course I had best
take, and I reasoned thus with myself:—"I am
here quite alone in an unknown country; if I
remain where I am, 1 run the risk of perishing
with hunger. Beyond these trees I see a very
lofty mountain: if I can climb to the top of it, I
shall discover the whole country; I shall see
houses and men; without doubt, they will take
pity on me and give me food : I shall offer my
services to them, for I had rather work for them,
than remain in this disconsolate condition, since
I am neither old enough nor strong enough to
provide for my own wants. [ have always
wished to be my own master, and not have any
one to obey. How stupid I was! I now go
where I will, I do what 1 choose, and yet I never
was so unhappy. O my dear mother! could I
but return to you, with what pleasure would I
do whatever you commanded me. I have well
deserved all I suffer, by my disobedience, and I
acknowledge the justice of God in my punish-
ment. " Floods of tears ran do wn my cheeks at these
melancholy reflections. At length I regained my
spirits, and determined to set. off the next day
for the mountain, and if I should discover any
habitation, to make the best of my way to it
.
As I intended to take some provisions with me,
1 hung up what remained of my broiled meat in
a tree, and gave what was undressed, to my dog.
I afterwards went to look for eggs, and found
five in one nest, and four in another: I stirred
up my fire afresh, and cooked them for my next
day's journey. The sun was set by the time I
had accomplished my work; I said my evening
prayers, and prepared to stretch myself on the
turf to sleep, as I had done the preceding night,
when a terrifying thought presented itself to my
mind and filled me with alarm. I fancied that
some hungry wild beast might attack me whilst
I was asleep, tear me to pieces, and devour me in
two or three mouthfuls. "In vain," said I,
«'will my brave dog Castor endeavour to defend
me, a bear or a lion is much stronger than he,
and we should both become a prey to the ferocious
animals." I saw no other means of avoiding so
dreadful a fate than by climbing up one of the
loftiest trees, where I concealed myself among
the thick foliage, and seated myself as commo-
diously as I could upon a strong branch, whilst
another supported my back, and my feet were
firmly fixed; but all this did not secure me
against the fear of falling; I therefore took off my
garters, tied them together, and formed a band-
age with which I made myself fast to the trunk of
the tree. In spite of all these precautions, fear
kept me a long while awake; I was, besides, very

uneasy respecting my dear companion, who had
no means of securing himself against the danger
of being devoured. At last I fell asleep, sighing
for the happiness of being able to find «ome
inhabitants to defend and afford me subsistence,
and a house to shelter me.
Castor, who partook of none of my fears or
anxieties, slept very quietly, but he was the first
to wake, and came barking at the foot of my tree
as if to warn me that it was time to think of setting
off. It was just day-break; this was the favour-
able time to begin my journey; my prepara-
tions were soon made, I folded up neatly, in some
large leaves, the meat which I had left, and tied
it in my handkerchief, distributed the eggs in
my pockets, filled my calabash, hung it across
my shoulder on a branch, and began my march.
Castor, who had breakfasted abundantly on what
remained of his game, followed me gaily, making
a thousand leaps and gambols; and I had not omit-
ted elevating my thoughts to God, and imploring
his blessing on my journey.
After traversing the immense plain, and pass-
ing through the trees which surrounded it, we
arrived at a tract of land which descended with a
gentle slope, so that I advanced more than a
league without experiencing any fatigue. As I
proceeded, tiie herbage became so high that it
V
D 2
reached to my shoulders; frequently our approach
startled, from among the tangled grass, flocks of
young birds, which made me conclude that the
old ones deposited their eggs among this cool
verdure; I could easily have caught some of
these birds, which were scarcely strong enough to
fly, but I was wholly engrossed with the desire
and hope of meeting with some inhabitants; the
fear of retarding my journey would not allow me
to stop, nor examine the surrounding objects.
At the bottom of the valley I met with an obsta-
cle, which, if I had had any experience, I might
have easily foreseen; this was a wide and beauti-
ful river, which it was necessary to pass in order
to arrive at the foot of the mountain. Castor
leaped in and soon swam to the opposite side; I
did not hesitate to follow him, though the cross-
ing it was as much as my strength was equal to;
but I was sure that the powerful animal would
come to my assistance, if it failed me; however, I
, needed not his aid on this occasion, and arrived
safe on the other shore. I observed that this
river was very firll of fish, and with almost any
net I might catch great plenty of them, but I
paid no regard to this circumstance, little think-
ing I was destined to provide for myself; I ex-
pected tr»at others would work for me.
When we had gained the foot of the mountain,

je sun was shining in its full strength, and not
tree was near to afford us shade; I looked
around and discovered, with great pleasure, a
cavity in the rock where we might retire during
the extreme heat. I carried there some large
stones to make me a seat; Castor stretched him-
self at my feet; the air and exercise had given me
so good an appetite, that the piece of meat I had
with me appeared but a small allowance, the
more so, as 1 must share it with my companion;
but what was still worse, when I came to unfold
it, so bad a smell exhaled from it that it quite
turned my stomach; the great heat had entirely
spoiled it, and I was forced to give it to my dog,
who devoured it in a few mouthfuls, so that I was
obliged to be content with the hard eggs with
which I had provided myself.
After resting some hours I began to climb the
mountain with much fatigue and difficulty; in
some places I met with a smooth rock where I
could get no foot hold, and was forced to crawl
by clinging to the shrubs which grew out of the
crevices; farther up the earth was covered with
flints, and the soil was so loose, that I was often
on the point of rolling to the bottom; notwith-*
standing, I kept up my courage, and the sight of
a tuft of trees, which I perceived about half way
up, encouraged me to redouble my efforts. My
trjisty companion assisted me to the utmost of
his power, and when I felt myself sliding down I
clung to his long shaggy coat, which he permit-
ted with great good nature, and with his help I at
length reached the wood, where I met with ample
recompense for all my trouble. Large citron
trees, loaded with fruit in full perfection, afforded
me a relief of which I stood in great need : the
ground was strewed with citrons, I eat of them
with avidity; nothing had ever afforded me more
pleasure than their refreshing juice, at a time
when I was sinking with the excess of heat and
fatigue. After resting awhile I filled my pockets
with fruit, and quitted this agFeeable place to
climb with fresh courage in order to gain the top
of the mountain before night. I had overcome
the greatest part of the difficulties: the rest of
the way was smooth and easy of ascent; a kind
of steps formed by nature led me to the object of
my wishes; but before I had attained it the sun
; had been long set, and darkness prevented my
distinguishing distant objects, and satisfying my
impatient curiosity; I therefore began to think
of making my arrangements for the night. As
I had not there any tree on which I might ascend
to 9ecure myself against the wild beasts, my ap-
prehensions were renewed, in addition to which I
experienced an excessive cold; I knew not at the
time that it was owing to my being in so> elevated
a situation. I determined to make a large fire

to sleep by; many dry plants afforded me mate-
rials for my purpose: I collected a great heap of
them, which I easily set on tire: I then said my
pfayers, and reiving oti the goodness of God, fell
asleep in spite of my fears. 1 awoke with the day,
and my first care was to cast my eyes on all sides
in hopes of discovering some traces of habitation,
houses or huts, men or flocks. What was "my
consternation and grief, at finding the land where
I then was, surrounded entirely by the sea, and
that in fact it was an island, and without doubt
I was the only human creature who inhabited it!
I could perceive no part of the land to be culti-
vated, not a single cottage, not one domestick
animal. "Miserable wretch that I am!" cried I,
throwing myself on the earth, "poor, forsaken
child ! thou wilt here perish with Want and misery,
since thou hast no one to afford thee assistance."
I shed abundance of tears, and gave myself up to
despair: the caresses of Castor aroused me from
this state; he appeared to participate my grief,
he licked my hands, and accompanied my sobs
with deep sighs, he fixed his eyes on me tenderly,
and by every thina: in his power, expressed a
most lively sympathy. 'iThis then," said I,
sighing, " is my only remaining friend; but have
I deserved to have any? How have I befiavpd to
my companions? I always endeavoured to tyran-
nize over them, I treated them neither with re-
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
gard nor civility. Oh! if I had now but one
companion of my solitary life, how I would love
him ! how desirous I should be to oblige him!"
At the same time I returned the affectionate
caresses of my good Castor, and, in the end, con-
sidered myself fortunate in having him with me.
It was necessary for me to think about my future
subsistence, since I had none but myself to de-
pend on. I was very hungry, and had only some
citrons, which though they refreshed me, afforded
me no nourishment. I examined more delibe-
rately, from the top of the mountain, all the sur-
rounding places, in order to fix on one for my
abode. I wished to be again near the sea shore,
where I hoped to find shell-fish for my support.
On the side opposite to that on which I had
landed, I discovered a shore which appeared
fertile; large trees and a great number of shrubs
gave it a very pleasing aspect; I took particular
notice of the side on which I should descend,
and the route I ought to follow in order to arrive
at it; then summoning all my resolution, and
submitting to necessity, I determined to exert
myself to the utmost in order to support life,
and to accustom myself to labour, which was
the only method of procuring what was neces-
sary to it
.

The descent from the mountain was little
more than sport to me; sometimes I sat down
and slid a long distance; where I found the
surface smooth, I rolled like a ball, which was
a still more rapid mode of travelling. On
arriving at the bottom, I found a beautiful field
covered with white and lilac flowers which grew
on stalks, forming a pretty nosegay; I easily
discovered them to be potatoes: my mother had
cultivated some in her garden, and I had the
charge of attending them, but as I was then an
idle little fellow, I often neglected them. This
discovery was exceedingly valuable to me, my
eyes were filled with tears of joy and gratitude;
I thought that God, who takes care of all his

whole heart, and began immediately to get up as
many potatoes as my pockets would hold; I
likewise tilled my handkerchief with them, and
found myself relieved from the fear of dying
with hunger: I did not foresee that in a short
time I should be unable to make any use of this
food, since my tinder would be expended, and
I then should have no means of making a fir a.
I had not accustomed myself to reflection, and,
like the animals, 1 rejoiced in the present, with-
out thinking of the future.
I quitted the potato field, and walked along
the side of a brook bordered with rushes and
reeds; it led me to a wood, which I had much
difficulty in passing through, on account of the
briers and entangled shrubs, which frequently
stopped my passage; I cut some of them with my
knife, and pushed aside others with my hands, at
the expense of several scratches; at last I came
to a spot where the trees being more distant from |
each other, left an open space, which formed a
beautiful verdant saloon. This was a charming
place for taking that repose which I then so
much needed, and I arrived at it in the moment
when the heat was insupportable. I enjoyed
greatly the pleasures of this refresing shade,
but the calls of hunger would not permit me to
remain idle, I therefore placed my petatoes in the

earth and made a fire over them. Castor, who
smelt nothing which was likely to suit his appe-
tite, set off on one of his excursions. While my
potatoes were cooking, I attentively examined
the trees and plants which surrounded me, and
recognized with extreme pleasure, the majestic
oak, so common in my native country; the foliage
was somewhat different from that of the European,
but the acorns, which were scattered on the
ground, removed all doubt of its being of the
same species. I wished to taste them, and found
them very sweet and agreeable to the palate; and
while my repast was preparing I regaled myself
with them, rejoicing in having discovered this
addition to my means of subsistence. At some
distance I saw some very lofty trees, which bore
no leaves except at the very top, where they were
united like a crown, underneath which grew the
fruit, as large as my head, and forming a kind of
bunch. One of these fruits had fallen; 1 wished
to know what it contained, but the shell was so
hard that my knife would not enter it; I tried to
break it with a large stone, but was at last forced
to give up the attempt
.
The smell of the roasting potatoes invited me
to dinner; I seated myself under an oak, and
made an excellent meal: I thought of sprinkling
my potatoes with citron juice, and found this

gave them a very pleasant relish. My good dog
now returned with lopping ears and famished
looks, plainly showing that his chase had been
unsuccessful. I offered him some potatoes,
and for want of something better, he made
shift with them; he did not refuse even the
acorns, but munched of them till his hunger was
satisfied.
The great heat being over, I prepared to quit
the wood and continue my route. The ground
by degrees becoming less and less woody, I
uttered a cry of joy at beholding the sea at a.
little distance. I observed some few rocks on
this coast, but they were of no considerable
height; the shore in other places was level and
formed a beautiful sand. I quickened my pace
in order to arrive on the beach before the setting
of the sun, which I beheld sinking below the
horizon in floods of light; I could not remove
my eyes from this glorious spectacle till it had
entirely disappeared from my sight; I then
sought for a place to pass the night in, and made
choice of the top of a tree which grew out of a
rock; its roots had penetrated into the clefts of
the stone, which had given it firmness sufficient
to withstand the fury of the winds and storms.
This retreat, however, was not as commodious
as it was safe; I found it very uncomfortable to

be sleeping perched in a tree like a bird, and in
the morning felt myself bruised all over, and
pains in all my limbs. I sighed after the plea-
sure of sleeping stretched on something less hard
than the branch of'a tree ; but, in order to enjoy
that comfort, it would be necessary to construct
a hut which might shelter me from being
attacked. 1 thought almost the whole night ori
this subject, and resolved to set about the work
the very next day. With the first dawn I went
down to the shore; the tops of the rocks were
clothed with an agreeable verdure, and with a
great variety of trees ; the space between them and
the sea was partly covered with tall herbage, and
partly with low wood. I should have very well
liked to have built a stone house of solid work-
manship, but- I had neither cement, plaster,
nor lime, nor could I dig the foundation, having
nothing but my hands and my knife to work
with: I was therefore forced to be content
with a hut formed of branches woven together,
and which, nevertheless, would cost me much
time and trouble in constructing.
I made choice of four trees growing at equal
distances at the foot of a pretty high rock, which
would serve to screen me from the north wind;
these I intended for the pillars of my edifice. I
was so anxious to set about my undertaking,
42
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
that I was going to commence it, forgetful that I
was yet fasting, but my stomach reminded me
of it, and I thought it prudent to strengthen
myself by taking some food before I began my
work. I made my prayer to God that he would
grant me that daily bread which it was his will
his children should depend on him for, and
looking about for Castor, saw him on the sea-
shore fishing very adroitly with his paws for
crabs, on which he was regaling himself. I fol-
lowed his example, and collected a good store,
but did not think fit to eat them raw: some
time must be spent in lighting a fire, and in the
meantime I devoured some oysters that I picked
up on the sand. When I had breakfasted, I
hurried to the place I had pitched upon for my
abode. I broke down a great quantity of flex-
ible branches, placed them across from one tree
to another, and tied them tightly together with
certain filaceous plants which grew in abundance
out of the clefts of the rocks. In this manner I
made a kind of enclosure on three sides, but it
was yet far from being firm and compact: to
render it closer and more solid, 1 wove in other
branches in all directions, and by means of
labour and perseverance, at length contrived to

open, and my next concern was to shut up part
of it, and to make a kind of door to it: in this
lay the greatest difficulty, and I could not
suggest any method of accomplishing it. I sat
down in front of my unfinished work, and began
weeping. After losing an hour in unavailing
regrets, I became ashamed of my weakness.
"Iam not yet a man," said I, "but I ought to
become one; my strength will increase every
day, and what appears impossible to me now,
will be easy when I am grown bigger; I ought
then to be content with what I am a\ present able
to accomplish, and wait patiently till age adds to
my powers." While making these reflections,
I was scorched by the sun, and thought I might
shelter myself from its beams by the walls I had
just erected: I retired there and rejoiced at
being in the shade. Castor followed me> and we
reposed ourselves during the great heat of the
day. In the evening I walked to the wood of
oaks, and brought away a good stock of acorns
and citrons. I collected likewise some potatoes,
and having provided my food for the present day
and for the morrow, returned to the shore, where
the sight of my hut caused me to sigh deeply;
but an unexpected pleasure drove away these
sad thoughts. My dog joined me, dragging
with him an animal similar to that which he had
E %
v
before killed; it was an agouti, but I then knew
not the name of it: he readily gave up his prey
to me, knowing that he should have his share of
it . The animal was soon uncased, but having a
mind to eat it roasted, 1 made a strong fire, and
stuck into the ground two forked sticks: I
thrust a very straight one through the agouti's
body, laid it across the two forks, and began to
turn my spit. I intended to augment the plea-
sure of this repast by adding to it the potatoes
which were cooking, in order that they might
supply the place of bread: when my dish was
about half roasted, I squeezed over it some citron
juice, which, mixing with what dropped from the
animal into a calabash I had placed to receive it,
formed an incomparable sauce. My companion
and I supped with a good appetite, and before I
ascended my tree in order to resign myself to sleep,
I considered how I might keep the remainder of
my meat from spoiling till the morrow. I placed
it in a hole of the rock, covering it slightly with
leaves, hoping that, as the nights were tolerably
cool, owing to the vicinity of the sea, it might
easily be preserved: my hopes were not deceived,
we had sufficient for the next day, without the
necessity of lighting a fire or losing time in
seeking for food.
I employed myself then wholly in finishing
His Progress in building his Hut. 45
my hut. I sought among the stones on the
shore and found one large and flat, which had a
sharp edge; this I made use of to dig round two
young trees which I meant to take up by the
roots; I afterwards made two deep holes in front
of my little dwelling at equal distances from the
two corners; in doing which I alternately made use
of my hands, my knife, and large shells. When
I had made the holes deep enough, I planted in
them the two young trees that I intended to sup-
port my door : the space between them and the two
pillars was filled up with woven branches, which
formed the fourth wall of the house, and only
differed from the other three in having an opening
in it. I was very well pleased with my performance
and sat down to admire it,, and to take some rest.
The night before I had stretched out the skin of
the agouti that it might dry in the sun, hoping
to make some use of it; I now perceived that it
was quite shrivelled up and was good for nothing.
How much I then desired to possess some nails
and a hammer; I should have stretched this skin
with all my strength and have nailed it up, it
would then have dried without shrinking. I entered
into my leafy inclosure to work at constructing my
door. I formed a long square of four very strong
branches; the difficulty was to fasten them to-
gether; I did not succeed till after many trials*
and was obliged to sacrifice a part of my string,
which I was very unwilling to make use of. I
filled up this frame in the same manner as my
walls, and fitted it to the open space of that in
the front. I tied this door in such a manner as
to allow it play freely; when I opened it, it shut
of itself. I had only now to construct a roof,
and resolved to make it of rushes; I employed
the evening in collecting them on the banks of a
brook at a little distance from my habitation. I
cut as many as I could carry in five or six
journeys, and before retiring to rest had a large
pile near my hut.
In climbing into my tree I pleased myself with
the idea that it would be the last time I should
pass the night so ill at ease; I hoped to finish
my house the nest day, and was so taken up
with the idea of what remained for me to do,
that I slept but little. My first intention was to
arrange horizontally some branches supported
on my four walls, and to cover them with a thick
layer of rushes; but I reflected that the roofs of
the houses and cottages in Europe were sloping,
to let the rain oft" more easily. "Should heavy
rains fall," said I, "they will soon penetrate
through my roof if 1 make it quite flat. Fortu-
nately the rock against which I had placed the
back of my hut was higher than its walls.
Unexpected Discovery of Salt. 47
Against this rock, therefore, I supported one end
of my timbers, the other rested on the front wall,
which was about a foot and a half lower. When
they were firmly fixed I placed on them three
layers of rushes, well fastened together. I then
found myself possessed of a hut, well closed in,
capable of sheltering me against the heat in the
day, and affording me the means of sleeping
quietly during the night, on a bed of dry leaves
and moss. It was not till after I had prepared
this delightful couch that I thought of taking a
slight meal. Nothing remained of my provisions
except some roasted potatoes, to which I wished
to add some oysters: while I was pulling them
from the rocks, I observed Castor scratching
something round out of the sand, which he eat
greedily; I searched in the same place and
discovered many white balls, wrapped in a skin
like wet parchment, and covered with a layer of
sand; I imagined that these might be turtles'
eggs: I had heard the sailors say, that they were
excellent food; I took some of them, but was so
weary that I deferred couking them till the next
day.
This evening was a very fortunate one. I
perceived in the crevices of the rock a white
substance, which excited my curiosity; I tasted
it, and found, to my great joy, that it was salt,
48
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
which I had so often lamented the want of; the
potatoes, the eggs, and even the meat itself, tasted
very insipid without this seasoning; I filled two
large shells with it, and carried it home with my
other provisions. In approaching my dwelling,
I felt an emotion of pride in reflecting that this
handsome cottage was my own work; I conceived
a high opinion of my abilities, and doubted not
that I was able to perform whatever I chose to
undertake. I called my faithful companion, for
whom I had also made up a bed of leaves; we
stretched ourselves at our ease near each other,
and I passed a delightful night, visited by
pleasant dreams.
I began to be no longer afraid of wild beasts,
as, since I had been on my island, I had not seen
any, nor had any cries or howlings disturbed my
repose. My hut appeared all that I could have
wished; the sun did not penetrate it, and I did
not doubt of being able to furnish it with some
useful articles, and I would not then have changed
it for the finest house of my native village, so
much value do we attach to one's own perform-
ances.
The young persons to whom my story may be
related, will perhaps be astonished that I could
live without play, but let them think of the many
things that occupied my mind, and how precious
Jtnxiety about the Failure of Tinder. 49
my time was; the days glided away too fast
for all I had to do. The only recreation I
allowed myself was to bathe a little before sun-
set; after a scorching clay nothing could be more
agreeable. I swam round and round in all
directions, but without going far from shore:
my friend Castor watched over me with tender
anxiety, and when I returned ashore testified his
joy by leaping on my shoulders, and bestowing
on me numberless caresses. I took care to keep
myself perfectly clean, and often washed my shirt,
my nankeen trowsers, and my ticken waistcoat;
as for my stockings, the feet of them had been
long worn out, and since they could no longer
be of use, and I foresaw that I might have occa-
sion for thread, I unravelled them and made a
large ball of it.
I promised myself a delicious repast of my
turtles' eggs, now that I could add salt to them.
I found them quite to my taste, but my enjoy-
ment was very much disturbed at perceiving that
my tinder would very soon fail; the occupations
of the preceding days prevented my thinking of
this. What would then become of me? Deprived
of the means of making a fire, I should be re-
duced to the necessity of living on oysters,
acorns, and raw eggs; my fine potatoes and the
huntings of my dog would be no longer of anj

THE FREJfCH GABIW BOY.
benefit to me, for I would not bring myself to
eat raw meat. I shed many tears on the occa-
sion, which, after a while, relieved my heart: I
lifted up my eyes to heaven, and prayed that God
would grant me courage, and direct me by his
wisdom how to act. After much reflection,
I resolved to visit every part of my island, hoping
to find some new productions, some fruits which
would not require cooking, and which might
serve me for my subsistence.. Fortunately I
had learned on board of ship the points of the
compass; it was by them I intended to direct my
course during my journey, and to find my way
back again : I passed this whole day in preparing
every thing for my departure; I dug up
some potatoes, and dressed as many as I could
carry; and the next day as soon as it was light
1 set out, accompanied by Castor. I took a
northerly direction, and, after walking about two
hours, found myself again on the banks of the
same river I had swum across, but on the shore
opposite to that which I had traversed before.
It was beautified by a number of trees of different
species. The citron trees grew in great abund-
ance, and I observed many of the lofty trees
with such large leaves, and at whose tops hung
those great nuts, which I had not been able to
break; I was desirous to ascend one of them and

get down some of the nuts to make a fresh trial:
I accomplished it with much trouble and threw
down a dozen of these fruits; when I descended
I examined one of them carefully; the outer
covering or rind was composed of threads like
hemp; the second, or shell, was as hard as iron,
and I had no doubt it contained something tit to
eat, and thought of an expedient to separate it. I
first fixed it between some stones, then placed my
knife very exactly to the middle of the nut,
and with a large stone struck the back of it with
all my strength; I had the pleasure to find that
it entered the shell; I redoubled my blows, and it
separated in two halves. The kernel was a kind
of oily substance which tasted like sweet almonds,
and in the middle, which was hollow, I found
some milk of a delicious flavour. Oh! how
thankful I was to God for having provided me
this food at a moment when I feared- being
without any. The two halves of the shell formed
two good cups, and I saw the means of procuring
as many such as I should have occasion for. i
broke several other nuts, and satisfied my hunger
completely, reserving my potatoes for a time of
need.

I soon took courage, however, on perceiving that
it was a herd of wild goats, who were come to
drink at the river. The sight of these animals
gave me much pleasure. I immediately formed
the design of taking one of them alive: their full
udders gave me hope of abundance of milk, and
I ardently longed for a treat of it. I rejoiced at
the absence of my dog, whose barking would have
scared away the whole herd. I hid myself be-
hind a large tree, and while the goats were copi-
ously drinking and cooling themselves in the
water, made ready my string; I plaited, it in
three to make it stronger, and formed a running
noose to it, and when the animals were coming
out of the river, laid wait for that which passed
nearest me. Never having been attacked by any
one, they were not shy; a female, near her time
of yeaning, was grazing very near the tree where I
was on the watch; 1 threw my noose with so good
an aim, that her horns were entangled: I pulled,
the string with such force that the goat fell to the
ground, and before she could get up again I tied
her to the trunk of a tree in such a manner, that
it was impossible for her to extricate herself from
her bonds. The poor beast struggled and en-
deavoured to strike me with her feet and horns,
but I took care to keep at a distance. Her
piteous bleatings awakened my compassion, but
He captures a Female Goat. 53
I promised myself so much advantage from her,
that I was not tempted to set her at liberty. All
the flock, terrified, took to flight, and I remained
alone with my prize; I resolved to put off, for
the present, my journey of discovery, and to
return to my hut with the goat, in order to
secure her. I dined in haste on my roasted
potatoes, and as soon as Castor had joined me,
untied the string from the tree and twisted it
round my left arm, taking in my right hand a
large bough to strike tile goat, while I dragged
her towards my dwelling. I should not have
been able to get her there without the help of
my dog; she resisted with all her strength,
and tried to kick me, but the barking of Castor
frightened her; he followed close at her heels,
and bit her legs when she refused to advance;
however, we arrived at home before night. I
tied my prisoner again to a large tree growing
in a sandy spot, where there was not a blade of
grass.; I had heard that every kind of animal
was to be tamed by hunger, and determined to
leave this without food till the next day, whatever
pain it might cost me to keep fasting my new
guest, whom I was already fond of, and whom I
hoped to make fond of me. When I had satis-
fied myself that she was safe, I went home with
my companion, and laid down on my bed of

leaves, very well contented with the success of
the day.
As soon as the morrow began to dawn, I set
about collecting fresh grass for my goat's break-
fast; I went up to her; the poor beast was lying
on the sand; she appeared very much dispirited,
and turned her languid eyes on me. I hastened
to complete my stock of forage; I offered her
the grass I had just plucked; she eat it greedily,
and suffered me to pat her without any resistance.
I was much pleased with having a new com-
panion, and it was then only for the sake of her
society, for being near her time of having young
ones, she had not any milk.

The increase of my family deranged all my
schemes. I could not think of leaving home
before I had secured, not only the goat, but the
whole flock, which I already fancied myself
possessed of. I wished to form a park near my
dwelling, and after revolving various plans, I
determined on the following. I dug up a
number of young trees, taking care to keep some
of the earth about their roots: I then made holes,
and planted them very near each other in the
form of a square, and at the foot of each of them
put in some creeping plants, which abounded in
this place. My cocoa nut cups (for I now know
the name of this precious fruit) I found very use-
ful in taking up water for watering my planta-
F2
tion, which was a work of no little fatigue; for
having only such small vessels, I had more
than thirty times, every day, to go to the nearest
brook; however, nothing discouraged me j I
worked with indefatigable industry, and was so
fearful of losing a moment's time, that I lived
with the greatest abstinence. Oysters, acorns,
and some cocoa nuts, were my only food, because
they required no preparation. In the mean
while, my goat, whom I kept still tied up, began
to grow tame; I took care to provide her early
in the morning with food for the whole day: in
the evening I led her to the brook to drink: she
had formed a friendship with Castor ; when she
lay down he played between her horns: I was
pleased with the cordiality which these animals
manifested towards each other, as that which
subsists among brothers gives pleasure to the
father of a family.
One morning, when I came out of my hut, I
was agreeably surprised by the sight of two little
kids lying by the side of my goat, and sucking
heartily. 1 approached, my heart palpitating
with joy, and caressed the little ones; the mother
made no opposition, but looked at me with an
air of satisfaction. I ran to the fields, and did
not regret the trouble of providing food for the
mother and her nurslings. On my return, these

latter were sleeping quietly; I was tempted to
press the udder of the goat, and to drink a good
cup of warm milk, but soon reproached myself
for this selfish idea. "No," said I, "Iwilloot
deprive these innocent creatures of the nourish-
ment which nature has provided for them; I will
wait for that pleasure till they -shall be able to
browze the herbage, like their mother; then the
care which I shall take for their subsistence, will
entitle me to partake of the food which is now so
necessary for them." My goat, which was still tied
to the trunk of the tree, appeared incommoded
m suckling her young. The enclosure of my
park was nearly finished, the shrubs and plants
had taken root, and had put forth fresh leaves,
and when they grew would become interwoven.
I had left but one little opening as a passage for
my flock, which I now led into it,-pe>suaded that
the goat, with her young ones by her side, and
provided with all that she wanted, would become
attached to her new abode, and likewise to
myself: I intended, besides, to prevent her being
able to quit me, should she be so inclined. I
collected a quanrty of the dry branches of thorny
shrubs, and placed them along the inside of the
park hedge, to prevent the goats getting near it,
as she would not have failed to gnaw the young
shoots. When 1 had put her into the park with

her kids, I released her entirely from her bonds,
at which she testified her joy by a thousand
gambols; she then lay down on some good litter
of dry leaves, and her young ones began again to
suck.
I now left the enclosure, stopping up the
entrance with boughs and stones, and resumed
my work with a light heart. I continued my
search among the plants which grew in the clefts
of the rocks, or at their feet, for those which
appeared fittest for climbing up my young trees,
and for rendering my hedge more bushy. This
day I discovered a new and very singular species,
which I have since Learned is called the karatas:
its large thick leaves were hollowed in the
middle in the shape of a cup, and seemed formed'
of a texture from which I might draw very strong
thread; itsftem was straight, and bore on its
top, in the midst of a tuft of leaves, a quantity of
beautiful red flowers. I transplanted some of
these handsome shrubs to strengthen the fence of
my park, but was then far from imagining
wherein they would be so serviceable to me.
Hunger forced me to break off my work; I went
to the shore to look for oysters, and there found
Castor zealously occupied in scratching up
turtles' eggs, and no less so in eating them: I
joined him and carried away a good many, which

I prepared to cook; but, oh grief! I perceived
that I was about to use the last of ray tinder,
and that hereafter I should be obliged to make
shift without fire; I was truly afflicted, and
looked sorrowfully on my flints and steel, and
the impossibility of their being of any further use
distressed mc exceedingly. My repast was dull,
and my work during the remainder of the day
was influenced by the despondency into which I
was fallen: at night 1 prayed with a similar
languor, inquietude drove away sleep, and I
passed a great part of the night in distressing
reflections. What then, said I to myself, is the
life of man, since that of a child is mingled with
so many troubles? My mind then reverted to
my shipwreck, the desolate condition in which I
was left, and the small portion of strength and
of resources which I possessed, all which rendered
me extremely miserable. "If at least," said I
gighing deeply," I had but a hatchet, a saw, a
hammer, and some nails, I could with the help of
these tools perform many things which I have in
my mind, and which I cannot undertake with
my bare hands. If but one of my shipmates had
been saved as well as myself, what pleasure I
should have enjoyed in his company ! We should
have loved and consoled each other : but I have
not here a fellow creature to love me, and to

whom I can attach myself." These afflicting
thoughts were succeeded by others of a very
different kind. Ungrateful as thou art, cried I,
what is it thou darest complain of? Thou
murmurest against God because thou alone hast
been saved; is not that an act of his kind pro-
vidence, for which thou oughtest to return him
thy sincere thanks? What hadst thou done to
merit this special favour? Certainly nothing.
But why has God preserved thy life? It is, that
thou mayest amend it; that thou ma'yest repent of
thy faults, and submit to the labours and priva-
tions which thy situation requires of thee. Bow
then to His will, and think of all the favours " He
has bestowed on thee, to make thee grateful." I
reflected, that I might have landed on a country
infested with wild beasts, by whom I should
have been devoured ; or on a spot so barren that
I should have perished with famine ; and that I
was indebted to the fatherly care of my Creator,
for all the resources I had met with in my island.
I wa's so moved with these affecting thoughts, that
my tears of despair were changed into tears of
tenderness. My mind being relieved by these last
reflections, I was enabled before morning to
enjoy a few hours' sleep.
My enclosure was finished the next day, and
I resumed my intention of making a journey,

as I could be absent from my beloved animals
for some days without anxiety. Besides a store
of forage which I had provided them with, my
goat could browse on the shoots of the young
trees which surrounded her park, and when she
should have eaten those within the fence, those
on the outside would keep it sufficiently thick.
On this occasion, I only took with me some
oysters and acorns ; the potatoes were no longer
of use to me, and I left the care of my subsistence
to Providence. I and my dog set off before sun-
rise, and I pursued the same route as I had done
before. On arriving on the bank of the river,
and under the beautiful cocoa trees, I mounted
them with facility, and procured an excellent
breakfast . Following the course of the river,
and continuing my march towards the north,
I perceived at some distance a little grove which
appeared very inviting; but, in order to get to
it, I was forced to pass a large piece of ground
covered with rushes, which were lying down con-
fusedly in all directions, and impeded my walk-
ing very much. Castor went first and cleared
the way for me, I followed slowly. To support
me in this difficult march, I cut a large reed;
in leaning upon it? I found my hand moistened
with a glutinous juice which ran out of it, and
discovered with equal surprise and joy4that it
was sugar. I had learned on ship-board that it
was canes which produced it, and made no doubt
that I had found this valuable plant. I ate a
good quantity of it, and felt myself refreshed and
strengthened by this excellent juice. 1 cut a
dozen of these canes, and walking on with fresh
vigour gained the little wood, which was chiefly
composed of citron trees. "Bravo! Felix," cried
I; «< let us now have some lemonade, there is but
little trouble in making it; 1 will squeeze some
of the juice of the sugar canes into a cocoa-nut
cup, which, mixed with that of some citrons,
will afford me a drink both pleasant and whole-
some." The sun now shining with its full strength,
I laid down on the turf and slept soundly; on
waking, 1 found a pleasant cool air blowing,
which invited me to continue my journey. Be-
fore quitting the wood, I made a very agreeable
discovery, which was of some trees much re-
sembling our acacias; they bore beautiful flowers,
and were furnished with strong thorns, growing
by threes together; they were so sharp that they
might be made into a dangerous weapon. I saw
at the first view what use 1 might convert them
to: I thought that by drying them in the sun
they would hecome hard enough to supply the
place of nails: 1 cut a great number of them,
tied them together with string, and threw them
over my shoulder on a stick.
He finds Sugar-Canes and Strawberries. 63
On going out of the wood, I came to a field
covered with rice; the sight of this, at first, re-
joiced me much, but I soon recollected that the
being deprived of fire prevented me from deriving
any advantage from it: the only part which ap-
peared useful was the straw, which I did not
despair of being able to plait and make me a hat,
which I very much needed to defend me from the
heat of the sun. I soon after mounted on a little
rising ground, from whence 1 discovered another
part of the coast, of so different an aspect from
•what 1 had already seen, that I determined to
examine it more closely. Expecting to be able
to reach it on the next day, 1 descended into the
plain, and after having supped on acorns and
cocoa nuts, and drank a cup of lemonade, dis-
posed myself on a tree, to take my night's rest.
My travelling companion was less inconvenienced
than myself, in procuring food; he often found,
among the high grass, the nests of different birds,
whose young he snapped up greedily; he some-
times brought me a part of his prey, which only
served to renew my regret at being unable to
profit by it.
The nex,t day was a very fatiguing one, I
scarcely took time for rest, but gathered some
fresh sugar canes as 1 went along, and found a
place abounding with strawberries, which were a

great refreshment to me.. The sea breezes tem-
pered the heat: this fortunate circumstance en-
abled me to attain my object before night.
Being extremely fatigued, my only object, on
arriving, was to seek that repose I was so much
in want of.
I arose very early in the morning to make my
observations; the coast in this place was guarded
entirely by rocks of the most varied and singular
forms; the water came in at high tide, and af-
forded opportunity of taking a bath in the most
commodious manner possible; salt was there in
abundance; the sand was covered with shell-fish
of every species; among a great number of
oysters and muscles, 1 recognised scollops, of
which I should have made a good repast if I had
been able to cook them.
I visited the chain of rocks which lined the
shore, and discovered one which had an opening
like that of a cavern, but it was so completely
stopped up by a great number of thorny plants,
that it was impossible for me to penetrate into it:
my knife was not strong enough to cut these
thick brambles, and after having torn my hands
till they were covered with blood, I was con-
strained to give up the attempt. It was with the
greatest grief that now, for the first time since
my shipwreck, I began to consider that the fine

weather which I then enjoyed would not last for
ever, but that winter would succeed, and that my
pretty cottage, of which 1 had been so proud,
would not resist the heavy rains, and might be
blown down by a gust of wind . it was then of
consequence for me to contrive a shelter, more
secure, and fitter to resist the tempests; I could
think of no better plan than to inhabit the hollow
of some rock; and thought 1 had now found one,
which might serve me as a retreat, but insur-
mountable obstacles prevented my entrance. If
I had at least but a hatchet, said I, weeping
bitterly, I would cut all these briars, even should
it take me many hours to do it: if 1 had tinder,
I could set them on tire; it would only burn these
hateful plants, without consuming the stones;
but all these means I am deprived of, and am
fated to perish by cold, or by the rains. It
was not long before I repented of these fresh
murmurs. "My God !" cried I, "thou hast not
preserved me in shipwreck to abandon me in
distress : it is now a long time that I have been
supported here by the care of thy Providence. I
will still trust in it, and expect every thing from
thy goodness." Re-animated by this prayer, I
walked along the shore, eating now and then
oysters and muscles, when to my extreme sur-
prise, 1 discovered a large chest of very hard
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
wood, half buried in the sand; I concluded that
it must have come from some ship which had
been cast away upon the coast, and the hope of
finding in it something: which might be useful to
me, excited me to employ all my efforts to get it
open. It was necessary to take the opportunity
of low water, for at the flood, the chest was
covered with the sea, which was the cause of so
much sand being amassed round it; I cleared it
away with much trouble, and at length dis-
covered the lock, which was so strong that it was
impossible to break it. If I had been able to
cut the wood all round, I could have got it open;
but I tried in vain, and this fruitless attempt cost
me dear, for I broke my knife, which was a most
serious misfortune; 1 had now no longer the
means of opening the cocoa nuts, which were my
principal subsistence: 1 blamed myself for this
accident, because 1 ought to have reflected that,
even could I have succeeded in breaking the lock,
my strength would have been insufficient to lift
up the lid of the chest. So much ill success had
plunged me in grief. 1 the more regretted not
being able to establish myself in this part of the
island, as it was here that 1 should have found
the greatest number of resources united. Shell-
fish abounded on the coast, potatoes grew behind
the rocks; clumps of trees, scattered here and

there, offered me the nutritious cocoa, the
wholesome citron, the Indian fig, and many
other fruits whose names 1 was ignorant of, but
•whose flavour was delicious. Brooks flowed on
every side; willows and oziers grew on their
banks, wild goats came there in flocks to drink,
and I should have hoped to catch some of them;
but was forced to renounce all these advantages,
as I could not construct a dwelling more secure
than that which I already possessed: 1 therefore
resolved to return thither, hoping to divert my
grief by the sight of my property, and more
especially of my little flock. I did not easily
find my way back, or rather took another, and
much longer way; I passed several nights in the
open air, and did not arrive at home until the
fourteenth day after my departure. I found my
hut and my enclosure in very good order, and my
dear little animals in perfect health; the kids
were cropping the herbage, which decked the
park, and could already reach the branches of
the young trees. Seeing them in a condition to
provide for their own subsistence, 1 did not
hesitate to milk the goat, and filled one of my
cocoa-nut cups with her milk; I drank it with
delight, after having squeezed into it the juice of'
a sugar-cane. This beverage recruited my
strength, which my painful journey had ex-
G 2
hausted; and wishing to give up the rest of the
day to repose, I drove my goat and her young
ones out of the park, and tied the mother tp a
tree, by a long string, which allowed her to stray
to a certain distance. I might even have dis-
pensed with this precaution; she was become
quite tame, knew my voice, and would have
followed me like a dog; the kids skipped around
their mother, and I sat enjoying this interesting
sight. 1 then contemplated my cottage, which,
made a very charming appearance, especially in
the eyes of the architect; and the park, situated
in the front, added to the effect. The foliage of
the young trees was become very thick; the
bushy and thorny plants, with which I had filled
up the intervals, had climbed up the trunks of
the trees, and were covered with flowers of such
various colours that I seemed in the midst of a
parterre; I particularly noticed those which I
have before spoken of, and whose bright red
blossoms outshone all the rest. I took a branch
of this shrub, to examine it more closely, stripped
off the bark, and drew out a piece of dry, spongy
pith; without any motive, I stripped several
other branches, and made a little heap of this
pith, having no idea that it could be of any use
to me. The misfortune of being deprived of
fire recurred to my mind, and caused me many

sighs: I took my steel from my pocket, and with
my flint struck out sparks merely for amusement;
when, O joyful surprise! some of them fell upon
the pith of the red flowered plant, which quickly
kindled; and I saw myself provided with excel-
lent tinder, and in possession of a precious trea-
sure. The joy which seized my mind caused
nie to commit a thousand extravagancies. I
called Castor to me, kissed him, and hugged him
in my arms, as if to make him partake of my
pleasure; the good dog returned my endear-
ments, without comprehending the motive of
them. I ran and jumped about as if I had lost
my senses. When 1 became a little more
tranquil, I considered that it was God to whom
I owed the blessing, by which I was so overjoyed,
and returned him thanks from the very bottom of
my heart. Night being come, I drove my
animals back into the park, and retired with my
dog into my hut, where my excellent bed of dry
leaves yielded me sincere pleasure.

The next day, on waking, I found so many
things to do, that I was at a loss which to begin
with. After saying my prayers, I milked my
goat, and divided her milk with my trusty
Castor; then walked to the shore, to seek for
turtles' eggs. I had fared hut scantily a long
while, and was willing to make up for it.. I found
half a-dozen eggs, and there still remained some
potatoes in the hut; I lighted a good fire, and
roasted them; placed the eggs in the ashes, and
prepared myself a hearty dinner. My mind was,
however, less taken up with what I was then
engaged in, than with a design I had formed of
returning soon to the place where I wished to
establish my winter dwelling. By means of tire,
I hoped to effect an entrance into the cavern:
Felix commences a third Journey: 71
the chest I had found, also occupied much of
my thoughts; 1 racked my invention for some
method of opening it; endeavoured to guess
•what it might contain, but bewildered myself ill
my conjectures. If it should be clothes, said
I, they will come very opportunely, for soon,
mine will fall to rags; and should I be left
naked, the heat of the sun would be insupport-
able. If I should find in it fire arms and ammu-
nition, I could kill birds, and many of that kind
of hares which have already furnished me so many
good dishes of roast meat.
While my dinner was cooking, I employed
myself in putting the park in order. I set my
flock at liberty, to feed in its environs; they did.
not abuse this indulgence, but kept near my
dwelling. I removed the old litter, gave them
fresh, and made a new provision of forage, to last
during the absence which 1 meditated; in short,
took care to supply my animals with every thing
necessary.
I quitted my abode a third time, but without
much preparation for my subsistence. Pro-
vided with a flint and steel, and with a good
quantity of the precious pith which served me
For tinder, t was Secure from the want of food;
I walked on briskly, not being much loaded, and
the desire of arriving at my journey's end, lent
me wings. I found nothing fresh in a route t
had already travelled over; and besides, did not
bestow any time in making observations. On
the fourth day, I reached the desired spot; it
was yet so early, that I would not put oft' the
execution of my project. I made a fire, and put
some potatoes, which I had taken up by the way,
to roast; when the wood was well lighted, I
seized a naming brand, ran to the rock, and
thrust it among the roots and brambles which
stopped up the opening; the flame communi-
cated rapidly from one to the other, and produced
so thick a smoke that I could not distinguish the
cavern In less than an hour, the fire devoured
all that was on the outside, and from thence
gained the interior, where it consumed every
thing that could serve to feed it; after which it
appeared extinguished, the smoke began to clear
away by degrees, anil discovered to me an open-
ing, whose height did not much exceed my own,
but of (he width of an ordinary door. I was
about to enter with my usual thoughtlessness,
but new clouds of black noxious smoke burst
forth, and had nearly suffocated me. I got
away quickly, and sat myself down at some
distance, to consider what I had best do. It was
evident that the fire, which I thought extinct,
was still burning under the ashes, and that it

would perhaps remain stifling there for a long
while; I saw the necessity of checking my
impatience, and, in order to divert it, went to
the chest, the second object of my desires and
anxieties. It lay dry, the tide being down ; I
examined it afresh on all sides, and perceiving
still the same impossibility of either opening or
breaking it, I fell into a profound reverie. On a
sudden the thought struck me, that I would set
fire to it. I may hope to save some of the things
it contains, said I; when then the fire has con-
sumed one end, I will use all my efforts to put it
out; it cannot burn very rapidly, since the sea
covers it every day. When the fire is out, I can
take possession of what remains uninjuried)
whereas, if I do not adopt this plan, I shall never
benefit by what it contains. On this occasion, I
had not to reproach myself with acting too pre-
cipitately; it was after much reflection, that I
determined to make use of this expedient. I had
the patience to wait the return of the tide, con-
sidering that the sea in rising would reach the
chest, and assist me powerfully in putting out
the fire. The moment being arrived, I carried
several lighted branches, and placing them close
to the chest, watched, with a palpitating heart,
the fire, which, catching the wood, soon blackened,
and afterwards began to burn it. As I had

forseen, its progress was but slow ; I stood by,
observing it with a mixture of hope and fear j
at length, one end of it having been consumed
without producing a flame, I thought it time
to put a stop to the fire. Having nothing to
fetch water in but my cocoa-nut cups, this
method would have been too tedious; 1 there-
fore thought of taking wet sand to throw upon
the fire, and to make a heap before the place
where it was burning. In the mean time the sea
reached it, and at times the waves covered it
entirely; so that, by their help, I completely
extinguished the fire, which had effected an
opening large enough to admit me easily; but
this day was destined for the exercising of my
patience; i,t was necessary to wait for the ebbing
of the tide, and to remove the sand with which
I had stopped the hole, before I could ascertain
what were the fruits of my labours.
The being obliged to remain idle, reminded
me that I was hungry, which the continual
occupation of my mind had prevented my
thinking of. 1 went to take up my potatoes,
but, owing to the long time they had been left
in the ashes, and the too strong lire they had
been exposed to, they were burnt to cinders.
How was this to be remedied P I had learned
better than to shed useless tears whenever I was

•vexed; I therefore went to the shore, where the
sight of some scollops gave me much pleasure;
for a lung time I had been desirous of eaUng
some; I placed them on the hot ashes to make
them open, then cleaned them from the sand
which had got in ; and, after squeezing some
citron juice into the deepest shell, placed them,
on a slow fire, and when cooked they made me
an excellent dinner. After this repast, I took a
walk round the rocks, to collect some potatoes
for the following days: I could bring home but
a few at a time, having only iny two pockets and
my hankerchief to carry them in : I resolved,
therefore, to make a basket of oziers; having
seen a basket-maker in our neighbourhood at
his work, I flattered myself that I should be able
to imitate him, at least so far as to answer my
purpose.
I slept but little this night, so much was I
taken up with the important events of the pre-
ceding day. Will the cave in the rock be large
enough to serve me as an habitation? Will it
not be so dark, that I shall be unable'to do any
'thing within it? What shall I find in the chest?
Will not the water have spoiled whatever it
contains? Such were the questions I asked
myself, and which kept me a long time awake.
As soon as daylight appeared, I came down from
H
the tree where I had been perched ; and, after
addressing my prayers to God, I proceeded
immediately 10 the chest, and began removing
the^sand from the opening; my dog assisted me
in this work, by scratching it away with his
paws. This faithful animal had so much in-
stinct, that he comprehended whatever I wished
him to understand ; and so much docility, that
he obeyed the slightest sign.
As soon as it was practicable, 1 thrust my arm
into the chest, and drew out a little hatchet:
nothing could have been so acceptable, it more
than compensated for my broken knife; I might
now easily cut wood, and undertake many works.
I sought with fresh ardour, and my joy was
increased at finding a saw, two hammers, and a
bag of nails of different sizes. In drawing out
these precious articles, which was done with
some difficulty, 1 enlarged the opening very
much, and drew out of it more hatchets and
saws, both large and small; pincers, gimlets,
and a quantity of other tools, of which 1 neither
knew the name nor the use. Some were so large
and heavy, that 1 was forced to leave them where
they were. Some of the handles of the saws and
hatchets the fire had destroyed, but as many as
I had need of remained entire. Behind the large
articles which I could not remove, there were yet
Valuable Contents of the found Chest. 77
many other things, which I wished to get pos-
session of; but, having already several sorts of
instruments, I did not despair of being able to
break up the chest, and make myself master of
what remained in it.
A miser who has just found a treasure, is not
more enraptured than I was, in contemplating
my newly acquired riches. The chest had been
a carpenter's, which the waves had driven on the
shore of my island, and I met with it at a time
when it was the most necessary of any thing I
could have been provided with. I admired this
fresh instance of God's goodness, and returned
him thanks with tears of gratitude and joy. I
carried all that I had taken out of the chest near
to the cavern, hoping to be able to use them the
next day. Castor afforded me a pleasant sur-
prise, by bringing an agouti larger than any he
had before killed; I intended to make shoes, or
rather a kind of sandals, of his skin; my shoes
being so much worn, that my feet were torn by
the thorns, or cut by the flints. I skinned the
animal as neatly as I could, and nailed its skin
on the trunk of a tree, that it might not shrink.
I afterwards spitted the body, and it may be
imagined whether I and my companion did not
make a hearty meal. I saved the fat of the
agouti, and rubbed the skin over with it several
times, to soften and render it more pliant.
I went often to visit the opening of the rock;
there issued no more smoke, and I doubled not
that I should be able to enter the next day. At
day-break I armed myself with a hatchet, and
entered the cavern boldly, only taking the 'pre-
caution to send in my dog before, whose barking
would have given me notice had there been any
danger. We walked at first over a heap of
ashes, but they were cold, which proved that
the fire had been extinguished for some time.
I went first to the right hand wall of the grotto,
then to the left, to ascertain in some measure its
width. I counted twenty-two of my steps
between the two walls: my next care was to
find out its depth, in order to which I walked
straight forward; while near the mouth of the
cavern, I had sufficient light to direct me, but
as I went forward it diminished sensibly, and I
found myself at last in complete darkness. After
counting fifty steps, I was stopped by a wall of
rock, and knew that the grotto extended no
farther. It was very spacious, and well adapted
to serve me as a place of retreat; but what a
dismal habitation! where the day-light never
penetrated. How could I work in this dark
cell? Nevertheless, 1 wished to improve and
furnish it; my head was full of schemes, but
this terrible darkness prevented the execution of
*

them. I was not easily disheartened; but
resolved to inhabit for the present the entrance
of the cavern, which admitted a degree of light;
at least to pass the nights there, and to lay up
my tools and my provisions in it; and did not
despair of being able to invent some means of
introducing a little light into the interior.
During eight whole days I was engaged in
fruitless endeavours. I climbed on the outside
of the rock, and searched in every crevice; I put
in wedges, which I drove by striking them with
all my strength with a hammer; when I suc-
ceeded in splitting off a piece of stone, I expected
I was about to perforate a hole which would
admit the light . Always disappointed of my
hopes, faint with fatigue, and grieved at my
ill success, 1 was going to abandon my under-
taking, when I observed a hollow, in which a
tuft of plants had" grown, which appeared to
receive more nourishment than those which
sprang out of the rock. I concluded that there
was more earth in that place than elsewhere,
and that it would perhaps be easier to pierce
through. I quickly tore up all the plants, and
dug away the earth with shells, sharp stones, and
my hatchet, and met with no rock, which cir-
cumstance strengthened my hopes. I threw
aside the earth which 1 took out of the hole; but
H 2

I deemed myself still far from attaining my
object, when it broke through, and the shell
which I was using fell to the bottom of the
cavern. I was so transported with joy, that
I remained motionless: my zeal, however, was
soon re animated; I continued to scratch and
clear away the earth, and at length succeeded in
making a hole of about a foot square. Very-
well satisfied with my work, 1 thought about
taking rest, and strengthening myself by some
food ; but before preparing my repast, I wished
to go into my grotto; for when any important
work engaged my attention, eating and drinking
were but secondary considerations. I saw, with
very great pleasure, that the window 1 had
perforated let in sufficient light for distinguishing
objects. Castor appeared to partake of my joy,
and jumped round me, as if to congratulate me
on my success. •
I had reason to be satisfied with my new
dwelling; the floor of it was even, and covered
with a very fine, dry, white sand; the walls
were composed of glittering stones, and seemed
sprinkled with particles of gold and silver; the
roof, which in some places was very lofty,
became lower towards the farther-end, where the
width of the cave decreased very much, and
formed a sort of closet; this was the oniy part

which had no light. I intended to store my
provisions here, for I considered that, during
the winter, I should find neither fruits nor
potatoes, and that I should act prudently in
providing beforehand for it. I wished also to
lodge my goats in another part of the cavern,
during the severe season, to preserve them from
injury.
A thousand different thoughts occupied my
mind, which became completely confused. I
had so much work on my hands, that it seemed
impossible to get through it all. I should have
wished to do every thing at once, and the hasti-
ness of my disposition was such, that it needed
much reflection to make me determine on doing
one thing before I began another. Before com-
mencing my great works, 1 thought it right to
make a journey to my hut, and bring away the
flock, on whose account I was always anxious
when absent from them. I feared lest they
should be in want of food, and that as the kids
had quite given over sucking, the mother might
lose her milk, which would deprive me of one
great resource for the winter. Since I had intro-
duced the light into the grotto, I had removed
my bed farther from the opening, into a nook
in the rock which formed an alcove; this was a
fortunate circumstance, for during the night I
was awakened by loud claps of thunder. I sat
up, and admired the effects of the lightning
on my brilliant walls, which seemed to sparkle
with a thousand fires. The noise of the thunder,
repeated by the echoes of the rocks, was so
awfully grand, that 1 listened to it with delight.
The storm went off with so violent a rain, that
water which fell through the window, and entered
at the door, overflowed a great part of the
cavern, but did not reach my sleeping place.
This deluge lasted more than two hours, during
which I was forced to remain inactive in the same
place. At length the rain ceased, the sky became
clear, and the sand of the grotto absorded the
water which had entered. I then went out, and saw
with dismay the ravages the tempest had made;
many trees were blown down by the violence
of the wind, the country was inundated, and I
walked up to my knees in water. O ! how fortu-
nate 1 deemed myself in having a substantial
dwelling place, which would secure me against
these terrible storms; 1 immediately formed the
project of rendering it more close, by stopping
up the window on such occurrences as this.
I felt great anxiety respecting my hut of boughs,
mv park, and my flock, but I could not travel
that day; it was necessary to allow time for the
waters to subside. In the mean time, 1 went on
Further Treasures from the Chest. 83
the shore, where the raging of the waves had
driven so great a quantity of shell fish, that I soon
made an ample provision of them. I had emptied
one of the nail bags,, which 1 had found, into a
corner of the grotto, and it was now very useful
in conveying any thing 1 had occasion to remove;
I filled it with scollops, oysters, muscles, and
a kind of shells shaped like knives, which
were very sharp, and might supply the place of
the knife I had broken.
After having stowed all these in the cavern. I
went to visit the chest, and perceived, with much
pleasure, that during the preceding night, the
waves had battered it so much that the planks
began to part asunder. I took the largest axe
I was able to lift, and drove wedges between
them, by which I contrived to separate many of
them. What an increase of treasure! I now saw
the means of making a door to my grotto,
and a shutter to my window. In a short time,
all that remained in the chest was discovered to
view: among the articles too heavy for me to
remove, were three other bags of nails, an iron
crow, sundry joiner's tools, and by a most fortu-
nate chance, a little cast-iron pot with a cover.
This last prize made me leap for joy; I was now
enabled to make broth, and to boil my potatoes,
my fish, and my eggs. I employed myself this
day in transporting to my dwelling, with much
labour, iny new acquisitions. The planks I
drew up high on the beach, that the sea might
not wash them away, resolving to work on them
where they laid; the rest of the day was occupied
in arranging my effects, in such a manner, that I
could easily find whatever I wanted, without
throwing the others into confusion. A sound
sleep made amends for the restless night I had
passed, and I was the next day ready to proceed
on my journey. I took the shortest way, passing
through the rice fields; now that I possessed the
means of making a fire, this was an abundant
granary for me, which would insure me subsistence
during the inclement season : but it would be
needful for me to purchase this blessing by many
cares and fatigues ) the grain must be carried
home, beaten out of the straw, and laid in a heap
in the recess at the lower end of the cavern.
My heart sunk in approaching my former dwel-
ling place. Alas! I scarce knew it again; the
roof of rushes was entirely broken in, the walls
of boughs half thrown down; it no longer
afforded means of shelter. The park had suffered
less : the young trees which I had planted had
taken root, and shot out so many branches on all
sides, that they were interwoven, and mutually
supported each other; and besides, these being

pliable, by yielding and bending to the storm,
escaped being broken. My flock did not
appear to have suffered, but the goat was incom-
moded by her milk; the young ones scarcely
sucked at all, and the poor animal was greatly
relieved at being milked. I also received much
pleasure in drinking a cup of her milk ; this
refreshing beverage recruited my strength, after
my fatigues.
Having deliberated on the subject a long
while, 1 decided not to repair my hut at present,
but to go and inhabit my grotto until the winter,
which I expected would soon commence, should be
passed. 1 then proposed to retire to this place,
and to construct a new cottage, much more sub-
stantial than the former, which 1 could without
much difficulty effect, being now furnished with
tools. 1 could dig deeper, and drive my stakes so
that they should not be easily shaken. I wished
to make, in this gayer and more smiling spot, a
country house to pass the summer in; for which
purpose it would be necessary to bring hither a
part of my tools, and I already conceived in my
mind the method I would employ to accomplish
that object: at present my most urgent business
was, to conduct my flock to the grotto, and to
apply myself entirely to the works which 1 ought
to finish before the bad weather.

The third day after my arrival, I quitted this
place with my little caravan. 1 led the goat
with a string, the kids followed, and Castor
brought up the rear. When the little ones
strayed, he quickly. brought them back. I
stopped now and then, where the grass was the
thickest, to let my flock graze: in one of these
haits, my dog, who had wandered at some little
distance, began to bark and howl in an unusual
manner, as if he had been hurt or scared by some
ferocious animal: I was much alarmed, but
could not leave my faithful animal without
assistance: i had no other arms than a hatchet,
but 1 determined to make use of that to defend
my dear Castor: I advanced cautiously, looking
round me on all sides, and perceived him engaged
with an enemy whose appearance was more sin-
Castor's Battle with a Porcupine. 87
gular than terrifying;: it was an animal of the
size of a large cat, covered with spikes, which
struck out of his body like quills. Castor had
thought lit to attack him, as his bleeding muzzle
testified : on a sudden, the animal rolled himself
up like a ball, presenting to us his bristling darts,
with a rattling noise: I took my hatchet in both
hands, and levelled so violent a blow at him,
that the ground was sprinkled with his blood;
he gave such a terrible spring up, that I drew
back quickly, but returning to the attack,
repeated my blows till I killed him. I confess
that I felt very proud of this victory, the first I
had ever gained in my life, and much wished to
carry off the body of my enemy; but that was
not possible, as I knew not where to take hold of
him ; I therefore contented myself then with
cutting off with my hatchet, all the anjmal's
darts, which were so strong and sharp, that I
conceived, if I could contrive to pierce a hole
through the thickest end of them, they would
serve well for needles, to sew the skins of which I
intended to make my clothes. Those who shall
read this relation will, no doubt, be better
informed than I was then, and will discover from
the description I have tiiven, that this animal was
a porcupine.
This was the only remarkable circumstance in

I
my journey. I arrived safely at my dwelling,
established my flock in their new abode, and not
being inclined that day to set about any thing
fatiguing, employed myself in working up the
skin of the agouti, to defend my feet from the
wounds they had been exposed to since I had
been without shoes. I cut out the soles in the
best manner I was able, and afterwards made
some straps to fasten them on the feet and round
the legs: to join them together, it was necessary
to have needles, and I took the following method
to procure them. I made a pointed nail red hot
in a strong tire, laid hold on the head of it with
my handkerchief wetted, and bored a hole through
the thick end of the porcupine's quills; this
succeeding perfectly well, I had very good
needles, and was enabled to fix the straps of skin
firmly to the soles, so that I might now walk
without being hurt. The evening was occupied
in providing food for several days, that I might
work without interruption. I made use of my
pot to cook crabs, muscles, and other shell-fish,
waiting till the success of my dog in the chase
should furnish me with the means to make
broth.

height and length of the opening, and afterwards
sawed the top of the chest, which remained entire,
into the same dimensions. It may be imagined
that this took a considerable time; but when
this was done, I was not much the forwarder. It
required to be convoyed to the cavern; and,
though the distance was not very great, I could
not accomplish this, as 1 was scarcely able to
move it: thus I again suffered for my want of
foresight, and was forced to be content with
shutting up my grotto with a kind of hurdle,
formed of branches woven together. I succeeded
better with my window shutter, as it was much
less; I finished it in a few days, and placed it
near my window, to be used at night or during
the rains. My next care was my rice harvest
and my potatoes, and I now congratulated my-
self in having some good large bags: without the
assistance of these, how could I have carried
home my stores? In the space of fifteen days, I
had gathered in grain aud potatoes enough for
the consumption of such a lad as myself: the
whole was lodged in the driest part of my
dwelling, and I began to use rice milk, of which
I was very fond; at other times [ cooked the rice

relished with salt or citron juice, made a very
tolerable meal.
Hitherto, I had always made my fire in the
open air: but I considered that, in heavy rains,
I should never be able to light one, or that, if
lighted, it would be immediately put out. I saw
the necessity of constructing a fire-place within
the grotto; the great difficulty, however, was,
how to make a passage fur the smoke to go out,
that I might not be suffocated by it. I first
sought for some flat stones, and ranged them
one upon another, placing between them a layer
of an unctuous earth, which I thought likely
to serve as. cement. I built two walls, as
high as my waist, and laid a plank across the
top, plastered with the same kind of earth, to
prevent its catching fire. I had fixed this fire-
place near my window, and had the good luck to
find another opening in the rock, that had been
stopped only by earth and grass, which I re-
moved, and made a hole large enough to pass my
two hands through: I then sawed four very
narrow boards, and put them into the hole, fast-
ening them firmly with large nails; this formed
a kind of chimney, which conducted the' smoke
outside. It was impossible to be more pleased
than I was with this invention : I was willing to
make an immediate trial of it, by setting the

pot on my new fire-place. While my rice was
boiling, [ took a walk on the shore. I had often
seen on the brink of the sea enormous turtles,
which deposited their eggs in the sand, and pro-
vided me such excellent repasts; I should have
very well liked to catch some of them, for I had
learned from the sailors that they were very fine
food, and that they made good soup of them;
I knew also that, in order to prevent their run-
ning back to the sea, the turtles must be turned
on their backs, but all that I had hitherto seen
.were too large and heavy to admit of my doing
this. I now met with one that was much less,
and which I hoped to be able to manage. I
called Castor, that he might cut off her retreat,
and approaching cautiously, threw her dexte-
rously on her back; the turtle being unable
either to escape or to defend herself, was then in
my power. I killed her with my hatchet, and
on opening her, found twenty-two eggs; 1 after-
wards cut off a large piece, which I put into my
porridge pot; then returning to my prize,
and having cut it entirely to pieces without
breaking the upper shell, I found myself possessed
of a handsome trough, which I soon made use of
to a good purpose; the sight of so handy a vessel
gave me the idea of salting the turtle, to preserve
it. I recollected what I had seen my mother do,
12
when she was salting pork, and I acted in the
same manner. 1 carried my shell-trough into the
grotto, and likewise all the flesh of my turtle; I -
then placed a layer of salt, and one of meat alter-
nately, until the trough was full, then covered
the whole with salt the thickness of my finger,
and placed upon this some ends of boards, and
lastly some heavy stones to press it down; this
done, I returned to my cookery: I found it done
to a nicety, and had the pleasure of eating an
excellent rice soup; the turtle's flesh also was
much to my taste, and Castor regaled himself
with it as well as I.
The most urgent of my affairs seemed to be dis-
patched: I had provided for my winter's subsist-
ence, and had a commodious retreat to protect me
from the inclemency of the weather. 1 turned my
thoughts to what I should next employ myself
about . Since I have been here, said I to myself, I
have not had a moment of ennui; nevertheless, I
have not a single companion to speak to, or who can
speak to me; I have not a kite, nor playthings of
any kind : how happens it, then, that the days pass
away so quickly, and that I never find them
tiresome r Oh! I know why; it is because my
mind and my hands are always employed. But
in the bad weather, when the rains prevent my
going abroad, how shall I pass ray time? I have
no company, no books, nor means of writing? If
I am without occupation, I shall die of wearisome-
ness: it is only work that can preserve me: what
can 1 do better than prepare for it beforehand ? I
shall make some baskets, to hold my stores; and
will go and collect a quantity of oziers and young
branches of willow, which 1 will lay up in the
cavern. Oh ! if I could but kill some goats before
the winter, and prepare their skins, I could then
make clothes for myself. Well then, enough
said; this is what I must immediately make my
chief concern; if I succeed, the dismal wet days
will be passed in tailor's work, or in basket-
making.
This project was well conceived, but the execu-
tion of it was difficult. 1 saw no other way of taking
the goats, than by spreading a large net in the way
which they passed in going to drink. 1 intended
to watch them, accompanied by my dog; to come
suddenly upon them, and by my shouts, and the
barking of Castor, put them to flight, when I
hoped that some of them would fall into my nets,
where I could easily kill them. But the misfor-
tune was, that my string was used up; I tried to
make some with several fibrous plants, and that
which appeared fittest for the purpose was the
outer coat of the cocoa nut; I drew from thence
a kind of thread, with which 1 made small cords,
94
THfe FRENCH CABIN BOY;
by twisting them with a piece of wood cut into
the form of a spindle. I had often seen the
fishermen at work on their nets; I formed a mesh
and needle, and succeeded in making a large and
strong net. 'I then applied myself wholly to the
chase; I was so successful that I scarcely passed
a day without taking a goat or a kid: I killed the
old ones, stripped them, and put their skins to
dry; the young ones I added to my flock, which
now consisted, exclusive of my first goat, of nine
kids, male and female. I determined likewise to
make a quantity of nets of different sizes, some to
take birds and others to catch fish. 1 was very
well pleased with the precautions I had taken
against the necessity of remaining inactive. The
rains began with such violence, that for many days
it was impossible to go out of doors; how I con-
gratulated myself in being provided with employ-
ment! Exercise and labour had sonsiderably
increased my strength, and the habit of reflecting
on what was useful had enlarged my ideas, so that
both in body and mind I was much forwarder
than the generality of children. Necessity had
rendered me industrious, and above all, observant.
For example, when the bad weather began, my
first thought was, that I ought to calculate the
time of its continuance, in order to know how to
provide for the following years; for this purpose
How Felix calculated Time. 95
I took a large calabash, and every day put a stone
into it, intending to count them at the end of the
winter.
I began my works by that of making baskets,
which I wrought of all shapes and sizes. I must
confess their form was not very elegant, but they
were strong, and I found them very serviceable;
I wove two large strong ones to lay up my rice in,
where it was kept much cleaner than heaped in my
magazine^ Whenever there happened a day free
from rain, I took the advantage of it to go out
and collect grass, that my animals should not want
food. Castor also went out on those days, and
sometimes regaled me with game, at other times
potatoes, rice and goat's milk furnished my kitchen
abundantly; and if food had failed me, I could
have killed one of the kids; but these creatures,
which 1 had domesticated, which I had fed with so
much care, and which formed part of my family,
1 was become extremely fond of; and it would
have been only in the greatest extremity that I
could have prevailed on myself to kill them.
I did not, however, wish that my flock should in-
crease, and concluding that they would breed in
the spring, I had resolved to kill the young ones
as soon as they had left off sucking, which would
be a twofold advantage, in procuring me plenty
of milk, as well as providing me with skin for
making clothes. The turtle I had salted kept
very well; when I had consumed it, I watched an
opportunity of catching another, which I managed
in the same manner, and whose shell furnished me
with another trough, and the means of augment-
ing my salt provisions.
When I was well stocked with wicker work, I
drove large nails into the clefts of the rock, and
hung against the walls of the grotto, baskets
filled with all my provisions. I also secured my
nails and my small iron articles, in'the same
manner; my stores being arranged in such
good order, my dwelling was not encumbered
by them.
All that annoyed me was, the having so little
light; frequently the rain obliged me to keep my
window shutter close, I was then deprived of the
light from the window, and was forced to work
near the door; besides which, the days were short,
and it was necessary to leave off work early; 1 had
then no resource against ennui, or idleness; 1
became wretched, and all my thoughts were
melancholy. Seeing myself abundantly sup-
plied with the necessaries of life, I felt the more
poignant regret at not having a companion to
share them with me; the least amiable of all
my former comrades would have formed an
invaluable society for me, and his friendship
would have made the happiness of my life,
The moral Philosophy of Felix. 97
The caresses of my dog did not satisfy me.
I wanted a being who could partake of my
pains and my pleasures. These reflections made
• me shed bitter tears, which began as soon as it
•was dark, and I often passed several hours
in weeping before I went to bed.
One night, when I was overwhelmed with
grief, a very happy thought came into my mind,
which restored my courage, and enabled me to
overcome my sorrow. I spoke thus to myself:
Of what use are all the tears and afflictions
to which I give myself up? My useless regrets
.will not procure me what I want. If God has
decreed that I am to spend my life in complete
solitude, His will must be accomplished in spite
of my murmurs; it will therefore be much wiser
in me to submit with resignation, and to endea-
vour to render my situation as little wretched as
possible. One part of the day hangs heavily
on my hand, because I am in darkness, and
cannot employ myself; but there are two kinds
of employment, that of the body and that of the
mind. It is true 1 have neither books, nor pens,
nor paper, to occupy my mind, but I have
a memory; what then prevents my recalling all
that I have formerly learned, all I have read at
home or at school? Will not this be as well
as if I was listening to stories, or reading afresh?
I will also recollect all I have thought, and all
98
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
I have done since my abode in this island. How
do I know but that I may find something to
supply the place of paper? I will then write my
adventures, and I am sure they will be very
amusing. This idea occupied me the whole of
the eveuing; I dried up my tears, and went to
repose on my leafy couch with my heart more at
ease than usual.
My readers, if I have any, will perhaps be
surprised that a lad scarcely thirteen years old,
should be capable of reasoning thus; but I beg
them to observe, that from the situation in which
I was placed, all my thoughts were bent on what
was useful; and that not being diverted by the
plays common to those of my age, nor disturbed
by the frivolous talk of other children, I was
incessantly employed in reflection, so that the
instructions I had received from my good parents
and teachers, shot forth, if I may so say, in
solitude, like seed sown in a soil where it meets
with nothing to impede its growth.
I had calculated the time by moons. It was
the 21st of April when I suffered shipwreck. I
was then 12 years and a half old; I had counted
four moons from that time to the beginning of
the rainy season, which I judged to be the end of
the month of August: I have shown the method
I adopted to know exactly how long it continued,
and have not to reproach myself with having lost

a single day in my reckoning. My clothes being
quite worn out, I made others of goats' skins:
they consisted of a kind of coat, very wide, and
reaching to the knees; it was formed of two
pieces joined together by a coarse, seam, to ac-
complish which I had made use of my porcupine
needles, and some thread I had spun in the
manner I have related: this garment was fastened
round my waist, with a strap of the same skin.
I likewise made gaiters, to defend my legs from
the stings of insects, and several pair i of sandals,
for they lasted but a short time. My head also
needed protection from the sun beams, by which
I was often incommoded. I plaited some oziers
into the shape of a pointed cap, not much unlike
a bishop's mitre, and covered it with skin, the
hair outwards, like my garments. With these
equipments I might have been taken for a little
bear; be that as it may, 1 was very well pleased
with my performance, and the assurance it gave me
of being always clothed. The dark and rainy days
were passed in these employments, and the even-
ing in those by which 1 had contrived to banish
ennui or vacancy of thought . I had read the Bi-
ble, and the Evangelists over again during three
or four years; deeply impressed on my memory,
I took pleasure in recalling them, according to
the series of the events. I soon had in my mind a
K
connected history, commencing at the creation of
the world, and ending at the death of Jesus
Christ. How much did I desire to be able to
write! I should then have enriched it with the
little reflections which so fine a subject gave rise
to. After my sacred history, I set about digest-
ing my adventures; and it is owing to this that I
have been able to give an exact account of all
that befel me on my island. I could not look
back on the past without feeling penetrated by
the most tender gratitude towards the God of
Mercy, who had delivered me from death, and
heaped so many benefits on me; nor call to mind
my murmurings,'without experiencing the most
severe compunction : from that time I placed
the most entire confidence in Providence, and
my prayers were more fervent. I no longer
looked upon myself as an unhappy, unprotected
being, but as a child under the care of a father,
ready, in every danger, to shelter me in his arms.
Besides these consolatory thoughts, I had yet
the hopes that every succeeding year, by in-
creasing my strength, would augment the means
of battering my situation. The remainder of
the wet sea on was taken up in spinning a great
quantity of string of different sizes, and in making
a fishing net.
I had many subjects of astonishment, in not
feeling cold, in seeing neither ice nor snow; but

rains, which were almost incessant, and some-
times hail. I remarked with surprise, when the
weather permitted me to go out, that the trees in
this happy climate always retained their verdure.
At length ihe rains ceased, the sun shone with
full splendour, and I nattered myself that the
winter was past. This was a matter of extreme
rejoicing; I went again to view the charming
bowers of my island, to visit all my domains, to
renew my stores of provisions, and varv my diet.
I counted the stones which t had put day by day
into the vessel, and found a hundred and fifteen,
which amounted to nearlv four months; I
concluded, therefore, that this was about the
duration of every winter in this part of the world.
Having formed great plans for travelling, I
wished to be equipped accordingly. I . made
myself a girdle of skin, to carry a hatchet on one
side, and a small saw in the other. A strong
branch stripped of its leaves served me for a stick,
which I bore on my shoulder in the manner of a
gun. and on which I slung a basket, to carry any
thing I might find worth bringing home. I
likewise loaded myself with a sack, rolled it up,
and fastened it on my back. I then took the road
towards my country house, to drive my flock
thither, and establish them in their park. The
poor animals were very well pleased at having
their liberty, and at browsing the fresh herbage

of the field, and the young branches of the. shrubs;
they proceeded gaily, and Castor, overjoyed at
having a run with his master, made numberless
gambols, rolled himself on the turf, and over-
whelmed me with his caresses.
On my arrival, I could not find any vestige of
my hut, it was entirely destroyed, and the ruins of
it swept away by the rains. The park, on the
contrary, was in the most flourishing condition:
the hedge was so thick that I could scarcely thrust
my hand through it, and the young trees had shot
out so many branches on all sides, that the
opening I had left was quite overgrown. I lopped
away the branches, which stopped it up, with my
hatchet, and drove in my flock. My goat had been
without milk for some time. I foresaw no incon-
venience in leaving these creatures to themselves,
and thought there was no necessity for providing
them with forage,but to leave them at liberty to go
out of the park to seek their own subsistence, being
well assured that they would return every night, as
they could sleep there more commodiously. The
good condition of my plantation made me wish
to form a similar one near my grotto, and to
surround my habitation with a grove of choice
trees to adorn and enliven it. I postponed the
execution of this project till near the- winter,
thinking that the abundant rains would be
favourable to their growth.

I set out, with my heart full of the hopes of
making new discoveries in those parts of the island
which 1 had not yet visited; I took the southern
coast; asl could not walk on the beach,on account
of the masses of sharp rocks in many places, I
ascended the sloping shore, in order to descend
again a little further on, but on the summit I
found the trees so close together, and so entan-
gled with brambles, that it was impossible to
penetrate into the forest which ottered itself to
my view. I walked some time on the tops of
the rocks, having on one side of me the immense
ocean, and on the other this forest, which termi-
nated my prospect. Soon, however, the trees
became more widely separated, the coast less
elevated, and I could see for nearly a league in
front of me the shore which, like a beautiful
K 3

carpet of verdure, ornamented with bowers of
wood, extended itself on the southern side from
east to west . I hastened to descend into this
delightful natural meadow, where at every step
I was presented with agreeable shades, and where
I discovered new productions which I had not
perceived in the other portions of the Island I had
traversed. As my time was my own, and there
was nothing to call me back to my dwelling, where
1 had left every thing in good order, I deter-
mined to examine attentively all the trees and
plants around me, in order to derive some advan-
tage from them.
I nowinform my readers, that for the perspicuity
of my recital, I shall henceforward give to every
species the names which belong to them, and
which I have learned since I quitted the island.
I hitherto have described them by the analogies
they bore to the articles they furnished me with
for supplying my wants. I called the karatas
with the red flowers, the tinder tree, because its
pith served me instead of that article, and so like-
wise of others. .
The banana first attracted my attention by its
singularity. This tree, which appeared to have no
trunk, resembled a number of rolls of leaves set
one upon the other: its large green stalk was
three times my height, but was so soft that I cut

one of them down with a single blow of my hatchet,
and sat down to examine it at my ease. The
leaves of the banana are of an enormous size, it
bears a fruit pretty much like cucumbers. I
found them of a sourish taste, but very pleasant;
and could not help imagining they would be much
better if cooked. The hour arrived for dinner,
which was to consist of eggs, birds, and potatoes.
I dug a hole in the ground like a small fire place,
into which 1 put several of the bananas and made
my fire over them. This succeeded very well;
I found them excellent, and almost as nutritious
as bread. After this repast, 1 sought the thickest
shade to screen me from the excessive heat; this
relief was afforded me by some mangoes which
raised themselves into a vast number of inter-
woven bowers reaching to the extremity of the
shore, and even extending far into the sea, where
they formed verdant arches and canopies of the
most varied shapes. The mango tree, or wild fig,
grows on the sea shore and in marshy grounds;
its roots lift themselves out of the earth and
extend on all sides, sometimes becoming of an
immeasurable height. My observations however
were disturbed by a very diverting spectacle;
this was a fishing party, which was taking place
about a hundred paces from me. The fishers
were a group of large birds with flame-coloured
wings, called flamingoes ; they were drawn up in a
line along the shore, and looked like a regiment
of soldiers in red uniform ranged in battle array.
This was so novel a sight to me, that it excited
all my curiosity; I looked on these birds without
daring to move or make the least noise, lest I
should scare them away. I observed that some of
them were posted as sentinels for the security of
the whole troop. I hid myself among the foliage,
that 1 might not be perceived, and amused myself
some time in seeing them eat the little fishes, and
dive into the mud with their long beaks to find
the insects of which they are so fond. In spite
.of the pleasure which I had in looking at them, I
wished to derive some advantage from them. I
approached softly among the trees, and when I
was within reach of the group,threwa large stone
into the midst of them, with so true an aim that
one was knocked down and severely wounded.
The sentinels set up a piercing cry, and the whole
flock took to their wings. I seized on the
flamingo ; as he was as big as myself, I could
not carry him, but dragged him by a string
into a shade of the mangoes: he had lost so much
blood, that he had not strength to strike me with
his beak. I cut ntt'its head, and began to pluck
it, intending not to roast it till the next day. I
regailed Castor with the entrails, and when pro-

perly prepared hung it to the branches of the tree,
in which I purposed passing the night. The
coolness of the evening invited me to walk on the
sea shore; I there observed many small fishes,
.which, no doubt, were what drew thither the
fishing birds. I hastily made a line, and
fastened to the end of it some of the bowels of
the flamingo, and though I had no hook, suc-
ceeded in catching fish enough to make me a
supper; I broiled them on the ashes, and found
them excellent. I finished this interesting day by
prayer and thanksgiving to God, for these fresh
benefits bestowed on me, and went to repose
myself among the thick foliage of a mango tree.
The next morning I bent my steps towards a
beautiful wood of palm trees; my flamingo
incommoded me a great deal, being very heavy,
and I beipg already much loaded. I thought
of tying it on the back of Castor; and partly
by threats, and partly by coaxing, prevailed on
the good creature to carry this burden, which I
eased him of as soon as we reached the wood, where
I intended to pass the morning and prepare my
dinner; in this place I noticed the different kind of
palm-trees, each of which offered me some advan-
tage. Those which are named fan-palms are so
called because the leaves are placed I ike'a fan at
the extremity of the branches : they are very lofty,
but not of a corresponding thickness. I easily
cut down a young one; the trunk not being very-
woody, it contained a great quantity of pith,
resembling flax: a new material for me to make
cords and strings of. I collected a quantity, which
I laid to dry in the sun in order to fill my sack
with it.'
The cabbage-palm bears at the top, a bunch
of tender leaves which is called a cabbage. It is
excellent food, whose taste much resembles that
of an artichoke ; so great a value is set upon it,
that they cut down the tree in order to get at it:
my ignorance prevented my procuring any food
from it, but chance discovered to me that it
afforded a delicious beverage. Wishing to
ascertain the thickness of the bark, I made an
incision in 'the trunk, from which there soon
trickled a liquid, which 1 caught in a cup: it
was a sweet wine, very agreeable to the palate;
and remained good for three or four days, after
which it turned to vinegar.
I saw likewise the sago-palm tree ; had I pos-
sessed more experience, I might have procured
from its pith a succulent nutritious paste.
How I lamented my want of instruction, which
deprived me of the advantages so many different
productions would have afforded me, had {
known their properties!
He roasts the Flamingo. 109
The superb cocoa elevated itself in the midst
of all these trees, and attracted my unwearied
admiration: it seemed that this tree alone was
sufficient for all the principal wants of man:
every part of it is useful; its leaves, dried and
twisted together, form a good covering for huts $
like the palm tree, it supplies a pleasant liquid
by means of incision, and its young fruit 'pro-
duces a delicious milk; when ripe, it affords a
kernel white and firm as a nut, whose flavour it
somewhat resembles: its shell furnishes cups,
and its outer coat may be employed, as I used
it, for strings and cordage.
The time had passed very quickly in con-
templating so many wonderful things. It was
necessary to prepare the splendid repast, which,
on this day, I intended should not be deficient
in any thing, since excellent wine was to crown
the good cheer. The flamingo was carefully
roasted; it afforded much oily fat, which I
caught in a cocoa-nut cup; I had preserved in
my grotto that of all the animals I had eaten;
but an idea struck me at this moment, which
had not before entered my mind; I thought
this fat might be fit for burning, as well as that
of beef or mutton. "How happy should I be,"
cried I, " could I but have a lamp to afford me
light during the dismal winter evenings! And
why not 1 I have all that is necessary for it; a
scollop shell shall be my lamp; the thread of
the stockings I have unknit will serve for the
wicks, and the fat of my roast meats will furnish
oil." I leaped for joy at this invention, but a
kick which I gave the vessel overturned all the
fat of the flamingo; this did not grieve me
much, as I had sufficient to replace it. 1 recol-
lected the fable of the milk maid and the pot of
milk, which I had learned by heart, and its
resemblance to my own case made me laugh
heartily. In this gay humour 1 placed myself
at table, that is to say, I sat down on the fresh
turf. Leaves of the cocoa-tree served as a table-
cloth, on which I placed my roast fowl, accom-
panied, on one side, by a fine cocoa-nut, and,
on the other, by a pyramid of potatoes; two
cups of palm wine were at the two ends, so that
nothing was wanting to render the feast sump-
tuous. Castor, seated in front of me, waited
impatiently for his share of the game; like a
good master I helped him first, and we both
not only satisfied our hunger, but indulged our
appetites.
In the afternoon I mounted several trees to
seek for nests, and fotfhd those of pigeons and
doves; but my most valuable discovery was a
parroquet's nest; the young had been hatched

some days, and began to be fledged. I took
the one that appeared to be the strongest, wish-
ing to breed it up, under the pleasing idea of
teaching it to talk, and to hear once more some-
thing resembling human accents. I came down
carefully with my little prisoner; it was trem-
bling all over; I encouraged it by caresses,
warmed it in my bosom, and afterwards poured
some palm wine into its beak, and then placed
it in my basket on a little bed of leaves.
1 was sometimes fearful that I should forget
the French language, having no opportunity of
speaking it. Hoping that hereafter some persons
might land on my island, I wished to be able to
make myself understood. 1 always said my
prayers aloud; besides which, I took pleasure
in repeating, as I walked, all that I had learned
in my childhood, but the hope of talking with
my parroquet pleased me much, and I deter-
mined to take great pains with his education. I
could not bear the thoughts of forgetting what I
had learned, and found myself sufficiently un-
happy in not being able to learn any thing new.
I did not reflect that experience was my instruc-
tor, underwhom I every day acquired fresh know-
ledge, without being conscious of it. I wrote a
good hand, and was grieved at my not being able to
cultivate this talent 5 at last the idea occurred to
me of writing some of ray thoughts every evening-
on the sand with a small stick ; the characters
were effaced the next day, but I kept up, by
this method, the practice of writing.
After a journey of eight days, which presented
new objects to my curiosity, and enriched me,
with many useful acquisitions, I found myself,
undesignedly, in the way to my habitation,
which I arrived at on a different side from that
on which I set out. The chain of rocks in this
place wore the most picturesque aspect; they
reminded me of a beautiful green house; instead
of flower pots, the little terraces, the clefts, the
projections were covered with the choicest plants,
charming the eye by their variety, especially a lux-
uriant species of plants, with thick fleshy leaves,
and most of them bearing thorns. The karatas,
the aloe, the superb torch thistle, abounded
there, and the gloss plantain hung its numberless
interwoven tendrils over the face of the rocks.
Among these different productions 1 discovered
a fruit, whose delightful odour invited me to
taste it. Each plant bore but one, on the top of
its stalk, which was about two feet high, and of the
thickness of one's thumb. This fruit was shaped
like a pine apple, the outside was yellow ; nothing
had ever pleased me so much as the delightful
flavour of its white pulp, which left a charming

coolness in the mouth—it was the beautiful anana,
the most perfect fruit of the new world. I was
epicure enough to rejoice at finding this prize,
but yet sufficiently rational to prefer to it things
which were more necessary in my present situa-
tion. On arriving at my dwelling, where I found
every thing in perfect order, I experienced much
regret in not being able to bring home a thousand
articles which 1 had met with on my journey, and
of which I perceived all the utility. 1 had filled
my sack with the flax which the palm tree had
afforded me, and tied it on the back of Castor; for
myself, 1 was loaded with a bundle of sugar canes,
some cocoa nuts, and the basket in which I had
placed my dear little parroquet.
Oh! how I longed to have made a carriage,
had it been but a cart; but the axle-tree, and
above all, the wheels, surpassed the limits of my
skill, being entirely unacquainted with all that
belonged to the cartwright's trade. 1 would,
nevertheless, have willingly given my ananas,
my strawberries, nay, my sugar-canes themselves,
for even a wheel-barrow. After much consider-
ation, I could find no better expedient than
making a hurdle, on which I might load the
articles I wished to bring home. I foresaw that
I should have much trouble in getting it along,
as it would be without wheels, but flattered
myself, that by harnessing my dog to it,
and pushing it behind, I should contrive to
accomplish it. I would not delay the attempt:
I wove together some branches of withy, and
formed a hurdle about four feet long and three
wide, then sawed a board from the precious chest
into slips, which being nailed on the top, gave
it more strength and solidity. During the
intervals of my work 1 began to make use of my
fishing nets, and caught several fishes like
mullets, which, when broiled, had a very plea-
sant flavour. Soon after my hurdle was finished,
an opportunity of making use of it presented
itself. I killed a large turtle on the shore,
placed it on my hurdle, and endeavoured to
harness Castor to it, but it was not without much
trouble that I succeeded; he resisted stoutly, and
whenever I attempted to fasten him, he shook off
his bands and ran off to a distance. 1 was con-
strained to beat him, though very unwillingly, in
order to render him more tractable; at length he
thought fit to submit, and with our united
efforts, we succeeded in bringing our load to the
grotto. I was much pleased with my success, but
pitied my good comrade, whom the cords by
which he was fastened, had unavoidably hurt
.
To remedy this, I formed a plan of making him
something like the harness of a horse out of goat
His Garden and Orchard. 115
skins: the traces which I made for him to draw
by, were soft and pliant, and could not do him
any injury, so that he soon accustomed himself
to them.
Little excursions and useful works filled up
my time; 1 perceived with joy, that three of my
goats were with young, and gave me hopes of a
supply of milk, which I had long been deprived
of. My parroquet, which I had named Coco,
grew perceptibly, and already pronounced some
words: I fed him with fruit, bananas, and palm
wine. He was so tame that he accompanied me
in all my walks, perched on my shoulder, kissing
me from time to time. My stature and my
strength increased surprisingly; I carried
burdens which I could scarcely move the year
before, and was obliged to stoop to enter my
grotto, whose opening at first was as high as
myself: all this encouraged me to plan new
undertakings. I determined to make a garden
close to my dwelling, and to gather together
under my own eye, the trees, the plants, and the
roots, which were most necessary or most agree-
able. 1 first made an enclosure of young trees,
which I took up by the roots, and planted at a
small distance from each other; they consisted
of citron trees, acacias, elders, and many other
species. The space between them was filled up
L 2
with creeping plants, which the following year
would make an impenetrable hedge. I divided
this area into four little squares, in which I
cultivated separately, potatoes, strawberries, rice,
and all other productions which might be service-
able to me. This work was tedious and labo-
rious; it was necessary to make long journeys to
fetch those things which were at a distance from
my habitation, to bring them home by means of
my hurdle, afterwards to sow, plant, water, turn
the earth over and over again, which was done by
the aid of a large shell, to which I had contrived
to fix a handle of wood, so that my garden was
just laid out before the rainy season, which
obliged me the second time to shut myself up in
my dwelling.

My goats had yeaned, I resolved to bring up
the young ones, to kill the old males for the sake
of their skins, and to eat their flesh in the winter.
I was now proficient in the art of salting and
preparing meats to preserve them, and only
wanted more turtle shell vessels in order to lay
up ample stores, and make sure of good pottage
during the bad weather. I caught a great
number of little birds, by snares; half roasted
them, then arranged them regularly in a trough,
and covered them with melted fat, that the air
might not get to them to spoil them; by which
method I preserved some for nearly six months.
I was not so fortunate in my attempts to procure
a light . The goat's fat went out in my lamp,

and all my efforts to make it burn were ineffectual.
In the mean while the rainy season was advan-
cing, and it was not without much grief that I
reflected on passing a great part of the days in
melancholy darkness. This afflicting idea was
near depriving me of courage, and causing me to
let the rest of the fine weather glide away in
inaction; but soon reproaching myself for this
weakness, and submitting to the law of necessity,
I determined, before'winter, to make an excur-
sion to the shores of the great river, which I had
not visited this year.
I began my journey one morning, after har-
nessing Castor to the hurdle, which he drew
easily, as it was very little loaded. I walked
gravely on by the side of it, armed at all points,
with my parroquet on my shoulder, and con-
sidering myself as master and sovereign of all I
beheld; but I would readily have exchanged
my empire for the society of a human being, for
the pleasure of possessing a friend. I ascended a
hill, and discovered a large fertile delicious plain,
which seemed the abode of tranquillity; it was
covered with high and most beautifully verdant
herbage, decorated here and there with little
groves of*pal ms, and other trees unknown to me.
The river, like a large silver ribbon, crossed the
Valley, having its banks fringed with rushes and
A Thicket of handsome Bushes. 119
other aquatic plants. I made haste to descend
into it, and reach the first tuft of trees, where I
wished to rest myself a while. I noticed a species
of palm tree which I had not seen any where else;
it was infinitely less than the others, its stem be-
ing scarcely as high as a man, on which account
I named it the dwarf palm : its leaves were thorny,
and its fruit not larger than a pigeon's egg. 1
determined to pull up some of the youngest, to
strengthen my hedge with.
A pretty thicket of bushes, which I was unac-
quainted with, drew my attention; all the
branches were loaded with berries, of an uncom-
mon appearance: I gathered some of them; they
were covered with wax, which stuck to my
fingers ; I was struck with this singularity, which
induced the following train of thoughts. Is there
not some method to collect sufficient of this wax
to make tapers of? If I carry home a large
quantity of these berries, and boil them in water,
the wax without doubt will rise to the top, that
being the property of all greasy substances.
Could I once separate it from the fruit, I might
easily make tapers in the same manner they make
tallow candles in my country. Come ! here is
what will make it worth while to return directly
to my grotto; if I do not succeed, at least I shall
have no reason to reproach myself; without fur-

ther delay, I began my work. I spent the whole
day in gathering the berries, with which I filled a
sack and a large basket, and placed them on the
hurdle. It was very late when I had finished my
work, but a line moon-light favoured my return 5
the cool air of the evening diminished the fatigue,
both of myself and my fejlow labourer; he drew
courageously, and I helped him to the utmost of
my power by pushing behind. The chattering of
Coco amused me on the way; " courage! courage!
my little master," cried he, distinctly; "home!
home! give Coco some wine." Then he whistled
the air, "Vive Henri IV." which I had taken
pleasure in teaching him. On my arrival, I
stood in great need of my bed, and immediately
threw myself on it, after drinking a cup of cold
milk, and with no small impatience wished for
the arrival of the morrow: the sun, therefore, did
not find me sleeping. My first care was to light
a fire; I put the berries into my pot, let them
boil gently, and while they were boiling prepared
some wicks. When I perceived a fine oily sub-
stance, of a clear green colour and agreeable
smell, rise to the top of the pot, I skimmed it off
with a deep shell, and put it in one of my turtle
shell vessels. When the fat was all taken off, it
produced a great quantity of melted wax. I
then dipped the wicks one after the other into it,

and afterwards hung them on the branches;
when the wax was settled round them and cooled,
I dipped them again, and repeated it till my
tapers appeared large enough; and lastly, placed
them in the coolest part of the grotto, to harden
perfectly before using them. However, it may
be easily imagined, that I much wished to try
them that very evening; I did so, and. was very
well satisfied; my tapers afforded a pleasant light,
which, being reflected by the brilliant walls of the
grotto, enlightened the whole interior, and en-
abled me to work as well as in day light. O!
how fortunate I deemed myself in possessing so
invaluable an advantage. My heart was filled
with affection and gratitude, for this fresh instance
of the goodness of Providence; and this sentiment
was awakened every time I lighted one of my
tapers. I did not regret the trouble it cost me
to procure a large quantity of them. I made five
or six trips to the little wood of palm trees, and
brought berries enough from thence to make
nearly a hundred tapers.
I saw the arrival of winter, without the least
uneasiness; it was passed, as the former one, in
different works, in making garments, and im-
proving the fashion of them. I increased my
wardrobe by a good cloak, to protect me when I
should be overtaken by a storm, which not
unfrequently took plaCe. I spun a great quan-
tity of string and small cords, which were very
serviceable to me. These works being accom-
plished, I undertook the making a bow. My
island produced a flexible sort of wood, very fit
for my purpose; after many ineffectual efforts, I
succeeded, by means of perseverance, in making
a bow which I could bend easily; the arrows cost
me much more time ; I made the points at first
with fish bones, but what answered best were the
thorns of that acacia tree I have before mentioned;
they suited my purpose perfectly; lastly, I
formed a case of skin, intended for carrying my
arrows in the manner of a quiver. I purposed
exercising myself in archery as soon as the fine
weather would permit me to go abroad. If the
powers of my body were inactive, those of my
mind were not idle ; they increased daily by reflec-
tion and study. This last term may surprise my
readers. Indeed ! they will cry; what can one
study without masters and without books? But,
it was Nature that I studied; that is a book
always open to those who wish to read it. I
carefully examined all the productions of my
island, sought to draw from them some advantage,
classed them in my head in such order as prevent-
ed my confounding them, though so numerous
and varied. In contemplating the wonders of
Felix's Love to his kind Mother.
12S
creatipn, my soul was lifted up towards the
Author of them; I admired his. infinite wisdom,
his boundless goodness to the beings he has
formed, and my mind and heart were filled with
veneration and gratitude.
My reflections, however, were sometimes
painful; the more I advanced in age, and the
more my reason strengthened, the more 1 re-
proached myself for my misconduct towards my
mother, and the disconsolate situation in which I
had. left her. I witnessed the tenderness of
mothers for their young, in the different kinds of
animals which surrounded me: they reminded me
of the affectionate cares of which I had been the
object, and which I had repaid only by ingrati-
tude. "O my God!"%:ried i, in the agony of
my grief, "if Thou hast ordained that 1 am to
pass my life in this solitude, I ought to submit
to it as the punishment I have deserved ; but if,
after some years of suffering, thou vouchsafest
to pardon me, ah! restore me to my mother,that
all my most earnest cares may be employed in
making amends for my past misconduct,in honour-
ing, cherishing, and assisting her who gave me life,
who instructed me to know and to love Thee.."
A torrent of tears accompanied this prayer, after
the offering up of which, 1 felt hope rekindle ia
my afflicted heart.
The rains had continued a fortnight longer
than in the preceding year; but not being now
in darkness, this time had appeared shorter
to me. Notwitstanding, I saw with much
pleasure the return of the fine weather. The
improvement which had taken place in my plan-
tation, during the four months and a half of
winter, gave me much satisfaction. The trees
had grown considerably, the climbing plants
had reached the tops of them,and the whole being
entwined together defended my garden as securely
as a stone wall. All that I had sown and planted
was prospering ; the rice was beautiful, the straw-
berries in full bloom like Hakes of snow, the
sugar canes improved wonderfully ; all was lively
and flourishing in this cKarming enclosure. A
multitude of birds, drawn thither by the coolness
of the place, and the abundance of food which
they found, were seeking among the trees for
convenient places to form their nests; this
feathered host devoured a part of my grain and
my fruits, but I foresaw that they would make
me amends in more ways than one. Their eggs
would supply me with my favourite dish, and by
means of my bow and arrows I expected to dimi-
nish their number sufficiently to prevent their
doing much mischief to my harvest, and that
they would furnish my kitchen with some

delicate roasts. Under this impression, it may
be imagined that I did not neglect to practise
with my bow, in order to shoot true. At first,
I set up a mark, and did not give over until I had
hit it; when I found myself more expert, I tried
my skill on birds, and at length became so adroit,
that I seldom missed the object I aimed at. I
found, in this exercise, not only the means of
adding to my cheer, but very great amusement.
I should have reproached myself for killing these
innocent creatures, if necessity had not obliged
me ; but, had I not destroyed a great portion of
them, they would have spared me the trouble of
getting in my grain and my fruits, and would
not have left me sufficient to have lived oil
during winter.
Being provided with the necessaries of life, I
next turned my attention to procuring some of
its conveniencies. I had used all the boards of
the chest, so that I could not make any thing of
wood; 1 nevertheless wished for a bedstead
covered with skins, to defend me from the damp,
a table, a chair, or a bench to sit at my ease. I
performed all these in basket work, at which, by
dint of practice, I was become very dexterous.
To form my bedstead, I drove four stakes, of
about a foot high, firmly into the ground, and
nailed upon them a hurdle of twisted oziers, which

I covered with three or four goat's skins; this
made a very tolerable bed. The table was of
exactly the same workmanship as the bedstead,
but the former was square, and the latter longer
than it was wide. I cannot boast much of the ele-
gance of these performances, but I looked only to
their utility, and they answered my purpose. I
was entirely baffled in my attempts to make a
chair, therefore was forced to put up with a bench,
and even to renderthatfirm,l found it necessary to
fix it to the ground, in front of my table; so that
not being able to make a portable one, I was
obliged to make three others, which were set up
in different parts ofthe grotto.

If my readers have observed my manner of
livipg, and my different occupations, they must
have remarked that they were much more mul-
tiplied at the approach of winter. My harvest
was to be got in, my salt meats to be prepared,
materials for work to be collected, provision of
dry wood to be made, gras^,to be dried, and laid
up for the subsistence of my flock. It was at the
beginning of the fine weather that I enjoyed the
greatest liberty, and this was the time I chose for
making these grand tours. It must be granted
that I was possessed with a mania for travelling;
I had nearly every thing I could desire, but had

not the good sense to be contented with them; I
was always wishing to discover new regions, and
to enrich my domains. Why should man, who
has few real wants, be so insatiable in his desires,
and so often destroy his happiness by endeavour-
ing to increase it? Youth as I was, I partook of
this folly of the human mind. I had already
traversed a great part of the coasts of my island,
but was little acquainted with the interior, which
I had the most ardent wish to penetrate into,
under the persuasion that 1 should find there i
many things worthy of my curiosity, and adapted
for the augmenting my riches. As I intended
this only as a journey of observation, I would
not incommode myself with the hurdle, which
would have retarded my march, and have fatigued
both myself and my dog. Castor was only
loaded with two sacks rolled up, and my cloak.
I armed myself with a hatchet and a saw, with
my bow and arrows. I carried likewise a kind of
pouch, which I had lately made. Having no
fear of robbers, 1 left the door of my grotto open,
that my goats might go out to pasture in the fields,
being assured that they would, of their own
accord, return to their shelter in the evening.
My garden was completely enclosed, so that
these animals could not get in, to do any
mischief.
The Battle of Felix with Apes.
129
At length I set off, my heart full of gaiety and
hope. Castor, who partook of my wandering
disposition, ran gaily before me, and Coco
chattered incessantly in my ears. After crossing
the great plain, as far as the river which divides
it through its whole length, I pursued my course
along the shore, till I came to a place where it
was so shallow, that I was able to ford it, the
water not reaching above my middle. I then
advanced into a country decorated here and
there with citron trees in full bloom, that exhaled
an odour that perfumed the air. At the extre-
mity of a level and very wide tract of land, I
perceived a thick forest, towards which I directed
my steps: trees of a fresh species had great
attractions for me, having often experienced how
many useful things they afforded; I arrived at a
time when the great heat made its salutary shade
very desirable. I made my repast of potatoes
and some roasted birds, which I had brought
with me; and after some hours repose, plunged
into the forest . I was very thirsty, not having
found any water since 1 passed the river. Seeing
a clump of cocoa trees, I prepared to climb up
one of them to gather some nuts, in order to
drink the milk, but was as much surprised as
terrified, at seeing a number of them falh
which appeared to be thrown from the tops of the
trees, and aimed at me. I had much trouble to
protect myself, as well as Castor, who began barkings
with all his force. I endeavoured in vain to disco-
ver the hidden enemy by whom I was so suddenly
attacked. I saw the leaves agitated, but they
were so thick that they prevented my discovering
what occasioned it. At last I perceived an ape
leaping from one tree to another; he then came
down the trunk, and squatted himself at the foot
of it, making horrible grimaces. Castor seeing
the mischievous beast within his reach, sprang
upon him and strangled him in the twinkling of
an eye. Immediately a dozen of these animals
descended from the cocoa trees, uttering shrill
cries, and advancing upon us in a menacing way.
I cheered my companion to attack them, and in
order to second him, I bent my bow, and shot
with so true an aim that I wounded one;
seeingt however, that they were surrounding my
dog, and that he had much trouble in defending
himself, I fell upon them with my hatchet and
killed several. The rest, terrified,took to flight,
redoubling their cries, and left us masters of the
field, and of the arms of the vanquished, that is
to say, of about twenty cocoa nuts, which they
had hurled at us.
This rencontre with the apes surprised me much,
as during my two years residence on the island I

had only seen goats and agoutis. I imagined
that the forest might serve as a retreat for other
animals more dangerous; in order, therefore, to
keep them away, I lighted a large fire at the
approach of night. After supping upon cocoa
nuts, I mounted an oak, and disposed myself to
take my rest. I placed my parroquet on a
branch, and slept soundly, but was awakened by
the noise of thunder, and-by flashes of lightning,
which rent the clouds. Every thing foretold a
violent storm : if a heavy rain, should fall I had
no shelter but the foliage of a tree, which would
very soon be penetrated. I wrapped myself up,
in the best manner I was able, in my cloak, and
placed Coco in my bosom, where he was strangely
agitated and dreadfully frjghtened at the tempest.
, In this situation I waited for the inundation I
expected; but a furious wind arose suddenly
and drove away the clouds. I knew not whether
to rejoice at this circumstance or not; all the
trees of the forest were shattered, and that which
served me for an asylum, suffered many terrible
shocks. To increase my terrors, my ears were
assailed by a most strange and incessant noise,
the cause of which I could not divine; it was
redoubled at every gust of wind, and I think that
the boldest man would not have heard it without
emotion. My parroquet cried out and fluttered
against my bosom; Castor, at the foot of the
tree, howled piteously, and their master, clinging
to the strongest branches, waited trembling, to
know what Heaven should ordain to be his fate.
How long did this night appear to me! particu-
larly on account of this insupportable noise,
which stunned and petrified me with fear. At
length the day appeared : as soon as any objects
were discernible, 1 looked around on all sides,
and saw at a distance from me a group of trees
resembling walnut trees; their tops bore a
quantity of long pods of a dark brown colour,
and of so hard a texture that striking against
each other by the force of the wind, they produced
the dreadful din which had so terrified me.
Naturally bold, I was ashamed of the fear that
had possessed me, and became convinced that
thinss which alarm us when we are ignorant of
the cause, are most frequently free from danger.
I was curious to examine, more closely, these
noisy fruits. The wind beginning to grow
calmer. I climbed up one of those trees, and
pulled off some of the pods. I soon recognized
them to be the cassia, and recollected that I had
often eaten of it in my childhood; the shell,
which is long and as hard as iron, is divided into
little cells, inclosing a kind of black sweetmeat,
and a kernel which is the seed of the tree. I

resolved, for the future, not to be more afraid of
noi3e than of darkness, neither of which have
any thing in themselves to frighten one.
My two travelling companions indemnified
themselves for the fatigues of the night, Castor
in devouring the body of one of the apes we had
killed, the parroquet in nibbling the kernel of a
cocoa nut. For myself, I desired nothing so
much as to find water; I walked more than two
hours without meeting with any; but the land
suddenly becoming shelving, renewed my hopes:
I descended into a charming valley, whose
verdure was so fresh and cool that it plainly
indicated the vicinity of some spring, and very
soon a sound, the most delightful, struck my ear;
it was that of a cascade, which fell from a rock
about fifteen feet high into a natural basin, and
divided itself into almost imperceptible streams
of water.
After having satisfied my thirst, I turned my
thoughts to the recruiting my stock of provisions,
I killed many birds, they were so numerous that
I had plenty of sport; I likewise found many
bananas, which I cooked for my dinner, and eat
on the brink of the basin, which was the most
enchanting spot 1 had ever seen. The forest
was there much thinner, but .the basin was
environed by it on all sides, and this magnificent,

verdant saloon seemed a retreat shut out from the
rest of the world by an impenetrable barrier of
trees, which the least ray of the sun could not
penetrate; so that, notwithstanding the agree-
able ness of the place, I could not avoid some
uneasiness respecting the difficulty of getting
out of this forest, whose limits my eye could not
reach. Too much precaution, however, is not
the characteristic of the youth ; this idea was,
therefore, soon banished by others, and the great
heat of the day being past, I continued my
journey cheerfully. I proceeded for four days
without meeting any, new objects worthy my
attention; but, on the fifth, I found myself
under some prodigiously large trees, which were
entirely unknown to me. There ran from them
a great quantity of gum, I tasted some and found
it delicious; then casting my eyes to the top of
the trees, I was seized with astonishment at
perceiving a kind, of cottage, covered with a roof,
and which appeared very spacious. Was this
the work of men? Is it inhabited? Ought 1 to
venture to mount to it? After asking myself
these questions, I remained undecided, not being
able to guess what kind of creature could have
chosen such an habitation. Curiosity got the
better of the undefined fear which restrained me;
but the trunk of the tree was so lofty and so

slippery, that I slid down again several times. I
disencumbered myself of every thing that might
impede me, reserving only my hatchet to defend
myself in case of attack, and after incredible
exertions, gained the top of the tree. The
aerial edifice was deserted, and partly destroyed
by time; large holes in the roof permitted my
seeing the interior; it consisted of a suite of
nests, placed at two inches apart in two rows;
there were several entrances, each one of which
formed a street. These buildings were com-
posed of grass skilfully arranged, and the roof
covered it in such a manner that no animal
could penetrate it: some broken egg shells
proved it to be the work of a species of birds,
living in a society like bees. To give my readers
an opportunity of consulting the dictionaries of
natural history, respecting this singular pheno-
menon, 1 shall inform them that I have since
learned the tree i had ascended was the mimosa,
and the bird which constructed these curious
nests was called the losia. This extraordinary
spectacle awakened in me melancholy reflections.
"Happy birds !" cried I; " how much reason
have I to envy your lot; you live and die in the
midst of your families, surrounded by your own
species; with their assistance you execute the
most difficult works; whilst I, alone in a desert,
N
abandoned to my own exertions, without parents,
without friends, shall live in wretched solitude,
and die without exciting any regret. But,
added I, what can have destroyed your abode,
inoffensive creatures? You are, no doubt, sorrow-
ing on account of your dispersion, or have
perished the victims of your enemies. Ah
why cannot I re-assemble you in your peaceful
dwelling, and render you that happiness, which,
alas! I am deprived of myself." I came down,
oppressed by deep melancholy, which was some-
what diverted by the endearments of Castor and
those of my parroquet. "Where have you been,
Felix?" said the latter: "Give Coco some
wine; kiss Coco."
I began to be weary of wandering in this
forest, and wished to behold the sea once more,
and to revisit my habitation, but the farther I
advanced the more obstacles I met with: the
aspect of the place was entirely changed, and
presented to me nothing agreeable. Instead of
those beautiful trees loaded with fruit, which
furnished both sustenance and refreshment, I saw
only firs and other barren trees, which were in-
tertwined and surrounded by so great a quantity
of bind-weed, brambles, briars, and all sorts of
prickly planks, that it was only by the help of.
my hatchet that I could open myself a passage.
Felix is entangled in a Forest. 137
I was often in want of food, the birds resorted
but little to these sterile regions, where I some-
. times journeyed a whole day without finding a
cup of water. No more citrons, no more cocoa-
nuts, no more sweet acorns; nothing but hard,
bitter roots, which extreme hunger drove me to
eat, and which caused cholics and frequently
vomitings. The desire and hope of finding an
outlet, and of quitting a place which appeared to
me like a vast prison, supported my courage;
notwithstanding, my situation became every day
more and more distressing; I was arrived at a
spot so choaked up with thickets that it would
have required a company of pioneers to force a
passage. My hatchet, quite blunted, was but
of little service to me, my legs were bleeding
from the thorns, and my sandals, worn out by
walking on the stones, no longer protected my
feet from injury. So many cruel circumstances
overcame my resolution; I sunk on the ground,
and shed a torrent of tears. How much I la-
mented my imprudence, in straying so far from
my dwelling place, in losing sight of the sea
coasts, and in having entangled myself in this
gloomy forest. How much I regretted the being
deprived of the conveniencies of my cheerful
home. In the midst of my tears and sobs, I
lifted up my hands towards Heaven,and fervently
prayed that God would either put an end to my
sufferings, by a speedy death, or afford me the
means of deliverance from this dismal place.
My prayer was doubtless accepted by Him, who
never abandons his creatures; I had an immedi-
ate proof of His protecting providence: Castor,
who, famishing with hunger, was roaming every
where for food, came dragging an animal which
I was unacquainted with, and of which he had
already eaten off the head, and laid it at my feet.
I snatched it from him, and skinning it instantly,
made a fire with branches, which, though dry
and resinous, yet kindled too slowly to suit my
impatience. The animal was broiled, and I ate
a part of it before it was nearly cooked: some-
what refreshed by this food, 1 returned thanks to
God, and began to reflect more tranquilly on my
situation. Seeing the impossibility of penetrating
farther, I prepared to return back again, but this
was no easy task; the routes, crossing and inter-
secting each other, could not be recognised: I
was always getting into fresh tracks, and was un-
able to find that by which I had entered; in vain
I sought for the cascade and the beautiful valley
which had charirted me so much; 1 could find no
trace of it, and all my efforts only served to be-
wilder me the more. To complete my misfor-
tunes, the weather became stormy; the rain fell

in torrents, and hail succeeded; I had no other
shelter than the trees, whose foliage, being soon
surcharged with water, poured it on me with still
greater violence. In this extremity, when I was
just sinking under all these discouragements, the
barking of Castor drew me towards a rock, where
I discovered a very low opening. In my present
situation, nothing could fright me. I crept with
difficulty into it, and found it a deep cavern,
where a few rays of light penetrated from above.
After walking some time, I came to a tolerably
large chamber, in the centre of which was a kind
of open bier, formed of sticks laid across each
other, and supported on props about the height
of a man; I climbed up to examine the bier; it
was filled with human bones, nearly reduced to
dust, two skulls only remained entire; at the
foot of these relics, were a bow and arrows, a
sabre of extremely hard wood, and several empty
calabashes. I remained motionless with aston-
ishment, unable to conceive how the remains of
human bodies should be found in this place; af-
ter thinking a long time on the subject, 1 was
persuaded that the island had been formerly peo-
pled, that the islanders had chosen this cavern
for the burial place of their dead, perhaps of
their kings; that some calamity had either de-
stroyed, or forced them to quit the island, and

that, a great number of years ago. This place,
frightful as it was, appeared an asylum afforded
me by the goodness of the Almighty; circum-
stanced as I was, to find a shelter from the
inclemency of the weather, was a great happiness.
I had often heard my parents speak of the respect
that was due to the dead: necessity obliged me
to take possession of the resting place of these,
but I wished previously to prepare them another j
I was not so silly as to fear the deceased, and
felt no reluctance in removing these bones into
a grave I had dug for them at some distance. I
wrapped them in my goat skin cloak, and covered
them again with earth. Returning into the
cavern, I set about cleaning it, and made a fire to
purify the air. The bow which I had found on
the tomb was stronger and better made than my
own, the sabre was as sharp as if the blade had
been made of steel, but they were both too heavy
for me to use. I resolved to keep them till the
increase of my strength should enable me to
make use of them.
The following night I had the pleasure of
sleeping on a good bed of moss; it was near
three months that my wandering life had
deprived me of that enjoyment; nevertheless my
mind was too agitated to allow me to sleep
much. Am I destined, said I to myself, to

remain shut up in this dreary place? Should
winter overtake me here, I must expect to perish
with want, since in this season I can scarcely find
wherewith to support me; how will it be, when
the violent rains hinder my going abroad? I
must not then be disheartened, but exert myself
to get out of this forest, and regain my habita-
tion; neither trouble nor fatigue ought to stop
me, since my life depends on it.
As soon as day-light appeared, I bent my
thoughts on what might facilitate my march.
I used the skin of the animal that Castor had
killed, to make me some new sandals, and doubled
it, that it might last the longer. Then slinging
the sabre and the bow and arrows of the savages
at my back, I departed, determined to overcome
every difficulty, in order to recover my liberty.

I quitted the melancholy "dark cavern of the
dead without any regret, the only benefit it had
afforded me was shelter from the torrents of rain;
all my wishes were directed towards my dear
grotto, my garden, and my flock. Since having
lost myself in this forest, I had scarcely been
able to calculate my time ; but I imagined, and
with reason, that I had not more than sufficient
remaining for the purposes of getting in my
harvest, and making provision for the winter.
^Filled with tkese thoughts, I advanced coura-
geously, cutting and hewing down all that
opposed my passage. The murmuring sound
of water inspired me with hope, I heard it some

time before I could obtain a sight of it, at length
I discovered a brook, the way along its bank
appeared the least difficult. I reasoned thus
with myself:—This brook has its rise in some
mountain, which if I trace it upwaids, I shall
necessarily arrive at; should it be within the
forest itself, I will mount to its summit, and from
the tops of the loftiest trees I shall meet with
there, shall be able to discover the surrounding
places, and the way I ought to take ; it is even
possible, that this rivulet may conduct me out of
this forest. 0 my God! direct my steps,
abandon not thy child in this great extremity.
Much perseverance was needful in pursuing this
project; I travelled four days without finding
any thing to justify my hopes, living on roots,
or rather starving with hunger. My poor
Castor, as well as myself, was enfeebled by want,
and I was near losing my parroquet; fortu-
nately he found, on the bushes, a little fruit,
resembling black currants, on which he fed,
though their acidity prevented my eating them.
On the fifth day the forest became a little
lighter, the trees, less closely planted, permitted
my seeing some distance before me; I again
found some of the kinds of trees I was acquainted
with. I saw some oaks, the sweet acorns of
which afforded me a tolerable meal: at length
my friendly brook conducted me to the limits of
the. forest, when casting my eyes around, I beheld
with surprise and extacy the same mountain I
had formerly climbed, and which I perfectly
recognised. 1 fell on my knees, and thanked
God for my deliverance: a man shut up in a
dungeon, waiting the execution of the sentence
of death, could not be more transported with joy
at being set free, than 1 was in this happy
moment. I forgot all my past troubles, and
felt only the present pleasure. The mountain
on this side presented a very different aspect; a
kind of pathway afforded much facility in the
ascent, but fatigue obliged me to wait till the
next day, before attempting it. Some potatoes,
which I had the good fortune to find, recruited
a little my exhausted strength, and I passed the
night on a tree at the foot of the mountain.
Before noon, the next day, I had attained the
wished-for summit. With what transports did
I discover all the spots I had so often traversed,
but chiefly the way which led to my beloved
dwelling-place! I noticed the side I should
descend by, in order to gain it the soonest. My
sensations were very different from those I had
experienced on this same mountain, a little time
after my shipwreck : it was then that 1 learned
the certainty of my being the only creature

of my species who inhabited this island;
and shed many bitter tears at this my
wretched, desolate condition. Now, accustomed
to solitude and resigned to my lot, 1 felt nothing
but joy at being free, and at returning to take
possession of all my riches.
After some hours rest, 1 descended into the
valley, and took the road towards my habitation.
Every relief I stood in need of presented itself
by the way, but the desire of arriving at my
journey's end scarcely permitted my availing
myself of them. I sucked a citron, or eat some
bananas, without stopping; and passed under
cocoa trees, without being tempted to mount
them, and gather their fruits. In spite of my
impatience, darkness overtook me at a good
distance from my dwelling, and I was obliged
once more to pass the night in the open air.
At length I approached the end of my journey,
and at perceiving the trees of my enclosure, tears
of joy rolled down my cheeks; before entering
my grotto, I prostrated myself, and kissed the
earth I was so happy to see again. I heard the
bleating of my goats, and, running to them,
caressed the dear animals, resolving never again
to wander away from them. My flock was
increased by four kids, that their mothers were
sucking; this circumstance promised me abund-

ance of milk, and allowed me to kill some of the
old ones for winter stores. I stood in great need
of wholesome nourishing food, having fallen away
excessively, and my strength being very much
enfeebled. Dedicating the remainder of the day to
rest, my only care was to milk my goats; a dish
of rice milk appeared to me a most delicious
treat, after the long fast I had been constrained
to keep.
Ah! how pleasant home is. The most mise-
rable retreat has always some charms for its
possessor; mine was the work of my own hands;
I owed to my own labour and industry all the
conveniencies of it, on which account it was
doubly dear to me; I looked upon the day on
which I returned to it, after having despaired of
seeing it again, as one of the most happy of my
life.
I was overburdened with business in preparing
my resources for the winter season, but my first
concern was the restoration of my exhausted
strength. I killed three male and two female
goats, some parts of which furnished me with
good broth, and I set about salting the rest.
My poor companion, who, like the dog of La
Fontaine, was nothing but skin and bone, soon
recovered his flesh by this nutritious food, and
the traces of our fatigues wore off by degrees.
Felix makes himself new Clothes. 147
I had but very little rice to get in; the birds had
enjoyed themselves during my absence,as nobody
was near to put a stop to their pillage. I killed
some of them, which were so well fattened at my
expense, that they were a delicious treat. My
crop of potatoes was very good, and made amends
for the loss of my rice. After providing for my
subsistence, my next care was to procure tapers:
I went to collect the micara berries, and after
some days labour, was secured against the danger
of wanting light. I prepared also my goats'
skins, with the intention of making new clothes,
my wanderings in ihe forest having worn out my
old ones: I meditated also the improving of the
fashion of them, and succeeded so well, that when
they were finished, 1 no longer deigned to look at
those 1 had first made, and was quite proud of
my new apparel.
Winter passed away like the foregoing, but
my reflections were more serious; I was now
near sixteen years old, and began to think about
the future. I thought, for the first time, that a
chance similar to that which had thrown me on
this desert coast, might bring there another
vessel, and that it was possible I might one day
return amongst mankind. My eyes were moist-
ed with tears at this affecting idea. To return
to my mother was the first desire of my heart,
O
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
to live in the society of my fellow-creatures was
the second. Oh! if Providence should graut
me this blessing, how was 1 resolved to render
myself thankful for it! To love and assist my
brethren should be the employment of my whole
life.
My imagination wandered a long time on this
subject, but the little probability of any change
in my lot, forced itself on my mind, and over-
whelmed me with grief. Ah! how miserable I
am, cried I one day; at this instant, I recol-
lected the dark forest, and represented to myself
what would have been my situation, had I been
obliged to pass the winter there, with no other
shelter than a frightful cavern, deprived of light,
and without doubt perishing with hunger. Then,
casting my eyes around me, I contemplated
my spacious, convenient abode, furnished with
every thing necessary for me: my dog, which was
lying at my feet, soothed me by his endearments,
and my parroquet, .placed on my table, amused
me with his chattering; the bleating of my goats
admonished me that it was time to relieve them
of their burden of milk, and that they were about
to afford me a delicious repast. I then felt most
sensibly how much I was indebted to the God of
goodness, who had bestowed all these benefits on
me. I returned him thanks from the bottom of
The Sabre and the Bow of Felix. 149
my heart, and surrendered myself entirely to his
disposal.
In order to prevent the return of these fits of
melancholy, with which 1 reproached myself as
offensive to the Almighty, I made a resolution
to turn my thoughts on myself, and to seek a°ain
in the stores of my memory for the employment
of my mind,'which could not remain inactive; I
succeeded in my endeavours sufficiently to regain
my cheerfulness: a certain inward satisfaction
was the reward of this effort.
The third winter I had passed in my grotto
was just completed: the heat of the sun re-ani-
mated all nature: the trees were' covered" with
flowers. The carols of the birds celebrated the
return of the fine weather, and the solitary inhab-
itant of the cavern went forth to enjoy the pleas-
ures it promised him. As soon as I had an op-
portunity of going out, I was convinced of the
astonishing increase of my bodily powers. The
bow and the sabre, which I had found in the sep-
ulchre of the savages, were no longer too heavy
for my sinewy arms. I bent the bow, and the
arrow 1 let fly was lost in the clouds. My
stature was tall, my limbs muscular, and few
youths at eighteen were as well formed as I was
at sixteen. In walking on the sea shore 1 found
a turtle; instead of cutting it up on the spot, as I
was accustomed to do, I placed it on my should-
ers and carried it into my grotto.
I was not of a disposition to neglect these fresh
advantages; the strength which I derived from
labour and activity afforded me the means of un-
dertaking more difficult enterprises. I could now
make use of the tools, which three years ago I was
unable even to lift. I began by widening my
cavern where I found it too narrow, and enlarged
it by adding a kind of magazine to secure my
provisions; the place formerly appropriated to that
purpose was transformed into a large hall, in
which I contrived two windows, so that it was
the best illuminated of all my apartments. I
also extended my enclosure, and collected in my
garden all the useful plants which were to be
found in the different quarters of the island; ex-
perience had taught me to improve the soil by
culture. The fruits acquired a more delicious
flavour, and the roots became more savoury.
Having accomplished these works, I amused
myself by fresh excursions, but took good care
never to lose sight of the sea coast, and only to
visit those places in the interior with which I was
well acquainted. Curiosity to see new objects
yielded to prudence, and to the bitter recol-
lection of the dark forest

shore towards the north, when the most unex-
pected sight caused me to stop short, and excited
an extreme agitation: several canoes passed be-
fore my eyes not far from the land. They were
very small, and each manned by two or three
people of a copper colour, and nearly naked.
They exhibited strong symptoms of fear, and
rowed with all their might to get away, as if pur-
sued: the dread of being discovered caused me
to conceal myself behind a bush. This precau-
tion was quite needless; for the poor creatures
thought only of escaping the danger which threat-
ened them. The first canoes got off to a good
distance, and I was some time before I saw any
more; at length I perceived three others, two of
them flew rapidly over the waves; the third im-
pelled, without doubt, by weaker arms, was much
behind. I then discovered two enormous fishes,
or rather sea monsters, which were pursuing ihese
miserable beings; they overtook the last canoe
in which there were but two persons, overturned
it, and seizing each one his prey, disappeared
with them.
Struck with horror and pity, I remained mo- <
tionless; a cold sweat bedewed my forehead; all
my limbs were agitated with convulsive motions,
and I fell to the earth in a state of indescribable
agony.
03
When I recovered ray Senses, i arose, and
.walking towards the sea shore, saw the overturned
canoe floating at the mercy of the waves; but
another object soon fixed my attention; the ris-
ing tide brought it towards the beach, and not
being able to conjecture what it could be, I felt
the most ardent desire to inform myself. I drew
near: ray heart, which beat violently, seemed to
announce some happy event. I seized a long
pole, and catching hold of the object of my wish-
es, drew it carefully to land. It was a basket
of such fine close texture, that the water could
not penetrate it. An infant, beautiful as the day,
was sleeping tranquilly in it; its complexion was
tawny, and it appeared to be about a year old.
My extreme surprise may be conceived, but it is
impossible to give an idea of the excess of my joy.
I fell on my knees to thank Heaven for a gift so
precious. "Blessed be thou, O gracious Being!"
cried I, "do thou make me thankful for this fresh
instance of thy goodness bestowed on me. I will
teach this child to know and love thee; as soon
as his lips are capable of articulating any thing,
he shall join his prayers to those which I offer
up to thee."
I returned to my child: the little innocent
opened its eyes and smiled on me. I bestowed
thousands of kisses on it: it soon began to cry:
Felix finds a beautiful Infant. 153
I supposed it was hungry or thirsty. I was in
no want of nurses, but was at a distance from
home, and it would take me an hour to reach it.
Having brought some palm wine in a calabash,
1 appeased the infant by making him drink a few
drops: he soon fell asleep, when, placing the
basket on my shoulders, I took the way to my
grotto. My heart danced with joy; my mind
was filled with a thousand projects, all of them
having reference to the child: and my ideas were
iu such a state of confusion, that I could not
possibly reduce them to any order.
On my arrival, I selected one of the finest of my
milch goats, and placed the little boy near her.
He greedily seized the conduit of milk; while he
was sucking, I caressed the docile animal, who so
readily performed the service required. The
goat very soon became attached to her nursling,
and came regularly to look for him at the times
she was accustomed to give him suck.
When I had provided for the wants of my
child, I gave myself up to reflection; and felt the
necessity of calming and collecting my scattered
thoughts. I made the following soliloquy:
"Here is a companion sent me by Heaven: 1 will
nourish, take care of, and instruct this dear little
one; he will be bound to me by the ties of
friendship and gratitude; I shall hear his sweet

voice answering mine: I will love him, and he
will love me; this is a happiness which I should
not have dared to hope for : I shall no longer work
for myself alone, and my labours will become an
hundred times more interesting. I must have a
convenient cradle for my dear Tommy, that is
the name I shall give him; I have a sufficient
quantity of willow and ozier to weave one, and
to-morrow I will set about it.
1 passed a most agreeable evening; the infant
placed on my knee, was playing with the
curls of iny hair. 1 called Castor, in order that
he might become acquainted with him: at first he
shewed some sign's of jealousy, but by dividing
my caresses, I succeeded in making him lick the
hands and face of the little one. As for Coco, he
appeared charmed with the increase of the family,
and babbled enough to stun us. 1 confess that the
words he pronounced no longer gave me the same
pleasure; I longed for that of hearing Tommy
speak, and felt that one word from his mouth
would afford me more pleasure than all the
chattering of my parroquet.

It may be well imagined, that my first
thoughts on waking were directed towards my
little boy; his sleep was peaceful, and a smile
was on his lips. Amiable child, said I, looking
tenderly on him; if Providence had not sent me
to thy succour, thou wouldst have been buried
in the abyss of the waters, or have become food
for the voracious monsters which have devoured
thy parents. Poor infant! thou art now an
orphan, thou hast no other protector than a boy,
who is himself but very young. I feel, notwith-
standing, all the importance of the duties which
God has imposed on me by throwing thee on my
care; 1 will supplicate Him to assist me in per-
forming them: it is His will that I should act
the part of a father before I am old enough to be
so in reality; he who gives me the inclinations
will also bestow the abilities.
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
How fervent were my prayers on that day 1 it
was not for myself alone that I implored the
assistance of Heaven. The little boy awoke ; on
his crying, the goat ran to him, and when he had
satisfied the cravings of nature, I gave my atten-
tion to those cares which cleanliness and the health
of the child required. I plunged him in pure
water, which I had the day before exposed to the
heat of the sun; a turtle's shell formed his bath.
I had made several mats which I used for various
purposes, one of these I spread on the ground and
placed Tommy on it, where he began rolling
about and exercising his growing strength; he
endeavoured to get up, hut soon fell down again,
all his motions appeared peculiarly graceful, and
I beheld him with delight. Castor came to
partake of his play, and to render the spectacle
more interesting ; the good natured animal seemed
fearful of hurting his little comrade, and his
tender precautions removed all my uneasiness on
the subject. In the mean while I worked
at the child's cradle, on which I bestowed more
pains than on all my other performances. When
it was finished, I lined it with skins, and then
put a mattrass of dry moss within it. It was
placed near my own bed, and the child found
himself so comfortable in it that he slept soundly.
'Seeing him so strong, I imagined that he had

need of more solid food than goat's milk. I had
often seen the women in my own country make
pap; nothing could be more easy for me, since I
had milk and rice. I determined, therefore, to
reserve all I had remaining, for the child, and to
deprive myself of it till the next harvest.
Being obliged to wage continual war with the
robbers of my-property, I lived almost entirely
on small birds' that I killed with my arrows, or
caught in my snares ; 1 embraced every oppor-
tunity of the child's being asleep, to pursue the
chace, and on my return I brought him fruits:
he already began to know me, and stretched out
his little arms towards me as soon as I entered the
grotto, I sptfke to him very frequently, though
I knew he could not understand me; yet I
considered, that in order to teach him to speak,
it was needful to pronounce to him often the same
words. Coco had very soon learned his name,
and called "Tommy" from morning to night.
Every day when the heat was passed, I took my
little boy in my arms, and walked on the shore.
I then sat down on a part of the rock, and
invented some games to amuse my dear little
child and to make him laugh, which always gave
me fresh delight.
For some time, intoxicated with my happiness,
all my ideas were concentrated in this object of
THE TRENCH CABIN BOY.
my tender affection and sweetest hopes. I lived
only for the present and future: the past seemed
effaced from my memory. One evening, how-
ever, as I was contemplating the sea, then smooth
as glass, I called to mind the appearance of the
canoes full of savages, and endeavoured to
account for it. For nearly four years that I had
been on the island, this was the first time of my
seeing any. I concluded that it was unknown
to them, and that chance, or some circumstance
which I could not form any idea of, had brought
them to that coast. I knew from the narrations of
the sailors, that there were some savage nations
who were not strangers to humanity ; who practised
the rites of hospitality, and who pitied and
relieved the distressed; but I remembered
likewise that there existed others, characterized
by the most ferocious barbarity, and who
put to death in the most cruel manner the
unfortunate wretches who fall into their hands.
I shuddered in thinking that those i had seen
were perhaps of this latter description, that they
might have noticed my island, and might, at
some future time, make a descent on it: Should
they attempt, thought I, to take from me my
child, even though I might escape myself, could
I live happy if deprived of him r This fear made
such an impression on my mind, that 1 was

tempted to abandon my dwelling, and to remove
inland ; but an open country did not appear to
me a retreat sufficiently secure for the conceal-
ment of my treasure: the dark forest was the
only asylum into which I was cer tain the savages
would not penetrate. The caverti of the dead
no longer appeared so frightful, since it might
conceal my child from all their researches. But
how should I provide for him there, when I
myself was near starving with hunger? This idea
and many others, diverted me from my extrava-
gant project; 1 would not deprive my dear
Tommy of the beautiesof nature, to shut him up
in a dark prison, but committed him, as well as
myself, to the protection of the Almighty, re-
solving to enjoy his blessings without tormenting
mvself about future and imaginary evils.
The fine weather passed away very agreeably:
Hitherto my hands had been employed, and my
mind had not been idle, but my heart wanted
some object to which it might attacli itself, and
which might participate the sentiments it inspired.
I had now found it, and enjoyed, in anticipation,
the friendship which my dear Tommy would
have for me; wholly engrossed by him, 1 had a
right to look for that return of affection which
would constitute my happiness- This amiable
child improved visibly. In our walks, when I

had placed him on the soft turf, he no longer
contented himself with rolling on it, but endea-
voured to get up and stand on his legs. I called
him, and his tottering steps were directed towards
me; he often fell, but as his falls could not be
dangerous, he saw that I laughed, and he laughed
likewise.
I had not given up my excursions, from which
I always brought home something useful for my
housekeeping; I recommenced these as soon as
the child was able to do without his nurse. He
eat potatoes, bananas, and all the fruits which the
island produced ; birds' eggs also agreed very
well with him: I was sure of finding all these
resources in the places I should pass through.
Before setting out, I placed my child in the
basket, the only inheritance he derived from his
parents, and loaded with this agreeable burden,
walked on cautiously,not to disturb his slumbers.
When I rested for the night, during my journey,
I chose out the tree in which 1 meant to sleep, and
hung the basket to a strong branch, and a cord,
passed round my arm, supported it likewise.
My labours were no way impeded by my
pleasing solicitude for the child; if I was forced
to quit him for a moment, I entrusted him to
the care of my faithful Castor, who appeared
quite proud of his charge, and acquitted himself

to perfection. He not only watched over him
to secure him from danger, but amused him, and
submitted, with the utmost good humour, to all
his little fancies, so that my sowings, my saltings,
my manufacture of tapers, were all finished in
proper time. My garden had become a delight-
ful spot; every year I beautified it by additional
plants and shrubs. I trimmed them around to
form them into bowers and verdant retreats,
which afforded us cool shades during the most
ardent heats of the day.
The rains, at length, obliged me to shut
myself up in the grotto: new pleasures awaited
me there. Tommy began to stammer some
words; the name of "Papa" already struck my
ear, and made my heart palpitate with joy.
This was, in my opinion, the time to form a plan
of education; all my thoughts were directed to
this point. I now regretted most sensibly
having so little profited by that which I had my-
self received. I felt my insufficiency, and the
slender means I had of instructing my pupil;
but if 1 could give him only a small portion of
knowledge, I resolved to form his mind to virtue,
and to inspire him with love and respect for
the Deity, humanity towards every creature,
courage in danger, resignation in distress, and
moderation in success. I had acquired these

qualities in the school of misfortune, and desired
that my child should possess them without their
costing him so dear.
Tommy was always in good humour; I pre-
vented all his wants, but granted nothing to his
caprices. If he asked by expressive gestures for
any thing which I ought to refuse him, an
unwholesome fruit for example, or a tool by
which he might be hurt, his cries or tears would
not obtain it for him; convinced of their unutility,
he only shed them when he was in pain ; I then
sought for their cause with tender solicitude, and
either succeeded in relieving or in diverting thera.
Fearing that the cold of the cavern might be
injurious to the child, I made him some little
clothes, but had some trouble in reconciling him
to the use of them. He disliked any thing that
confined his movements, which were always very
active: notwithstanding, as he grew, decency
required that he should be clothed. I made him
therefore a wide kind of tunic, which reached to
the knees, and accustomed him to wear it. I did
not think it necessary to make him shoes,
considering that, being habituated from his
early infancy to go barefooted, his feet would
become hardened, like those of the little
peasants in my country, who ran about on the
stones without being hurt by them. Having

often regretted not being; brought up in this
manner myself, I determined that Tommy
should have the advantage of being so. In the
mean time, his improvement was rapid; he
began to walk steadily, and pronounced a great
many words distinctly : but what gave me more
pleasure, was, that he evinced a good temper and
much affection. He divided with Castor
whatever 1 gave him ; he distinguished among the
goats her who had nursed him, and bestowed on
her abundance of caresses; but I was the object
of his most tender attachment; he was never so
happy as with me, and as soon as I called him,
he quitted every amusement to run into my
arms. He already shewed those imitative pro-
pensities so peculiar to children. If I was
weaving rushes or oziers, he would seize some
twigs and endeavour to do the like; if I was
pulling up weeds in the garden, he would still
imitate me. Observing this, 1 was convinced
how carefully those who have the bringing up of
young persons, ought to watch over their actions;
that they should not, in any thing, set a danger-
ous example. It is more from the conduct
of the master that the child forms his own,
than from the precepts he receives, which lat-
ter produces no fruit if unsupported by
example. As soon as 1 perceived the child

could unite any ideas, 1 accustomed him to lift
his little hands towards heaven, and to pronounce
reverently the name of God. This mechanical
homage disposed him afterwards to render to the
Supreme, a worship more worthy of Him. I
waited impatiently for the moment when I could
instruct him in his duty towards Him. I said
my prayers in his presence devoutly, and in
the most respectful posture: he will one day,
thought I, ask me the reason, then will be the
time to give him the first notions of the worship
which man ought to render to the Being who
formed him.
I continually recalled to my mind the Old and
New Testament, which I intended as the founda-
tion of the instruction I should give to him.
How much I rejoiced in reflecting that I might
be instrumental in rescuing from the darkness
of idolatry, this poor child, who, had not
accident thrown him into my hands, would have
been brought up by heathen parents, and might
never had known the true God.
At the return of spring, Tommy might be
eighteen or nineteen months old; he was much
stronger than children of that age usually are;
he ran alone and spoke distinctly; the fine
weather contributed much to strengthen him. I

reader me many little services; he was never
more pleased than when he thought I had need
of him, and already shewed a pleasure in being
useful. Between Castor anil him there existed
the most perfect friendship. I wished to take
advantage of this, and induce the kind animal to
carry the child on his back when we made long
journeys. I formed a kind of pannel with skins,
and strapped it on the dog; I added a back to it,
in order to support the little boy, and some rests
for his feet. Before venturing upon an excur-
sion with this equipage, I made several trials of
the invention; but the easy pace of Castor, who
walked with the greatest precaution, as if con-
scious of the charge confided to him, and the
boldness of Tommy, who enjoyed much this
manner of travelling, put my mind at ease, and
determined me to set out, accompanied by all my
household, to visit the banks of the great river.
I relieved my dog, when I saw him fatigued, by
taking the child in my ;irms ; our inarch was ex-
ceedingly slow, but I had nothing to hurry me
in the least, my time being entirely my own.

The two following years were remarkable only

wanted but a short time of my having been six
years on the island; my little boy was four years
old: his forward intellect and lively curiosity
assisted me much in the work of his education.
His most usual question was, "Papa, who made
that?" I generally answered, " It was God," or
sometimes, "It was I." One day, as he was
looking at the rising sun, he said to me, <* You,
who make so many things, make me another
sun. "And why?" replied I, smiling at this
request. "To light Tommy when the sun shall
be hid down there." "But, my little friend, I
cannot make a sun; it is only God who is power-
ful enough to do that." "You have told me that
it is also the good God who made you; you thank

him and pray to him every day; do the sun
and the moon pray to him likewise?" "All
creatures praise him after their own manner, but
chiefly in performing his will. He has com-
manded the sun to light the earth during the
day, and you see that it obeys him." "And we,
Papa, what does God require that we should do?"
** He ordains that we should love him with our
whole heart, and that we should love each other
likewise." "Oh, how easy it is to obey the
good God in doing that."
These simple questions of my dear child
affected me even to tears ; it was only the remem-
brance of my mother that prevented my being
perfectly happy ; without that, I should neither
"have regretted the world, nor have desired to quit
my solitude.
One beautiful evening, as I was enjoying its
charms at a little distance 'from my grotto,
the sky became suddenly quite overcast with
black sulphurous clouds, the sea began to
swell and foam, the sound of thunder was heard
at a distance, and every thing portended a violent
tempest. I snatched up Tommy in my arms,
and running as fast as my strength would permit,
regained my retreat. I shut up my doors and my
windows closely, and lighted some tapers.
Scarcely had 1 taken these precautions, when I

heard torrents of rain falling, the noise of which,
mingled with that of the raging winds and the
roaring of the thunder, seemed to threaten the
destruction of ray island. I was accustomed
to these shocks of nature, and persuaded that the
Almighty would not withdraw from me his
fatherly guardianship, I threw myself on the bed
near the cradle of my little boy, who was sleeping
peaceably, and invoked the protection of Heaven
for us both ; when I thought I heard the report of
cannons fired at regular intervals; I listened
attentively, and was soon convinced that I did
not mistake. They were, doubtless, signals of
distress from some vessel in extreme danger: the
unhappy beings who made them implored the
succour of their fellow-creatures, but they wer£
heard only by a boy, who was unable to render
them any assistance. This idea was most dis-
tressing. I would,willingly have ventured my life
to save them, but had not any means of so doing.
The thought, however, struck me, that some of
these unfortunates might, by the help of their
boats, land upon my island, if they had any
knowledge of it; and that, by lighting a large fire
on the shore, it would point tut to them its
situation. The rain had ceased, but the wind still
blew with violence. I quitted my grotto, and
went down to the beach, loaded with dry wood

from my magazine. I made a faggot, and set
fire to it; the violence of the winds soon
caused it to blaze, and three discbarges of
cannon gave me reason to hope that it had been
noticed. 1 sheltered myself as well as I could
under the projection of a rock, and passed the
rest of this most anxious night in keeping up my
fire. In about an hour after my arrival, the firing
of the cannon ceased, which made me think the
unhappy mariners had abandoned the ship. I
waited for day with extreme impatience ; at length
it appeared, and I discovered at a distance, as far
as my eye could reach, a vessel entirely dismast-
ed, and on her beam ends between" two rocks,
which appeared just above the water's edge. I
was in hopes of perceiving the boats rowing
towards the island, but they did not present
themselves to my sight: and the aspect of a foam-
ing sea, whose swelling waves dashed themselves
to pieces against the shore, gave me reason to fear
that they had been ingulfed in its deep abyss.
I needed the exertion of my utmost resignation
to enable me to submit patiently to this dis-
pensation of Providence. My heart was ready to
burst, and tears rati down my cheeks. I
walked back to my grotto, overwhelmed with
grief: Tommy was awake ; the attention I paid
to him diverted, in some measure, my sadness.
When I had provided for all his wants, I left him
under the care of my dog, and returned to the
shore, resolving to coast it, with the intent of"
bestowing burial on the bodies which the sea
might cast on the beach. My search was, for a
long time, fruitless; but approaching a point of
land, which jutted into the sea like a little
promontory, and turning the corner of a rock, I
perceived on the sand a body, in female attire,
apparently lifeless. This spectacle filled me with
pity; [ placed myself on my knees, near this
unfortunate being, to seek for some signs of life
in a countenance disfigured, and darkened by
the shadows, of death. I lifted up her arm, it
was stiff' and cold; I placed my hand on her
heart, and thought I perceived a feeble pulsa-
tion; exerting then all my strength, I took her in
my arms, placed her against the rock, and sup-
ported her head. This motion caused her to throw
up a large quantity of water, which she had
swallowed; she opened her eyes for a moment,
but soon relapsed into a state of insensibility.
My situation was very embarrassing. I was
ignorant of the means of restoring to life,h.er who
awakened in me so lively an interest. Having
with me some palm wine, I succeeded with much
difficulty in making her swallow a small quantity
of it, and had the satisfaction of seeing her revive
and breath* freely. She came quite to herself,
and looking on me with tenderness and grati-

tude, " I owe you my life," said she, "and can
never acquit myself of the obligation; but 1 make
a vow to serve you the rest of my days, which
shall henceforth be devoted to testifying my
gratitude. At the affecting sound of this voice,
I experienced the most violent emotion; it re-
called to my mind a very tender remembrance. I
considered attentively the features, disfigured by
sorrow and fear, they were those of my affec-
tionate mother, the palpitations of my heart left
me no room for doubt. Divided between joy, grief,
and compunction, I remained speechless and was
near fainting: Susan perceived my paleness.
"God protect my preserver," cried she, and
starting from my arms, made me sit at the foot
of the rock, and returned me those cares I had
liberally bestowed on her. I had not been
deprived of consciousness, but was incapable of
uttering a word. 1 considered what was best for
me to do: it would have been dangerous to make
myself known to my mother, in her present
wetik state; she would have been unable to sup-
port the excess of joy this discovery would have
occasioned. My tall stature, and my unusually
muscular form, prevented her recognizing me,
and rendered it impossible for her to imagine
that it was her son she held in her arms. On
recovering the use of speech, I removed her fears
Q,
respecting my indisposition, which I attributed
to the fatigues of the preceding night; I express-
ed a desire of conducting her to my dwelling; she
consented, and leaning on my arm we walked
slowly towards the grotto. As soon as she entered
I seated her on a bench covered with skins, and
placing my little Tommy on her knees, begged
her to adopt this child and to love him for my
sake; she loaded him with caresses, which he
returned with the natural graces of infancy.
Entirely engaged by solicitude for the restora-
tion of my mother's health, after having given
her a cup of milk with some juice of a sugar cane
squeezed into it, I begged her to repose herself
upon my bed. She soon fell into a tranquil
sleep, during which I employed myself in
making some good broth; I put a piece of turtle
into my pot, and added two birds of a delicate
flavour; these I boiled down and afterwards thick-
ened the mess with rice, which composed a very
nourishing pottage. While engaged in these
pleasing cares, my heart palpitated with joy; it
was filled with affection and gratitude towards the
God of goodness, who had afforded me the means
of repairing the wrongs I had committed, and
constituting the happiness of my mother; Ire-
solved not to make myself known till I should
have proved to her my repentance and my love.
I frequently left my cookery to enjoy the pleas-

ure of looking on her during her slumber; the
refreshment of sleep had spread over her cheek
a rosy tint; her features regained their sweetness,
and I contemplated with delight the beloved
countenance of my mother, nearly such as I had
seen it formerly. She was not more than thirty-
eight years of age; her excellent constitution had
borne up under the grief I had caused her, and
led me to hope that I might prolong, yet many
years, a life which was more dear to me than
my own.
Tommy came running round me, asking me
in a whisper, a thousand questions about my new
guest. Having no idea that there existed two
sexes, he spoke of her as of a man. "How he
kissed me!" said he; "I think he will love me
very much; it is perhaps another Papa that the
good God has given me." "No, my little friend,
it is a mamma, it is a woman; I will explain that
to you some other time, but do not make a noise
for fear of waking her; comewith me to the garden;
we will gather an anana and some strawberries for
your mamma to eat.
He followed me, jumping and continuing his
prattle. "How happy lam! a papa, a mamma!
when papa goes out and cannot take me with him,
I shall not be left alone with Castor, I shall stay
with mamma."
After three hours tranquil sleep, my mother

awoke quite recovered: I presented lier the re-
past I had prepared for her: she was extremely-
surprised to find, in a remote desert, such whole-
some and agreeable food. She gave me many
thanks for the cares I had exerted on her account,
and told me that she wished I would give up to her
the office of cook, and content myself with that
of purveyor. After dinner she expressed a strong
curiosity to know my adventures; 1 could not
deny her request, but began the recital from
the period of my shipwreck. She supposed me
to be twenty years of age, and I allowed her to
continue in that error: I then entered into the
detail of my labours, my discoveries, all my era- i
ployments, and of all the resources I had met
with. I gave her an account of my reflections
and my feelings, an.l assured her that 1 was in-
debted to the good principles inculcated by my
parents, for the courage and resignation which
had supported ine in the most trying situations.
She lifted her eyes and hands to Heaven, and
tears overflowed her cheeks; it was the remem-
brance of her son that caused them to flow; with
one word I could have stopped them, but I
would not present to the eyes of my mother, a
guilty child; I wished to blot out the traces of
my fault by my attentions, and by the whole
tenor of my conduct. The adventure of the dark
forest made her shudder, still more so did the

account of the death of the parents of Tommy,
and the manner in which he had fallen into my
hands; she pressed the poor child to her heart,
and I saw that she participated all the sentiments
with which he had inspired me.
I had also a great desire to learn by what ac-
cident my mother had been brought to my island,
and by what means divine Providence had made
me the happy instrument of saving her life; but
I delayed asking her, until she should have re-
covered her strength- I led her into my garden,
the arrangement of which she much admired; from
thence to the sea shore, where we amused our-
selves in searching for turtle's eggs, for our even-
ing's repast. „
The waves had driven on shore some of the
planks, which were loosened from the wrecked
vessel. This was a precious acquisition. I
carried them into my magazine; they gave birth
to an idea of framing a raft, by means of which I
might go to the stranded vessel, and save out of
it some useful articles. I had no anxiety as to
the subsistence of my mother; I needed only to
cultivate a greater quantity of rice, and of
potatoes, to prepare more salt provisions, and to
augment my flock by some more goats: but I
saw with pain that she would experience priva-
tions of another kind. Notwithstanding infancy
easily accustoms itself to any thing, I had found
Q2
it very unpleasant to be without linen; how-
very distressing would it then be for her to have,
hke me, nothing but skins of beasts for clothing.
I saw no other way of procuring apparel or linen,
but to go and fetch it from the ship; and deter-
mined that neither fatigues nor dangers should
prevent me.
I had much trouble in persuading my mother
to accept my bed; she yielded only to my most
pressing requests, and to the promise I gave her
of working the next day in making another, and
allowing her to assist me. She carried a heap of
dry leaves into the hall, which was for the future
to be my sleeping apartment; they were spread
out and covered with skins. .Tommy, delighted
with all this bustle, followed her like a little
dog, and endeavoured to render himself useful;
he collected leaves, and bringing both his hands
full, fancied himself wonderfully useful. My
mother conceived so great an affection for this
child, that she asked me to let his cradle be
placed near her bed : her desires were laws to me,
therefore I did not oppose this wish.
Oh, what a delightful night we passed ! 1 was
doubtless the most happy, because I knew the
extent of my felicity. In the midst of the enjoy-
ments I had procured for my mother, sia;hs often
escaped her bosom : she thought of her dear Felix.:

The next day Susan collected all the willows
and oziers she could find among my stores, and
called upon me to keep my word. As soon as she
saw the method I took, she imitated me with much
skill, so that the work went on pteasantly. I
took this opportunity to beg she would relate her
history. "It is," said she, "a sorrowful recital,
but I cannot refuse any thing to my preserver."
My mother then began the detail of her
marriage, of my birth, the pains she and my
father had taken with my education, and the
hopes that they had entertained that 1 would
have profited by them. She painted, in lively
colours, her grief on the death of her husband:
I cannot doubt that her affection for me had
prevented her sinking under it. But when she
spoke of my disobedience, of my wandering
disposition, and the uneasiness I had occa-
sioned her, it awakened all my remorse, and
wrung my heart; I was near losing my senses.
My mother reproached herself bitterly for the
weakness which had prevented her exerting all
her authority over me, and making use of
coercion for my amendment; she lamented yet
more, her having granted her consent to my
quitting her, and looked upon herself as the
cause of my death.
I shall here take up the recital of Susan,
and in nearly the same words she herself made
use of; the lively interest I took in it engraved
them deeply in my memory.
« When I was separated from my dear Felix,
and saw him depart in the diligence, 1 returned,
weeping, to my own village. My neighbours
and friends, commiserating my grief, sought to
alleviate it, by coming often to visit me. Those
who were mothers, particularly, spoke to me of
my son, and assured me that in a few months I
should hear some news of him: this was the best
method of consoling me, but the only true
comfort I found, was, when I prostrated myself
before God, and implored hiin in behalf of my
child. Eighteen months passed away without
my hearing any tidings of the ship in which he
had sailed. At Brest, and in its neighbourhood,
every body was persuaded he was lost. For me,

ignorant of all that regarded maritime affairs, I
suffered myself to be persuaded by the discourses
of those who interested themselves about me, and
who wished to conceal from me my misfortune.
It was at length made known to me; two sailors
from our village had escaped from the shipwreck;
they had saved themselves on a rock, where they
were near perishing with want,vvhen an American
vessel picked them up, and they had since
returned to their own country. Our worthy
curate, finding it impossible to conceal fijjnn me
what was known to every body else, took upon
himself the office of announcing-to me the afflict-
ing intelligence; in doing which, his humanity
led him to use the greatest precaution, but the
shock was not the less dreadful. I fell senseless
at his feet, and recovered from a long fainting fit
only to be seized with a violent fever and delirium.
I was for many days in this state. When 1 re-
covered my senses, the venerable pastor was by my
bedside, holding one of my hands ; he spoke to me
with angelic sweetness, and availed himself of the
most powerful motives of religion to lead me to
submit with resignation to my lot. I well recol-
lect the answer I made to all his remonstrances;
'Ah! sir, I had so earnestly prayed to God not
to punish him!' 'Well,' said he, at length,
< dare you reproach the Almighty for not having

granted your prayer? Can you penetrate his
designs? Are you not assured, that, being your
Father, all that he ordains is ultimately for your
good? Your child, had he been permitted to
remain in this world, might perhaps have for-
feited his hopes of that which is to come: God
has taken him to himself. Woman of little faith,
submit patiently, that you may render yourself
worthy to join him.' This tone of severity was
foreign to the heart of the good curate; he soon
resumed the natural sweetness of his disposition,
and accomodating himself to my weakness, per-
mitted me to cherish a hope, which he did not
entertain himself, and which alone has sustained
me during several years of my unhappy existence.
My mind was possessed of the idea, that since two
sailors were saved, my son might have had the
same good fortune; that he was perhaps still
living in some corner of the world, and that I
should see him again sooner or later. This idea
made so strong an impression on my mind, that
I started every time any one knocked at my door,
and ran to open it in extreme agitation; my
disappointed hopes threw me back into a state of
excessive debility.
« I had been brought up in a convent, conse-
quently was not so ignorant as others in my
station of life; but I had not the least idea of

geography. A new schoolmaster had just es-
tablished himself in our village, who taught this
science to the children of the gentry and rich
trades-people in the neighbourhood. I conceived
so great a desire to take lessons of him, that I
could not resist its impulse. I kept this a secret,
fearing I should be laughed at, but went every
evening to the teacher's house, and soon learned
to understand maps; from that time, my plea-
santest employment was to examine them, to
trace the route of the ships which sail to India, or
to our American colonies, to observe the immense
number of islands yet uninhabited. When my
eyes were arrested by an Archipelago, I could not
withdraw them; I fancied I saw my son on one of
these isles, without considering that so young a
child would have been unable to procure subsist-
ence, and that he would have become the prey of
wild beasts, against whom he had no means of
defence.
"These chimeras occupied my mind for three
years. In the mean time I declined daily; my
health sunk under the anguish of my heart,
when I learnt that Madame d'Altamont, a rich
widow residing at Brest, was about to depart for
Martinique, whither she was going to take pos-
session of a considerable property she was
become heiress to, and that she wanted a confi-

dential person as a companion. My imagination
was excited by this intelligence; it" I could
follow this lady, I should see the same places my
son had visited ; I would enquire every where,
and should perhaps find him.—This idea, though
without any foundation, haunted me day and
night. I went and presented myself before our
curate, and begged him to propose me to
Madame d'Altamont, to whom he was known.
He at first opposed my design, but seeing how
much 1 was bent on it, he informed me that this
lady was of an imperious and haughty disposition,
and that I should have much to put up with
from her temper. This was a weak objection to
so ardent a desire as mine; I redoubled my
entreaties and my tears; the curate was softened
by them, he went to Brest, and by his recommen-
dation I obtained the situation I so earnestly
wished. By the advice of the prudent pastor, I
made the necessary arrangements for securing my
little fortune to my son, if he should return, or
in default of him, to my legal heirs, in case it
should be the will of God that I should not sur-
vive the voyage. The curate also made me promise
that, if my researches should prove fruitless, I
would resign myself patiently to the will of the
Almighty; and 1 made a firm resolution, in that
case, to retire into some religious house, and con-

secrate the rest of my days to Him, who alone
could fill up in my heart the place of my son.
"My preparations were soon made; I repaired to
Brest accompanied by the curate, who wished to
present me himself to my new mistress. She was
surprised at my disinterestedness, as 1 would not
make any stipulation with her, but threw myself
entirely on her generosity: provided I was con-
veyed to the new world, all my wishes would be
gratified.
"I have already trespassed too much on your
patience in engaging your attention so long with
my misfortunes: 1 will not relate to you the
vexations I experienced during the voyage.
Madame d'Altamont had indeed a most fantastic
and whimsical disposition: in spite of all my
efforts, I could do nothing to please her; she
would have made me feel bitterly my dependent
state in putting up with her ill humours, but
being wholly engrossed by the object of my voy-
age, I did not suffer her behaviour to make any
serious impression; frequently I heard not her
reproaches, or, as I was conscious of not meriting
them, I heard them with indifference. She was a
long time troubled with sea sickness; fortunately
1 felt it but slightly, so that I was able to render
her those attentions she had a right to expect
from me. We touched at the Madeira
R
Islands, and Madame d'Altamont there reco-
vered her health. The rest of our passage wis
without any disaster, till the time we experienced
the horrible tempest which wrecked our ship on
the rocks that surround this island. In the
midst of the universal consternation, 1 constantly
employed myself in assisting my unhappy mistress,
who was fallen into dreadful convulsions, and ap-
peared every moment ready to expire. As to myself
I had voluntarily hazarded my life, and the hope
of rejoining my husband and my son made me
look on death without much emotion. Mean-
while the vessel lying on her side began to fill
with water; it reached the little cabin into which
we had retired. The movements which took,
place above, and the exclamations of the crew,
made me conclude they were going to take to the
boats. I apprized Madame d'Altamont, and
exhorted her to go upon deck and endeavour to
save herself by the same means; she found
strength to follow my advice. The boats, already
overloaded with people, were just pushing off
from the vessel; but the supplications of my
mistress induced the men to take her in;
they called to us to slide down by means of a
rope which hung from the ship's side. Madame
d'Altamont seized it first and got on board, I
followed immediately, but a wave drove off the
boat at the moment 1 was setting my foot on it,
Felix's Mother falls into the Sea. 185
and I fell into the sea: the noise of the tempest,
and the darkness which surrounded us, without
doubt, prevented their perceiving what had hap-
pened, or they were unable to afford me assist-
ance. I lost all sensation, and only recovered it
when your generous cares restored me to life. I
know not by what miracle Providence has con-
ducted me alive to this island, but I receive with
gratitude this blessing of the Almighty; my
imagination is cured of its chimerical hopes, and
my heart submits at length to the will of fleaven.
Ashamed and repentant at my little resignation,
I now consent to support life, as long as it shall
please God to grant it me; perhaps it may yet
become dearer to me, if I could be serviceable to
him who has preserved it. I have no longer a
son, my young friend, be you a son to me; allow
me to fulfil the duties of a mother towards you,
and restore me the happiness of which it has been
my unhappy lot to be deprived."
These tender words penetrated my heart. I
threw myself at my mother's feet, and promised
her the respect, the obedience, the affection of a
son. "Well then," said she, "I shall be doubly
happy, I will persuade myself that this child is
yours, and the title of grandmother will afford
me a new pleasure. In so saying, she almost
stifled little Tommy with kisses, who was over-
joyed at having so kind a mamma.

Susan would not be refused taking charge of
the kitchen, and all the household department.
I went every day shooting or fishing, brought her
home delicate game, or excellent fish. I always
found on the sand some wrecks of the ship, and
worked secretly at constructing a raft, while my
mother was employed in the grotto, preparing me
some agreeable surprize. She knew how to
make butter, but was in want of a churn, and her
ingenuity contrived one: she one day presented
me with.a cocoa-nut-cup full of delicious butter:
these dainties recalled to my mind my own
country, and gave me infinite pleasure: from this
time we were in no want of them, and my mother
had the means of making very good sauces, and of
varying our diet.
When the raft was completed, I was tempted
to go and visit the ship without acquainting my
mother; but the submission I owed her, and the
fear of causing her uneasiness, withheld me. t
asked her permission to m;ike this voyage, and
had much trouble in obtaining it; I represented
to her, that by choosing the ebb tide for the time
of my departure, it would necessarily carry me
towards the rocks where the vessel was stranded,
and that waiting on board till the time of flood,
I could, by its aid, easily return to shore, and that
in case of accident, the distance was not so great,
but that I might swim back. Since my abode on

the island, I was become an excellent swimmer;
and, assuring my mother of my vigour and skill
in that exercise, I succeeded in lessening her fears;
but she insisted that I should take Castor with
me, whose faithful attachment had, once already,
saved my life. There was nothing more to do
than to set the raft afloat, which I had constructed
near the water's edge, on a sloping ground.
When the tide came up, it lifted one end of it; we
raised up the other with two strong levers, and
soon had the pleasure of seeing it glide down
softly, and at length float on the water. We tied
it by a strong cord to the trunk of a tree, and I
waited impatiently for the time when the ebb
would allow me to put to sea. My mother de-
scribed the situation of her mistress's cabin; it was
in a part of the ship where probably the water
had not done much damage, for the stem being
entirely buried in the sea, the stern necessarily lay
very high. A little trunk, containing the effects
belonging to my mother, and some curiosities
which she usually placed near her bed,and a small
almanack which was there likewise, were all she
desired me to bring; "only," said she, "take
care of yourself, and load your raft with nothing
but what is useful and convenient."
The time arrived for unmooring; I untied the
raft; a long pole served for thrusting it off, and

guiding it . I performed successfully the shor t
passage to the vessel; the ropes assisted me iu
getting on board; she was entirely parted
asunder, and in such a condition that she could
not escape going to pieces the first gale of wind;
it behoved me, therefore, to take advantage of this
voyage and to collect what was most necessary, as ,
I could not flatter myself with the hope of making
a second. My mother's trunk did not exceed my
strength; I carried it upon deck, and by means
of a rope lowered it on the raft. I likewise threw
down some large coils of different sized cordage.
I afterwards visited every part of the ship which
was above water, and found in the captain's cabin
several large trunks filled with linen and wearing
apparel; as they were very heavy I emptied them,
and made parcels of what I wished to have. I
took also a case of bottles of brandy and liquors.
I wished to procure some barrels of biscuit, but
the water was between decks, so that I could
not get any, and besides it must have been all
spoiled: I had therefore reason to congratulate
myself, that the productions of my island being
sufficient to satisfy.,the wants of life, I had only
to look after what might render it agreeable.
Several mattresses made part of my toad, which
was completed by all the household utensils I
could find, porridge pots, copper pans, coffee pots,
dishes, plates, spoons, knives, and forks. I

could not see, without longing for them, a great
number of fire-arms; 1 had always wished to be
provided with some, in case of an attack; how
much more did I desire it, now that I had to
defend all that was dear to me in the world, my
mother and my adopted child; but I had the
mortification of being unable to procure any
powder; it was all stowed away in a part of the
ship which I could not come at on account of the
water, and therefore, sighing, I left behind the
guns and pistols, but carried away two large
sabres. Fearing to overload my raft, and wish-
ing to take advantage of the tide which was
beginning to rise, I quitted the vessel, and
worked courageously to reach the shore. My
family was waiting for me there: on approaching
I beheld my mother on her knees, praying fer-
vently for the fortunate issue of my voyage. As
soon as I set my foot on shore, she came to me
with open arms, testifying the joy she felt in
seeing me arrive safe, and entreating me with the
most affectionate expressions not to expose
myself again to similar dangers, but to promise her
not to return any more to the ship; I made her
the promise she required, and, being freed from
all her inquietudes, she cheerfully assisted me
in unloading the raft. I wished to have imme-
diately carried the goods I had saved into the
grotto, but my mother insisted that I should
first recruit my strength by a good dinner. We
therefore returned to our habitation, I taking
only the case of liquors, and she some plates,
dishes, &c. Our meal was quite ready, it con-
sisted of good soup and half a roasted kid. 1
spread a handsome cloth on the table, and
arranged the plates, dishes, knives and forks;
and, for the first time during five years, had the
pleasure of eating after the European manner.
Tommy, quite astonished at what he saw, uttered
exclamations of surprize, and endeavouring to
imitate us, spilt the broth upon him, or pricked
his tongue with a fork, but he only laughed at
these trifling accidents. A little Barbaboes
cream, which I gave him at the dessert, put him
quite in good humour; his joy excited ours, and
we should have prolonged this agreeable repast, if
more important occupations had not called us to
the shore. Before night, with the help of the hurdle
and Castor, we had transported all our riches to
our dwelling place. After placing them in se-
curity, we found ourselves exceedingly fatigued,
and spreading two mattresses on each of our beds,
we lay down, blessing God for the additional
benefits he had bestowed on us.

When I awoke, my mother was still sleeping
soundly. I pleased myself with the idea of
appearing before her, dressed in the French
fashion; 1 took a fine shirt, a jacket and pan-
taloons of Nankin, thread stockings, and a pair
of shoes. It may be well imagined that I did not
omit to furnish myself with those necessary
articles, but brought away all the shoes that
would fit me, as likewise two pair of boots,
which seemed made for me: an embroidered
muslin neckcloth and a green morocco cap com-
pleted my apparel. I was preparing to go to
my mother's apartment, when she entered the
room in a handsome undress of English linen,
and a black taftety apron: her hair, still very fine,
was carefully arranged, parted in front like the
Madona's of Raphael, turned up and fastened
behind with a tortoise-shell comb. We compli-

mented each other mutually on our dress. My
mother acknowledged that it was a great pita-
sure to her not to be without linen and clothes;
but she observed, I must feel this pleasure muck
more sensibly than herself, after being so long
deprived of it.
Tommy, on awaking, was much surprised at
our new attire; he threw his large eyes first on
Susan, and then on me; after looking on us a
long time, he held out his little arms, and said,
"It is still papa and mamma, but they are much
handsomer."
We proceeded to examine the contents of my
mother's trunk, in order to put every thing in its
place. I had reason to admire the foresight of
females, and their attention to the minutiae of
housewifery. Besides a sufficient quantity of
linen and clothes, Susan had provided herself
with every thing necessary for needle-work. She
had an ample store of needles and thread, with
several pairs of scissors; but what gave me most
satisfaction was, to find at the bottom of the trunk
half a ream of common paper, and some quires
of letter paper, some pens, and two bottles of
ink well sealed. "0! what a treasure!" cried

Susan; "and these are mine, which 1 will par-
take with you." She drew forth a Bible, a book
of the Gospels, and some volumes of Massillon;
I kissed these sacred books: besides the use they
might be of to myself, they afforded me the means
of teaching my child to read, and of instructing
him in the first principles of religion. I accepted
my mother's present with gratitude, and
having plenty of boards, undertook the
making a wooden table, on which I might write
commodionsly.
I had not forgotten the articles which Susan's
piety had led her to wish for, but had presented
them to her on my arrival from the ship; some
days after, she begged me to resign to her one of
the green bowers, with which I had ornamented
my garden. "Know you not," replied I, "that
all I have is yours? Choose which of them you
please, you shall be there at perfect liberty, and
I will not approach it whon you forbid."
"There is not a moment," said she, " when your
presence is not agreeable to me; but, in your
absence, I will often retire into the arbour of
acacias and honeysuckles; it is that which I ask
of you, with permission to fit it up according to
my own taste." "You distress me," replied I,
"by speaking in this manner: you are mistress

and sovereign of this little empire, and I am th e
most submissive of your subjects."
A fortnight passed in our ordinary occupa-
tions: we had, in addition, the care of collecting
on the sea beach what the flood tide brought on
shore from the wreck of the vessel, which the
shock of the waves was continually breaking up.
Th* evening of the fifteenth day, I perceived a
cloud of sadness on the countenance of my
mother, which afflicted me; she stifled her
sighs, and endeavoured to hide the tears which
filled her eyes. I did not venture to ask her
any questions, but, respecting her melancholy.
I retired betimes to leave her at liberty. Rising
very early in the morning, I entered her cham-
ber softly: surprised at not finding her there,
I searched every corner of the grotto; she was
already gone out. On entering the garden, and
approaching the acacia bower, 1 heard sobs and
groans; I advanced on tiptoe, scarcely breathing,
and beheld an altar of turf raised in the middle
of the bower, the crucifix was placed in a niche
ornamented with flowers, my mother was pros-
trate, and praying in a low voice; it was for her
son that she addressed her prayers to Heaven.
I entered, and knelt beside her; she perceived
me, and turning on me her eyes swimming with
tears, "Pardon me," said she; "you who have
saved my life, and whose every endeavour is to
render it happy, believe me, I feel most grateful
for the benefits you have conferred on me, but
I cannot forget that I had a son; this is the
anniversary of his birth-day, he would to-day
have been eighteen years old ; this epoch justly
renews my grief." She could say no more; her
strength forsook her, and she fainted in my
arms. 1 was extremely terrified at seeing her
in this condition, and reproached myself for
having concealed from her that I was living;
and calling on her repeatedly by the endearing
name of mother, sought to re-animate her by the
tenderest caresses; at length she revived, and
seeing me at her feet in a supplicating posture,
"What mean you?" said she. "You never
offended me, and yet you seem to ask forgive-
ness." "Yes, my mother; I ask pardon for
the guilty Felix. Recognise the child who is
still so dear to you, in spite of all the wrongs he
has committed, and who wished to atone for
them before he dared to make himself known."
The excess of joy suspended all the faculties of
the tender Susan; she leaned her head, on my
bosom, and a flood of tears relieved her heart.
She considered my features attentively, and
notwithstanding the change which years, labour,
and climate had produced, she recollected them,

and felt the pleasure of being still a mother. She
had poured out her grief before God, she now
offered up the homage of her joy, and never
were devotions performed with greater fervour.
We opened our hearts in the most delightful
conversation: my mother made me repeat all
the particulars I had already recked, but which
she listened to with fresh interest; and we
ended by congratulating ourselves on having,
after all our sufferings, attained the happy state
We now enjoyed. We were both at that period of
life which might lead us to hope we should be
able, by our exertions, to provide for the wants of
it during many years, and we were bringing' op
a child who would one day supply our place, and
repay to us the cares we had bestowed on htm.
We foresaw the possibility of one day being
removed from our island, and restored to society^
But we thought of this event without any anxious
solicitude; satisfied with our present condition,
we committed to Providence the care of the future.
On our return to the grotto, we found that
Tommy had been some time awake, and was
playing with Castor and talking to Coco; he was
rejoiced at seeing us with such happy counte-
nances: our breakfast was very cheerful. 1
informed my mother that I was going to begin
writing my adventures, and she undertook teach-

ing the ch/Ui'to read, and begged me to trace on
some square pieces of paper, the letters of the
alphabet, in order tbat he might become ac-
quainted with them. Perfectly instructed in her
religiori", she purposed making a little abridg-
ment of the Christian doctrine, to initiate
Tommy in its first principles.
My mother had not yet been at any distance
from our dwelling. 1 wished to show her the
charming landscapes #ifch which the interior of the
island abounded -T and besides, it was high time to
think of laying in our provision of wax. I proposed
to her a journey to the beautiful plain and the
delightful groves, where the miraca trees grew:
she consented with pleasure, and this excursion
proved extremely agreeable to us. Susan ceased
not to admire the beauties of nature, and the
resources she afforded us in this happy climate.
Tommy most frequently ran before us; when he
was tired we carried him alternately: my mother
had made him some light clothing of cotton,
which was much more convenient to him than his
coat of skin; his vivacity and infantile graces
charmed us both; never was there a more amiable,
a more sprightly, or a more tractable child.
From the top of a hill I pointed out to my
mother the forest which had been so disastrous
to me, and smiling, proposed to her to traverse it
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
with me, assuring her that nothing could be more
curious than the cavern of the dead. "No, no,''
replied she; "we are now in a terrestrial
paradise, my curiosity shall not cause me to
forfeit it."
We gathered an abundant crop of the miraca
berries, collected a good quantity of sugar canes
anil cocoa nuts, and also laid in a provision of
potatoes, in case those growing in our garden
should not be sufficient f%f*us. At length, after
having remained abroad on the banks of the river
for several days, we returned home, loaded with
whatever might, be useful to us during the winter.
Other cares now demanded our attention; we
salted goats, turtles, and some large fish much
resembling cod; we collected many eggs, which
we preserved in sand, and got in our harvest of
rice. Our next employment was making tapers,
and all was finished before the end of the fine
weather.
I was never more happy than when employed
in doing something to contribute to my mother's
pleasure. Her piety caused her to value very
highly the oratory which she had formed in the
garden: it gave me pain to think she would be
deprived of it during the rainy season; I there-
fore took advantage of the intervening time, to
construct a hut with" planks, and covered it with

rushes, over which I spread some goat skins,
that it might be proof against the rain: this erec-
tion was near the entrance of the grotto, and I con-
trived a covered way to lead to it, so that my
mother had the enjoyment of her oratory in all
weathers, .-•he conducted Tommy there every
morning and evening; 1 often joined them, and
we offered up to Heaven our united prayers.
The rains now obliged us to shut ourselves up
in our grotto, but we were not the less happy on
that account. A variety of occupations, and the
charms of a society as delightful as the ties
which united it were tender, made the time pass
away with extreme rapidity. I employed my-
self three or four hours every day in preparing
the relation which I am giving to the public;
manual labour engaged the rest of my time. My
mother took upon herself the care of providing
our meals, milking the goats, and keeping the
linen and clothes in good order. We were
both engaged in the education of Tommy, who
enlivened us by his pretty interesting ways and his
pertinent questions. In the evening I read to
my mother, and we often broke off to communi-
cate to each other the reflections which the
subject gave rise to.
The human mind delights in forming schemes,
and we, in our remote retreat, had our projects:
THE FRENCH CABIN BOY.
we intended, on the return of the fine weather, to
construct a rural habitation at about a league
distant from the grotto, on the smiling banks of
the great river. It was to be our farm, we were
to remove our cattle there, and to rear pigeons
and a kind of fowls we had lately discovered; but
Providence had ordered otherwise, having
determined to restore us to the society Of our
fellow creatures, and was even then preparing our
deliverance.
In my voyage to the ship, I had found in the
cabin of Madame d'Altamont, a casket of rose-
wood ornamented with plates of silver, and very
strongly secured; I took possession of it, with
the idea that it might please my mother. Both of
us being occupied with matters more essential, we
had placed this box in a corner of the grotto, and
forgotten it. Susan met with it, and, curious to
know what it contained, she begged me to force
the lock; this was soon done, but we were much
disconcerted at finding that it contained only
some valuable jewels, some family papers, and a
thousand louis d'ors. Disappointed at first
with so useless a discovery, we began to laugh at it
and passed many jokes on this unexpected for-
tune: like a careful father, I spoke of disposing
of it for the benefit of Tommy, by purchasing
a share in some lucrative establishment. After
A Casket of Jewels and Money. 201
having made ourselves merry a long time on the
subject, my mother suggested a more rational
idea. "If," said she, "we should one day quit
this island, and have the happiness of returning to
our country, we shall have the satisfaction of
restoring to the heirs of Madame d'Altamont what
legally belongs to them, and to whom this gold
and these jewels may be very needful, and these
papers which the casket contains, may be proba-
bly of great consequence." It was then resolved
that we should replace every thing carefully,and
keep the whole as a sacred deposite, for which
justice and our conscience rendered us respon-
sible.

We waited for the fine weather without
impatience, but it was with much pleasure that
we beheld Nature resume her charms, the trees
become covered with blossoms, the birds re-as-
semble in the groves, and all around us breathe
new life. Archery and fishing were my favourite
amusements, and I began to practise them again.
One morning, wishing to reach a part of the
coast which abounds with fish, I had to pass
through a little grove of trees, and had scarcely
entered it, when to my inexpressible astonish-
ment, 1 perceived four men, armed with guns,
advancing towards me. On seeing me, they ex-
hibited signs of great surprise, and accosted me

by addressing some words to me in a language I
did not understand: I answered them in my own,
when one of them approached me, and shaking
me by the hand, asked me in broken French, how
I came there, and from whence; at the same
time informing me that they were English, and
friendly disposed towards me and all men, and
requesting me to conduct them to my place of
abode, if I had one.
Pleased that, at least, I could make myself
understood by one of these strangers, I begged
him to follow me, with his companions, assuring
him that it would give me pleasure to receive
them at my dwelling. As we went along, I
briefly recounted the history of my shipwreck,
which I saw much interested him who could
understand me; he repeated it in English to
the other three, who came by turns to shake me
cordially by the hand.
It is easy to imagine the astonishment of my
mother at the sight of four strangers; she re-
ceived them, however, courteously, and the table
was soon spread with the best we had to offer.
The brandy and the liquors, which we had
husbanded until now, were distributed liberally
to our guests, who were very well pleased with
their reception: they spoke frequently to each
other, and though we did not understand their

discourse, we guessed by their gestures and the
expression of their countenances, that they were
making arrangements for taking us with them;
our conjectures were confirmed by him who
spoke a little French, and who was the chief
surgeon of the ship. He gave us the following
information :—
A ship commanded by Captain Sir Edward
Walter, returning from the South Seas, after
passing the straits of Magellan, had touched at
Rio Janeiro, where she was re-victualled, from
hence she sailed to Jamaica, where she again put
in, to land some of her cargo, and to take on
board other merchandise, and was op her voyage
homeward bound to England, when the weather,
which till then had been favourable, suddenly
changed; a violent storm drove them out of
their course, and they were beating about for
ten days quite out of their latitude. Provisions
began to run 6hort, as well as fresh water, of
which each man received only an allowance of a
quart a day. The ship had received some dam-
age, and the Captain was anxious to.find a place
where he might refit her, procure provisions,
and above all, lay in a stock of fresh water: they
discovered a coast surrounded by reefs; the
wind having considerably abated, they sailed
along the shore, and cast anchor at about a

quarter of a league distant; a boat, haying on
board eight seamen with two officers, besides the
surgeon and pilot, was sent off to examine the
coast and look for a landing place. . In ranging
along shore, after doubling a point of land, thej
discovered a bay where the sea was smooth, and
the shore easily accessible; there tliey ran the
boat in. The sailors dispersed themselves in the
island to seek for water, and the officers advanced
in-land on another side, to kill game, or to find
any other resources. The surgeon consulted at
as to what they had best do to procure provisions.
My advice was, that they should bring the ves-
sel near the coast to refit, and during the time
that was doing, they should kill as many goats
as they could to victual the ship; in the mean
while 1 offered them my flock, consisting of two
he-goats, four females, and eight young kids,
for the subsistence of the crew, and promised
to shew them fields of rice and potatoes, and the
places where they might find turtle in abundance.
The Englishmen expressed much gratitude for
these obliging offers, and were in haste to return
on board, in order to communicate them to the
Captain. We went together to look for the
seamen, who had already filled several butts of
water; then proceeding to the place where the
boat lay, and ascending a rock, I saw the ship
lying at anchor. We separated with many ex-
pressions of friendship, and I returned to the
grotto to converse with my mother on the hopes
this event vvas calculated to inspire us with.
1 found her much agitated, and confess I partook
of her solicitude; since our re-union, we thought
that nothing was wanting to our happiness; but
the mention of our country awakened delicious
emotions in our hearts, and if the hopes we now
conceived of seeing it once more, should prove
fallacious, it was to be feared that our solitude
would lose all its charms. In this state of sus-
pense it was needful to call to our aid those
great principles of submission to the Divine will,
and dependence upon Providence, which ought
to guide all Christians: from this source Susan,
derived calmness and resignation, her example
and discourses soon inspired me with them like-
wise: we succeeded in regaining our tranquillity,
and waited, without uneasiness, for what Heaven
should ordain for us.
When we had set every thing in order in our
house, I wished to conduct my mother to the bay
where the English had landed: she leaned on my
arm and we set out. Tommy went before us,
leaping like a young kid. On our arrival, we
noticed a great stir on board the ship; some
time after the anchors were weighed, the sails

hoisted, and the ship stood in for the bay, which
she entered without accident, and broughi up at
a little distance from shore. A boat came off,
and in a short time we had the pleasure of pre-
senting ourselves to Sir Edward Walter, who re-
ceived us in the kindest manner, and in our own
language, which he spoke fluently; expressed
his great happiness in having met with us, and
engaged to remove' us from this island, and to
procure us the means of returning to France.
After giving his orders to his men, he followed us
to our habitation, accompanied by his second in
command: he was surprised and charmed with
all he saw there, and could not refrain from ex-
pressing his wonder, that, young as I was, I
should have been able to provide for myself dur-
ing five years, and by my own exertions to have
furnished myself with all the necessaries of life.
He approved of the advice I had given his offi-
cers, but as to my flock, he assured me he would
not allow a single beast to be killed, but would
take them on board as live stock for the voyage;
concluding, reasonably, that by shooting, and
Sshing, they should be able to procure abundant
subsistence for the crew during their stay on the
island. While we were thus conversing, four
sailors arrived, loaded with biscuits, cheeses, a
T
fine ham, and a case of Bourdeaux wine. This
was a very acceptable present, which the eaptaia
made us, and we thanked him heartily for it.
Sir Edward conceived a friendship for me;
during the twelve days that he continued on the
island, I accompanied him in all his excursions;
while we were absent, my mother was engaged in
preparing us nutritious food to refresh us after
our fatigues, for the captain took his meals with,
us all the time he was on shore. The crew
procured by their guns a sufficient stock of pro-
visions to last them a good while at sea; but
though they knew not exactly what part of the
world they were in, they concluded themselves
to be not very distant from the Antilles. Tha
oaptain ordered a neat cabin to be prepared for
us on board, near to his own: and when the ship
was repaired we embarked, feeling some regret
at quitting the hospitable land which had afford-
ed us the necessaries of life, where we had en-
joyed tranquillity, and where we had experienced
the happiness of meeting again after a long sepa-
ration. We took nothing but our clothes and
the casket of Madame d'Altamont. I made the
oaptain a present of my parroqnet; he was so
well taught, and spoke so distinctly, that he was
very valuable to those who fancy these birds. It

may be imagined that I did not part with my
friend and preserver, the faithful Castor: many
of the officers wished to purchase him, but my
attachment for this good animal was for life and
death.
When the ship had set sail, and I was at liberty
to converse freely with my mother, I imparted
to her my uneasiness. I do not doubt, said I,
that Sir Edward will act generously by us, and
will conduct us to some of the colonies, without
requiring any thing for uur passage; but how
shall we live there, since we possess nothing?
and how shall we get back to our dear country,
without money to pay the passage of three per-
sons? t see no other resource than that I should
enter the service of some rich planter: with the
captain's recommendation I might obtain some
situation, which would enable me to supply oar
wants, and perhaps, after some few years, to lay
jjp a sum sufficient to return to France. "This
project, my son, is very well conceived," said
my mother; "you love labour, and possess all
the requisites for a good economist, but I do not
see that it is necessary to have recourse to this
mode of subsistence, nor to wait so long before
we revisit our country; have you forgotten that
we have a sum of twenty-four thousand francs, a
part of which will be sufficient to relieve us from
this embarrassment?" "It is doubtless," replied
I, <* in order to prove my integrity, that you
make this proposal; but, my dear mother, what
have I ever done, or what have I said, which
should make you suspect 1 should disregard the
dictates of justice and probity i The deposire
which we have in our hands, ought to be delivered
untouched into those of the heirs of Madame
d'Altamont; rather than make use of it, I would
submit to labour as a slave all the rest of my
life."
At these words, uttered with much warmth,
my mother pressed me to her bosom. "Dear
Felix," she exclaimed, "this moment makes
amends for all I have suffered. How it charms
me to find you actuated by this delicacy of
conscience, and these solid principles, which I
hope will always influence your conduct. I will
explain to you that which surprises you in mine.
Circumstances authorize me to make use of the
money we have saved, because I have a certainty
of replacing it, on our arrival in France; the
sale of some portions of land will suffice for that
purpose; and if your inheritance is thereby di-
minished, our industry will soon repair the loss.
When you quitted me, you was but a child; you

was not aware that I possessed fortune enough to
render your circumstances easy; you judged of
my means by the economical manner of our liv-
ing, which was occasioned by my desire of see-
ing you one day enjoy a comfortable indepen-
dence." This explanation, while is set my
mind at ease, increased my gratitude for my
affectionate mother. After a voyage of three
weeks, we arrived at the isle of St. Christopher.
Sir Edward had friends and correspondents
there; he lodged at a very handsome hotel, and
his friendship for us led him to wish that we
should inhabit it likewise. As soon as he had
arranged his own affairs, he gave his attention to
ours. Perceiving our ardent wish to return to
France, he engaged our passage on board an
English ship bound for Plymouth, and omitted
nothing in his power, which might contribute to
render our voyage agreeable. He sent on board
some cases of wine, liquors, and dried sweet-
meats, and when we wished to settle our account
with our landlord, he informed us that all was
paid. The captain would not allow us to express
our gratitude, but wished us to suppose that he
was the party obliged. He conducted us on
board, himself,and we took an affectionate leave of
each other. Tommy, who loved Sir Edward

very much, had thrown his arms round his neck,
and would not quit him; but the latter disen-
gaged himself gently, and gave the child so gay
a pocket book, that his attention was attracted by
it. The captain seized the opportunity of has-
tening into the boat, from whence he waved his
handerchief to us in token of friendship, as long
*s we could perceive him.
Left to ourselves, we were conversing on the
kindness of the captain, when Tommy came to
m'e to beg that I would open his pocket book;
it shut with a secret spring, which I soon found
out, and there fell from it a paper, that on ex-
amination, proved to be a bank bill for five hun-
dred pounds sterling, accompanied by the words
written on the tablets: "Present of Sir Edward
Walter to his little Friend."
Thanks to the liberality of the Captain, our
child was now secured against want, and all our
prospects were flattering. The voyage, which
was a favourable one, did not appear tiresome,
though we could not form an acquaintance with
any of those on board the vessel, not one of whom
spoke a word of French. We remained but three
days at Plymouth, to rest ourselves, and receive
the amount of our bank bill. We travelled post
to Dover, and embarked on board the packet for
Joyful Arrival in France. 213
Calais. My mother's health obliged us to stay-
some days in this town; she had several attacks
of fever; 1 called in the most celebrated physician,
and our cares soon re-established her. We were
now in France, but our most ardent wish was not
yet accomplished; we sighed for the place of our
nativity; the soil which our fathers had inhabited
seemed alone capable of supplying the place of
the pleasant and peaceable retreat of our island.
We left Calais in the Diligence; the journey was
not fatiguing; we had very pleasant companions,:
and the charms of interesting conversation di-
verted the extreme impatience we felt to arrive
at our journey's end. At length we reached
Brest, and scarcely allowing ourselves time to
take a slight repast, mounted a little carriage,
and in less than an hour, were in sight of the
steeple of our village church. Tears of joy filled
our eyes; every object we recognised made our
hearts palpitate—" There is the church which was
built at the last mission—here is the fine ave-
nue of lime trees which leads to the village—we
are now on the spot where the old men meet to
talk over their affairs, where the young folks
dance to the sound of rural music, and the chil-
dren engage in the noisy sports suited to their
age." We alighted at the door of the parsonage-
house; the worthy curate was informed of (oqr
arrival; he hastened to us, clasped us in his arias,
and with parental embrace, blessed that Provi-
dence which had preserved us in so many dan-
gers, and had conducted us back to our home.
"Mary," said he to his cook, "we ought to kill
the fatted calf to celebrate the return of the prod-
igal son; but he must content himself with a
young lamb, with which I intended to have regaled
my brethren at the village festival; but these are
my children, and ought to have the preference."
The good curate led us to his study, where we
recited to him minutely all that had befallen us.
He was pleased with my conduct and sentiments,
and made many judicious reflections on the hap-
piness of having received a Christian education,
and seen virtuous examples, the impressions of
which are never effaced from the mind : he was
much affected at the history of Tommy, and re-
turned thanks to God for having snatched this
child from, death, and from the darkness of
idolatry.
We afterwards spoke of our affairs; we had
spent but six thousand francs out of the sum
which we had in our charge. We begged our
stor to convey the casket to the hands of
adame d'Altamont's heirs, and to ask them

to allow three months for selling a piece of land,
to enable us to repay the two thousand crowns we
had taken from thence. The farmer who rented
our house and the land attached to it, was far
from being an industrious man, consequently
managed his affairs very ill; he agreed that we
should take the property into our hands, allowing
him a compensation of four thousand francs.
This money was drawn from that belonging to
Tommy, and we bought in his name, a farm con-
tiguous to our estate, which brought in a rental
of five hundred francs.
We again took possession of our house and
lands, where every thing was in a very bad con-
dition, but we had the power and inclination to
improve our estate; I resolved to establish myself
there in the honourable occupation of a cultiva-
tor; it is known how much I loved labour; I had
sufficient capacity to acquire, in a short time, an
insight into rural economy, and my taste led me
to follow it.
The curate returned from Brest accompanied
by two of the principal heirs of Madame d'Alta-
mont; in the transports of their joy and gratitude,
there was nothing they would not have done for
us. An unjust process had been commenced
against them, which the papers we had saved in-
sured their gaining. They would net allow us
to mention the restitution we wished to make,
but pressed on my mother's acceptance a very
valuable ring, as a token of their gratitude.
Providence had highly blessed our labours; out
affairs are prosperous; we are in easy circumstan-
ces; our mutual attachment rendered us ashappy
as it is possible to be in this world. Our respec-
table pastor has undertaken the education of
Tommy; and when he is ten years of age, I in-
tend to send him to college, that he may, on
some future day, be fit to fill that station of life
which may suit his genius.
Beloved by our neighbours, to whom we have
often the happiness of rendering ourselveB useful,
content with our mediocrity, and enjoying do-
mestic tranquillity, we make all who surround
us partake of our happiness. Our servants are
treated as our children; we employ the laborious
poor in preference to others; and a prudent
economy, the distinguishing characteristic of my
mother, enables us to perform some charities.
It is thus that Heaven has led us, after the sever-
est trials, to a condition the most desirable, and
the most exempt from care.
I beg my young readers to take notice how
useful it is to acquire betimes a knowledge of

things in general, to accustom themselves to fa.
tigue,and to the inclemency of the weather; to ban-
ish vain fears,and to prepare their minds for every
event. Those which chequer the life of man are
so varied, that it is impossible to foresee the sit-
uation into which we may be thrown; but patience
and courage are powerful defences in all circum-
stances; with their help, and the protection of
Heaven, there is no obstacle we may not sur-
mount, no misfortune which we may not over-
come.
