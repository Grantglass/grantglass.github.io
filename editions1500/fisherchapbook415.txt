ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



This person, whose life and adventures have been 
made immortal by Daniel Defoe, an author not 
so well known as Shakespeare and Scott, but 
whose name will descend to posterity with theirs,

early filled with rambling thoughts, and though, 
when he grew up, his father was anxious to settle 
him in business, while his mother used the ten- 
derest entreaties, yet nothing could prevail upon 
him to lay aside his desire of going to sea. He

notwithstanding the uneasiness and distress which 
his father and mother showed at his leaving thorn

my glass, and ascended the hill, when I beheld 
an English ship lying at anchor some distance 
from the shore. 

The joy I felt on this occasion I .shall not de- 
scribe. I flung my arms round Friday's neck, 
and bathed his faithful bosom with tears. We 
made a large fire at night, to convince the crew 
that there were people on the island. They let 
us know they perceived us by firing a gun ; and 
the next morning, the captain and some sailors 
came on shore, at the sight of whom my joy was 
so great, that I fell down on the ground speechless. 

The captain and Friday assisted in raising me 
from the ground ; and when I was recovered, I 
entreated the captain to take me on board, to which 
he readily consented, and gave me a suit of his 
clothes. I packed up my goat-skin dress, and the 
money 1 found in my ship that was wrecked, and 
went on board ; Friday and the rest follow^ed, 
bringing my dog and parrot with them. 

After a prosperous voyage we landed in Old 
England, after 1 had been absent from it thirty- 
seven years ! On my arrival at York, I was 
very much shocked to hear that both of my 
])arents were dead ; but was somewhat consoled 
when I found they had forgiven me, and left me 
all their property.
