DANIEL'DEFOE.

THE author of Robinson Crusoe would be entitled to a promi-
nent place in the history of our literature, even had he never
given to the world that truly admirable production; and yet
we may reasonably question whether the name of Defoe would
not long ago have sunk into oblivion, or at least have been
known, like those of most of his contemporaries, only to the
curious student, were it not attached to a work whose popu-
larity has been rarely equalled--never, perhaps, excelled.
Even as it is, the reputation due to the writer has been nearly
altogether absorbed in that of his hero, and in the all-engrossing
interest of his adventures : thousands who have read Robinson
Crusoe with delight, and derived from it a satisfaction in no wise
diminished by repeated perusal, have never bestowed a thought
on its author, or, indeed, regarded it in the light of a literary
performance. While its fascination has been universally felt,
the genius that conceived it, the talent that perfected it, have
been generally overlooked, merely because it is so full of
nature and reality as to exhibit no invention or exertion on
the part of the author, inasmuch as he appears simply to have
recorded what actually happened, and consequently only to
have committed to paper plain matter of fact, without study or
embellishment. We wonder at and are struck with admiration
by the powers of Shakspeare or Cervantes; with regard to
Defoe we experience no similar feelings: it is not the skill of

the artist that enchants us, but the perfect naturalness of the
A 3
picture, which is such that we mistake it for a mirror; so that
every reader persuades himself that he could write as well,
perhaps better, were be but furnished with the materials for
an equally interesting narrative.

There are many circumstances in Defoe's own history that
would recommend it to the notice of the biOgrapher, inde-
pendently of his claims as the author of Robinson; among
which are the variety and extraordinary number of his literary
performances, amounting to no fewer than two hundred and
nine different publications; and the no less singular fact that
the masterpiece of his genius was not only his first essay in
that species of composition, but was not produced till he was
far advanced in years, he having then arrived at a period of
life when the generality of authors close their literary career ;
and when the powers of imagination either lose much of
their vigour, or become altogether torpid. Nor will our
surprise at Defoe's industry, and the almost unprecedented
fertility of his pen, be at all diminished by considering that he
was not a recluse student or professed scholar, but was engaged
in trade and various other speculations. In one respect,
however, his mercantile occupations contributed to lay the
foundation of his excellence as a novel writer, since there can
be little doubt that it is to his actual experience of the sea,
and his acquaintance with other countries, we are indebted for
that truth and spirit which animate the more interesting parts
of Robinson Crusoe; while his manly good sense, unaffected
earnestness, and fund of native intelligence have placed him

very far above those who presumed to undervalue his literary
acquirements.

According to the latest and most copious of all his biogra-
phers, Daniel Defoe was born in 1661, two years earlier than
the generally assigned date of his birth. His father was a
butcher in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate; and appears
to have been a citizen in easy circumstances, although his
trade was one that confers no particular lustre on a pedigree.
It is usual to affect some degree of astonishment when we read
of men whose after fame presents a striking contrast to the
humility of their origin; yet we must recollect that it is not
ancestry and splendid descent, but education and circumstances
which form the man; and in this respect the middling classes
possess a decided advantage over those either below or above
them; for if the former are precluded from cultivating their
talents and abilities, the latter generally consider themselves
exempt from the necessity of doing so, and accordingly content
themselves with cultivating mere external accomplishments, in
preference to exercising their mental energies. Those on the
contrary who are placed in a middle station, while they are
not debarred from the means of application, feel that stimulus
to exertion which arises from the desire of acquiring fortune
or fame. The history of such men as Ximenes, Wolsey,
Alberoni, and Napoleon, may, indeed, justly excite our won-
(161' 3--When, too, we behold unlettered genius emerging, in.
spite of every obstacle, from the obscurity to which it seemed
condemned, as in a Fergusson, a Duval, a Burns, and an Opie,
we may be permitted to eipress our astonishment; but as
regards his origin, the history of Defoe is that of thousands who
have afterwards raised themselves into comparative elevation,
by the display of their powers. The solicitude, therefore, so
generally displayed by biographers, on similar occasions, to
trace some consanguinity with a more dignified branch of their
families, for those whose native obscurity -seems to demand
some apology, betrays a rather mistaken policy. However
this may be, it is certain that it is quite as honourable for
Defoe to have ascended from a butcher as it would have been
to have descended from the Conqueror himself.

One undoubted and very great advantage, for which Defoe
was indebted to his parents, who were nonconformists, was an
education superior to what it was then usual for persons in
their station to bestow upon their children; and they were
careful also to implant in his youthful mind that regard for
religion, and that strict moral integrity which afterwards
displayed themselves not only in his writings, but his conduct
through life. And this rectitude of principle he most unequi-
vocally evinced when his misfortunes put it so severely to the
proof. At about the age of fourteen he was placed under the
tuition of the Rev. Charles Morton, of Newington Green,
who was afterwards vice-president of Harvard College, New
England; and from various incidental remarks in his own
works, it appears that young'Defoe now entered upon an
extensive course of studies, and made considerable proficiency
in languages, mathematics, philosophy, history, and theology ;
although the natural liveliness of his disposition unfitted him
forthat severe application which is necessary to form a profound
scholar in any one of those pursuits.

It was the intention of his parents that'he should embracexii BIOGRAPHICAL sxs'rcn or

the clerical profession, which their religious feelings, and
probably a very pardonable ambition, induced them to select
for him; yet, notwithstanding his regard for the sacred oflice,
he was unwilling to embrace it himself; or events, at least,
diverted his talents into another channel. The political and
religious excitements of that period were contagious for one of
Defoe's temper: he assumed the character of the patriot as
soon as he cast off that of the boy, and espoused the side of
the popular party with all the ardour of youth; nor was it
long before he had opportunities of distinguishing himself.
He was a warm advocate for the Bill of Exclusion, passed by
the Commons to prevent the succession of the Duke of York
to the throne; and regarded with abhorrence that spirit of
despotism which sentenced Sydney and so many others to
the scaffold. At the age of twenty-one he commenced author,
which employment he continued for nearly half a century,
and that, too, almost uninterruptedly, notwithstanding his
various speculations of a different nature. It cannot be ex--
pected that in a sketch of this nature we should attempt to
give any thing like a connected account of Defoe's various
literary performances, they being too numerous and multi-
farious for us to advert to them separately, even if we conceived
that by so doing we should greatly interest the readers of this
--the most distinguished of them all. But the truth is, the
majority of them are of that class which it is rather the
province of the bibliographer than the critic to describe. We
may, however, here mention the first production of his pen,
which, under the singular title of " Speculum Craps-gown-
orum," was a reply to a publication of Roger L'Estrange's, a
noted party writer of that day. In this work Defoe indulged
in rather intemperate language, and while vindicating the
dissenters, reflected in too hostile and indiscriminate a manner
upon the established clergy. This was succeeded by a " Trea-
tise against the Turks," occasioned by the war between them
and the Imperialists ; and was penned by Defoe for the purpose
of showing his countrymen that if it was the interest of pro-
testantism not to increase the influence of a Catholic power, it
was infinitely more so to oppose a Mahommedan one; which,
however debateable it might appear to politicians, was almost
too obvious a truism to be entitled to any merit for its sagacity.
It is the fate of political publications quickly to fall into
oblivion after the events which call them forth have passed
away: the reputation derived from them is as transitory as
the events themselves, or if the fame of the writer occasionally
descends to posterity, it is more than can be affirmed of his
writings.

Shortly after this, Defoe proved that he was as ready to
support the doctrines he advocated by the sword, as by the
pen: he accordingly joined the standard of the Duke of
Monmouth, when the latter landed in England with the view
of expelling a Catholic prince from the throne, and seating
himself upon it as the defender of protestantism. The issue
of that adventure, and the subsequent fate of the unfortunate,
, if not perfectly innocent, Monmouth are well known. Happier
than the leader of the enterprise, it was Defoe's better luck to
escape; he returned to the'metropolis in safety; and, aban-
doning politics and warfare, was content for a while to turn
his attention to the more humble but less stormy pursuits of
trade.

He now became a hosier, or rather a hose-factor, that is a
kind of agent between the manufacturer and retailer; and,
according to Mr. Chalmers, he continued to carry on this
concern from 16% to 1695. It was about two years after he
had thus established himself, that he was admitted a liveryman
of London, on the 26th of January, 1687-8. Business, how-
ever, did not so entirely absorb his attention but that he found -
time to engage in the various controversies that agitated the
public mind, and which were occasioned by the arbitrary '
measures of James, who, feeling himself secure after the
removal of so dangerous an enemy as Monmouth, began more
openly to favour the Catholics, and to dispense with the tests
intended to prevent their accepting commissions in the army.
This of course excited both the alarm and indignation of the
Protestants, which were by no means allayed by the tempo-
rizing servility of their own clergy, who exerted their eloquence
in favour of the king's prerogative. Among those who attacked
the doctrine of the dispensing power was Defoe; nor, as may
well be imagined, was he afterwards an unconcerned spectator
of the Revolution, whose progress he had minutely watched,
and whose anniversary he continued yearly to celebrate as a
day marked by the deliverance of his country from political
and religious tyranny. His attachment to the new sovereign
was confirmed by the personal notice shown him both by that
prince and his consort; for the " butcher's son" had had the
honour of an early introduction to the royal presence.

At this period Defoe resided at Tooting in Surrey, and he
had now launched out into more extensive commercial specula-
tions, having embarked in the Spanish and Portuguese trade,
so that he might fairly claim the title of merchant. The precise
time of his going to Spain, whether before or after the revo-
lution, cannot be ascertained; but he not only made a voyage
thither, but stayed some time in the country, and acquired a
knowledge of the language. Sincere as was his attachment
to the purer tenets of protestantism, it did not degenerate into
blind prejudice, nor prevent him from doing justice to catholics;
he has accordingly, in his Robinson Crusoe, represented the
Spanish character under its most amiable traits, and in a tone
that may almost pass for panegyric. This voyage, as we have
already remarked, doubtlessly contributed to store his ob-
servant mind with many materials for those descriptions of the
perils and adventures common to a seafaring life, that so

strongly excite the sympathy of those who follow his hero
across the trackless deep. Nor was he without some expe-
rience of shipwreck, if not actually in his own person, by the
loss of a vessel in which he was a shareholder, and which was
wrecked in a violent storm off the coast of Biscay. It was
about this period also that he traded with Holland; probably
for civet, as one of his enemies has sneeringly styled him a
" civet-cat merchant." Besides this he visited some other
parts of the continent, particularly Germany; he did not, how-
ever, relinquish his hose-agency business in consequence of
his other engagements. But commercial enterprise did not
prove for him the road to wealth: on the contrary, his specu-
lations involved him in such embarrassments that, in 1692, he
was obliged to abscond from his creditors. A commission of
bankruptcy was taken out against him, yet it was afterwards
superseded, those to whom he was most in debt agreeing to
accept a composition on his own bond; and he not only
punctually discharged these claims, but, after he had some-
what retrieved his circumstances, voluntarily repaid the re-
mainder. This is so much the more to his honour, since so
far from having met with many precedents of similar probity
in others, his misfortunes had been in some degree occasioned
by the knavery of unprincipled men, who, availing themselves
of the impunity held out to them by the supineness or the
impotency of the law, were then accustomed to set their cre-
ditors at defiance in the most harefaced manner.

It was Defoe himself who first called the attention of the
legislature to the intolerable abuses which arose from those
sanctuaries, as they were termed, for criminals and debtors,
which then existed in the metropolis ; and to him, consequently,
may we be said to be indebted for the abatement of a nuisance
as disgraceful to the national character, as it was injurious to
the industrious and honest portion of the community.

With the view of assisting him in his distress some of his
friends now came forward and offered to settle him as a factor
at Cadiz; yet, advantageous as the proposal was, he declined
it, preferring to endeavour to retrieve his finances by his pen.
The country being then engaged in an expensive war with
France, Defoe proposed a scheme to assist the government in
raising " the ways and means ;" and some time afterwards he
received the appointment of accountant to the commissioners
of the glass duty; but it proved only a temporary one, as the
duty was repealed in August, 1699. Probably it was also
about the same period that he became secretary to the tile-
works at Tilbury, in which concern he embarked some money,
and was again a sufi'erer. His " Essay on Projects," pub-
lished in January, 1696-7, shows him to have been, if not a
very successful speculator himself, at least a very ingenious
and fertile deviser of theoretical plans; most of which must
be allowed to have the welfare of society in view; nor have
they been without influence in leading to many improvements
of later times: among those which have been practically
adopted we may mention his scheme for Friendly Societies
and Savings' Banks. Were any testimony required in favour
of this work, it would be sufficient to quote that of the cele-
brated Franklin, who confesses that the impressions he received
from it gave a strong bias to his own pursuits.

If not invariably employed in the active defence of public
morals, Defoe's pen was too honest to betray their interests on
any occasion: it was not always that his topics called for, or
even admitted, any direct inculcation of virtue, but whenever
they did, he displayed his earnestness in its behalf. His pub-
licatiou entitled " The Poor Man's Plea," is a very keen piece
of satire, with a considerable touch of humour. levelled against
the vices of the upper classes of society, in which he urges them
to discountenance by their own conduct the immorality they
deem so reprehensible in the vulgar. The stage too did not
escape his castigation: and really its transgressions were at
that period so barefaced and audacious, so offensive even to
common decency, that, whatever infamy there may have been
in either tolerating or in attempting to defend such a system
of lewdness, there could be no great triumph in exposing that
which did not even attempt to conceal itself.

We have now to notice our author in a somewhat different
character--namely, as a candidate for poetical fame. His
satire, entitled the " Trueborn Englishman," which was.
written for the purpose of averting from the king the abusive
reflections cast upon him as a foreigner, had indeed a very
great run at the time ; more, however, on account of the matter
than of the manner; since both that and all Defoe's other
attempts of the kind convince us, that, like the great Roman
orator, he was an intolerably bad poet, and not even a decent
versifier. Yet could gratitude and enthusiastic devotion to
his prince have supplied that inspiration which the muses
denied him, Defoe's poetry would have been of first-rate excel-
lence, so sincere was his admiration of, so zealous was his
devotion to, William III. The various effusions in rhyme,
and the numerous political pamphlets and tracts which he
published at this interval, we must pass by, and come directly
to an event that obtained for our author a rather unenviable
species of distinction. The reign of Anne commenced with
much violence and with cabals between the respective church
parties, leading to controversies that rather fanned than allayed
the public ferment. On such an occasion, it was not to be ex-
pected that Defoe would remain passive; assuming the furious
tone of the high-churchmen of the day, against the dissenters,
he published a small pamphlet which was in reality a satire
upon the writings which that party had issued from the press;
but the irony was so fine, and the imitation so' exact, that while
it was supposed by them to utter the real sentiments of the
writer, it was also interpreted by those whom it was intended
to serve, as coming from a violent enemy. The " Shortest
\Vay with the Dissenters"--such was its title, created an
amazing sensation; and on its real object being exposed, the
high-church party became as fierce in their indignation, as
they had before been warm in their applause. The author
was detected, a reward offered for his apprehension, and he
himself sentenced to be imprisoned in Newgate, and to stand
in the pillory; but the attendance of his friends and the en-
thusiasm of the populace in favour of the champion of religious
liberty, converted an ignominious punishment into a triumph,
so that his enemies had as little reason to exult in their victory,
as to be proud of the sagacity they had displayed. If, however,
this event rather increased than diminished Defoe's reputation,
it had a different efl'ect upon his pecuniary afl'airs ; his confine-
ment in Newgate prevented his attending any longer to his
concern at Tilbury, the consequence of which was that it was
obliged to be given up; and thus Defoe saw himself deprived
at once of what had been the source of a handsome income, for
before this affair he was in such thriving circumstances as to
be able to keep his coach. According to his own statement,
he lost three thousand five hundred pounds, a far more con-
siderable sum at that period than it would be now. There
was indeed one way of both speedily and safely repairing his
finances, namely by accepting the overtures made him by the
ministry, who would gladly have enlisted in their own cause
that pen which had proved so powerful against them: but
Defoe was too independent of soul and too high-principled to
purchase his release upon terms that would inflict upon him
the disgrace the pillory had failed to effect. '

Although a prison is not the most congenial place for lite-
rary pursuits, our author availed himself of the time which the
loss of his liberty afforded him, of occupying his unwelcome
leisure from all other business in writing both in verse and
prose. It was here that he published his poem on the " Re-
formation of Manners," a suficiently cepions theme in every
age, and afterwards continued the subject in another, entitled
" More Reformation ;" in which he alludes to his own situa-
tion in the following nervous lines, describing himself as

" A modern tool,
To wit, to parties, and himself a fool;
Embroil'd with states to do himself no good,
And by his friends themselves misunderstood;
Misconstrned first in every word he said,--
By these nnpitied, and by those unpaid."

Here we may truly say facit indignatio verses, for the caustic
tone and antithesis are not unworthy of Pope himself. The
political controversial pieces which he sent forth to the world
from his " place of durance vile," were too numerous for us
to specify them, we therefore prefer speaking of a work of
more permanent interest, one in which he may be regarded as
the immediate predecessor of two of the most popular and
admired of our classic writers in the days of Anne--namely,
Steele and Addison. Defoe's " Review," which commenced

Feb. 19. 1704, deserves to be considered as the prototype of
our Tatlers and Spectators; and may earn for its author the
appellation of the Father of English Essayists; since not--
withstanding that political intelligence and discussion consti-
tuted a great portion of its contents, it touched upon a variety
of other topics bearing upon literature, manners, and morals;
while it was itself hardly in any degree indebted for this part
of its plan to preceding or contemporary publications. Uni-
formly assailing vice, or exposing to just ridicule the follies
and foibles of society, Defoe varied his mode of attack, at one
time employing grave reasoning and serious remonstrance;
at another, substituting sarcasm, humour, wit, and pleasantry
for monitory reproof. To a modern reader, indeed, many of
the topics might seem to lack invention, and to be rather
commonplace, merely because they have been so repeatedly
handled by later writers, that both the wit and argument dis-
played in them have lost their freshness. This circumstance,
however, does not detract from Defoe's intrinsic merit, or from
the praise due to him as an originator: on the contrary, he,
in this respect, only shares the fate common to all those who
open a new path in literature or art, inviting imitators whose
numbers oppress, if they do not overwhelm them: that Defoe
has not since been surpassed in this species of writing is far
more than we can venture to assert; yet it should be recol-
lected that it is the first navigator of the Atlantic, not those
who cross it in a modern steam--boat, who claims the homage
of our admiration.

Those who are unacquainted with Defoe the essayist as well
as Defoe the novelist, will not be able to appreciate the extent
of our author's powers, and the variety of his information.
But we have already dwelt upon the " Review" at greater
length than is consistent with the brevity we must perforce
observe; it is time therefore to proceed with our narrative.
Mr. Harley, afterwards earl of Oxford, happened by a change
in the ministry to come into power, after Defoe had been about
two years in confinement, and being able to appreciate his
abilities--perhaps anxious to secure them in his own support,
he represented his case to the queen, who generously sent a
sum of money to his wife and family, and another to discharge
his fine and prison expenses. Immediately upon his liberation
Defoe retired to Bury St. Edmund's. It was there that he
wrote his masterly treatise, entitled " Giving Aims no Charity,"
in which he displays great practical knowledge, with enlarged
and sound views on the causes of poverty, and on the employ-
ment of the poor. In the intervals of these and other occupa-
tions, for it should be observed that he had been sent in 1706
by Harley on a secret mission to the continent, the express
object of which has not transpired,--he found leisure to employ
his pen on other subjects, and anticipating his future character
of a romance writer, he invented the " true narrative" of Mrs.
Veal's apparition, which was prefixed to a translation of Drelin-
court on Death. The supposed stranger from the other world
is made to recommend that performance; and, as such super-
natural testimony was irresistible, the whole impression, which
had before lain on the bookseller's shelves, was quickly sold.
_ and was succeeded by many others, the work having since
passed through forty difi'erent editions. This stratagem cer-
tainly does honour to Defoe's ingenuity and penetration; yet
whether it be entirely justifiable, considering the tendency of
the deception, may be doubted.

Leaving for awhile the account of his literary career, we
must now briefly notice a very important national subject.
namely, the Union with Scotland, in which, besides warmly
advocating the measure with his pen, Defoe was personally
employed. At the recommendation of Harley and Lord Go-
dolphin, by whom he had been recommended to the queen, he
was sent on a mission to Edinburgh, in which city he arrived
in October, 1706. Here, it should seem, he was chiefly em~
played in making calculations relating to trade and taxes, for
the information of the committees of parliament; he also occu-
pied himself in collecting those documents relative to the
Union, which he afierwards published. Besides this, be pro-
posed several plans for encouraging the manufactures, and for
promoting the trade, wealth, and maritime resources of Scot-
land. After an absence of about sixteen months, he returned
to England in 1708, when his services obtained for him, from
the ministry, an appointment with a fixed salary; and as it
does not appear what was the nature of the office he held, we
may conclude it to have been merely a sinecure. Almost
immediately afterwards, his patron Harley was dismissed from
office, through the persevering intrigues of the duchess of
Marlborough, whom he had supplanted in the queen's favour;
an event that suddenly overclouded Defoe's political prospects.
Without compromising his principles, however, he espoused
the interests of the succeeding ministry; but although Godol-
phin treated him with consideration, he suffered his pension
to fall into arrears, perhaps in consequence of Defoe's long
absence in Scotland, whither he was again dispatched a few
months afterwards, upon some secret business. In the follow-
ing year, 1709, Defoe published a work which, to use the
words of an eminent living critic, " places him amongst the
soundest historians of the day ;" and which, according to the
testimony of another, would have handed down his name to
posterity, even had he not immortalized himself by Robinson
Crusoe. This was his " History of the Union," which is as
interesting for the minute descriptions it gives of the actors
and incidents in that important event, as for the documents it
furnishes.

Still engaged in politics, Defoe's continued and severe
attacks against the Tories and high-church party so exaspe-
rated them that they attempted to suppress his writings, and
even threatened him with prosecutions: their animosity, how-
ever, did not procure for him, from those whose cause he
defended, a degree of favour and support at all commensurate
with his long and able services. He had also to contend with
fresh pecuniary losses in some concern in which he was engaged
(1712) with Mr. Wood. a mercer of Coleshill in Warwick'shire;
and with the personal abuse with which his character was
assailed by writers who reflected upon him as being a knavish
bankrupt. But his political career was now drawing to its
close: having carried on his " Review" for more than nine
years, he finally relinquished it in May, 1713, when he was
again a prisoner in Newgate upon an indictment preferred
against him by his friends the Whigs, as the author of three
treasonable Jacobitical pamphlets; whereas the publications
in question were of a directly opposite tendency. The queen
once more bestowed a free pardon on him, and the malice of
his numerous enemies was defeated. From this time be em-
ployed his pen only occasionally on political subjects. By the
accession of George I. to the throne, Defoe gained nothing,
although his writings had strenuously pleaded the cause of the -
House of Hanover during the late reign; and although he had
superior claims upon public gratitude for the zeal with which,
during nearly thirty years, he had not only advocated religious
and political independence, but endeavoured to call attention
to subjects of paramount importance to the national prosperity.
That this neglect should, in spite of all his philosophy, have
occasioned him considerable mortification, is not much to be
wondered at: and to the effect it had upon his health was
attributed an apoplectic attack in the year 1715, from which
he continued to suffer for six months.
After so serious a blow to his constitution, and at his
advanced period of life, it might have been expected that he
would now lay aside his pen,----at least remit in his exertions.
Yet it was subsequently to this apparently cloudy epoch of
his career that the brightest and most durable of his literary
wreaths was won; Great versatility of talent is not often
accompanied by an equal degree of vigour and raciness of
intellect; when, however, such does happen to be the case,
it should seem that the former is rather beneficial than other-
wise to its possessor, and that change of subject serves to
recruit the mental energies. Defoe at least may be quoted as
an extraordinary instance of rejuvenacency of mind in the
decline of years. We do not here allude to his " Family
Instructor," although that performance is one of the most
valuable and useful systems of practical morality in our lan-
guage, and has, doubtless, been far more beneficial to society,
than many works of even splendid celebrity. It is the series
of novels which now appeared in quick succession from his
pen, that have won for him an imperishable reputation among
the worthies of English literature; nor will his claims upon
our admiration be diminished by considering the extravagant,
unnatural system of romance-writing which had till then pre-
vailed, where every thing was either so artificial or so shadowy,
that not a glimpse of real life was to be discerned. In Defoe's
narratives, on the contrary, there is such an air of downright
matter-of-fact and unadorned truth, as to amount to actual
deception; thereby preventing us from crediting the author
with any merit on the score of imagination, contrivance, or
invention. Of this the reader will be amply convinced by the
perusal of the present work, on which it is not necessary that we
should expatiate, and we shall therefore merely advert to the
circumstances connected with its origin and publication. The
History of Robinson Crusoe was first published in the year
1719, and its popularity may be said to have Been established
immediately, since four editions were called for in about as
many months, a circumstance at that time almost unprece-
dented in the annals of literature. It rarely happens that an
author's expectations are surpassed by the success of his work,
however astonishing it may seem to others; yet perhaps even
Defoe himself did not venture to look forward to such a wel--
come on the part of the public, after the repulses he had expe-
rienced on that of the booksellers; for, incredible as it now
appears, the manuscript of the work had been offered to, and
rejected by, every one in the trade, in which respect its destiny
was not only similar to that of Paradise Lost, but of two of
the most celebrated literary productions of the present day.
namely, Waverley and Cbilde Harold; the former of which
remained in manuscript ten years, without any probability of
ever seeing the light, although its fame has since extended
itself wherever the English language is known--nay more, has
even penetrated the wilds of Siberia.

Astonishing as was the success of Defoe's romance, it did
not deter the envious from attempting to disparage it. The
materials, it was said, were either furnished by, or surrepti-
tiously obtained from, Alexander Selkirk, a mariner who had
resided for four years in the desert island of Juan Fernandez,
and returned to England in 1711. Very probably, his story,
which then excited considerable interest and attention, did
suggest to Defoe the idea of writing his romance; but all the
details and incidents are entirely his own. Most certainly .
Defoe had obtained no papers or written documents from Sel~
kirk, as the latter had none to communicate. So far, however,
have others been from taxing our author with plagiarism, that
they have, on the contrary, charged him with putting on paper
a heap of chimaaras, to impose upon public credulity. Thus
these two contradictory charges reciprocally destroy each other.
An attempt has also been made to rob him entirely of the
brightest jewel in his literary crown, by denying him to have
been the author of Robinson Crusoe, which has been ascribed,
by some, to Arbuthnot; by others, to Defoe's patron, the first
earl of Oxford. Those who have wished to gain credit for the
latter opinion, assert that it was composed by that nobleman
during his imprisonment in the Tower, in 1715, on a charge of
high treason: and they have argued that the whole tone of the
work, especially of that part towards the conclusion where an
account is given of the exiled nobles of Muscovy, is what would
naturally be suggested by the solitude of a prison. Yet as far
as internal evidence is concerned, that is, indisputably, much
stronger in favour of Defoe; for he had not only been familiar
with imprisonment, but was also by his acquaintance with
foreign countries, and his experience in business and traffic,
much better qualified to produce a work which displays so
much practical knowledge of things, as well as of man. In~
deed, nothing short of the most conclusive and undeniable
testimony of facts to the contrary, can at all invalidate his
claims to be considered as the real author. Had Robinson
Crusoe been the only production of the kind that proceeded'
from his pen, there might be better reason for doubting whether
he wrote it; but the various other novels, or rather pieces of
fictitious biography, which he produced, form an additional
reason for attributing it to him.

Of these latter we must here speak far more briefly than
they deserve: the " History of Moll Flanders," which was
published in 1721, is an admirably drawn picture of life, and
contains an excellent moral lesson, although many of the scenes
it necessarily discloses are coarse and revolting. The " Life of
Colonel Jaque" contains also much able delineation of real
life ; and in that part of the narrative which gives an account of
the hero's residence in Virginia, Defoe has humanely advocated
the cause of the negro slaves. His " Memoirs of a Cavalier,"
which work is supposed to have been written about the same
time, is rather history attired in the form of an imaginary piece
of biography, than a romance. Indeed, all the details are so
circumstantial and accurate, that it has been mistaken for a
genuine narrative of the events of the civil wars in England
and Germany; and it was actually recommended as the very
best account of them, by the great Lord Chatham, with whom
it was a favourite book. In like manner our author's " His--
tory of the Plague" imposed upon Dr. Mead, and since upon
others, who have referred to it as an authentic document, and
a true recital of that great national calamity. Here he is the
rival of Thucydides and Boccaccio; and depicts the horrors of
pestilence as vividly and as masterly as Poussin. It may
however be imagined by some that this is rather suspicious
praise, and that the work of fiction which can pass as true
history must be cold, matter-of--fact, and tame; repulsive and
dry. It is not, however, in the formal gravity of style that
these works resemble history; but they imitate and reflect the
features of the past in their most interesting, if not their most
engaging aspect.

Besides the preceding, and one or two other productions of
a similar cast, Defoe produced that very excellent and popular
work entitled " Religious Courtship," which was first pub-
lished in 1722, and afterwards went through numerous editions.
This and his " Family Instructor" are replete with lessons of
the soundest practical wisdom, and place their author among
the most extensively useful of our English moralists.

Here, however, we must terminate our sketch, having barely
left ourselnes room to mention a few particulars relative to
the close of his life. Although the profits accruing from his
publications had of late been considerable, and he had been
able to give a portion to his daughter Sophia, who married
Mr. Baker, the celebrated natural philosopher, in 1729; yet
he was still doomed to contend with misfortune. In addition
to the affliction of bodily infirmity and severe pain, he again
fell into great pecuniary difficulties, and was even arrested.
He appears, however, to have recovered his liberty within a
short time; but the unnatural conduct of his son who refused
to give up the property that had been intrusted to him, with
the view of securing a provision to his mother and two un-
married sisters, was a heavier blow than any he had before
experienced; and the mental anguish it occasioned, doubtless
accelerated his death, which occurred on the 24th of April,
1731. Since that period just a century has now elapsed; and
in that interval many names of considerable eminence in their
day have sunk into irretrievable oblivion; Defoe, also, has lost
some portion of the celebrity he enjoyed with his contempo-
raries; yet after every deduction, enough remains to entitle
him to a place among the \Vorthies of English literature, for

should all his other productions be forgotten, his Robinson
Crusoe must remain imperishable.
 

SECTION I.

ROBINSON'S FAMILY, l-L'l'Co--HIS ELOI'EMENT FROM HIS PARENTS.

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner
of Bremen, named Kreutznaer, who settled first at Hull. He
got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade,
lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married my
mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good
family in that country, and after whom I was so called, that is
to say, Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves,
and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions always
called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colouel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. W hat
became of my second brother, I never knew, any more than
my father and mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
mly head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.
1v y father, who was very aged, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house education and a country free
school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would

B2 anvnxruass or

be satisfied with nothing but going to sea: and my inclination
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of
my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something
fatal in that propension of nature, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confincd
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this
subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a mere wander~
ing inclination, I had for leaving his house, and my native
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect
of raising my fortune, by application and industry, with a life
of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate
fortunes, on one hand, or of superior fortunes, on the other,
who went abroad upon adventures, aspiring to rise by enter-
prise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature
out of the common road; that these things were all either too
far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle
state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in
the world, the most suited to human happiness; not exposed
to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride,
luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind: he
told me, I might judge of the happiness of this state by one
thing, viz. that this was the state of life which all other people
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequences of being born to great things, and wished they
had been placed in the middle of two extremes, between the
mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to
this, as the just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to
have " neither poverty nor riches.' '

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
of mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disas-
ters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher
or lower part of mankind: nay, they were not subjected to so
many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as
those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies,
on one hand, or, by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
mean and insufficient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that tem-
perance, moderation. quietness, health, society, all agreeable
diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessingsROBINSON causon. 3

attending the middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out
of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the
head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and
the body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly
tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that

they are happy, and learning, by every day's experience, to
know it more sensibly. ,

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec-
tionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate
myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was
born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under
no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for
me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life
which he had been just recommending to me; and that if I
was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere
fate, or fault, that must hmder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in
warning me against measures which he knew would be to my
butt: in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me
if I would stay and settle at home as he directed; so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any
encouragement to go away: and, to close all, he told me I had
my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low
Country wars ; but could not prevail, his young desires prompt--
ing him to run into the army, where he was killed ; and though.
he said, he would not cease to pm for me, et he would
venture to say to me, that if I did take this foo ' h step, God
would not bless me; and I would have leisure, hereafter, to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be
none to assist in my recovery.

I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic, though, I suppose, my father did not know it to be
so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very
plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was
killed; and that, when he spoke of my having leisure to
repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke
of the discourse, and told me his heart was so full, he could
say no more to me.

I was sincerely afi'ected with this discourse; as, indeed,
who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home, according to my
father's desire. But alas! a few days were it all 03': and, in
short, to prevent any of my father's further importunities, in
a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.

a 24 ADVENTURES or

However, I did not act so hastily, neither, as my first heat of
resolution prompted; but I took my mother, at a time when I
thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her that
my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that
I should never settle to any thing with resolution enough to
go through with it, and my father had better give me his can-
sent than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen
years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I should never
serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me make but one voyage
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, 1 would go
no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to
recover the time I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me she
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such a subject; that he knew too well what was my inte-
rest to give his consent to an thing so much for my hurt; and
that she wondered how I cou d think of any such thing, after
such a discourse as I had from my father, and such kind and
tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me: and
that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for
me; but I might depend I should never have their consent to
it : that for her part, she would not have so much hand in my
destruction; and I should never have it to say, that my mother
was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him;
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to
her with a sigh, That boy might be happy, if he would stay 'at
home; but, if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose;
though in the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively de--
termined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me
to. But, being one day at Hull, whither I went casually, and
without any purpose of making an elopement at that time, and
one of my companions then going to London by sea in his
father's ship, and prompting me to go with them b the com-
mon allurement of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me
nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother
any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but lefi them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing, or
my father's, without any consideration of circumstances or
consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows.

SECTION II.

FIRST ADVENTURES AT SEA, AND EXPERIENCE OF A MARITIME LIFE--VOYAGE
TO GUINEA.

ON the lst of September, 165l, I went on board a ship bound
for London. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I
believe, began younger, or Continued longer, than mine. The
ship had no sooner got out of the Humber, than the wind
began to blow, and the waves to rise, in a most frightful man-
ner; and as I had never been at sea before, I was most inex-
pressibly sick in body and terrified in mind: I began now
seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I
was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven, for wickedly leav-
ing my father's house. All the good counsels of my parents,
my father's tears, and my mother's cntreaties, came now fresh
into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to
the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached
me with the contempt of advice, and the abandonment of my
dut .

Ayll this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had
never been upon before, went very high, though nothing like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few
days after; but, such as it was, enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known any thing of the ,
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,
and that every time the ship'fell down, as I thought, in the
trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and
in this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that
if it would please God to spare my life this voyage, if ever I
got my foot once on dry land, I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I
would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life; how easy, how

comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had been ex-

posed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved
:halt I would, like a true repeating prodigal, go home to my
at 181'.

These wise and sober thou hts continued during the storm,
and indeed some time after; at the next da , as the wind was
abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a 'ttle inured to it.
However, I was very grave that day, being also- a little sea-
sick still: but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind
was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun
went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a smooth'sea, the sun shining

upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that I
ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and
pleasant in a little time after.

And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my
companion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me, and
said, \Vell, Bob, clapping me on the shoulder, how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frightened, wa'n't you, last
night, when it blew but a cap-full of wind ?--A cap-full, do
you call it? said I; 'twas a terrible storm.----A storm, you
fool! replies he, do you call that a storm? Why, it was
nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we
think nothing of such a squall of wind as that: you are but a
fresh--water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a bowl of punch,
and we'll forget all that. D'ye see what charming weather 'tis
now? To make short this sad part of my story, we went the
way of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made
drunk with it; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned
all m repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct,
and a 1 my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea
was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness
by the abatement of the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up
by the sea forgotten, and the current of my former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises I had made
in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection;
and serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes ; but I shook them of and roused myself from them,
as it were from a distemper, and, applying myself to drink
and company, soon mastered the return of those tits,----for so I
called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a
victory over conscience as any young sinner, that resolved not
to be troubled with it, could desire. But I was to have ano<<-
ther trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases gene-
rally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse:
for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to
be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among
us would confess both the danger and the mercy of. The sixth
day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth Roads; the
wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had
made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to
come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days, dtlring which
time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same
roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for
a wind for the river Thames. We had not, however, rid here
so long, but we should have tided up the river, but that the
wind blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five days,
blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good
as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least appre-
hensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea. But the eighth day, in the morning,
the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our
topmasts, and make every thing snug and close, that the ship '
might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor;

so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered
out to the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the
seamen themselves. The master was vigilant in the business
of preserving the ship; but, as he went in and out of his cabin
by me, I could hear him softly say to himself several times,
Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we shall be all
undone! and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid,
lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot
describe my temper. I could ill reassume the first penitence,
which I had so apparent] trampled upon, and hardened my-
self against; I thought t at the bitterness of death had been
past, and that this would be nothing too, like the first: but
when the master himself came by me, as I said just now, and
said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I got
up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight
I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us
every three or four minutes. When I could look about, I
could see nothing but distress around us; two ships, that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board, being
deeply laden; and our men cried out that a ship. which rid
about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more ships,
being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to
sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running
away, with only their spritsails out, before the wind. Toward
evenin , the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship
to let t em cut away the foremast, which he was very loath to
do; but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the
ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the
ship so much, they were obliged to cut it away also, and make
a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this,
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright
before at but a little. But if I can express, at this distance.
the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold
more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions,
and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition,
that I can by no words describe it, but the worst was not come
yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen
themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. \Ve
had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and so wallowed in
the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder. It was my advantage, in one respect, that I
did not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired.
However, the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others, more
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every
moment the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the
night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men,
that had been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung
a leak; another said, there was four feet water in the hold.
Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very word,
my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell backwards
up0n the side of my bed, where I sat in the cabin. However.
the men roused me, and told me, that I, who was able to do
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another: at which
I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very heartily.
While this was doing, the master seeing some light colliers
who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and
run away to sea, and would not come near us, ordered us to
fire a gun, as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what
that meant, Was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke,
or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, , I was so
surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when every body had his own life to think of, no one minded
me, or what was become of me: but another man stepped up
to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie,
thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was
apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm
began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could
swim till we might run into a port, so the master continued
firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just
ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for
us to get on board, or for the boat to lie. near the ship's side;
till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern
with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which
they, after great labour and hazard, took hold of, and we
hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat.
It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat,
to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her
drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we
could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was
staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went awa to the
northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as inter-
ton-Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of
our ship when we saw her sink; and then I understood, for
the first time, what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea.
I must acknowledge, I had hardly eyes to look up when the
seamen told me, she was sinking; for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in.
My heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright,
firfly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet

fore me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when,
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the strand, to assist us
when we should come near; but we made slow way towards
the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past the
light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward,
towards Cromer, and so the land broke 03' a little the violence
of the wind. Here we got in, and, though not without much
difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot
to Yarmouth; where, as unfortunate men, we were used with
great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who
assigned us good quarters, as by the particular merchants and
owners of 'ships; and had mone given us suficient to
us either to London or back to all, as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone baa: to Hull, and
B
have gone home, I had been happy; and my father, an em-
blem of our. blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the
fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went in was cast
away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had
an assurance that I was not drowned.

Eut my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from
my reason, and my more composed judgment, to go home, yet
I had no power to do it.--I know not what to call this, nor will
I urge that it is a secret, overruling decree, that hurries us on
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it
be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could
have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and per-
suasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such
visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who
was the master's son, was now less forward than I: the first
time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town
to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it ap-
peared his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, he asked me how I did : telling his father
who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,
in order to go farther abroad. His father, turning to me, with
a grave and concerned tone, Young man, says he, you ought
never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a
plain and visible token, that you are not to be a seafaring
mam--Why, sir? said I; will you go to sea no more l--That
is another case, said be; it is my calling, and therefore my
duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial,'you see what a
taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if on
persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, ' e
Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.--Pray, continues he, what are
you, and on what account did you go to sea? Upon that I told
him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out with
a strange kind of passion. What had I done, said he, that
such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship! I would
not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for athousaud
pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an' excursion of his
spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was farther than he could have authority to go.--However, he
afterwards talked very gravely to me; exhorted me to go back
to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me,
I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me; and, young
man, said he, depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever
you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disap-
pointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you.ROBINSON 030802. I I

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more; which way he went, I know not: as for me,
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by
land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I
should go home or go to sea. As to going home, shame
opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts; and it
immediately occurred to me how I should he laughed at among
the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see not my father
and mother only, but even every body else. from whence I
have often since observed, how incongruous and irrational the
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that
reason which ought to guide them in such cases, viz. that they
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not
ashamed of the action, for which they ought justly to be
esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which only
can make them be esteemed wise men. .

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead.
An irresistible reluctance continued to going home ; and as I
stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been in
wore oti'; and, as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to a return wore ofl' with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. That evil
influence which carried me first away from my father's house,
that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising
my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entrea--
ties, and even the commands of my father; I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of
all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound
to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a
v0 age to Guinea.

t was my great misfortune, that in all these adventures I did
not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might indeed
have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet, at the same
time, I had learned the duty and office of a foremast--man, and
in time might have qualifie myself for a mate or lieutenant, if
not a master: but as it was always my fate to choose for the
worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and
good clothes 11 on my back, I would always go on board in the
habit of a gen eman; and so I neither had any business in the
ship, nor learned to do any. It was my lot, first of all, to fall
into pretty good company in London; which does not always
happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some snare for
them very early. But it was not so with me: I first fell
acquainted with the master of a ship, who had been on the

coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good success there,
was resolved to go again. He, taking a fancy to my canversa-
tion, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, and hear-
ing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me, that if I
would go the voyage with him, I should be at no expense; I
should be his messmate and his companion; and if I could
carry any thing with me, I should have all the advantage of it
that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with
some encouragement. I embraced the ofi'er, and, entering into
a strict friendship with this captain, who was an honest and
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a
small adventure with me; which, by the disinterested honesty
of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I
carried about forty pounds in such toys and trifies as the cap-
tain directed me to buy. This forty pounds I had mustered
together by the assistance of some of my relations whom I
corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my father, or, at
least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first
adventure. This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the inte-
grity and honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also
I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules
of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some
things that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, as
he took delight to instruct me, I took deli ht to learn; and, in
a word, this voyage made me both a sai or and a merchant:
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return,
almost three hundred pounds, and this filled me with those
aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. Yet
even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly,
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calen-
ture by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal trading

being upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north,
even to the line itself.
 

SECTION III.

R081NSON'S CAI'TIVITY AT SALLEE--ESCAPE "'ITH XURY--ARRIVAL AT THE
BRAZILS. /.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
the same voyage again; and I embarked in the same vessel
with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite a bun-
dred pounds of my new-gained wealth, so that I had two
hundred pounds left, and which I lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible mis-
fortunes in this voyage: and the first was this, viz.--our ship,
making her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather

between those islands and the African shore, was surprised, in

the gray of the morning, by a Turkish rover, of Sallee, who
gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. W'e crowded
also as much canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly mime up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the rover eighteen.
About three in the afternoon he came up with us ; and bring-
ing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart
our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear
on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made

.him sheer ofi' again, after returning our fire, and pouring in
, also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had
Ton board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men
keeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to
defend ourselves; but laying us on board the next time upon
our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging.
\Ve plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests,
and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However,
to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we
were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I ap-
prehended; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's
court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain
of the rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now looked back
upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be
miserable, and have none to relieve me; which I thought was
now so effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was
undone, without redemption. But, alas! this was but a taste
of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hapes he would take me with him when he
went to sea again, believing that it would, some time or other,
be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of
war, and that. then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away ;_ for when he went to sea, he
left me on shore, to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he
came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
cabin, to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it. Nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that
would embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two
years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination,
yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it
in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my
liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home longer
than usual, without fitting out is ship, w ich, as I heard, was
for want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship' 8
pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching
fish, insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,
one of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it 5 and rowing, we
knew not whither, or which way, we laboured all day and all
the next night, and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled 011' to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, and that
we were at least two leagues from the shore: however, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some
danger, for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morn-
ing; but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the longboat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved
he would not go a fishing any more without a compass and
some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of the ship, who
was an English slave, to build a little state-room or cabin in
the middle of the longboat, like that of a barge, with a place
to stand behind it, to steer and haul home the main sheet, and
room before for a' hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and
the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug
and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two,
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink, and particu-
larly, his bread, rice, and coffee.

e went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without
me. It happened, that he had appointed to go out in this boat,
either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction in that place, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat,
"overnight, a larger store of provision than ordinary, and had
ordere me to get ready three fusees, with powder and shot,
which were on board his ship, for that they designed some
sport of fowling as well as fishin .

I got all things ready as he cted, and waited the next
morning with the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants
out, and every thing to accommodate his guests: when, by and
by, my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests
had put ofl' going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered
me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat,
and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at
his house; and commanded, that as soon as I had got some
fish, I should bring it home to his house: all which I prepared
to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship
at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to
furnish m "self, not for a fishin business, but for a voyage:
though I new not, neither did so much as con'sider, whither
I should steer; for any where, to get out of that place, was
my way.

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I
told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread: he
said, that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which
it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English
prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was
on shore, as if they had been there before for our master. I
conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed above half a hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of
great use to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make candles.
Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into
also: his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley:
so I called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns are on board
the boat, can you not get a little powder and shot? it may be we
may kill some alcamies (fowls like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship.--Yes, says
he, I will bring some; and accordingly he brought a great
leather pouch, which held about a pound and a half of powder,
or rather more, and another with shot, that had five or six
pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat: at the
same time I found some powder of my master's in the great
cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the case,
which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another;
and thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed out of
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the
port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us; and we
were not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in our
sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew from N. N. E.
which was contrary to my desire; for, had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at last
reached to the bay of Cadiz: but my resolutions were, blow
which way it would, I would be gone from the horrid place
where I was, and leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
when I had fish on my book I would not pull them up, that
he might not see them, I said to the Moor, This will not do;
our master will not be thus served; we must stand farther ofi'.aomxsos causes. 17

He, thinking no harm, agreed; and being at the head of the
boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm, I run the boat near
a league farther, and then brought to, as if I would fish.
Then giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the
Moor was, and I took him by surprise, with my arm under
his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He
rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,
begged to be taken in, and told me he would go all the world
over with me. He swam so stron after the boat. that he
would have reached me very quick y, there being but little
wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one
of the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I
had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would do
him none: But, said I, on swim well enough to reach the
shore, and the sea is ca m; make the best of your way to
shore, and I will do you no harm: but if you come near the
boat, I will shoot you through the head; for I am resolved
to have my liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam
for the shore; and I make no doubt but he reached it with
ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust
him. \Vhen he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they
called Xury, and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me I will make you a great man; but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me (that is, swear by Mahcmet and
his father's heard), I must throw you into the sea too. The
boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the Strait's
mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do); for who would have supposed we
were sailin on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast.
where who e nations of Negroes were sure to surround us
with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never once
go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or
more merciless savages of human kind?

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair fresh 6 of wind, and a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail, that believe by the next day, at --
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I made the land, I could
not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee,
.quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed
of any other king thereabout: for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the
wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five days;
and then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over: so I ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river; I knew not what
or where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or
what river. I neither saw, nor desired to see, any people;
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon
as it was dark, and discover the country: but as soon as it was
quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking,
roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged
of me not to go on shore till day. Well, Xury, said I, then
I will not; but it may be we may see men by day, who will be
as bad to us as those lions.----Then we ma give them the
shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make t em run away.
Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave
him a dram out of our patron's case of bottles to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it. W e dropped
our little anchor, and lay still all night: I say, still, for we
slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast creatures
(we knew not what to call them), of many sorts, come down
to the seashore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves, for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more frightened when we heard one of these
mighty creatures swimming towards our boat: we could not
see him, but we might hear him, by his blowing, to be 9. mon-
strous, huge, and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and
it might be so, for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me
to weigh the anchor, and row away. No, says I, Xury; we
can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go off to sea: they
cannot follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars length, which
something surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to
the cabin door, and, taking up my gun, fired at him; upon
which he immediately turned about, and swam to the shore
a in.

gaBut it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and
hideous cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon the noise
or report of the gun; a thing, I believe, those creatures had
never heard before. This convinced me there was no going
on shore for us in the night upon that coast: and how to ven-
ture on shore in the day, was another question too; for to
have fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been as
bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and tigers; at
least, we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat: when and where to get it was the point. Xury said, if
I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would
find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked
him why he would go; why I should not go, and he stay in
the boat. The boy answered with so much affection, that he
made me love him ever after. Says be, If wild mans come,
they eat me, you go way.--Well, Xury, said I, we will both
go; and if the wild mans come, we will kill them; they shall
eat neither of us. So I gave any a piece of ms]: bread to
eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles, which I
mentioned before; and we hauled in the boat as near the
shore as we thought was pr0per, and so waded to shore, car-
rying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy,
seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to
it; and, by and by, I saw him come running towards me. I
thought he was pursued by some savage, or frightened by
some wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hangin over
his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, ike a
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs: however, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat: but the
great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had
found good water, and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards, that we need not take such pains
for water ; for a little higher up the creek where we were, we
found the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed
but a little way up; so we filled our jars, and, having a fire,
feasted on the hare we had killed; and prepared to go on our
way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that
part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very
well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
islands also, lay not far from the coast. But as I had no in-
struments to take an observation, to find what latitude we
were in; and did not exactl know, or at least remember, ,
what latitude they were in, knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them, otherwise I
might now have easily found some of these islands. But my
hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to the
part where the English traded, I should find some of their
vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve
and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was,
must be that country which, lying between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the .Negroes, lies waste, and unin-
habited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes having aban-
doned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the Moors, and
the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness: and, indeed, both forsaking it because of the
prodigious numbers of tigers, lionsheOpards, and other furious
creatures which harbour there: so that the Moors use it for
their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time; and, indeed, for near a hundred
miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste,
uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings
and roaring of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice, in the day time, I thought I saw the Pico of
Tenerifi'e, being the tap of the mountain Tenerifl'e in the
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again
by contrary winds; the sea also going too high for my little
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep
along the shore. .

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place; and once, in particular, being early in
the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of
land which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to flow,
we lay still, to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more
about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to me, and
tells me, that we had best go farther off the shore; for, says
he, Look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that
hillock, fast asleep. I looked where he pointed, and saw a
dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion, that -
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the
hill, that hung, as it were, over him. Xury, says I, you shall
go on shore and kill him. Xury looked frightened, and said,
Me kill! he eat me at one mouth: one mouthful he meant.
However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him be still;
and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket bore,
and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two
slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with two
bullets; and a third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with
five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first
piece, to have shot him in the head; but he lay so, with his
leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
about the knee, and broke the bone: he started up, growling
at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then got
up upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever
I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on
the head; however, I took up the second piece immediately,
and though he began to move ofi', fired again, and shot him in
the head, and had the pleasure to see him dro , and make but
little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then ury took heart,
and would have me let him go on shore. Well, go, said I:
so the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in
one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him in the head again, which dispatched him
quite. '

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and I was
very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a
creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said
he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and asked
me to give him the hatchet: For what, Xury! said I. Me
cut off his head, said be. However, Xury could not cut off
his head; but he cut oil" a foot, and brought it with him, and
it was a monstrous great one. I bethought myself, however,
that perhaps the skin of him might, one way or other, be of
some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I
could. So Xury and I went to work with him: but Xury
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how
to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole day; but at
last we got 011' the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of
our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in twodays' time, and it
afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop we made on to the southward continually,
for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our pro-
visions, which began to abate very much, and going no oftener
into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. My
design in this, was to .make the river Gambia, or Senegal;
that is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I
was in hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did
not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the
islands, or perish among the Negroes. I knew that all 'the
ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea,
or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this'cape, or those
islands: and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon
this single point, either that I must meet with some ship, or
mustperish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as'we sailed by, we saw people
stand upon'the shore to look at us: we could also perceive .
the were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to ave gon'e on-shore to them; but Xu was In better
counsellor, and said to me, No go, no go. owever, hauled
in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them; and I found
they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed they
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long,
slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they
would throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a
distance, but talked to them by. signs, as well as I could, and
particularly made signs for something to eat. They beckoned
to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat:
upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two
of them ran up into the country; and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh and
some corn, such as is the produce of their country; but we
neither knew what the one or the other was; however, we
were willing to accept it. But how to come at it was our next
dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they
were as much afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us
all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and went

and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then
came close to us again.

W'e made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends: but an opportunity offered that very
instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying
by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the
other (as we took it) with great fury, from the mountains to-
wards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,
any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange;
but I believe it was the latter, because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and, in
the second place, we found the people terribly frightened,
especially the women. The man that had the lance, or dart,
did not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their
diversion: at last, one of them began to come nearer our boat
than I at first expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my
reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head: immediately
he sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged
up and down, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he
was: he immediately made to the shore; but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures, at the noise and fire of my gun; some of them were
even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very
terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to search for
the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water;
and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave
the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found
that it was a most curious leOpard, spotted, and fine to an
admirable degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at that dis-
tance, know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made signs
to them that they might take him, they were very thankful for.
Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had
no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off
his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we could
have done with a milk. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made
signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provisions, which, though I did
not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them
for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turnin
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that
wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to some of
their friends, and there came two women, and brought a great
vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun; this
they set down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with
my jars, and filled them all three. The women were as stark
naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for
about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore,
till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about
the distance of four or five leagues before me; and the sea
being very calm, I kept a large oiling, to make this point. At
length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land,
I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward: then I con-
cluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape
de Verd, and those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de
Verd Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I
could not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should be
taken with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor the
other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the boy cried out, Master, master. a ship with a sail!
and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking it
must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us,
when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the
ship, but what she was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship,
and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for Ne-
groes. But, when I observed the course she steered, I was
soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not
design to come any nearer to the shore : upon which, I stretched
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if
possible.

\Vith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I
could make any signal to them; but after I had crowded to
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me, by
the help of their perspective glasses, and that it was some Eu-
ropean boat, which, they supposed. must belong to some ship
that was lost; so they shortened sail, to let me come up. I was
encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign On
board, I made a waft of it to them, for-a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me they saw
the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these
signals, they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and
in about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish
and in French, but I understood none of them ; but, at last, a
Scotch sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee: they then
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all
my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such
a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as I was in; and
I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be de-
livered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. For, says he,
I have saved your life on no other'terms than 'I would be glad
to be saved myself ; and it may, one time or other. be my lot
to be taken up in the same condition. Besides, said he, when
I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own
country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be
starved there, and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no, Senhor Ingles (Mr. Englishman), says he ; I will carry
you thither in charity, and these things will help to buy your

subsistence there, and your passage home again.C3

SECTION IV.

"E SETTLE IN THE DRAZILS AS A I'LAN'fEn.--MAKES ANOTHER VOYAGE, AND IS
SHIPWRECRED.

Ashe was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance, to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that none
should offer to touch any thing I had: then he took every
thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact in-
ventory of them, that I might have them, even so much as my
three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use; and
asked me what I would have for it? I told him, he had been
so generous to me in eVery thing, that I could not offer to
make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him: upon
which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
ofl'ered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loath to take ; not that l was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be
just, and ofl'ered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Chris-
tian: upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him,
I let the captain have him.

\Ve had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of life ; and what to
do next with myself, I was now to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never

C
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my pas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty
for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused every
thing I had in the ship to be pnnctually delivered to me; and
what I was willing to sell, he bought of me; such as the case
of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-
wax,~for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made
about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo;
and with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the
house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio
as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived
with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that means,
with the manner of planting and of making sugar: and seeing
how well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly,
I resolved, if I could get alicencc to settle there, I would turn
planter among them: endeavouring, in the mean time, to find
out same way to get my money, which I had left in London,
remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of
naturalization, I purchased as much land that was uncured as
my money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation
and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbour, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather
planted for food than any thing else, for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began to come
into order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come : but we both wanted help ; and now
I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting with
my boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had got into
an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly con-
trary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good advice: nay, I
was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of
low life, which my father advised me to before; and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world, as I had done:
and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as
well in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand
miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness,

and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me.
In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour; no work to be done, but by the labour of
my hands: and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been! and how should all men reflect, that
when they compare their present conditions with others that
are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange,
and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience:
I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected
on, in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had
so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in
which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceed-
ing prosperous and rich.

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the
ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained
there, in providing his lading, and preparing for his voyage,
near three months; when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advice: Senhor Inglez, says he (for so he always called me),
if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to
me, with orders to the rson who has your money in London.
to send your effects to 'sbon, to such persons as I shall direct.
and in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring
you the produce of them, God willing, at my return: but.
since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I
would have you give orders for but one hundred pounds ster-
ling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be
run for the first, so that if it come safe, you may order the rest
the same way; and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half
to have recourse to for your supply. This was so wholesome
advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but be con-
vinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly
prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired me.

_ I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my
adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour. and
what condition I was now in, with all other necessary direc-
tions for my supply; and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant at London, who represented it efl'ec-
tually to her: whereupon she not only delivered the money,
but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in

c 2
English goods, such as the captain had wrote for, sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me
at the Brazils: among which, without my direction (for I was
too young in my business to think of them), he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me. When this
cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid
out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him as a present
for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant, under
bond for six years' service, and would not accept of any con-
sideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce. Neither was this all: but
my goods being all English manufactures, such as cloths, stuffs.
baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage;
so that I might say, I had more than four times the value of
my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neigh-
bour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation: for the
first thing I did, I bought me a Negro slave, and a European
servant also; I mean another besides that which the captain
brought me from Lisbou.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year
with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours: and these fifty rolls, being
each of above one hundred pounds weight, were well cured,
and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon: and
now, increasing in business and in wealth, my head began to
be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as
are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. Had
I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the
happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so
earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of:
but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful
agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon m self, which in my
future sorrows I should have leisure to ma e, all these mis-
carriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering
to my foolish inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing
that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doing
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and
those measures of life, which nature and providence concurred
to present me with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus in breaking away from my parents,
so I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the
happy view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new
plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of
rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with
life, and a state of health in the world.

To come, then, b just degrees, to the particulars of this
part of my story .--- on may suppose, that having now lived
almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted an acquaintance and friend-
ship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my dis-
courses among them, I had frequently given them an account
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trad-
ing with the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase
on the coast for trifles--such as beads, toys, knives, scissars,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only gold dust, Guinea
grains, elephants' teeth, 8:42. but Negroes, for the service of the
Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on b
the underdog, or permission of the kings of Spain and Portuga ,
and engrossed from the public; so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what I had dis-
coursed with them of the last night, and they came to make a
secret proposal to me : and, after enjoining me to secrecy, they
told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;
that they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened
for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that
could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell
the Negroes when they came home, so they desired to make
but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations: and, in a word, the
question was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship,
to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they
offered me that I should have an equal share of the Negroes,
without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not a settlement and plantation of
his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me,
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to
have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and
who, in that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds
sterling, and that increasing too; for me to think of such a
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in
such circumstances, could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me.
In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscar-
ried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings
or covenants to do so: and I made a formal will, disposing of
my plantation and efl'ects, in case of my death; making the
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my uni~
versal heir; but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had
directed in my will; one half of the produce being to himself,
and the other to be shipped to England. In short, I took all
possible caution to preserve my effects, and to keep up my
plantation: had I used half as much prudence to have looked
into my own interest. and have made a judgment of what I
ought to have done and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving
all the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a
voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes
to myself,

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason: and accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done
as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an evil hour again, the first of September, 1659,
being the same day eight years that I went from my parents
at Bull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the
fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden.
carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his
boy, and myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the Negroes,
such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially
little looking-glasses, knives, scissars, hatchets, and the like.

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing
away to the northward upon our own coast, with design to
stretch over for the African coast. When they came about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
was the manner of their course in those days, we had very
good weather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height of cape St. Augustino; from
whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and
steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha,
holding our course N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on the
east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were. by our last observation, in seven degrees
twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado,
or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge: it began
from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then
settled in the north-east ; from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected every day
to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect
to save their lives. '

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one
of our men died of the calenture, and one man and a boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating
a little, the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude,
but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude difference,
west from cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was got
upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, be-
yond the river Amazons, toward that of the river Oronoco,
commonly called the Great River; and began to consult with
me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky and
very much disabled, and he was for going directly back to
the coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came
within the circle of the Caribbee islands, and therefore resolved
to stand away for Barbadoes; which by keeping ofi' to sea, to
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we might easily
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; whereas we
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa
without some assistance, both to our ship and ourselves.

With this design, we changed our course, and steered away
N. W. by W. in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief: but our voyage was othermse de-
termined; for being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen
minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us away
with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of
the very way of all human commerce, that had all our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being
devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowin very hard, one of our
men early in the morning, cried out, nd! and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea
broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were immediately
driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very
foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like con-
dition, to describe or conceive the cousternation of men in
such circumstances: we knew nothing where we were, or
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by
a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In a word,
we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every
moment, and every man acting accordingly. as preparing for
another world ; for there was little or nothing more for us to
do in this: that which was our present comfort, and all the
comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our expectation, the
ship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began
to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking
too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful
condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to think of saving
our lives as well as we could. \Ve had a boat at our stern
just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke
away, and either sunk, or was driven 011' to sea; so there was
no hope from her: we had another boat on board. but how to
get her 011' into the sea was a doubtful thing; however, there
was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship would break
in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her flung
over the ship's side; and getting all into her, let her go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy,
and the wild sea: for though the storm was abated consider-
ably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and
might be well called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in
a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
we had none; nor, if we had, could we have done any thing
with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all
knew that when the boat came nearer to the shore, shewould
be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea.
However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well
as we could towards land.

\Vhat the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep
or shoal--we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might
happen into. some bay or gulf. or the mouth of some river.
where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got
under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.
But there was nothing of this appeared; and as we made
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful
than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountainlike, came
rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
the boat at once ; and separating us, as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " O God !"
for we were all swallowed up in a moment. .

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver m self from the waves so as to draw my
breath, till that wave aving driven me, or rather carried me.
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself. went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead
with the water I took.in. I had so much presence of mind.
as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land
than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make
on towards the land as fast as I could, 'before another wave
should return and take me up again; but I soon found it was
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had
no means or strength to contend with: my business was to
hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could;
and so, by swimmin , to preserve my breathing, and pilot
myself towards the s ore, if possible; my greatest concern
now being, that the wave, as it would carry me a great wav
towards the shore when it came on,-might not carry me back
again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body; and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the
shore, a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my immediate relief, 'I found my head and hands

shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I
held it out ; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and
felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments,
to recover breath, and till the water went from me, and then
took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had farther
towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me from
the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again;
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried for-
wards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me;
for the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body; and had it
returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water: but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should again be covered with the water, I re-
solved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my
breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the
waves were not so high as the first, being nearer land, I held
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to
carry me away; and the next run I took, I got to the main
land ; where, to .my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of
the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore; and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there
were, some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I be-
lieve it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies
and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved. as I may
say, out of the grave: and I did not wonder now at the cus-
tom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his
neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a
reprieve brought to him; I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very moment
they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal
spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him.

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

-I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplation
of m deliverance; making a thousand gestures and motions,
which, I cannot describe; reflecting upon my comrades that
were dro ed, and that there should not be one soul saved
but mysel ; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or
any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two
shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--'when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so far
off-and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on
shore? '

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of
a place I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon
found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dread-
ful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nor any thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and that which
was particularly aillicting to me was, that I had no weapon,
either to hunt and kill any creature for m sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other creature t at might desire to
kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a
knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was
all my provision; and this threw me into such terrible agonies
of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, seeing at night they always come abroad for
their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time,
was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny--
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night--
and consider the next day what death I should die, for as yet
I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a fur-long from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which
I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree,
and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that
if I should fall asleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a
short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my
lodging; and having been excessivel fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I lieve, few could have
done in my condition; and found myself the most refreshed
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.' 0": '2'Fr.'( "f'

ARTICLES FROM THE "'RECK--CONSTRUCTS HIS IIABITATION.

\VHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before;
but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling
of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which
I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave
dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save
some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat;
which lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up, upon the
land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I
could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck,
or inlet, of water, between me and the boat, which was about
half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more
intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find some-
thing for my present subsistence.

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile
of the ship: and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief;
for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe ; that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and
I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears
from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I
resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the
water: but when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still
greater know how to get on board; for as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach
to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second time
I spied a small piece of a rope. which I wondered I did not
see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low, as that with
great difficulty, I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope
got into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; but
that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather
earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head
low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be
sure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled
and what was free: and, first, I found that all the ship's pro-
visions were dry and untouched by the water; and, being very
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room. and filled my
pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went about other things.
for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now I
wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things
which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had, and this extremity roused my application: we had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare
topmast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many overboard as I could manage for
their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not
drive away. When this was done, I went down the ship's
side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together
at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and
laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them, cross-
ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was
not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light:
so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare
topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a
great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing
myself with necessaries, encouraged me to go beyond what I
should have been able to have done upon another occasion. -

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I
was not long considering this. I first laid all the planks or
boards upon it that [could get, and having considered well
what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, which
I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon
my raft; these I filled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats' flesh (which we lived
much upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls which we had brought to sea
with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some
barley and wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I
found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As
for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about
five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves,
there being no need to put them into the chests, nor any room
for them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began to
flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore, upon the
sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were only linen,
and open-kneed, I swam on board in them, and my stockings.
However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which
I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my eye was more upou; as.
first, tools to work with on shore : and it was after long
searching that I found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a
ship-lading of gold would have been at that time. I got it
down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to
look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these I secured first, with some powder-horns and a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.
Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now I
thought myself pretty .well freighted, and began to think how
I should get to shore with them, having neither sail. oar, nor
rudder; and the least capfull of wind would have overset all
my navigation.

I had three encouragements: lst, A smooth, calm sea:
2dly, The tide rising, and setting in to the shore: 3dly, What
little wind there was, blew me towards the land. And thus,
having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat,
and besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this cargo I put to sea.
For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that
I found it drive a little distant from the place where I had
landed before ; by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
Opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide
set into it; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to get into
the middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suf.
fered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would
have broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my
cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so
fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust of the raft with all my strength; neither dnrst I stir
from the posture I was in, but holding up the chests with all
my might, I stood in that manner near half an bent, in which
time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a
level; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated
again, and I thrust her-off with the car I had into the channel,
and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the
mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong
current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for a
proper lace to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too hig up the river; hoping, in time, to see some ship at
sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast
as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, as that reaching ground with my
oar, I could thrust her directly in; but here I had like to have
dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land,
but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so
high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would en-
danger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait till
the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my car like
an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat
piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over;
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft
drew about a foot of water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of
ground, and there fastened or moored her, b sticking my two
broken cars into the ground, one on one si e, near one end,
and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus I lay
till the water ebbed aWay, and left my raft and all my cargo
safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow .my goods, to se-
cure them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I et
knew not; whether on the continent, or on an island ; whe r
inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts,
or not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop
some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward.
I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols,
and a horn of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for dis-
covery up to the top of that hill; where, after I had, with
great labour and difficulty, got up to the top, I saw my fate,
to my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island, environed
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks,
which lay a great way off, and two small islands, less than
this, which lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren. and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
of whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds; neither, when I killed them, could
I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree.
on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun
that had been fired there since the creation of the world: I
had no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there
arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts. making
a confused screaming, and crying, every one according to his
usual note; but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As
for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk,
its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or
claws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for
nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came.back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up
the rest of that day: what to do with myself at night I knew
not, nor indeed where to rest: for I was afraid to lie down on
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour
me; though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need
for those fears. However, as well as I could, I barricadoed
myself round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a but for that night's lodging.
As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except
that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of
the wood where I shot the fowl.

. I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship, which would be useful to me. and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land; and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in
pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till I got eve

thing out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a counc' ,
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back
the raft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go
as before, when the tide was down; and I did so, only that I
stripped before I went from my hut; having nothing on but a
chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps
on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft; and having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldly, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me: as, first, in the car-
penter's stores, I found two or three bags of nails and spikes.
a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets; and, above all,
that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured
together, with several things belonging to the gunner; parti-
cularly, two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket
bullets, seven muskets. and another fowling--piece, with some
small quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small shot,
and a great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, I
could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side. Besides
these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, and
a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with
this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on
shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence
from the land. .my provisions might be devoured on shore: but
when I came back, I found no sign of any visiter; only there
sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, which,
when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then
stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned. and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted
with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not under-
stand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer
to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though,
by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it,
smelled of it, and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more; but
I thanked her, and could spare no more: so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore--though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large casks--I went to work to make
me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles, which I cut for
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I
- knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the
empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify
it from an sudden attempt either from man or beast.

When had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without ;
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head. and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was
very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept little,
and had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all those
things from the ship, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was
laid up, I believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still :
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought
to get every thing out of her that I could: so every day, at low
water, I went on board, and brought away something or other:
but particularly, the third time I went, I brou ht away as much
of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rape-
twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which was to
mend the sails upon occasion. and the barrel of wet gunpowder.
In a word. I brought away all the sails first and last; only that
l was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as
I could; for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere
canvass only.

But that which comforted me still more was, that, last of all.
after I had. made five or six such voyages as these, and thought
I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my
meddling with; I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising to me,
because I had given over expecting any more provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead
of that bread. and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel. in pieces of
the sails,which I cut out; and, in aword, I got all this safe on
shore also.

The next day I made another voyage, and now having plun-
dered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began
with the cables, and cutting the great cable into pieces, such as
I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all
the iron work I could get; and having cut down the spritsail-
yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I could, to make a

arge raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods; and came
away: but my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft
was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was entered the
little cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being
able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset. and
threw me and all my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was
no great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo,
it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I ex-
pected would have been of great use to me: however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and
some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fain to
dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very much.
After this I went every day on board, and brought away what
I could get.

I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship; in which time I had brought away all
that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring;
though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should
have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but pre-
paring, the twelfth time, to go on board, I found the wind
began to rise: however, at low water, I went on board; and
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so efi'ectually, as
that nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors. and
one pair of large scissars, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces
of eight. some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: 0 drug! I
exclaimed, what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me,
no, not the taking off the ground ; one of those knives is worth
all this heap: I have no manner of use for thee; e'en remain
where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life
is not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts, I took
it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvass, I began
to think of making anather raft; but while I was preparing
this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and
in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It
presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft with the wind off shore; and that it was my busi-
ness to be gone before the tide of flood began, or otherwise I
might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let
myself down into the water, and swam across the channel which
lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with diffi-
culty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about
me, and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose
ve hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.

at I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that
night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold, no more
ship was to be seen! I was a little surprised, but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no
time, nor abated no diligence, to get every thing out of her that
could be useful to me, and that, indeed, there was little left in
her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time. V

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore, from her
wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did; but
those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had man thoughts of
the method how to do this, and what kind of dwel 'ng to make,
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner
and description of which, it may not be improper to give an
account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near
the sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome; and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it: so I
resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
und.

gr: cousulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me: first, air and fresh water, I just now
mentioned: secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun: thirdly,
security from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts:
fourthly. a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight,
I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I
was not willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search for a place proper for this, I found a little plain
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain
was steep as a house side, so that nothing could come down
upon me from the top. On the side of this rock there was a
hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of
a cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the
rock, at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green
before my door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly
every way down into the low ground by the seaside. It was
on the N. N. W. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or there-
abouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hol-
low-place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its begin-
ning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the
biggest end being out of the ground about five feet and a half,
and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the ship, and
laid them in rows. one upon another, within the circle, between
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high.
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither
man nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods.
bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but
by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was
in, I lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in and
fortified, as I thought, from all the world. and consequently slept
secure in the night, which otherwise. I could not have done;
though, as it appeared afterwards. there was no need of all this
caution against the enemies that I apprehended danger from.
 

SECTION VI.

CARRIES ALL "IS INCHES, PROVISIONS, l'TrC. INTO HIS HABITATIONo--DREARINESS
0P SOLITUDl-Zo--CONSOI.A'I'OIIY REFLECTIONS.

INTO this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which
you have the account above; and I made a large tent, which,
to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a
large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.

\Vhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock.
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out
through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature
of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and
a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which
served me like a cellar to my house. It cost me much labour
and many days, before all these things were brought to perfec-
tion; and therefore I must go back to some other things which
took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and
making the cave. that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark
culoud, a sudden flash ot lightning happened, and after that,11
great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not
so much surprised 11 ith the lightning, 11s I was with a thought,
which darted into my mind as 111111 as the lightning itself: 0
1111' powder! My very heart sunk within me when I thought,
that at one blast, all m1 powder might be dcstro1ed; on 11l11ch.
not 1111' defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought,
entirel1 depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger, though, had the powder took fire, I had never
known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me. that after the storm
was over. I laid aside all my works. my building and tbrtifying,
and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the
pow d1. r, and to keep it a little and 11 little in a parcel, in hope
that 11 hate1 er might come, it might not all take fire at once ,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make
one part fire another. I finished this 11 ork 111 about a tortuight' .
and I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred
and fort1 pounds weight, was divided 111 not less than a hun-
dred pa.r1els As to the bane! that had been 11',et I did not
apprehend any danger from that; so I placed it in my new
1'11 0, which, in m1 fancy, I (alled my kitchen, and the rest I
hid up and down in holes among the rocks. so that no wet might
come to it marking 1er1' carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time 11 hile this was doing I went out at least
once every day with my gun, as 11 ell to divert myself, as to
see if I could kill 11111 thing fit for food; and. as near as I
could, to acquaint myself with 11 hat the island produced. The
first time I went out, I presently discovered that there were
goats upon the island, which was a great satisfaction to me;
but then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle. and so S11 ift of foot that it was the
most ditlicult thing in the world to come at them. but I was
not discouraged at this. not doubting but I might now and then
shoot one. as it soon happened; for after I had found their
haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed,
if they saw me in the 1 alleys, though they were upon the rocks,
they would r1111 away as in a terrible fright; but if they were
feeding 111 the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no
notice 2,of me; from 11 hence I concluded, that by the position
of their optics. their sight was so directed do11n11' ard that they
did not readily see objects that 11 ere above them: so, after-
11',ar1ls I took this method--I always climbed the rocks first,
to get above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. The
first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat,
which had a little kid by her, 11111ch she gave suck to, 11 Inch
grie1 ed me heartily , but 11 hen the old one fell, the kid stood
stock still by her, till I came and took her up; and not only
so. but when I carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders.
the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon which. I laid
down the dam, and took the kid in my arms. and carried it over
my pale. in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not
eat; so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two
supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and
preserved my provisions (my bread especially) as much as
possibly 1 could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces-
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn ; and
what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of it in its pro-
per place: but I must first give some little account of myself,
and of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be sup-
posed, were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by
a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage;
and a great way. viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the
ordinary course of the trade of mankind. I had great reason to
consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate
place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The
tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these
reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself
why Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned without
help, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to
be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me: and particularly, one day, walk-
ing with my gun in my hand. by the seaside, I was very pensive
upon the subject of my present conditiOn. when reason, as it
were, expostulated with me the other way, thus: \'Vcll, you
are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember.
where are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you
into the boat? Where are the ten? Why were not they saved.
and you lost I \Vhy were you singled out? Is it better to be
here or there I And then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to
be considered with the good that is in them, and with what
worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again. how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had
not happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the
ship floated from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her: what would have been my case, if I had been
to have lived in the condition in which I at first came on shore,
without necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and pro-
cure them I Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself),
what should I have done without a gun, without ammunition.
without any tools to make any thing, or to work with. without
clothes. bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering? and that
now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair
way to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my
gun. when my ammunition was spent: so that I had a tolerable
view of subsisting. without any want, as long as I lived; for I
considered, from the beginning, how I would provide for the
accidents that might happen, and for the time that was to come.
not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after
my health or strength should decay. '

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammuni--
tion being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so
surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I observed
Just now.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene
of silent life, such, perhaps. as was never heard of in the world
before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, when,
in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid
island; when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox, was
almost just over my head: for I reckoned myself, by observa-

tion. to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes
north of the line.
 

SECTION VII.

ROBINSON'S MODE 0F RIZCKONING TIME.--DIFFICULTIBS ARISING FROM WANT OI'
TOOLSu--IIE ARRANGKS HIS IIABII'ATION.

AFTER I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want
of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath
days from the working days: but, to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it
into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed,
viz. " I came on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659."
Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as lOng again as the
rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long
one: and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.

But it happened, that among the many things which I brought
out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above men-
tioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not
at all less useful to me, which I found, some time after, in rum-
maging the chests; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper;
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical
instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of naviga-
tion; all which I huddled together, whether I might want them
or no: also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me

D
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among
my things; some Portuguese books also, and, among them,
two or three popish prayer books, and several other books, all
which I carefully secured. And I must not forget, that we had
in the ship a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something, in its place: for I carried both
the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship
himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore
with my first cargo, and was a true servant to me for many
years: I wanted nothing that be con (1 fetch me, nor any com-
pany that he could make up to me, I only wanted to have him
talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed before, I
found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact, but after that was gone, I could not; for I
could not make any ink, by any means that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these,
this of ink was one; as also a spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to
dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for
linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily:
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my
little pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes,
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bring-
ing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and
bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driving
it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of
wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows; which, however, though I found it answer, made driving
these Posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what
need have been concerned at the tediousness of any thing I
had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any
other employment, if that had been over, at least that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food; which
I did, more or less, every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that
were to come after me (for I was like to have but few heirs),
as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afllicting my mind: and as my reason began now to master my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and
to set the good against the evil, that I might have something
to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated very impar-
tially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against
the miseries I suffered, thus: '
EVIL

I am cast upon a horrible, deso-

late island, void of all hope of reco-
very.

I am singled out and separated, as

it were, from all the world, to be
miserable.

51

GOOD.

But I am alive; and not drowned,
as all my ship's company were.

But I am singled out too from all
the ship's crew, to be spared from
death; and he that miraculously

saved me from death, can deliver
me from this condition.

But I am not starved, and perish-
ing in a barren place, affording no
sustenance.

But I am in a hot climate, where,

if I had clothes, I could hardly wear
them.

I am divided from mankind, a

solitaire; one banished from human
society.

I have no clothes to cover me.

But I am cast on an island where
I see no wild beast to hurt me, as I
saw on the coast of Africa: and what
if I had been shipwrecked there?

But God wonderfully sent the
ship in near enough to the shore,
that I have got out so many neces-
sary things as will either sup ly my
wants, or enable me to supp y my-
self, even as long as I live.

I am without any defence, or
means to resist any Violence of man
or beast.

I have no soul to speak to, or
relieve me.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it: and let this stand as a direction, from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world,
that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves
from, and to set, in the description of good and evil, on the
credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to

accommodate my way of living, and to make things as easy to
me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised
a kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside: and atter some time (I think it was a year and a half)
I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get,
to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of the year,
very violent.

D2
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But
I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of
goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all my
place; I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to en-
large my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it was a
loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 1 bestowed
on it: and when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of
prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand, into the rock, and
then turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me
a door to come out in the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to
stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few com-
forts I bad in the world; I could not write, or eat, or do
several things with so much pleasure, without a table: so I
went to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason
is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by stating
and squaring every thing by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be, in time, mas-
ter of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my
life; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and contrivance,
I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made,
especially if I had had tools. However, I made abundance of
things, even without tools; and some with no more tools than
an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that
way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
set it on an edge before me. and hew it flat on either side with
my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then
dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I
could make but one board of a whole tree; but this I had no
remedy for but patience, any more than I had for a prodigious
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank
or board: but my time or labour was little worth, and so it
was as well employed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place; and this I did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when
I wrought out some boards, as above, I made large shelves, of
the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all along
one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron work
on; and, in a word, to separate every thing at large in their
places, that I might easily come at them. I knocked pieces
into the wall of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that
would hang up: so that had my cave been seen, it looked like
a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had every
thing so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me
to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find my
stock of all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's
employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurr ,
and not only as to labour, but in much discomposure of min};
and my journal would, too, have been full of many dull things :
for example, I must have said thus--" Sept. 30th. After I had
got to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being thank-
ful to God for my deliverance, having first vomited, with the
great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach,
and recovering myselfa little, I ran about the shore, wringing
my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my
misery, and crying out, I was undone, undone! till, tired and
faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but
durst not sleep, for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship '
and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear getting
up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in
hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a vast distance, I
spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and, after look-
ing steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
tanltll weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my
0 y.

But, having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household stufi' and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal: of which I shall here give you the
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again)
as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it off.
 

SECTION VIII.

ROBINSON'S JOURNALc--DETAILS OF HIS DOSIFSTIC EWNOMY AND CONTRIVANCES-
SHOCK 01' AN EARTHQUAKE.

THE JOURNAL.

SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe,
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I called
the ISLAND 0F Desmm; all the rest of the ship's company
being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of that day I spent in afliicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to: and, in despair of
any relief, saw nothing but death before me; that I should
either be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or
starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night
I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.

OCTOBER 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again much nearer the island; which, as it was some
comfort on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and not broken
in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief), so,
on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my com-
rades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board, might have
saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all
drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we _
might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the ship,
to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things;
but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the
sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day
also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days entirely
spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of the
ship ; which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts.
Much rain also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.

OCT. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got
upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly
heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was out.

001'. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts
of wind; during which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind
blowing a little harder than before) and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved,
that the rain might not spoil them.

001'. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a place to fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or
men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place, under a
rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment; which
I resolve to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made
of double piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceedingly hard.

The slst, in the morning, I went out into the island with m
gun, to see for some food, and discover the country; when
killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I after-
wards killed also, because it would not feed.

NOVEMBER 1; I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night; making it as large as I could, with stakes
driven in to swing my hammock upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts; and with them formed a fence
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my
fortification.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon I went
to work to make me a table.

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion;
viz. every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself to work till
about eleven o'clock; then ate what I had to live on; and
from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessive hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The
working part of this day and the next was wholly employed in
making my table, for was yet but a very sorry workman:.4 / i" a? ""55

56V ADVENTURES or

though time nd necessity made me a complete natural mechanic
soon after, as I believe they would any one else.

Nov. 5. This day, went abroad with my gun and dog, and
killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for
nothing: of every creature that I killed I took off the skins,
and preserved them. Comin back by the seashore, I saw
many sorts of seafowl which did not understand: but was
surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals;
which, while I was gazing at them (not well knowing what
they were), got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking: nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday,
according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but
never to please me; and, even in the making, I pulled it in
pieces several times.

N on. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omit-
ting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceed-
ingly, and cooled the earth: but it was accompanied with ter--
rible thunder and lightning, which frightened me dreadfully,
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or
two pounds at most, of powder: and so, putting the powder
in, I stowed it in places as secure and as remote from one
another as possible. On one of these three days I killed a large
bird that was good to eat ; but I knew not what to call it.

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the
rock, to make room for my farther convenience.

Nona. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work,
viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I
desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply
these wants, and make me some tools. As for a pickaxe, I
made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing efl'ec-
tually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a
tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the
iron tree, from its exceeding hardness: of this, wrth great
labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece ; and brought
it home, too, with difiiculty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no other
way, made me along while upon this machine: for I worked
it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or
spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only
that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it
would not last me so long: however, it served well enough
for the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never was
a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long a
making.

I was still deficient: for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbar-
row. A basket I could not make by any means, having no such
things as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware; at least,
none yet found out: and as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied I
could make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of;
neither did I know how to go about it: besides, I had no pos-
sible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the
wheel to run in; so I gave it over: and, for carrying away the
earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a
hod, which the labourers carry mortar in for the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days; I
mean, always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which
I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing home
something fit to eat.

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on;
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods cemmodiously.

NOTE. During all this time, I worked to make this room.
or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse
or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a
lodging, I kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep my--
self dry; which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles, and in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large
leaves of trees, like a thatch.

DECEMBER 10. I began now to think my cave or vault
finished; when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large)
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side:
so much, that, in short, it frightened me, and not without rea-
son too ; for if I had been under it, I should never have wanted
a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great dealof work
to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and,
which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so
that I might be sure no more would come down.

Dec. 1 1. This day I went to workwith it accordingly; and got
two shoars or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces

D 3
of board across over each post: this I finished the next day;
and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week more
I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part otf my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts, to hang every thing up that
could be hung up: and now I began to be in some order within
doors.

Dec. 20. I carried every thing into the cave, and began to
furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be
very scarce with me: also I made me another table.

DEC. '24. Much rain all night and all day: no stirring out.

DEC. 25. Rain all day. -

Dec. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that
I catched it, and led it home in a string: when I had it home,
I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever: but, by nursing it so long, it grew
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not
go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food:
this time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.

JANUARY 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the
centre of the island. I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. Accord-
ingly, the next day, I went out with my dog, and set him upon
the goats: but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon
the dog: and he knew his danger too well, for he would not
come near them.

JAN. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal: it is sufficient to observe, that I
was no less time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall: though it
was no more than about twenty-five yards in length, being a
half circle, from one place in the rock to another place, about
iwleIIve yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre,

e ind it.nonthou cnusos. 59

All this time I worked very hard; the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together: but I thought I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished;
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced,
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that
if any people were to come on shore there they would not per-
ceive any thing like a habitation: and it was very well I did
so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasron. ,

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent
discoveries, in these walks. of something or other to my advan-
tage; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, who build,
not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks: and, taking some youn ones, I
endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; ut when
they grew older, they flew all awa ; which, perhaps, was at
first for want of feeding them, for had nothing to give them:
however, I frequently found their nests, rnd got their young
ones, which were very good meat. And now, in the managing
my household afi'airs, I found myself wanting in many things,
which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as
indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance, I could never
make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I
observed before; but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, thongh I spent many weeks about it: I
could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true to
one another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also
over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so
that as soon as it was dark, which was generally b seven
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remember the ump of
bees-wax with which I made candles in my African adventure;
but I had none of that now: the only remedy I had was, that
when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow; and with a little
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me
light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In the
middle of all my labours it happened, that in rummaging my
things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted before, had
been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry; not for this
voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been in the bag
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag
but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for
some other use (I think, it was to put powder in, when IA)

60 ADVENTURES or

din'ded it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook
the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification,
under the rock.

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that
I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of any thing, and not
so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing there:
when about a month after, I saw some few. stalks of something
green, shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly
astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or
twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley of the
same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto acted upon no
religious foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any
thing that had bct'allen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as we
lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as inquiring
into the end of Providence in these things, or his order in
governing events in the world. But after I saw barley grow
there. in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially as I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangely; and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directed purely for my sustenance, on that wild
miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes ; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account: and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks~
of rice. and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my suppor ut, not doubting that there was more in the
place, I went 0 all that part of the island where I had been
before, searchin in eve corner, and under every rock, for
more of it; but I could u nd any. At last it occurred to my
thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's-meat in that
place, and thenfihe'idbder began to cease: and I must con-
fess, my religious lb'ankfulness to God's providence began to
abate too, upon the' discovering that all this was nothing but
what was common; though I ought to have been as thankful
for so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been
miraculous: for it was really the work of Providence, as to
me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of
corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all
the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I
should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in
the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas,
if I had thrown it any where else, at that time, it would have
been burned up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season. which was about the end of J nne; and, laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again; hoping, in time,
to have some quantity sufficient to su ply me with bread. But
it was not till the fourth year that I) could allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as
I shall show afterwards, in its order; for I lost all that I sowed
the first season, by not observing the proper time; as I sowed
just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at
least not as it would have done; of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care; and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz.
to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it
up without baking, though I did that also after some time.--
But to return to my Journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get
my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up ; contriving
to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder,
that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.

APRIL 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the
ladder to the t0p, and then pulled it up after me, and let it
down in the inside: this was a complete enclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from
without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the case
was thus :---As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent,
just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frightened
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for, all on a
sudden, I found the earth come crumblin dOWn from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hi1 r my head, and
two of the posts I had set up in the cave eyed in a frightful
manner. I was heartily scared; ut than 'nothing of what
really was the cause, only thinkin hat tip of my cave was
falling in, as some of it had done be for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forward to m d not thinking
myself safe there neither, 1 got ov wa l for fear of the
pieces of the hill which I expected m1 t roll down upon me.
I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I
plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake : for the ground I stood
on shook three times at about eight minutes distance, with three
such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building
that could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and a great
piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from
me, next the sea, fell down, with such a terrible noise as I
never heard in all my life. I perceived also that the very sea
was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks
were stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself(having never felt
the like, nor discoursed with any one that had) that I was like
one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea: but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rousing me
from the stupified condition I was in. filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and
my household goods, and burying all at once; this sunk my
very soul within me a second time. .

After the third shock was over. and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; yet I had not heart enough to
go over my wall again. for fear of being buried alive. but sat
still upon the ground greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the least seri-
ous religious thought; nothing but the common Lord, leave
mercy upon me! and when it was over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast. and grow cloudy,
as if it would rain; and soon after the wind rose by little and
little. so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea was. all on a sudden, covered with foam
and froth ; the shore was covered with a breach of the water;
the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it
was. This held about three hours, and then began to abate;
and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain
very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came into my
thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequence of
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and
I might venture into my cave again. With this thought my
spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade
me, I went in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so
violent. that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and
I was forced to get into my cave, though very much afraid and
uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This violent rain
forced me to a new work. viz. to cut a hole through my new
fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would
else have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave for
some time, and found no more shocks of the earthquake follow,
I began to be more composed. And now to support my spirits.
which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store.
and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then, and
always. very sparingly. knowing I could have no more when
that was gone. It continued raining all that night. and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but my
mind being more composed. I began to think of what I had best
do; concluding, that if the island was subject to these earth-
quakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must
consider of building me some little hut in an open place, which
I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men: for if I staid where I
was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it now stood, being just under the hanging preci-
pice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would
certain] fall upon m tent. I spent the two next days, being
the l9t and 20th oiy April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation. The fear of being swallowed alive
affected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the appre-
hension of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost equal
to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw how every thing
was put in order, how pleasantly I was concealed, and how
safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove. In the
mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal
of time for me to do this; and that I must be contented to run
the risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient camp, and
secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion I com-
posed myself for a time; and resolved that I would go to work
with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in
a circle as before, and set up my tent in it when it was finished;
but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was ready,
and fit to remove to. This was the 21 st.

APRIL 22. The next morning I began to consider of means
to put this measure into execution; but I was at a great loss
about the tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of
hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the In-
dians) ; but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood.
they were all full of notches, and dull: and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This
caused me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and
death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string,
lttgeurn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at
i rt . '

Hoyle. I had never seen any such thing in England, or at
least not to take notice how it was done, though since I have
observed it is very common there: besides that, my grindstone
was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week's
work to bring it to perfection.

APRIL 28, 29. These two whole days I 'took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.

APRIL 30. Having perceived that my bread had been low
a great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself
to one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.
 

SECTION IX.

ROBINSON OBTAINS MORE ARTICLES FRO." THE WRISCK.---lll$ ILLNESS AND
AFFLICTION.

MAY 1. In the morning, looking toward the seaside, the tide
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordi-
nary, and it looked like a cask: when I came to it, I found a
small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship,
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out
of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel that
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gun-
powder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as
hard as a stone: however, I rolled it farther on the shore for
the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to
the wreck of the ship, to look for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed.
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved
up at least six feet: and the stern (which was broke to pieces,
and parted from the rest, by the force of the sea, soon after I
had left rummaging of her) was tossed, as it were, up, and cast
on one side: and the sand was thrown so high on that side
next her stern, that I could now walk quite up to her when the
tide was out; whereas there was a great piece of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck
without swimming. I was surprised with this at first, but soon
concluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, so many
things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of remov-

,'.\.'-.
ing my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any way into the
ship: but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for
all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However,
as I had learned not to despair of any thing, I resolved to pull
every thing to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that
every thing I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.

MAY 3. I began with my saw, "and cut a piece of a beam
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or quar-
ter-deck together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared
away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay
highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for
that time.

MAY 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to
leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long
line of some rope-yarn. but I had no hooks; yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried
in the sun, and ate them dry.

MAY 5. Worked on the wreck: out another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir planks off from the decks; which I
tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of flood
came on.

MAY 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron work; worked very hard, and
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.

MAY 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent
to work: but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose; and the inside of the hold lay so open that
I could see into it; but almost full of water and sand.

MAY 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
and sand. I wrenched up two planks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for
next day.

MAY 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also
a roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it was too heavy
to remove.

MAY 10 to 14. Went every day to the wreck; and got a
great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or
three hundred weight of iron.

MAY 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece of the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a
half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the

hatchet.
MAY 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck

appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed
so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide
prevented my going to the wreck that day.

MAY 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore,
at a great distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what
they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy
for me to bring away.

MAY 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck;
and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests: but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and
a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt
water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every
day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food ;
which I always appointed, during this part of my employment,
to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was
ebbed out: and by this time I had gotten timber, and plank,
and iron work, enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how: and I also got, at several times. and in several pieces,
near one hundred weight of the sheet~lead.

J UNP. 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tor-
toise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen: which, it seems,
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity:
for bad I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might
have had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards;
but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

J UNE 17, I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her
threescore eggs: and her flesh was to me, at that time, the
most savoury and pleasant that I ever tasted in my life ; having
had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this
horrid place.

J UNF. 18. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I thought,
at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was somewhat chilly;
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

J UNE 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had
been cold.

JUNE 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and

feverish.
JUNE 21. Very ill; frightened almost to death with the

apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help:
prayed to God, for the first time since the storm of Hull ; but
scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being all con-
fused.

1 use '22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions
of sickness.
J Us: 23. Very had again; cold and shivering, and then a

violent headache.

J UN: 24. Much better.

J use 25. An ague very violent: the fit held me seven
hours; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.

JUNE 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak: however, I killed a she-
goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some
of it, and ate. 1 would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.

J UN}: 27. The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day,
and neither ate nor drank. I was read to perish for thirst;
but so weak, I had not strength to stan up, or to get myself
any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-
headed: and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew
not what to say: only lay and cried, Lord, look upon me!
Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me! I suppose I did
nothing else for two or three hours ; till the fit wearing off, I
fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I
awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceed-
ing thirsty: however. as I had no water in my whole habita-
tion, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.
In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I thought that
I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where
I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw
a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of
fire, and light upon the ground: he was all over as bright as a
flame, so that I could but just hear to look towards him: his
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for
words to describe: when he stepped upon the ground with his
feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before
in the earthquake; and all the air looked, to my apprehension,
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He had no sooner
landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me,
with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when
he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express
the terror of it: all that I can say I understood, was this:
Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance,
now thou shalt die; at which words, I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand, to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terri-
ble vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even
dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to
describe the impression that remained upon my mind when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by
the good instruction of my father was then worn out, by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with none but such as were, like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not remem-
ber that I had, in all that time, one thought that so much as
tended either to looking upward towards God, or inward to-
wards a reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or consciousness of evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hard-
ened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common sailors,
can be supposed to be; not having the least sense, either of the
fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to him, in deliver-
ances.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never
had so much as one thought of its being the hand of God, or
that it was a just punishment for my sin; either my rebellious
behaviour against my father, or my present sins, which were
great; or even as a punishment for the general course of my
wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa. I never had so much as one thought of
what would become of me; or one wish to God to direct me
whither I should go, or to keep me from the danger which
apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages: but I was quite thoughtless of a God or a Pro-
vidence ; acted like a mere. brute. from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates of common sense only; and indeed hardly
that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Por--
tn ese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and honour-
ab y, as well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in
my thoughts. \Vhen, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and
in danger of drowning, on this island, I was as far from re-
morse, or looking on it as a judgment: I only said to myself
often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to he always
miserable.

It is true, when I first got on shore here. and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with
a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankful-
ness: but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight of
joy; or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least
reflection upou the distinguished goodness of the hand which
had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved
when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Provi-
dence had been thus merciful to me: just the same common
sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are got safe
ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown all in the next
bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over: and all
the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was, afterwards,
on due consideration, made sensible of my condition,--how I
was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human
kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption,---as
soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not
starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore
off, and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the works
proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough
from being afilicted at my condition, as a judgment from Hea-
ven, or as the hand of God against me: these were thoughts
which very seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal. had,
at first. some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something mira-
culous in it; but as soon as that part of the thought was
removed. all the impression which was raised from it wore off
also, as I have noted already. Even the earthquake, though
nothing could be more terrible in its nature. or more immedi-
ately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such
things, yet no sooner was the fright over, but the impression it
had made went off also. I had no more sense of God, or his
judgments, much less of the present affliction of my circum-
stances being from his hand, than if I had been in the most
prosperous condition of life. But now, when I began to be
sick. and a leisure view of the miseries of death came to place
itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the bur-
den of a strung distemper, and nature was exhausted with the
violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began
to awake; and I reproached myself with my past life, in which
I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal
with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed
me for the second or third day of my distemper; and in the
violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of
my conscience. extorted from me some words like praying to
God: though I cannot say it was a prayer attended either with
desires or with hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright
and distress. My thoughts were confused ; the convictions
great upon my mind; and the horror of dying in such a mise-
rable condition, raised vapours in my head with the mere
apprehension: and, in these hurries of my saul, I knew not
what my tongue might express: but it was rather exclamation,
such as, Lord, what a miserable creature am I! If I should
be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what will
become of me? Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I
could say no more for a good while. In this interval, the good
advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his pre-
diction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story, viz.
that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me;
and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in
my recovery. Now, said I, aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and I have
none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a station of life wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it
myself, nor learn from my parents to know the blessing of it.
I left them to mourn over my folly; and now I am left to
mourn under the consequences of it: I refused their help and
assistance, who would have pushed me in the world, and would
have made every thing easy to me; and now I have difficulties
to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support;
and no assistance, no comfort. no advice. Then I cried out.
Lord. be my help, for I am in great distress. This was the
first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many
years. But I return to my Journal.

HIS REOO\'ERY.--HIS COMFORT IN READING-TUB SCRIPTURES.--MAKIPSS AN
EXCURSION INTO THE INTERIOR OI" THE ISLANbo--FORMS "IS a BOWEII."

JUNE 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did was to fill a
large square case-bottle with water; and set it upon my table.
in reach of my bed : and to take of? the chill or aguish disposi-
tion of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into
it. and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the
goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very
little. I walked about; but was very weak, and withal very
sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable condition.
dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night.
I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs; which I roasted
in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell : and this was
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I
could remember, in my whole life. After I had eaten, I tried
to walk; but found myself so weak, that I could hardly carry
the gun (for I never went out without that); so I went but a

. little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon

the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth.
As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred to me:
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?
\Vhence 1s it produced? And 11 hat am I. and all the other
creatures. wild and tame, human and brutal? \Vhence are we "
Surely, we are all made by some secret power. who formed the
earth and sea. the air and sky. And who 15 that? Then it fol-
lowed most naturally, It 15 God that has made all. Well, but
then. it came. on, if God has made all these things, he guides
and governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the
power that could make all things, must certainly have power
to guide and direct them: if so, nothing can happen in the
great circuit of his works, either without his knowledge or
appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition: and if
nothing happens without his appointment, he has appointed all
this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thought, to contra-
dict any of these conclusions: and therefore it rested upon me
111th the. greatest force, that it must needs be that God had
appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought to this
miserable circumstance by his direction, he having the sole
power. not of me. only, but of every thing that happens 1n the
world. Immediately it followed, \Vhy has God done this to
me. ' \V hat bar 6 I done to be thus used? My conscience pre-
sently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphcmed;
and methought it spoke to me like a voice, \Vretch! dost thou
ask 11 hat thou hast done. ' Look back upon a dreadful mispent
life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done? Ask, why' 1s it
that thou 11 ert not long ago destro1ed? Why 11' ert thou not
drowned 1n Y armouth Roads; killed 111 the fight when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war; de1oured by the wild
beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned he; e, when all the
crew perished but thy self' Dost thou ask 11 hat thou hast done. 7
I 11 as struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished,
and had not a 11 ord to say; no, not to answer to myself: and,
rising 11p pensi1 e and sad. 11 alked back to my retreat, and went
over my 11 all. as if I had been going to bed: but my thoughts
11' ere sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I
sat down in the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now. as the apprehension of the return of my distemper
terrified me very much it occurred to my thought, that the
Brazilians take no p111 31(- but their tobacco for almost all dis-
tempers , and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco 1n one of the
chests, which was quite cured; and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt: for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books
I had saved lay there too. I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found lei-
sure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I say, I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not. as to my
distemper, nor whether it was good for it or not; but I tried
several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit
one way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it
in my mouth; which, indeed, at first, almost stupified my
brain; the tobacco being green and strong, and such as I had
not been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an
hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it
when I lay down: and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of
coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as
I could bear it; as well for the heat, as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and
began to read ; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having
opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me
were these: " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These words were
very apt to my case; and made some impression upon my
thoughts at the time of reading them. though not so much as
they did afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the word had
no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so
impossible in my apprehension of things, that, as the children
of Israel said when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can God
spread a table in the wilderness?" so I be u to say, Can even
God himself deliver me from this place? nd as it was not for
many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often
upon my thoughts: but, however, the words made a great
impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It
now grew late; and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head
so much, that I inclined to sleep: so I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want any thing in the night, and went to
bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in
all my life; I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the
promise to me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble,
he would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer
was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco:
which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I
could scarce get it down: immediately upon this I went to bed.
I found presently the rum flew up into my head violently; but
I fell into a sound sleep, and wakcd no more till, by the sun.
it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the
next day: nay, to this hourI am partly of opinion, that I slept
all the next day and night, and till almost three the day after ;
for otherwise, I know not how I should lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years
after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing
the line, I should have lost more than one day; but certainly
I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way. Be

My condition began now to be. though not less miserable as
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind. and my
thoughts being directed. bI constantly reading the scripture
and praying to God. to things of II higher nature, I had a Irreat
deal of comfort within. which. till now. I knew nothing of;
also. as my health and strength returned. I hestirred me, to
tarnish my 3self with every thing that I I anted, and make mI
way of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th. I "as chiefly employed In
walking about with my gun in my hand. a little and a little at
a time as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit
of sickness: for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was.
and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which
I made use of was perfectly new. and perhaps what had neI er
cured an agne. before; neither can I recommend it to any one
to practise. by this experiment: and though it did carry off
the fit. yet it rather contributed to weakening me , for 1 had

learned from it also this, in particular; that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health
that could be, especially in those rains which came attended
with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which
came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with
such storms, so I found that this rain was much more dangerous
than the rain which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months:
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be.
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having secured my
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire
to make a more perfect discover of the island. and to see
what other productions I might nd, which I yet knew no-
thing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more par-
ticular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first.
where, as l hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, very fresh and good: but this being the dry season,
there was hardly any water in some parts of it; at least, not
any stream. 0n the banks of this brook I found many plea--
sant savannahs or meadows, plain. smooth. and covered with
grass: and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher
grounds (where the water. as it might be supposed, never over-
flowed), I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing
to a very great and strong stalk: and there were divers other
plants, which I had no knowledge of, or understanding about,
and that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I
could not find out. I searched for the cassava root, which the
Indians. in all that climate, make their bread of; but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand
them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild ; and, for want of
cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these disco-
veries for this time; and came back, musing with myself what
course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any
of the fruits or plants which I should discover ; but could bring
it to no conclusion; for. in short. I had made so little observa-
ti0n while I was in the Brazils. that I knew little of the plants
in the field; at least. very little that might serve me to any
purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and
after going something farther than I had gone the day before.
I found the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, and the
country become more woody than before. In this part I found
different fruits: and particularly I found melons upon the
ground. in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees: the
vines, indeed, had spread over the trees. and the clusters of
grapes were now just in their prime. very ripe and rich. This
was a surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of
them, but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of
them; remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the
eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were
slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. I found,
however, an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to
cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or
raisins are kept; which I thought would be (as indeed they

were) as wholesome and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes
were to be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation; which. by the way, was the first night, as I might
say, I had lain from home. At night, I took my first con--
trivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well; and the
next morning proceeded on my discovery, travelling near four
miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley; keeping
still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north
sides of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little
spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill
by me. ran the other way, that is. due east; and the country
appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being
in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked like
a planted garden. I descended a little on the side of that de-
licious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though
mixed with other afllicting thoughts), to think that this was all
my own; that I was king and lord of all this country inde-
feasibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey
it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of
a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees,
and orange, lemon, and citron trees, but all wild, and very few
bearing an fruit; at least not then. However, the green
limes that gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.
I found now I bad business enough, to gather and carry home;
and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and
lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was
approaching. In order to this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place; and a
great parcel of limes and lemons in another place ; and, taking
a few of each with me, I travelled homeward: and resolved
to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,
to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three
days in this journey, I came home (so I must now'call my
tent and my cave): but before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the juice,
having broken and bruised them, they were good for little or78 Anvrzs'rvass or

nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring
only a few.

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest ; but I was surprised,
when. coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and
tine when I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod
to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there. and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there
were some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this,
but what they were I knew not. However. as I found there
was no laying them up in heaps, and no carrying them away
in a sack ; but that one way they would be. destroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own weight: I
took another course: I then gathered a large quantity of the
grapes. and hang them upon the out--branches of the trees. that
they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant-
uess of the situation; the Security from storms on that side;
the water and the wood: and concluded that I had pitched
upon a place to fix my abode in, which was by far the worst
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally
safe as where I was now situate; if possible, in that pleasant
fruitful part of the. island.'

This thought ran long in my head; and I was exceeding fond
of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me:
but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I
was now by the seaside, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my advantage, and, by the same
ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such thing should ever happen. yet to enclose myself
among the hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not only
improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by
any means to remove. However, I was so enamoured of this
place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole re-
maining part of the month of July; and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved, as above stated, not to remove, yet I
built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a dis-
tance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I
could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood.
Here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights toge-
ther; ahvays going over it with a ladder, as before: so that I
fancied now I had my country and my seacoast house. This
work took me up till the beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labour. when the rains came on, and made me stick close to
my first habitation: for though I had made a tent like the
other. with a piece of sail, and spread it very well, yet I had
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave
behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said. I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The ad of August,l found
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed
were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take
them down from the trees; and it was very happy that I did
so, as the rains which followed would have spoiled them. and
I should have lost the best part of my winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
cave, but it began to rain: and from hence. which was the
14th of August, it rained. more or less, every day till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season. I was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats. who ran away from me, or, as I thought. had been dead;
and I heard no more of her, till, to my astonishment, she came
home with three kittens. This was the more strange to me,
because, about the end of August, though I had killed a wild
cat. as I called it, with my gun. yet I thought it was quite a
ditl'ereut kind from our European cats: yet the young cats
were the same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both
of my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But from
these three, I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats. that
I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to
drive them from my house as much as. possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me, My food was now regulated thus: I ate a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh.
or of the turtle, broiled, for m dinner (for, to my great mis-
fortune, I had no vessel to bo' or stew any thing); and two
or three of the turtle's eggs for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
dail two or three hours at enlarging my cave : and by degrees
wor ed it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of
the hill; and made a door, or way out, which came beyond
my fence or wall: and so I came in and out this way. But I
was not perfectly easy at lying so open: for as I had managed
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, I
thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there
was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had
yet seen upon the island being a goat.

SEPTEMBER 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniver-
sary of my landing, I cast up the notches on my post, and
found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days.
I kept this day as a solemn fast; setting it apart for religious
exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknow-
ledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him
to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and having not
tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the
going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it. I
had all this time observed no sabbath-day; for as at first I
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch
than ordinary for the sabbath-day. and so did not really know
what any of the days were: but now having cast up the days,
as above, I found I had been there a year; so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath: though
I found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two in
my reckoning. A little after this, my ink beginning to fail
me, I contented myself to use it more sparingly; and to write
down only the most remarkable events of my life, without
continuing a daily memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before
I had it; and what I am going to relate was one of the most
discouraging experiments that I had made at all.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley,
and rice, which I had so surprisingly found sprung up, as I
thought, of themselves. I believe there were about thirty
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought
it a proper time to sow it after the rains; the sun being in its
southern position. going from me. Accordingly I dug a' piece
of ground, as well as I could, with my wooden spade; and
dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but, as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper
time for it; so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving
about a handful of each: and it was a great comfort to me
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this
time came to any thing; for the dry month following, and the
earth having thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till
the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had
been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow,
which I easily imagined was from the drought, I sought for a
moister piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest
of my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox.
This having the rainy month of March and April to water it,
sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but
having only part of the seed left, and not daring to sow all that
I had, I got but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amounting to above half a peek of each kind. But by this
experiment I was made master of my business, and knew
exactly when was the proper time to sow; and that I might
expect two seed-times, and two harvests, every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were
over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower; where, though I had not been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts.
were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usuall shoots the firsctafiear after lopping its head;
but I could not tel what tree to it that these stakes were
cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see
the young trees grow; and I prrned them, and led them to
grow as much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how
beautiful a figure they grew into in three years : so that, though
the hedge made a circle of about twen -five yards in diameter,
yet the trees, for such I might now cal them, soon covered it,
and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the
dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall
(I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing
the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards dis-
tance from my first fence, they grew presently; and were at
first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a
defence also; as I shall observe in its order.

SECTION XI.

ROBINSON MAKES A TOUR 1'0 EXPLORE "IS ISLANDa--EMI'LOYED IN BAhKE'I'
MAKING.

I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into
the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally
thus: From the middle of February to the middle of April,
rainy; the sun being then on or near the equinox. From the
middle of April till the middle of August, dry; the sun being
then north of the line. From the middle of August till the
middle of October, rainy; the sun being then come back to
the line. From the middle of October till the middle of Fe-
bruary, dry ; the sun being then to the south of the line.

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by expe-
rience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I
took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out: and I sat within doors as much
as possible during the wet months. This time I found much
employment, and very suitable also to the time ; for I found
great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish
myself with but by hard labour and constant application:
particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket: but
all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that
they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to
me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take great delight
in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my father
lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys
usually are, very oflicious to help, and a great observer of the
manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lending
a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods
of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I
cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the
sallows, willows, and osiers. in England; and I resolved to
try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country-house,
as I called it; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found
them to my purpose as much as I could desire: whereupon I
came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a
quantity. which I soon found, for there was great plenty of
them. These 1 set up to dry within my circle or hedge ; and
when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave: and
here, during the next season, I employed myself in making,
as well as I could, several baskets; both to carry earth, or to
carry or lay up any thing as I had occasion for. Though I
did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suffi-
ciently serviceable for m purpose: and thus, afterwards, I
took care never to be wi out them; and as my wicker-ware
decayed, I made more; especially strong deep baskets, to
place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to
have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two other wants. I had no vessel to hold any thing
that was liquid. except two runlets, which were almost full of
rum; and some glass bottles, some of the common size, and
others (which were case-bottles) square, for the holding of
waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any
thing; except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship,
and which was too big for such use as I desired it, viz. to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second
thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe; but it was
impossible for me to make one; however, I found a con-
trivance for that too at last. I employed myself in planting
my second row of stakes or piles, and also in this wicker-
working, all the summer or dry season; when another busi-
ness took me up more time than it could be imagined I could
spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole
island; and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to
where I had built my bower, and where I had an opening
quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved
to travel quite across to the seashore, on that side: so taking
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usua ; with two biscuit-cakes, and a
great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store; I began my
journey. When I had passed the vale where my bower stood,
as above, I came within view of the sea, to the west; and it
being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island
or continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending
from \V. to \V. S. 'W. at a very great distance ; by my guess.
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be; other-
wise than that I knew it must be part of America; and, as I
concluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions; and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where,
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than I
was now. I therefore acquiesced in the dispositions of Provi-
dence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this, and
left off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair. I considered that
if this land was the Spanish coast. I should certainly, one
time or other. see some vessel pass or repass one way or other;
but if not. then it was the savage coast between the. Spanish
country and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the
worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters. and
fail not to murder and devour all human beings that fall into
their hands.

W'ith these considerations, walking very leisurely forward,
I found this side of the island, where I now was, much plea-
santer than mine; the open or savannah fields sweetly adorned
with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw
abundance of parrots: and fain would have caught one, if
possible. to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young parrot;
for I knocked it down with a stick, and, having recovered it,
I brought it home: but it was sonic years before I could make
him speak; however, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though
it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in
the low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes:
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met
with; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed
several. But I had no need to be venturous: for I had no
want of food, and of that which was very good too; especially
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise.
With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could
not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the
company ; and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I
had great cause for thankfulness; as l was not driven to any
extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabout; but I took so many turns and returns,
to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary
enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for the night;
and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground, either
from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come
at me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side. of the island : for
here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles;
whereas. on the other side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many
kinds; some of which I had seen, and some of which I had not
seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such as I
knew not the names of. except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased. but was very sparing
of my powder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill a
she-goat, if I could, which [could better feed on. But though
there were many goats here, more than on my side the island.
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come. near
them ; the country being flat and even, and they saw me much
sooner than when I was upon a hill.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine ; yet I had not the least inclination to remove; for as I
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me. and I
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a jour--
ney, and from home. However, I travelled along the seashore
towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and then set-
ting up a great .pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I
would go home again; and that the next journey I took should
be on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling, and
so round till I came to my post again : of which in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking
I could easily keep so much of the island in my view. that I
could not miss my first dwelling by viewing the country: but
I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or three
miles. I found myself descended into a very large valley, but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood,
that I could not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the
position of the sun at that time of the day. And it happened
to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for
three or four days while I was in this valley; and not being
able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortable, and
at last was obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by easy jour-
neys I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot,

and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things very
heavy.

IN this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and running to take hold of it, I caught it, and saved
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if
I could; for I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot should be
all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I had made of some rope-yarn, which I always
carried about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty,
till I came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him ;
for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I had
been absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This
little wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had
been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and
it rendered every thing about me so c0mfortable, that I resolved
I would never go a great way from it again, while it should be
my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my long journey: during which, most of the time was taken
up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who
began now to be more domestic, and to be mighty well ac-
quainted'with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid
which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to
fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went. and
found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out), but
was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs
of trees. and branches of such shrubs as I could find. and threw
it over. and having fed it, I tied it as I did before. to lead it
awa '; but it was so tame with being hungry, that! had no
nee to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as l
continually fed it. the creature became. so loving. so gentle, and
so fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics also,
and would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come.
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner
as before. being the anniversary of my landing on the island :
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments for the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with. and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks to God for
having been pleased to discover to me. that it was possible I
might be more happy even in this solitary condition, than I
should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world: that he could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society,
by his presence, and the communications of his grace to my
soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon his providence here, and to hope for his eternal presence
hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now Is was. with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days: and now I changed both my sorrows
and my joys: my verv desires altered, my affections changed
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what they
were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for view-
ing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would
break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I
was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal
bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness. with-
out redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures of
my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands, and weep like a child: sometimes
it would take me in the middle of m work, and I would
immediately sit down and sigh, and loo upon the ground for
an hour or two together: this was still worse to me; but if I
could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings by words, it
would go off; and my grief being exhausted, would abate.SS an1'sxrvaas or

But n011 I began to exercise n13 self with ma thoughts: I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to my present state. One morning, being ver3 sad. I opened
the Bible upon these 11' ords. " I will never leave thee. nor tor--
sake thee. "' immediately it occurred that these 11 ords 11 ere to
me . 11 I11 else should they be directed 111 such a manner, just
at the moment when I was mourning over my condition. as
one forsaken of God and man. \Vell then, said I if God does
not forsake me. of 11 hat ill consequence can it be. or 11 hat mat-
ters it. though the world should forsake me; seeing. on the
other hand, if I had all the 11' orld. and should lose the favour
and blessing of God. there would be no comparison in the loss '

From this moment I began to conclude 1n my mind that it
was possible for me to be more happ3 111 this forsaken. solitary
condition. than it 11 as probable I should e1' er have been 111 any
other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was
going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I
know not 11h'1t it 11' as. but something shocked m3 mind at that
thought. and l durst not speak the words. How canst thou be
such a hypocrite. sa1d 1 e1 en audibl3. to pretend to be thank--
1111 for a condition 11l11ch. b011'e1' er thou may est endeavour to
be contented 111th thou nouldest rather pra3 heartily to be
delivered from! Here I stopped: but though I could not say
I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to
God for opening my e1 es, by whatever afflicting prov idences.
to see the former condition of my life. and to mourn for my
wickedness. and repent. I ne1 er opened the Bible. or shut it,
but my 1er3' soul within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine. to pack it 11p among
my goods; and for assisting me after" ards to 3111 e it out of the
wreck of the ship.

Thus. and 111 this disposition of mind. I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so parti-
cular an account of my works this 3ear as the first. yet in
general it may be observed that l was very seldom idle; but
ha1 mg regularly di1ided my time. according to the several
daily employ ments that were before me; such as. first, My
duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures. "hich I con-
stantly set apart some time for. thrice every day: secondly,
Going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours every morning, when it did not rain . thirdl.
Ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed
or catched for my supply: these took up great part of the day;
also it is to be considered, that 1n the middle of the day, when
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heatnas too great
to stir out; so that about four hours 1n the evening was all the
time I could be supposed to work m; with this exception, that
sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and
went to 11 ork 1n the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours
which. for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill. everv
thing I did took up out of my time: for example, I was full
two and forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which
I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers. with their tools
and a sawpit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree
in half a day.

My case was this; it was a large tree which was to be out
down. because my board was to be. a broad one. This tree I
was three days cutting down. and two more in cutting off the,
boughs, and reducing it to a log. or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of
it into chips, till it was light enough to move; then I turned it.
and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board, from end
to end; then turning that side downward, cut the other side,
till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my
hands in such a piece of work ; but labour and patience carried
me through that, and many other things: I only observe this
in particular, to show the reason why so much of my time went
away with so little work, viz. that what might be a little to be
done with help and tools. was a vast labour, and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding
this, with patience and labour I went through many things:
and, indeed, every thing that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured or dug up for them was not great ; for. as Iobserved,
my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck,
having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season: but
now my crop promised very well ; when, on a sudden, I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several
sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it; as, first,
the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares. who, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as
it came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to
shoot up into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this, but by making an enclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil; and the.
more, because it required speed. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crap, I got it tolerably well fenced
in about three weeks' time ; and shooting some of the creatures
in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, t ing
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and ark
all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the
place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to_
ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before. while my corn was in
the blade. so the birds were as likely to ruin me now . when it
was in the ear: for going along by the place to see how it
throve. I saw n13 little crop surrounded with fowls. I know
not of how many sorts. who stood as it 33' ere. watching till I
should be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I
.1133 ms had my gun with me); I had no sooner shot. but there
rose 11p a little cloud of fo33 ls. which I had not seen at all.
from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibl3. for I foresaw that 1n a few days
they would de3our all my hopes; that I should be. starved.
and ne3 er be able to raise a crop at all . and what to do I could
not tell: how ev er. I resol3 ed not to lose my corn. if possible.
though I should watch it night and da3 . In the first place. I
went among it. to see what damage was already done. and
found they had spoiled a good deal 0! it; but that as it was 3 et
too green for them, thes9 loss was not so great. but that the
remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could be saved.

I staid by it to load my gun. and then coming away. I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me. as if
they only 33 aited till I was gone a33 ay- , and the event prov ed
it to be so: for as I walked ofl'. as it gone. I was no sooner out
of their sight than they dropped down, one b3 one. into the
corn again. I was so provoked. that I could not have patience
to stay till more came 011, knowing that every grain they eat
now was. as it might be said. a peck loaf to me in the. conse-
quence: so coming up to the hedge. I fired again. and killed
three of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them
11p, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in England.
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impos-
S1ble to imagine that this should have such an efl'ect as it had :
for the fowls not only never came to the corn. but. in short.
they forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see
a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was 3ery glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December. which was our second harvest of the
year. I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down:
and all I couldde was to make one as well as I could, out of
one ot the broad 533 ords. or cutlasses. which I saved among the
arms out of the ship. Howev er. as my first crop was but small.
I had no great difficulty to cut it down: in short, I reap ed it
my 33' ay, for I cut nothing of but the ears. and carried itp away
in a great basket which I had made. and so rubbed it out with
my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting. I found that
out of my half peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice. and
ab03 e two bushels and a half of barley , that 1s to say, by my
guess. for I had no measure.

How ever. this was great encouragement to me; and I fore.
saw that. in time. it would please God to supply me with
bread ; and yet here. I was perplexed again; for I neither
knew how to grind. or make meal of my corn. or indeed how
to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal. how to make
bread of it : and if how to make it. yet I knew not how to bake
it: these things being added to my desire. of having a good
quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop. but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season; and, in the mean time. to employ all
my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work
of providing myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said. that now I worked for my bread. It
is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, viz. the strange multitude of little things
necessary in the providing. producing. curing, dressing, mak-
ing. and finishing this one article of bread. I, that was reduced
to a mere state of nature. found this to my daily discourage-
ment. and was made more. sensible of it every hour. even after
I had got the first handful of seed-corn. which. as I have said,
canie np unexpectedly. and indeed to a surprise.

First. I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or
shovel to dig it: well. this I conquered. by making a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work in but a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days to
make it, yet. for want of iron, it not Only wore out the sooner.
but made my work the harder. and performed it much worse.
However, this I bore with. and was content to work it out with
patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When
the corn was sown, I had no barrow, but was forced to go over
it myself. and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to
scratch it, as it may be called, rather than rake or barrow it.
When it was growing and own. I have observed already how
many things I wanted to ence it, secure it, mow or reap it,
cure and carry it home. thresh, part it from the chaff, and save
it: then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread. and an oven to bake it; and yet
all these things I did without, as shall be observed; and the
corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me: all this.
as I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but
that there was no help for; neither was my time so much loss .
to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was
every da appointed to these works; and as I resolved to use
none of t e corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me,
I had the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour
and invention, to furnish myself with utensils proper for the
performing all the operations necessary for making corn fit for
my use.

BUT now I was to prepare more land ; for I had seed enough
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a
week's work at least to make me a spade; which, when it was
done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it: however, I went through that.
and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as I could find them to my mindg and fenced them
in with a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut off that
wood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so
that, in one year's time, I knew I should have a quick or living
hedge, that would want but little repair. This work took me
up full three months; because a great part of the time was in
the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within doors,
that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found employ-
ment on the following occasions; always observing, that while
I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learned him to know
his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll;
which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by
any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work.
but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great
employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long studied,
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels,
which indeed I wanted much, but knew not where to come at
them : however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might botch up some
such pot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard and strong
enough to hear handling. and to hold any thing that was dry.
and required to be. kept so: and as this was necessary in the
preparing corn. meal. &c. which was the thing I was upon. I
resolved to make some as large as I could. and fit only to stand
like jars. to hold what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me. or rather laugh at me. to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil; what
odd. mishapen. ugly things I made; how many of them fell in.
and how many fell out. the clay not being still' enough to hear
its own weight; how many cracked by the over violent heat of
the sun. being set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces
with only removing. as well before as after they were dried:
and. in a word. how. after having laboured hard to find the
clay. to dig it. to temper it. to bring it home, and work it. I
could not make above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot
call them jars) in about two moaths' labour.

However. as the sun baked these two very dry and hard. I
lifted them very gently up. and set them down again in two
great wicker baskets. which I had made on purpose for them.
that they might not break; and as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I smiled it full of the
rice and barley straw ; and these two pots being to stand always
dry. I thought would hold my dry corn. and perhaps the meal,
when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots. yet
I made several smaller things with better success ; such as little
round pots. flat dishes. pitchers. and pipkins. and any thing my
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them very hard.

But all this would not answer my end. which was to get an
earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of
these could do. It happened some time after, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after
I had done \\ ith it. I found abroken piece of one of my earthen-
ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a
tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it; and said to myself.
that certainly they might be made to burn whole. if they would
burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters
burn in, or of glazing them with lead. though I had some lead
to do it with; but I placed three large pi kins and two or three
pots in a pile. one upon another. and p aced my firewood all
round it. with a great heap of embers under them. I plied the
fire with fresh fuel round the outside. and upon the top. till I
saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed
that they did not crack at all: when I saw them clear red, I let
them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them. though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand
which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I94 sovmrvaes or

slacked m1 fire gradually. till the pots began to abate of the
red colour; and watching them all night. that I might not let
the fire abate too fast in the morning I had three 1111 good I
will not say handsome. pipkius. and t11o other earthen pots. as
hard hurnt as could be desired; and one of them perfectly
glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment. I need not say that I 11 anted no sort
of earthen" are for 1111 use; but I must needs say. as to the
shapes at them. they were 1er1 indifferent, as an1 one may
suppose. as I had no way of making them but as the children
make dirt pies. or as a woman would make pies that never
learned to raise paste. No 101' at a thing of so mean a nature
w as e1 er equal to mine, when I touud I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the tire , and 1 had hardly patience to stay
till tl1e1'11ere cold before 1 set one on the fire again. 111th
some 11 ater in it. to boil me some meat. which it did admirably
11 ell . and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth .
though I wanted oatmeal. and several other ingredients requi-
site to make it so good as l 11 onld have had it been.

M1'ne\t concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat
some corn in; for as to the mill there was no thought of arri1' -
ing to that perfection of art with one pair at hands. To suppl1
this want I was at a great 1055: for. of all trades in the world,
I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonccutter as for a111'11hat-
ever . neither had I 11111 tools to go about it 111th I spent
many a da1 to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow.
and make fit for a mortar: but could find none at all. except
what was in the solid r01 L. and 11 inch I had no way to dig or
cut out . nor. indeed. 11 ere the rocks 1n the island of sufficient
hardness. as they 11 ere all of a sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither bear the 11 eight of a heavy pestle. nor 11 ould
break the corn without filling it with sand: so, after a great
deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over. and
resolved to look out a great block of hard 11'.ood which I found
indeed much easier , and getting one as big as I had strength
to stir, I rounded it. and formed it on the outside with my axe
and hatchet; and then, 11 ith the help of fire. and infinite labour,
made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater. of
the wood called iron-11' cod; and this I prepared and laid by
against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself
to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal. to make my bread.

My next difficulty was to make a sieve. or search. to dress
my meal. and to part it from the bran and the husk, without
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread. This
was a most difficult thing. even but to think on; for I had
nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin
canvass or stuti' to search the meal through. Here I was at a
full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to d0' .
linen I had noue left, but 11 hat 11 as mere rags; I had goats'-
hair. but neither knew how to weave it nor spin it; and had I
known how, here were no tools to work it with : all the remedy
I found for this was. at last recollecting I had. among the sea-
men's clothes which were saved out of the ship. some neckcloths
of calico or muslin, with some pieces of these I made three
small sieves, proper enough for the work; and thus I made. shift
for some years: how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered. and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn : for. first.
I had no yeast: as to that part, there was no supplying the
want. so I did not concern myself much about it; but for an
oven 1 was indeed puzzled. At length I found out an expedient
for that also. which was this; I made some earthen vessels.
very broad. but not deep, that is to say, about two feet diame-
ter. and not above nine inches deep: these I burned in the fire.
as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted
to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved
with some square tiles, of my own making and burning also;
but I should not call them square. \Vhen the firewood was
burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let them lie till
the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all the embers.
I set down my loaf. or loaves. and covering them with the
earthen pot, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot.
to keep in and add to the heat; and thus. as well as in the best
oven in the world. I baked my barley loaves, and became, in
a little time, a good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made
myself several cakes and puddings of the rice: but made no

pies, as I had nothing to put into them except the flesh of fowls
or goats.

It need not be wondered at. if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here: for, it is to be
observed. in the intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: I reaped my corn in its season.
and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the
ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for]
had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted
to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in ; for
the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of
the barley about twenty bushels, and of rice as much, or more,
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely; for my
bread had been quite gone a great while: I resolved also to
see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and
to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed

the last, in bapes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.

MEDITATES "IS ESCAPE FROM THE ISI.A.\'D.--BL'ILDS A CANOE.--I'AII.URE OF HIS
SCIIEMB.--RESIGNATION TO HIS CONDITION.--MAKPSS HIMSELF A NEW DRESS.

ALL the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had
seen from the other side of the island ; and I was not without
some secret wishes that I was on shore there; fancying, that
seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I might find
some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at
last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages,
and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse
than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came in their
power, I should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one
of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard
that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals, or man-
eaters; and I knew, by the latitude, that I could not be far off
from that shore. Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet
that they might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands, even when they have been ten or
twenty together; much more I, who was but one, and could
make little or no defence; all these things. I say, which I
ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts
afterwards, took up none of my apprehensions at first; yet my
head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the
shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain: then I
thought I would go and look at our ship's boat. which. as I
have said. was blown up upon the shore a great wav. in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She In nearly where
she did at first. but not quite; having turned. y the force of
the waves and the winds. almost bottom upward. against a high
ridge of beachy rough sand ; but no water about her, as before.
It' I had had hands to have refitted her. and to have launched
her into the water. the boat would have done very well. and I
might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough;
but I might have foreseen. that I could no more turn her and
set her upright upon her bottom. than I could remove the island ;
however. I went to the woods. and cut levers and rollers. and
brought them to the boat. resolving to try what I could do;
suggesting to myself. that if I could but turn her down. and
repair the damage she had received. she would be a very good
boat. and I might venture to sea in her.

I spared no pains, indeed. in this piece of fruitless toil. and
spent. I think. three or four weeks about it: at last. finding it
impossible to heave her up with my little strength. I fell to
digging away the sand. to undermine her. and so as to make
her fall down. setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her
right in the fall. But when I had done this. I was unable to
stir her up again. or to get under her. much less to move her
forward towards the water; so I was forced to give it over:
and yet. though I gave over the hopes of the. bout. my desire
to venture over the main increaseo. rather than diminished. as
the means for it seemed impossible.

At length. I began to think whether it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periagua. such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools. or, as I might sa . without
hands. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not on y thought
possible. but easy. and pleased myself extremely with the idea
of making it. and with my having much more convenience for
it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at all consider-
ing the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
the Indians did. viz. the want of hands to move it into the water
when it was made. a difficulty much harder for me to surmount
than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them: for
what could it avail me, if. after I had chosen my tree, and with
much trouble cut it down. and might be able with my tools to
hew and dub the outside into the preper shape of a boat. and
burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a
boat of it; if. after all this, I must leave it just where I found
it, and was not able to launch it into the water?

One would imagine. if I had had the least reflection upon my
mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, I
should have immediately thought how I was to get it into the

sea: but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage in it, that

I never once considered how I should get it off the land: and
it 11 as reall1, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it
0v er fort1' -fi1 e miles of sea. than the forty-fiv e fathoms of land,
where it lay, to set it afloat 1n the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, 11' ho had any of his senses awake. I pleased m1 self
with the design, without determining whether I was able to
undertake it; not but that the difficulty of launching .my boat
came often into In head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it. by this foo ish answer: Let us first make it; I warrant
I will find some "may or other to get it along when it is done.

This 11as a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree,
and I question much whether Solomon e1' er had such a one for
the building of the Temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet
eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet 11' here it
lessened and then parted into branches. It was not without
infinite labour that I felled this tree , I was t11 enty days hack-
iug and 111311 mg at the bottom. and fourteen more getting the
branches and limbs, and the 1ast spreading head of it, cut off:
after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a pro-
portion. and to something like the bottom of a boat. that it
might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three
months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make
an e\act boat of it: this I did. indeed, without fire, by mere
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour. till I had
brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to
have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely de-
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I
saw a canoe or a periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
there remained nothing but to get it into the water; which, had
I accomplished, I make no question but I should have begun
the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to he performed,
that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though
they cost me inexpressible labour too. It lay about one hun-
dred yards from the water, and not more; but the first Incon-
v enience was, it was up hill towards the creek. "'ell, to take
away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of
the earth, and so make a declivit this I began, and it cost
me a prodigious deal of opains; t(lhut who grudge pains that
have their deliverance 1n view?) when this was worked through,
and this difficulty managed, it) was still much the same, for I
could no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then
I measured the distance of ground. and resolved to cut a dock
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not
bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work ;
and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it
was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out,
I found by the number of hands I had, having none but my
own. that it must have been ten or twelve ears before I could
have gone through with it; for the shore ay so high, that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; this
attempt, though with great reluctancy, I was at length obliged
to give over also.

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late,
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and
befpre we judge rightly of our own strength to go through
wit 1 it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much comfort as before; for, by a constant study and
serious application to the word of God, and by the assistance
of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before; I entertained different notions of things; I looked
now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about:
in a word, I had nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to
have; I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it
hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well might I say, as father Abraham to Dives, " Be-

tween me and thee is a great gulf fixed."
In the first place, I was here removed from all the wicked-

ness of the world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for
I had all that I was now capable of enjoying: l was lord of
the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or
emperor over the whole country' which I had possession of;
there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute
sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised ship-
loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grou-
as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle
enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put to
any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships;
and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I
had enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was the
rest to me"! If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog
must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to
rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than
for fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dress

in food.

to mI self in the most liI ely colours, how I must have acted ifaomssoa' cavsoa. lot

I had got nothing out of the ship. I could not have so much
as got any food. except fish and turtles; and that. as it was
long before I found any of them. I must have perished; that
l should have lived. it'l had not perished. like a mere savage ;
that if I had killed a goat or a fowl. by any contrivance. I had
no way to flay or open it. or part the flesh from the skin and
the bowels. or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth.
and pull it with my claws. like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me. and very thankful for my present condition.
with all its hardships and misfortunes: and this part also I
cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt.
in their misery. to say. Is any affliction like mine? Let them
consider how much worse the cases of some. people are, and
their case might have been. if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection. which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was. comparing my present
condition with what I had deserved. and had therefore reason
to expect from the hand of Providence. I had lived a dread-
t'nl life. perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God.
I had been well instructed by my father and mother; neither
had they been wanting to me. in their endeavours to infuse an
early religious awe of God into my mind. a sense of my duty,
and what the nature and end of my being required of me. But.
alas! falling early into the. seafaring life. which. of all lives. is
the most destitute of the fear of God. though his terrors are
always before. them: I say. falling early into the seafaring life,
and into seafaring company, all that little sense of religion
which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my mess-
mates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death, which grew habitual to me; by my long absence from
all manner of opportunities to converse with any thing but what
was like myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or tending
towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliver-
ances I enjoyed (such as my escape from Sallee, my being
taken up by the Portuguese master of a ship, my being planted
so well in the Brazils, my receiving the cargo from England,
and the like), I never had once the words, Thank God, so much
as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress
had I so much as a thought to pray to him, or so much as to
say. Lord, have mercy upon me! no. nor to mention the name
of God. unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as
I have already observed, on account of my wicked and hard-
ened life past; and when I looked about me, and considered

what particular providences had attended me since my coming
into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me,--
had not only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for me,--this gave me great
hopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
mercies in store for me.

With these reflections. I worked my mind up, not only to a
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my
circumstances. but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to
complain. seeing I had not the due. punishment of my sins;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at
my condition. but to rejoice. and to give daily thanks for that
daily bread. which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed by a miracle,
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a
long series of miracles: and that I could hardly have named a
place in the uninhabitable part of the world where I could have
been cast more to my advantage; a place where. as I had no
society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers. to threaten my
life ; no venomous or poisonous creatures. which I might feed
on to my hurt; no savages, to murder and devour me. In a
word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life
of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of
comfort, but to make myself sensible of God's goodness to me.
and care over me in this condition; and after 1 did make a
just improvement of these things. I went away, and was no
more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone. or very
much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but
a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little.
till it was so pale. it scarce left any appearance of black upon
the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute
down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me : and, first, by casting up times past. I remem-
ber that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various
providences which befell me. and which. if I had been super-
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate. I might
have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of
curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends. and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee
man-of-war, and made a slave; the same day of the year that
I escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
same day-year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the
boat: and the same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously
saved twenty-six years after. when I was cast on shore in this
island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both
on one day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread,
I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship: this I had
husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of
bread a day for above a ear; and yet I was quite without
bread for near a year be ore I got any corn of my own; and
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all. the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to mira-
cu ous.

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had
none for a great while, except some chequered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully
preserved. because many times I could bear no clothes on but
a shirt; and it was a ver great help to me that I had. among
all the men's clothes of t ship, almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also, indeed, several thick watchcoats of the sea-
men's which were left, but they were too hot to wear: and
though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that
there was no need of clothes, yet I' could not go quite naked,
no. though I had been inclined to it. which I was not, nor
could I abide the thought of it, though I was all alone. The
reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could not bear
the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some
clothes on: nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin:
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it.
No more could I ever bring m self to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the eat of the sun heating with such
violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache
presently, by darting so directly upon my head, without a cap
or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my
hat, it would present] go away.

Upon these views, I. began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order: I had worn
out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if
I could not make jackets out of the great watchcoats that I had
by me, and with such other materials as I had : so I set to work
a tailoring, or rather, indeed, a batching, for I made most
piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make two or
three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while : as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift
indeed, till afterwards.

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them
up, stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which means some
of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but
others I found \ ery useful. The first thing I made. of these mm
a great cap for IIII head. II Ith the hair on the outside. to shoot

SECTION XV.

III-Z MAKES A SMALLER CANOE, IN WHICH III-Z A'ITEMI'I'S 'I'O CRUISE ROUND 'I'IIE
mama--ms PERIIDUS SITUATION AT sEA.---IIIPS RETURNS HOME.

I CANNOT say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the
same posture and place, just as before; the chief things I was
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley
and rice, and curing my raisins, Of both which I always kept
up just enough to have sufficient stock of one year's provision
beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily
pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make
me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that by digging a canal
to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly
big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as I ought
to do, how I should be able to launch it, so, never being able
to bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be
wiser the next time: indeed, the next time, though I could not
get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not
get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near
half a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave
it over: and though I was near two years about it, yet I never
grtlidged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea
at ast.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in
view when I made the first; I mean, of venturing over to the
ten'afirma, where it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly,
the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design,
and now I thought no more of it. As I had a boat, my next
design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had

s 3106 anvexrt'nes or

been on the other side in one place. crossing. as l have already
described it. over the. land. so the discoveries I made in that
little journey made me very eager to see other parts of the
coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing
round the island.

For this purpose. that I might do every thing with discretion
and consideration. I fitted up a little mast in my boat. and made
a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay
in store. and of which I had a great stock by me. Having titted
my mast and sail, and tried the boat. I found she would sail
very well: then I made little lockers. or boxes. at each end of
my boat. to put provisions. necessaries. ammunition. C\c. into.
to he kept dry, either front rain or the Spray of the sea: and a
little long hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat. where I
could lay my gun. making a flap to hang down over it. to keep
it drv.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern. like a mast.
to stand over my head. and keep the heat of the sun all me.
like an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea. but never went far out. nor for from the
little creek. At last. being eager to view the circunllerence of
my little kingdom. I resolved upon my cruise; and accord-
ingly. I victualled my ship for the voyage. putting in two
dozen of loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley
bread. an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great
deal of). a little bottle of rum. half a goat. and powder and shot
for killing more. and two large watchcoats. of those which. as
I mentioned before. Iliad saved out of the seamen's chests;
these I took, one to lie upon. and the other to cover me in the
night.

It was the sixth of November. in the sixth year of my reign.
or my captivity. which you please. that I set out on this voyage.
and I found it much longer than I expected; for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the. east side
of it. I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea. some above water, some under it: and beyond
that a shoal of sand. lying dry half a league more. so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again. not knowing how far it might
oblige me. to go out to sea. and. above all. doubting how I
should get back again; so I came to an anchor ; t'orl had made
me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling
which I got out of the ship.

Having secured mv boat. I took my gun and went on shore.
climbing up On a bill, which seemed to overlook that point,
where I saw the full extent of it. and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood. I per-
ceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current. which ran
to the east and even came close to the point' . and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger.
that II hen I came. into it, I might be carried out to sea in the
strength of it, and not be. able to make the island again: and.
indeed had I not got first upon this hill. I believe. it would
have been so; for there was the same current on the other side
the island. only that it set ofl' at a farther distance, and I saw
there was a strong eddy under the shore: so I had nothing to
do but to get out of the first current, and I should presently be
in an eddy.

I la" here. houeI'er, two day 8. because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E. S. E. and that being just contrary to the said
current made a great breach of the. sea upon the point; so that
it was not safe for me to keep too close. to the. shore, for the
breach. nor to go too far OK. because. of the stream.

The third day, in the morning. the wind having abated m er
night the sea was calm. and I ventured: but i am a warning-
piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I
come. to the point when I was not III en my boat' s length from
the shore. but I found my self In a great depth of II ater. and II
current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along with
it II ith such violence. that all I could do could not keep her so
mue h as on the edg I at it; but I tonnd it hurried me farther and
further out from the. eddy. which was on my left hand. There
was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do II Ith my
paddles signified nothing: and now I began to give myself m or
tor lost; for as the current "as on both sides of the island, I
knew in a 1er leagues' distance. they must join again, and then
I was irrecoverably gone . nor did I see any possibility of
avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me but of perish-
ing, not 0by the sea. for that was calm enough, but of starIine
for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as biz?
almost as I could lift and had tossed it into the boat; and I
had a great jar of fresh water. that Is to say one of my earthen
pots; but II hat II- as all this to being driven into the. vast oc can.
II here, to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island
for a thousand leagues at least'

And no" I Saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse.
Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as the
most pleasant place' In the II arid and all the happiness my
heart could wish for was to be but there. again. I stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes: 0 happ py desert! said I. I
shall neI er see thee more. 0 miserable creature! whither am I

going! Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper,
and how I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what
would I give to be on shore there again' Thus we never see
the true state at our condition till it is illustrated to us by its
contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the
want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation
I was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it
appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean. almost two
leagues. and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However. I worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost
exhausted. and kept my boat as much to the northward. that is.
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as pos--
sibly I could ; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian.
I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face. springing up
from S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially
when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale.
By this time I was got at a frightful distance from the island.
and had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had
been undone another way too; for I had no campass on board.
and should never have known how to have steered towards the
island. if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather con-
tinuing clear. I applied myself to get up my mast again, and
spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible,
to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was
so strong. the water was foul: but perceiving the water clear.
I found the current abate; and presently I found to the east.
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks:
these rocks I found caused the current to part again. and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks
to the north-east. so the other returned by the repulse of the
rocks", and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the
north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to
murder them, or who have been in such-like extremities. may
guess what my present surprise of joy was. and how gladly I
put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheer--
:ully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under
001.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again.
directly towards the island. but about two leagues more to the
northward than the current which carried me away at first: so
that when I came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore of it. that is to say. the other end of the island.

'opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent. and
served me no farther. However, I found that being between
two great currents, viz. that on the south side, which had huro
ried me away, and that on the north, which lay about a league
on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake of the
island, I found the water at least still, and running no way:
and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering
directly for the island, though not making such fresh way as I
did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league
of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned
this disaster, stretching out, as is described before, to the south-
ward, and casting oti' the current more southerly, had, of course,
made another eddy to the north; and this I found very strong.
but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was due
west, but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I
stretched across this eddy, slanting northwest: and, in about
an hour, came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in alittle
cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat: I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the
case. to think of attempting it by the way I went out ; and what
might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up
my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I wanted her.
In about three miles, or thereabout, coasting the shore, I came
to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed
till it came to a ve little rivulet or brook, where I found a
very convenient har our for my boat, and where she la as if
she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. ere I
put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it
was exceeding hot, I began my march. The way was comfort-
able enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I
reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,
being, as I said before, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade, to rest
my imbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep: but judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be
in, when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling me
by my name several times. Robin. Robin. Robin Crusoe; poor
Robin Crusoe! \Vhere are you. Robin Crusoe! ""here are.
you! Where have you been!

I was so dead asleep at first. being fatigued with rowing. or
paddling. as it is called, the first part of the day. and with walk-
ing the latter part. that I did not wake thoroughly : but dozing
between sleeping and waking. thought I dreamed that some-
body spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crusoe. Robin Crusoe. at last Ibegan to wake more perfectly.
and was at first dreadfully frightened. and started up in the.
utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes Open. but I
saw my Poll sitting on the tap of the hedge; and immediately
knew it was he that spoke. to me; for just in such bemoaning
language I had used to talk to him. and teach him; and he had
learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger. and
lay his bill close to my face, and cry. Poor Robin Crusoe!
\V here are you I Where have you been? How came you here?
and such things as I had taught him.

However. even though I knew it was the parrot. and that
indeed it could be nobody else. it was a good while before I
could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature
got thither. and then. how he should just keep about the. place.
and no where else: but as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding out my
hand. and calling him by his name. Poll. the sociable creature
came to me. and sat upon my thumb. as he used to do. and
continued talking to me. Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did
I come here! and where had I been! just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again: and so I carried him home along
with me.

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time. and had
enough to do for many days, to sit still. and reflect upon the
danger I had been in. I would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island; but I knew not
how it was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of
the island, which I had gone round. I knew well enough there
was no venturing that wa ; my very heart would shrink. and
my very blood run chill. ut to think of it; and as to the other
side of the island. I did not know how it might be there; but
supposing the current ran with the same force against the shore
at the east as it passed by it on the other. I might run the same
risk of being driven down the stream. and carried by the island.
as I had been before of being carried away from it; so. with
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat.
though it had been the product of so many months' labour to
make it. and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year.
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and
my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition.
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence. I thought [lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon appl ing myself to; and I
believe lcould, upon occasion, have ma e a very good carpen-
ter, especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a
wheel. which I found infinitely easier and better; because I
made. things round and shapeable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain
of my own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though
it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and only
burned red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm,
and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with
it. for I had been always used to smoke: and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first. not thinking that there
was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I searched
the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.

In my wickerware also I improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed
me; though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things up in. or fetch-
ing things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I
could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces,
and bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle: I could
cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh,
which was enough for me, and bring them home in a basket,
and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets were
the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as
it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably;
this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and
I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill
any goats. I had, as is observed. in the third year of my being
here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in
hopes of getting a he--goat: but I could not by any means bring
it to pass, till my kid grew an old oat; and as I could never
find in my heart to kill her, she die at last of mere age.
 

SECTION XVI.

HE BEARS A l-'I.OCI{ 0P GOATS.--HISS DAIRYo--IIIS DOMESTIC HABITS AND STYLL
0F LIVING.---I.\'CRPSASING PROSPERITY.

BEING now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have
said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some
art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she--goat great
with young. For this purpose, I made snares to hamper them ;
and I do believe they were more than once taken in them; but
my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found
them broken, and my bait devoured. At length I resolved to
try a pitfall: so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places
where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those
pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them ; and several times I put cars of barley and
dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could easily perceive
that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I could
see the marks of their feet. At length I set three traps in one
night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.
However, I altered my traps; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one
of them a large old lie-goat, and in one of the others three kids,
a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was
so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
go about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted: I
could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor would
it answer my end; so I even let him out, and he ran away, as
if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I had forgot
then, what I had learned afterwards, that hunger will tame a
lion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without
food, and then have carried him some water to drink. and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids :
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used. However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time : then I went to the three kids, and taking
them one b one, I tied them with strings together, and with
some difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be
tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply myself
with goat's flesh when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way ; when, perhaps, I might have
them about my house like a flock of sheep. But then it occurred
to me. that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they
would always run wild when they grew up: and the only way
for this was. to have some enclosed piece of ground, well
fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so efi'ec-
tually, that those within might not break out, or those without
break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I
saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work
was to find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely
to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and
cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for
all these (being a plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah,
as our people call it in the western colonies), which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was ve
woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall te l
them, I began my enclosing this piece of ground in such aman-
ner, that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass,
for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to
do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild
in so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I
should have so much room to chase them in, that I should never
catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stop-
ped short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to enclose a
piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one
hundred ards in breadth; which, as it would maintain as
many as should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock
increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure. '
This was acting with some prudence. and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first
piece; and. till I had done it. I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it and used them to feed as near me as possible, to
make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them
some ears of barley. or a handful of rice. and feed them out of
my hand: so that after my enclosure was finished. and I let
them loose. they would follow me 11p and down. bleating after
me for a handful of corn.

This answered my end; and 111 about a year and a half I had
a flock of about t11elve goats, kids and all; and in two years
more. I had three and forty. besides several that I took and
killed for my food. After that I enclosed f11e several pieces of
ground to feed them 10, with little pens to drive them into. to
take them as I wanted. and gates out of one piece of ground
into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed 011 when I pleased, but milk too; a thing which. indeed,
in the beginning. I did not so much as think of, and which.
11 hen it tame into my thoughts. was really an agreeable sur-
prise. for 11011 I set up my dairv. and had sometimes a gallon
or mo of milk 111 a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies
of food to e1' er1' creature, dictates e1 en naturall1 how to make
use of it. so I. that had ne1 er milked a cow. mtuh less a goat,
or seen butter or cheese made. onl1r when I 1111s a boy. after a
great many essay s and miscarriages. made me both butter and
cheese at last, and also salt (though I found it partly made to
my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the
sea). and ne1 er 11 anted it afterwards. How mercifully can our
Creator treat his creatures. even in those conditions 111 which
they seemed to be overwhelmed 1n destruction! How can he
sweeten the bitterest pro1idences, and give us cause to praise
him for dungeons and prisons! W'hat a table was here spread
for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing. at first. but to
perish for hunger!

It would ha1e made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner: there "as my majesty.t the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command; I could hang, draw. give
liberty, and take it away . and no rebels amoug all my subjects.
Then to see how like a king 1 dined too, all alone. attended by
my servants . Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
Only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now
grown very old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply
his kind upon, sat always at my right hand. and two cats one
on one side of the table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at

first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interred
near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the
woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for they
would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at
last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great man ; at
length they left men--With this attendance. and in this p enti-
ful manner, I lived ; neither could I be said to want anv thing
but society: and of that, some time after this, Iwas like to
have too much.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards;
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving wa s to get her about
the island, and at other times I sat myse f down coutented
enough without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as I have
said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to
do: this inclination increased upon me every day, and at length
I resolved to travel thither by land, followmg the edge of the
shore. I did so; but had any one in England been to meet
such a man as I was, it must either have frightened him, or
raised a great deal of laughter: and as I frequently stood still
to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in
such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as
follows:

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with
a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me
as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck: nothing
being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh,
under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down
to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed
breeches of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of
an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs;
stockings and shoes I had mm, but had made me a pair of
somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes:
but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of
my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side. and
one on the other. I had another belt, not so broad, and fast-
ened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and

at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, bothl 16 aovss'ruaas or

made of goat's skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in
the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket. and on
my shoulder my gun; and over my head a great clumsy ugly
goat's skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for my face,
the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heard I had once suf-
fered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as
I had both scissars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed
into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen
worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear
such. though the Turks did: of these mustachios or whiskers,
I will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them.
but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough. and
such as, in England. would have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure. I had so few
to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence; so I
say no more to that part. In this kind of figure I went my new
journey. and was out five or six days. I travelled first along
the seashore, directly to the place where I first brought my
boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; and having no boat
now to take care of, I went over the land, a nearer way. to the
same height that I was upon before; when looking forward to
the. point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged
to double with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see
the sea all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no cur-
rent, an more there than in any other places. I was at a
strange oss to understand this, and resolved to spend some
time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the
tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it
was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining
with the current of waters from some great river on the shore;
must be the occasion of this current; and that according as the
wind blew more forcibly from the west, or frOm the north, this
current came nearer, or went farther from the shore; for wait-
ing thereahouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and
then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again
as before, only that it ran farther 03', being near half a league
from the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it; which, at
another time, it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror
upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been
in, that I could not think of it again with any patience; but,
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more
safe, though more laborious; and this was, that I would build.
or rather make me another periagua or canoe ; and so have one
for one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had. as I may call it, two
plantations in the island; one. my little fortification or tent.
with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind
me, which, by this time, I had enlarged into several apartments
or caves. one within another. One of these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or forti-
fication. that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock .
was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut ofi'
short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall. made, as before, with long stakes or piles.
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance. to an one's view, of any habitation behind them.

Near this dweliing of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land.
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed. and which duly yielded
me their harvest in its season: and whenever I had occasion
for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat; and I had now a tole-
rable plantation there also: for, first. I had my little bower, as
I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept the
hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside: I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but were
now grown very firm and tall. always out so, that they might
spread and grow thick and wild. and make the more agreeable
shade; which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle
of this I had m tent always standing, being a piece of a sail
spread over po es, set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had made me
a squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed.
and with other soft things ; and a blanket laid on them, such as
belonged to our sea bedding, which 1 had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to
be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of
pains to fence and enclose this ground, I was so anxious to see.
it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never
left 011', till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the
hedge so full of small stakes. and so near to one another, that
it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to
put a hand through between them; which afterwards. when
those stakes grew, as they all did 111 the next rainy season. made
the enclosure strong like a wall ,--indecd, stronger than any
wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle. and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a 111' mg magazine
of flesh. milk butter. and cheese for me as long as I lived 1n
the place, if it 11 ere to be forty years; and that keeping them
in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclo-
sures to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them
together , which. by this method indeed, I so etl'ectually
secured. that when these little stakes began to grow. I had
planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of
them 11p again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing. which I princi-
pall1 depended on for my 11 inter store of raisins. and which 1
never failed to preser1e very carefully , as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my 11' hole diet: and indeed they 11 ere not
only agreeable. but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between n1 other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat. generally stayed
and In here 1n my way thither; for I used frequently to visit
mv boat; and I kept all things about or belonging to her, in
very good order. sometimes I went out in her to di1 ert my self,
but no more hazardous 101 ages would I go, nor scarce ever
abo1e a stone' s cast or two from the shore, I 11 as so apprehen-
si1' e of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents
or 111nds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new
scene of my life.
 

SECTION XVII.

UNEXI'ECI'ED ALARM AND CAUSE FOR APPREIIENSION---IlPS l-'OR'I'II'IES HIS
ABODE.

IT happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I
was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I
stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition;
I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor
see any thing; I went up to a rising ground, to look farther ;
I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one ; I
could see no other impression but that one. I went to it again
to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be
my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly
the print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it
came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but,
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly con-
fused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not
feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the
last degree: looking behind me at every two or three steps.
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every~ stump at a
distance to he a man. Nor is it possible 'to describe how many
various shapes my afl'righted imagination represented things to
me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my
fancy, and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my
thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever
after this), I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over
bV the ladder, as first contrived or "eat in at the hole. 111 the
rock, which I had called a door. I cannot remember; no, nor
could I remember the next morning , for never frightened hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than 1
to this retreat.

I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion
of my fright the greater my apprehensions VV ere . which is
Something contrary to the nature ot such things. and especially

nothing but dismal imaginations to my self. eV e11 though I was

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out
of all apprehensions of its being the DeVil; 11nd I presenth
concluded then, that it must be some more dangerous creature.

VI hile these reflections were rolling upon mV mind. I was

then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having
found my boat, and that there were people here , and that if
so. I should certainly have them come. again in greater num-
bers, and deV our me; that if it should hap pen so that they
should not find me, yet they would find mV enclosure, destroV
all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I
should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope. all that fornier
confidence in God. which was founded upon such wonderful
experience as I had had of his goodness, as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his power, the
provision which he had made for me by his goodness. I re-
proached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more
corn one year than would just serve me till the next season. as
if no accident would intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop
that was upon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof.
that I resolved for the future to have two or three years' corn
beforehand; so that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret different springs are the affections
hurried about, as different circumstances present! To-day we.
love what to-morrow we hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow
we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear. nay, even
tremble at the apprehensions of; this was exemplified in me,
at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable ; for I, whose
only affliction was that I seemed banished from human society,
that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off
from mankind, and condemned to what I called silent lit'e ; that
I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered
among the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures;
that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to
me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing
that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation.
could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the
ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man's hav-
ing set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recOVered my first surprise. I considered that this was
the station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of
God had determined for me; that as I could not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to
dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an
undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that
had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me
to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to
submit to bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not only righteous,
but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me.
so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do
so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely

Non I began to take courage. and to peep abroad again. for

that I began to starve for ma isions . for I had little or nothing

thus two or three days. and having seen nothing. I began to be
a little bolder. and to think there was really nothing in it but
my own imagination; but I could not persuade myself fully of
this till I should go down to the shore again. and see. this print
of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any
similitude or fitness. that I might be assured it was my own
foot: but when I came. to the place, first. it appeared evidently
to me, that when I laid up my boat. I could not possibly be on
shore any where thereabout: secondly, when I came to measure
the mark with my own foot. I found my foot not so large by a
great deal. Both these things filled my head with new imagi-
nations. and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree.
so that I shook with cold like one in an ague: and I went home
again. filled with the belief that some man or men had been on
shore there; or. in short. that the island was inhabited, and I
might be surprised before I was aware; and what course to
take for my security I knew not.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was.
to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild
into the woods, lest the enemy should find them. and then fre-
quent the island in prospect of the same or the like booty: then
to the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields. lest they
should find such a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent
the island: then to demolish my bower and tent, that they
might not see any vestiges of habitation. and be prompted to
look farther. in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night's cogitatious after I
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
overrun my mind were fresh upon me. and my head was full of
vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes :
and we find the burthen of anxiety greater. by much. than the
evil which we are anxious about: and. which was worse than
all this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the resigna-
tion I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked. I
thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Philis-
tines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I
did not now take due ways to compose my mind. by crying to
God in my distress. and resting upon his providence. as I had
done before, for my defence and deliverance; which. if I had
done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported under this
new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more resolu-
tion.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but
in the morning I fell asleep; and having. by the amusement of
my mind, been, as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I

had ever been betore. And now I began to think sedately:
and. upon the utmost debate with n1vself.I concluded that this
island whichwassoexceedingpleasant. fruitful. and no farther
from the main land than as I had seen. was not so entirelV
abandoned as I might imagine . that although there were no
stated inhabitants who liV ed on the spot. Vet that there might
sometimes come. boats oil from the shore. who. either with de-
sign. or perhaps never but when they were driven b} cross
winds. might come to this place; that I had liV ed here fifteen
years 110w . and had not met with the least shadow or figure of
am people y;et and that if at any time they should be driven
here. it was probable theV went away again as soon as m er they
could. seeing tl1e_V had new er thought fit to fix here upon any
occasion , that the most I could suggest an} danger from," was
from :11>> casual accidental landing of straggling people from the
main. who, as it w as likely. it the) were driven hither. were
here against their wills. so they made no stay here. but went
ofi again with all possible speed , seldom staVing one night on
shore. lest theV should not haVe the help of the tides and day-
light back again . and that. therefore. I had nothing to do but to
consider of some safe retreat. in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot.

Now I began sorelV to repent that I had dug mV fine so
large as to bring a door through again, whie l1 door. as I said
came out be} 011d where my fortification joined to the rock:
upon maturely considering this. therefore. I resolved to draw
me a second fortification. in the same manner of a semicircle.
at a distance from mV wall. just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelVe. ve ears before. of which I made men-
tion: these trees having been planted so thick before. they
wanted but few piles to be driven between them. that they
might be thicker and stronger. and my wall would be soon
finished: so that I had now a double wall and mV outer wall
w as thickened with pieces of timber. old cables. and every thing
I could think of. to make it strong . having in it seV en little
holes. about as big as I might put mv arm out at. In the inside
of this. I thickened mV wall to about ten feet thick, with con-
tinually bringing earth out of my cave. and laying it at the foot
of the VV all. and walking upon it; and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the muskets. of which I took notice that I
had got seven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my
cannon, and fitted them into frames. that held them like a car-
riage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time: this VV all I was many a weary month 111 finishing, and yet
never thought mV self safe till it was done.

\Vhen this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall. for a great length any way. as full with stakes, or
sticks, of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as
they could well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might set in
near twenty thousand of them. leaving a pretty large space
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy. and they might have no shelter from the young trees,
if they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus. in two ears' time. I had a thick grove; and in five or
six years' time had a wood before my dwelling. growing so
monstrous thick and strong. that it was indeed perfectly im-
passable ; and no men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine
that there was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I
left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in. and left room to
place another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were
taken down, no man living could come down to me without
doing himself mischief ; and if they had come down, they were
still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen. at length. that
they were not altogether without just reason ; though I foresaw
nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my
other afl'airs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a ready supply to me on
every occasion. and began to be sufficient for me, without the
expense of powder and shot. but also without the fatigue of
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advan-
tage of them. and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose. after long consideration, I could think of
but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was, to enclose two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much can-
cealed as I could. where I might keep about half a dozen young
goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the
flock in general, I mi ht be able to raise them again with little
trouble and time : an this, though it would require a great deal
of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as pri-
vate, indeed. as my heart could wish for: it was a little damp
piece of ground. in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before. endea-
vouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the
island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by
nature; at least, it did not want near so much labour to make
it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.

new Visrrizo nv CANNIBAIS.

I IMMEDIATELY went to work with this piece of ground, and in
less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my
flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were not so wild
now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it: so, without any farther delay, I removed ten
young she goats and two he goats to this piece; and when they
were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it
as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure,
and it took me up more time by a great deal. All this labour
I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions on the
account of the print of a man's foot which I had seen ; for, as
yet, I never saw any human creature come near the island;
and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,
indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before,
as may be well imagined by any who knows what it is to live
in the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must
observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of my
thoughts: for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker, at
least not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul
which I was wont to do : I rather prayed to God as under great
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before
morning; and I must testify from my experience. that a temper
of peace. thankfulness. love. and affection, is much the more
proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure:
and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no
more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying
to God, than he is for a repentance on a sickbed; for these
discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and
the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a
disability as that of the body, and lunch greater; praying to
Iod being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for ano-
ther private place to make such another deposit; when. wan-
dering more to the west point of the island than I had ever
done yet, and looking out to sea. I thought I saw a boat upon
the sea. at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass
or two in one of the seanien's chests. which I saved out of our
ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote. that
I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till
my eyes were not able to hold to look an ' longer: whether it
was a boat or not, 1 do not know. but as lydescended from the
hill 1 could see no more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved
to go no more out without a perspective glass in my pocket.
W hen l was come down the hill to the end of the island, where,
indeed. I had never been before. I was presently convinced that
the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing
in the island as I imagined: and. but that it was a special pro-
vidence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the
savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far out at sea. to shoot over to
that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often
met and fought in their canoes, the victors. having taken any
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, accord-
ing to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would
kill and eat them; of which hereafter.

\Vhen I was come down the hill to the shore. as I said above,
being the south-west point of the island, I was perfectly con-
founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the
horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls,
hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and, particu-
larly, I observed a place where there had been a tire made, and
a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the
savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon
the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a
long while: all my apprehensidns were buried in the thoughts
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of
the degeneracy of human nature, which. though I had heard of
it often, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach
grew sick. and I was just at the point of fainting. when nature
discharged the disorder from my stomach ; and having vomited
with uncommon violence. I was a little relieved, but could not
bear to stay in the place a m0ment; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my
own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood
still awhile, as amazed. and then recovering myself, I looked
up with the utmOSt affection of my soul, and, with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks. that had cast my first lot
in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such
dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable. had yet given me so many
comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for than to
complain of: and this. above all, that I had. even in this
miserable condition, been comforted with the knowled of
Himself, and the hope of His blessing; which was a fe icity
more than sufliciently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered. or could sufl'er.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now. as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking. not wanting, or not expecting, any
thing here; and having often. no doubt. been up in the covered
woody part of it. without finding any thing to their purpose.
I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years. and never
saw the least footsteps of human creature there before; and I
might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was
now, if I did not discover myself to them. which I had no
manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better
sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet
I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I
have been speaking of. and of the wretched inhuman custom of
their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, for
almost two years after this; when I say my own circle. I mean
by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, my country seat,
which I called my bower, and my enclosure in the woods: nor
did I look after this for any other use than as an enclosure for
my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them
as of seeing the Devil himself. I did not so much as go to look
after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of making
me another; for I could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I
should meet with some of these creatures at sea; in which if I
had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what
would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same
composed manner as before; only with this diti'erence, that I
used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I
did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest
any of them being on the island should happen to hear it. It
was therefore a very good providence to me that I had furnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to
hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did
catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had
done before: so that for two ears after this, I believe I never
fired my gun once off, though Inever went out without it; and.
which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship. I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, stick-
ing them in my goat's-skin belt. I also furbisbed up one of the
great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt
to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow
to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former
description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a

- great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said. for some time, I
seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former
calm sedate way of living All these things tended to show me,
more and more, how far my condition was from being miser-
able. compared to some others; nay, to man other particulars
of life, which it might have pleased God to ave made 111 lot.
It put me upon reflecting how little repining there wo d be
among mankind at any condition of life, if people would rather
compare their condition with those that were worse, in order
to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which
are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had
been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had
been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my
invention for m own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which had once bent my thoughts too much upon,
and that was, to try if I could not make some of m barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. his was
really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the want
of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it

6 3
would be impossible for me to supply: as, first, casks to pre-
serve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,
I could never compass ; no, though I spent not only many days,
but weeks, nay, months, in attemptin it, but to no purpose.
In the next place, I had no hops to ma e it keep, no yeast to
make it work, no c0pper or kettle to make it boil; and yet,
with all these thin s wanting, I verily believe, had not the
frights and terrors was in about the savages intervened, I had
undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom
gave any thing over without accomplishing it, when once I had
it in my head to begin it. But my invention now ran quite
another way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel,
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger
volume than this whole work is intended to he, to set down all
the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least fright-
ening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more: but
all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect,
unless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one
man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or
thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows and
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a. mark as I
could with my gun? .

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gun-
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would conse-
quently take fire, and blow up all that was near it: but as, in .
the first place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder
upon them, my store being now within the' quantity of one
barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain
time, when it might surprise them ; and, at best. that it would
do little more than just blow the fire about their ears, and fright
them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I
laid it aside ; and then proposed that I would place myself in
ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all
double-loaded, and, in the middle of their bloody ceremony,
let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps
two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that if
there were twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased
my thoughts for some weeks; and I was so full of it, that I
often dreamed of it, and sometimes that I was just going to let
fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagina-
tion, that I employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them ;
and I went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown
more familiar to me: but while my mind was thus filled with
thoughts of revenge, and a blood putting twenty or thirty of
them to the sword, as I ma cal it, the horror I had at the
place, and at the signals of t e barbarous wretches devouring
one another, abetted my malice. Well, at length, I found a
place in the side of the' hill, where I was satisfied I might
securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming: and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, con-
vey myself, unseen, into some thickets of trees, in one of which
there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and
there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take
my full aim at their heads, when the were so close together
as that it would be next to impossib e that I should miss my
shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first shot. In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design;
and, accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary
fowlingpiece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs
each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-
bullets; and the fowlingpiece I loaded with near a handful of
swan~shot, of the largest size: I also loaded my pistols with
about four bullets each; and in this posture, well provided
with ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared
myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island,
or standing over towards it: but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my
watch, but came always back without any discovery; there
having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not only
on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes

or glasses could reach every way.
As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so

long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable form for so outrageous
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in
my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first fired
by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people
of that country; who, it seems, had been suffered, by Provi-
dence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other
guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions;

and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been so for some
ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cuso
toms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven,
and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of
the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so farI32 An1'1zsrt'u1ts or

every morning in vain. so 1111' opinion of the action itselt'begau
to alter; and I began. with cooler and calmer thoughts. to
consider what I was going to engage in: 11' hat authority or call
I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men
as criminals. whom Heaven had thought tit. for so many ages.
to sutl'er. unpunished. to go on. and to be. as it were. the exe-
cutioners of his judgments one upon another. llow far these
people were otl'enders against me. and what right I had to
engage in the quarrel ot that blood which they shed promiscu-
ously upon one another. I debated this 1'er1 otteu with my sell.
thus: How do I know what God himselt judges 111 this parti-
cular case! It is' certain these people do not commit this as 11
crime: it is not: gaiust their 1111 11 consc ieuces repro1i11g . or
their light r11pro111 lung them 1 they do not know it to be 1111
otl'cncc. and then commit it in defiance ot'diviue. justice. as we
do in almost all the sins we. commit. They think it no more a
crime to kill 11 captive taken in war. than we do to kill 1111 ox:
nor to eat human flesh. than we do to eat mutton.

"'hcu I consider ed this a little. it follow ed necessarily that
l was certainl1 in the wrong in it: that these people were not
murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in
1111' thoughts. any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken 111 battle: or more
trequcntly . upon 11111111' occasions. put 11 hole trOops ot men to
the sword. without giving quarter. though they threw down
their arms 11nd submitted. In the ne\t place. it occurred to
me. that although the usage they gave one another was thus
hrutish and inhuman. 1ct it was re 1ll1 nothing to me: these
people had done me no injury: that it the' attempted me. or
I saw it necessary. for my immediate preser111t1on. to fall upon
them. something might be said tor it; but that l was yet out of
their power. and they really had no knowledge at me. and
consequently no design upon me' . and theretore it could not
be just for me. to fall upon them: that this would justify the
conduct of the Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in
Ameri 11. where they destroyed millions of these people: who.
however they were idolaters and barbarians. and had se1eral
bloody and barbarous rites 111 their customs. such 11s sacrificing
human bodies to their idols. 11' ere 1' ct. as to the Spaniards. very
innocent people' . and that the rooting them out ot the country
is spoken at with the utmost abhorreuce and detestatiou by
e1 e11 the Spaniards themselves at this time. and by all other
Christian nations in Europe. as a mere hatchery. a bloody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man.
and for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be
t'righttul and terrible to all people at humanity. or at Christian
compassion: as if the. kingdom of Spain were particularly
eminent for the produce of a race of men who were without
principles of tenderness. or the common bowels ot pity to the111111135011 caesoe. 133

111iserable. which is reckoned to be a mark of g morons temper
in the mind.

These cousiderations really put me. to a pause. and to a kind
ot a tall stop; and I began. by little and little. to be all my
design. and to colulude I had taken wrong measures in my
resolution to attack the savages. deg and that it was not my busi-
ness to meddle 111th them. unless they first attacked me: and
this it was my business. if possible. to prevent; but that it I
11 ere disco1ered and attacked by them. I knew my duty. (In
the other hand. I argued 111th myself. that this really was the
way not to deliver myselt. but entirely to ruin and destroy
m1 selt tor unless [was sure to kill e1ery one that not oul1
should be on shore at that time. but that should ever come on
shore afterwards. if but one at them escaped to tell their coun-

I had no manner ot occasion for. Upon the whole, I cum luded.
that neither in principle nor in policy. I ought. one way or
other. to comer" 1111selt in this atl'air: that my business was.
by all possible means. to 1on1eal 1111 selt trom them. and not to
leave. the least signal to them to guess by that there were any
li1ing creatures upon the island. I mean ot human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution , and l was
eomiueed now. many ways, that l was perfectly out of my
duty 11' hen I 11 as la_1 111g all my bloody schemes for the destruc-
tion at inno1ent creatures. I mean iunm eat as to me. As to
the crimes they were guilty of towards one another. I had
nothing to do with them . they were national. and I ought to
lea1e them to the justi1e of God. who is the governor ot

just retribution for national otl'eemes. and to bring public judg-
ments upon those who otl'eud 111 a public n1anuer.degbv such ways
as best please him. This appeared so dear to me now. that
nothing was a greater satistaction to me than that I had not
been sutl'ered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason
to belie1e 11 ould ha1e been no less a sin than that of wilful
murder. it' I had committed it : and I gave most humble thanks
011 my knees to God. that had thus delivered me trom blood-
gniltiness; beseeching him to grant me the protection of his
pro1ide111e. that I might not fall into the hands of the bar-
barians. or that I might not lav 1111 bands upon them, unless I

had a more clear call trom Hea1en to do it, in defence oi my

SECTION XIX.

ROBINSON DISOOVERS A CAVE, "'IIICII SERVES HIM AS A RETREAT AGAINST THE
SAVAGES-

IN this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whe-
ther any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might
not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them,
or be provoked, by any advantage which might present itself,
to fall upon them: only this I did, I went and removed my
boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it
down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a
little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least
would not, come with their boats, upon any account whatever.
\Vith my boat I carried away every thing that I had left there
belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going
thither, viz. a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a
thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called
either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could
make of its kind: all these I removed, that there might not be
the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of any
boat, or of any human habitation, upon the island. Besides
this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and seldom
went from my cell, other than upon my constant employment,
viz. to milk my she goats, and manage my little flock in the
wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the island,
was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these savage
people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with
any thoughts of finding any thing here, and consequently never
wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but they might
have been several times on shore after m apprehensions of
them had made. me cautious. as well as *fore. Indeed. I
looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my
condition would have been if I had p0pped upon them and
been discovered before that. when. naked and unarmed. except
with one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where. peeping and peering about the. island to
see what I could get; what a surprise should I have been in.
it'. when I discovered the print of a man's foot. I had, instead
of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages. and found them pursu-
ing me. and by the swiftness of their running. no possibility of
my escaping them I The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my
very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much. that I
could not soon recover it. to think what I should have done.
and how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but
even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what
I might have done; much less what now. after so much con~
sideration and preparation, I might he able to do. Indeed,
after serious thinking of these things. I would he v'cry melan~
cholv. and sometimes it would last a great while : but I resolved
it all. at last. into thankfulness to that Providence which had
delivered me from so many unseen dangers. and had kept from
me those mischiets which I could have no way been the agent
in delivering myself from. because I had not the least notion of
any such thing depending. or the least supposition of its being
possible. This renewed a contemplation which often had come
to my thoughts in former time. when first I began to see the
merciful dispositions of Ileaven. in the dangers we run through
in this life: how wonderfully we are delivered when we know
nothing of it; how, when we are in (a quandary, as we call it)
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that way, a
secret hint shall direct us this way. when we intended to go that
way: nay. when sense, our own inclination. and perhaps busi-
ness, has called to go the other way. yet a strange impression
upon the mind. from we know not what springs, and by we
know not what power. shall overrule us to go this way ; and it
shall afterwards appear. that had we gone that way which we
should have gone. and even to our imagination ought to have
gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these. and
many like reflections. I afterwards made it a certain rule with
me. that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of
mind, to doing or not doing any thing that presented. or going
this way or that way. I never failed to obe the secret dictate;
though I knew no other reason for it than t at such a pressure,
or such a hint. hung upon my mind. I could give many exam-
ples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life. but
more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy
island ; besides many occasions which it .is very likely I might
have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then
that l see with now. But it is never too late to be wise:
and I cannot but advise all considering men. whose lives are
attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine. or even
though not so e\traordinar3'. not to slight such secret intima-
tions of Providence let them come from II hat invisible intel-
ligence they will. That I shall not discuss. and perhaps cannot
account for: but certainly the3 are a proof of the converse of
spirits. and a secret communication between those embodied
and those IIneInlnxlied. and such II proof as can never be with-
stood: of which I shall have occasion to giIe some very
remarkable instances in the. remainder of III3 solitary residence
in this dismal place.

| believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con~
fess that these anxieties. these. constant dangers I lived in. and
the concern that was now upon me. put IIII end to all invention.
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accom-
modations and conveniences. I had the care ot my safety more
now upon my hands than that of m3 food. lcared not to drive
II nail. or chop a stick of II ood now. for fear the noise I might
make should be heard I much less would I tire II gun. for the
same reason: IuIIlIIIboI e all. I was intolerabl3' uneasy at making
any tire. lest the smoke. which is visible at a great distance in
the day. should betra3' me. For this reason I removed that
part ot In3- bIIsiness which required tire. such as burning of pots
and pipes. t'sc. into m3 new apartment in the woods; where.
atteI' I had been some time. I tound. to my unspeakable conso-
lation. II mere natural cam in the earth. which went in a vast
II III. and where. l dare say. no savage. had he been at the
mouth of it. would be so hard3 as to venture in' . nor. indeed.
would any IIIIIII else. but one II ho like me. wanted nothing so
much as II safe retreat.

The month of this hollow was at the bottom ot'a great rock.
where b3 mere accident (I II onld say. it I did not see abundant
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence). 1 was
cutting down some thick branches ot trees to make charcoal.
and. before I go on. I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal which was thus: I was afraid of making a smoke
about my habitation. as I said before; and yet I could not live
there II Ithont baking m3 bread. cooking nIv meat. &c. . so I
contriI ed to burn some wood here. as I had seen done III Eng -
land. under turf. till it became chark. or drv coal: and then
putting the f re out. I preserved the. coal to carry home. and
perform the. other services for which fire. II as wanting. without
danger of smoke. But this Is by the by :---\\'hile. l was cutting
don II some wood here. I perceived that behind a verv thick
branch of low brushwood. or underwood. there II as a kind of
hollow 3:Ilace I was curious to look In it. and getting with dif-
ficnlt3 into the mouth of It. Ifouud it was prett3 large . that Is
to say. sufficient for me to stand upright in it. and perhaps
another with me: but I must confess to you that I made more.
haste. out than I did in. when. looking farther into the place.
and which was perfectly dark. I saw two broad shining eyes of
some. creature. whether devil or man I knew not. which twinkled
like two stars; the dim light from the cave's mouth shining
directly in. and making the reflection. However. after some
pause. I recovered myself. and hogan to call myself a thousand
fools. and to think. that he that was afraid to see the devil was
not tit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I
might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself. Upon this. plucking up my courage. I
took up a tirebrand. and in I rushed again. with the. stick
flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in. but I was
almost as much frightened as I was before; for I heard a very
loml sigh. like that of a man in some pain. and it was followed
by a broken noise. as of words half expressed. and then a deep
sigh again. I stepped back. and was indeed struck with such
a surprise. that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had
a hat on my head. I will not answer for it. that my hair might
not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits as well
as I could. and encouraging myself a little. with considering
that the power and presence of God was every where. and was
able to protect me. upon this I stepped forward again. and by
the light of the tirebrand. holding it up a little over my head.
I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous. frightful. old
he goat. just making his will. as we say. and gasping for life ;
and dying, indeed. of mere old age. I stirred him a little to
see if I could get him out. and he essayed to get up. but was
not able to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might
even lie there: for if he had frightened me. so he would cer-
tainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should he so
hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise. and began to look
round me. when I found the. cave was but very small. that is to
say. it might be about twelve feet over. but in no manner of
shape. neither round nor square. no hands having ever been
employed in making it but those. of more Nature. I observed
also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in
further. but was so low that it required me to creep upon my
hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not:
so having no candle, I gave it over for that time; but resolved
to come. again the next day. provided with candles and a tinder-
hox. which I had made of the. lock of one of the muskets. with
some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly. the next da I came provided with six large
candles of my own making( or I made very good candles now
of goat's tallow. but was hard set for candle-wick. using some-
times rags or rope-yarn. and sometimes the dried rind of a
weed like nettles); and going into this low place. I was obliged
to creep upon all fours. as l have said. almost ten yards;
II hIch. by the way. I thought was a venture hold enough. con-
sidering that I knew not how far it might go. nor II hat was
heIond it. \V hen I had got through the strait. I found the root
rose higher up. I helIeI II near tIIIInty teet. but never was such
a glorious sight seen in the island. I dare say. as it mm. to look

occasion ot removing my ammunition. I happened to open the

had been II ct. and I found that the II IIter had penetrated about
three. or tour inches into the powder IIII every side. II Inc

poIIder III the centre of the. cask: this was a I'IIrI agreeable
discoIery to me at that time; so I Iarried all away thither.
neI er keeping ahoIe two or three pounds ot powder with me
in my castle. for fear of II surprise 01 any kind: I also carried
thither all the lead 1 had left for bullets.

that it five hundred sava ages were to hunt me. they could never

me here. The old goat. II hem I found e\piring. died in the
mouth of the NI II the he" day attIIr I made this discovery:
and I found it much easier to dig a great hole there. and throw
him III and cm er him with earth. than to draw him out; so I
interred him there. to prevent oil'ence to my nose.

I II as now in the tIIentI -third III Ir of my residence in this
island ; and was so naturalised to the place. and the manner 01
living. that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the )ltlt't' to disturb me. I could have.
been content to have capitu nted for spending the rest of my
time there. even to the last moment. till I had laid me down
and died. like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements. which made the time
pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before:
as. first, I had taught my Poll. as I noted before. to speak ; and
he did it so familiarly. and talked so articulatel and plain. that
it was very pleasant to me; for I believe no ird ever spoke
plainer: and he lived with me no less than six-and-tweuty
years: how long he might have lived afterwards I know not.
though I know they have a notion in the. Brazils that they live
a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and loving
eompanion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time. and
then died of mere old age. As for my cats. the ' multiplied. as
I have observed. to that degree. that l was 0 liged to shoot
several of them at first. to keep them from devouring me and
all I had; but. at length. when the two old ones I brought with
me were gone. and after some time. eoutiutudly driving them
from me. and letting them have no provision with me. they all
run wild into the woods. except two or three favourites. which
I kept tame. and whose young, when they had any. I always
drowned: and these were part of my fanuly. Besides these.
I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom I
taught to feed out of m hand; and I had two more parrots.
which talked pretty wel . and would all call Robin Crusoe, but
none like my first; nor. indeed did I take the pains with any
of them that I had done with him. I had also several tame
seafowls. whose names I knew not. that I caught upon the
shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had
planted before. my castle wall being now grown up to a good
thick grove. these fowls all lived among these low trees. and
bred there. which was very agreeable to me: so that. as I said
above. I began to be very well contented with the life I led. if
I could have been secured from the dread of the savages. But
it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all
people who shall meet with my story. to make this just observa-
tion from it. viz. How frequently. in the course of our lives.
the evil which in itself we seek most to shun. and which. when
we are fallen into. is the most dreadful to us. is oftentimes the
very means or door of our deliverance. by which alone we can
be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could
give. many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable
life; but in nothing was it more particularl remarkable than
in the circumstances of my last years of so itary residence in

this island.
 

SECTION XX.

ANOTHER VISIT OF THE SAVAGES.--ROBINSON SEE-3 THE)! DANCINGo--PBICCEIVES
THE WRBCK OF A VBSEL.

IT was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields: when
going out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island where I had observed some
' savages had been, as before; and not on the other side, but, to
my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised ; and yet I had no more peace within, from the
apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the
island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works
and improvements, they would immediately conclude that there
were people in the place, and would then never give over till
they had found me out. In this extremity, I went back directly
to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things
without look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture
of defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is
to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new forti-
fication, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to
the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this
posture about two hours ; and began to be mighty impatient for
intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After
sitting awhile longer. and musing what I should do in this. I
was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer: so setting
up my ladder to the side of the hill. where there was a flat
place. as Iobserved before. and then pulling the ladder up
after me. I set it up again. and mounted to the tap of the hill ;
and pulling out my perspective glass. which I had taken on
purpose. I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground. and
began to look for the place. I presently found there were no
less than nine naked savages. sitting round a small fire they
had made. not to warm them. for they had no need of that. the
weather being extremely hot. but. as I supposed. to dress some
of their barbarous diet of human flesh. which they had brought
with them. whether alive or dead I could not tell.

They had two canoes with them. which the had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of e b. they seemed
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me. into.
especially seeing them come on my side of the island. and so
near me too; but when I considered their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb. I began. afterwards. to be
more sedate in my mind. being satisfied that I might go abroad
with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on
shore before; and having made this observation. I went abroad
about my harvest work with the more coiiiposure.

As I expected. so it proved : for as soon as the tide made to
the westward. I saw them all take boat. and row (or paddle.
as we call it) away. I should have observed. that for an hour
or more before they went oil'. they went adancing; and I could
easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass. I
could not perceive, by my nicest observation. but that they
were stark naked. and had not the least covering upon them;
but whether they were men or women, I could not dis-
tiuguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in in girdle, and my
great sword by my side, without a scahbar . and with all the
speed I was able to make. went away to the hill where I had
discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon as I got
thither. which was not in less than two hours (for I could not
go space. being so loadeu with arms as I was). I perceived
there had been three canoes more of savages at that place:
and looking out farther. I saw they were all at sea together.
making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me.
especially as. going down to the shore. I could see the marks
of horror. which the dismal work they had been about had
left behind it. viz. the blood. the bones, and part of the flesh.
of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with
merriment and sport. I Was so filled with indignation at the
sight. that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the
next that I saw there, let them be whom or how many soever.142 11111117111113 or

It seemed evident to me that the visits which they made thus

this 11hile I lived uncomfortably. by reason of the constant
apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise: from
whence I observ e, that the e\peetation of e11l is more. bitter
than the suffering. especially if there is no room to shake off
that e\pet 12111011, or those apprehensions.

During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better

be di1ided. as the1 were the last time, into two parties: nor
did I consider at all that it I killed one party. suppose ten or
a dozen. I was still the 11th day. or week, or month, to kill

length 110 less a murderer than they 11' ere in being man-eaters.
and perhaps much more so. I spent my days 11011 in great
perple\it1 and anxiety of mind e\'peeting that I should one
day or other. fall into the hands of these merciless creatures. -
and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without
looking round me 11 ith the greatest care and caution imagin-
able. And 11011 I found. to my great comfort, how happy it
was that I provided for a tame flock or herd of goats , for I
durst not, upon any account. fire 1111 gun, especially near that
side of the island 11 here they usually came, lest I should alarm
the 5m ages; and if the1 had fled from me 11ow.I was sure to
have them come again. with perhaps two or three hundred
canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew what to
expect. H011 ever. I 11' ore out a year and three months more
before I N er saw any more of the savages, and then I found
them again. as I shall soon observe. It 1s true. they might
have been there once or twice, but either they made no stay,
or at least I did not see them: but in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-t11ent1eth year,
II had a very strange encounter 111th them, of 11 hich in its
p ace.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months inter1',al was very great; I slept unqniet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep 1n
the night. ' in the day, great troubles over11 helmed my mind;
and in the night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
of the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to
wave all this for a while.--It was in the middle of May, on
the sixteenth day, I think as well as my poor wooden calendar
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it
11 as on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of
wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder. and
a very foul night it was after it. I knew not what was the
particular occasion of it. but as I was reading in the Bible.
and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought. fired at sea. This was, to be sure. a surprise quite
of a different nature from any I had met with before; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, and. in a trice.
clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled
it after me; and mounting it the second time. 0t to the top on
the hill the very moment that a flash of fire big me listen for a
second gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I
heard; and, by the sound. knew that it was from that part of
the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I
immediately considered that this must be some ship in dis-
tress, and that the had some comrade, or some other ship in
company, and fire these guns for signals of distress, and to
obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that minute. to
think, that though I could not help them. it might be the
might help me: so I brought together all the dr wood
could get at hand. and making a good handsome pi e, I set it
on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely;
and though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out;
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship,
they must needs see it; and no doubt they did ; for as soon as
ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun. and after that
several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all
night long, till daybreak; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full
east of the island. whether a sail or a hull I could not dis-
tinguish, no. not with my glass; the distance was so great,
and the weather still something hazy also; at least, it was so
out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived
that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a
ship at anchor; and being eager. you may be sure, to be
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south
side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been
carried awa with the current; and getting up there, the
weather by t is time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out in
my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the
stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the
occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless
condition that ever I had been in, all my life. Thus. what is
one man's safety is another man's destruction; for it seems
these men, whoever they were. being out of their knowledge,
and the rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven uponl-H .IIIII-tI'II III-2s III'

SECTION XXI.

lll'. VISITS THE "'RECK AND OBTAINS MANY STORES FROM "Rm--AGAIN THINKS
0F QUIITING TUB XSLAND.--IIAS A RBMARKABLB DREAM.

THERE are some secret moving springs in the affections, which.
when they are set ageing by some object in view, or, though
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of
imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity,
to such violent, eager embracings of the object, that the absence
of it is insupportable. Such were these earnest wishings that
but one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the words,
0 that it had been but one! a thousand times; and my desires
were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms
of my hands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my hand.
it would have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my
head would strike together. and set against one another so
strong, that for some time I could not part them again. Let
the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner
of them: all I can say to them is, to describe the fact, which
was even surprising to me, when I found it, though I knew
not from whence it proceeded: it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realising
the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow Chris-
tians would have been to me.--But it was not to be; either
their fate or mine, or both, forbade it: for, till the last year of
my being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship or no; and had only the affliction, some days
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the
end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no
clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed

linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct
H
me so much as to guess what nation he was of I he had nothing
in his pockets but IWO pieces-of-eight and a tobaccmpipe;---the
last was to IIIII often times more value than the first.

It II as non calm. and I had a great mind to Ienture out in
nII boat to this wreck. not doubting but I might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me: but that did not
altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might
he Iet some lII mg creature on board. II how life I might not
onlI saI e. but might. bys IaIiIII. I that life. comfort my mm to
the last degree: and this thought clung so to my heart. that I
could not be quiet night or day. but I must Ienture out in my
boat on board this II reek; and committing the rest to (uni s
proIidence. I thought the' IIIIpression II as so strong upon my
mind that it could not be. resisted. that it must come from
some inI isible direction. and that I should be II anting to mI selt
it' I did not go.

I'nder the gamer of this impression. I hastened back to my
castle. prepared eIerI thing for IIII IoI'age. took a quantity
ot bread. a great pot ot t'resh II .Iter. a compass to steer bI . a
bottle ot rum "(for I had still a great deal at that lett). and a
basket oi raisins: and thus, loading InI sell II Ith eI'erI thing
necessary . I II ent doII II to my boat. got the II ater out of her.
put her atloat. loaded all IIII cargo in her. and then went home.
again for more. "I second cargo II .II a great bag ot rice. the
umbrella to set up In er my head for a shade. another large
pot ot tresh II Men and about tIIo dozen of my small loaves. or
harleI -cakcs. more than before. IIith a bottle. ot goat's IImilk
and a cheese. ' all II Inch. II ith great Iabonrand .III eat I carried
to my boat: and pr." mg to Iod to direct my voyage. I put
out' . and mu mg or paddling. the canoe along the shore.c came
at last to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.
And now I was to launch out into the. ocean. and either to
venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
II hich ran constantly on both sides of the. island at a distance.
and II Inch II ere very terrible to me. from the remembrance of
the. hazard I had been in before. and my heart began to fail
me: for I t'oresaII that it l "as driIen into either of those
currents. I should be carried a gr rent II ay out to sea. and per-
haps out ot my reach. or sight of the island again. and that
then. as my boat "as but small. it any little gale of wind
should rise. I should be IneI itably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind. that I began to give.
OIcr my enterprise; and haIing hauled my boat into a little
creek on the. shore. I stepped out. and sat me Il0II II upon a
rising bit 0t ground. very pensiI e and anxious. betIIeeII fear
and desire. about my voyage: when. as IIvas musing. I could
perceive that the tide II III turned. and the flood come. on; upon
II Inch my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon
this. presentII it occurred to me, that [should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find. and observe. if I could.
how the sets of the tide. or currents. lay when the flood came
in. that I might judge whether. if I was driven one way out.
I might not expect to be driven another way home. with the
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no sooner
in mv head than I cast my eye upon a little bill. which sutli-
cientiy overlooked the sea both ways. and front whence I had
a clear view of the currents. or sets of the tide. and which way
I was to guide myself in my return. Here I found. that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island. so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of
the north side: and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the
north side of the island in my return. and I should do well
enough.

Encouraged with this observation. I resolved. the. next
morning. to set out with the tirst of the tide: and reposing
myself for the night in my canoe. under the great watchcoat I
mentioned. I launched out. I tirst made a little out to sea.
full n'orth. till I began to feel the benefit ot'the current. which
set eastward. and which carried me at a great rate; and yet
did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done
before. so as to take from me all gm'ernment of the boat: but
having a strong steerage with my paddle. I went at a great
rate directly for the wreck. and in less than two hours I came
up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship. which. by
its building. was Spanish. stuck that. jammed in between two
rocks; all the stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces
with the sea; and as her forecastle. which stuck in the rocks.
had run on with great violence. her mainmast and. foremost
were brought by the board. that is to say. broken short otl';
but her bowsprit was sound. and the head and bow appeared
tirm. When I came close to her. a dog appeared upon her.
who. seeing me coming. yelped and cried; and as soon as I
called him. jumped into the. sea to come to me; I took him
into the boat. but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst.
I gave. him a cake of my bread. and he devoured it like a
ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow:
I then gave the. poor creature some fresh water. with which. if
I would have let him. he would have burst himself. After
this. 1 went on board; but the first sight I met with was taro
men drowned in the cook-room. or forecastle ot' the ship. with
their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed
probable. that when the ship struck. it being in a storm. the
sea broke so high. and so continually over her. that the. men
were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant
rushing in of the water. as much as if they had been under
water. Besides the dog. there was nothing left in the ship that
had life; nor any goods. that I could see. but what were
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whe-

n 2
ther wine or brandy I knew not. which lay lower in the hold.
and which. the water being ebbed out. I could see: but they
were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests. which I
believed belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of
them into the boat. without examining what was in them. Had
the stern of the ship been fixed. and the foreth broken otl'. I
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage: for. by what
I found in these two chests. I had room to suppose the ship
had a great deal of wealth on board: and. ifI may guess from
the course she steered. she must have been bound from Buenos
Ayres. or the Rio dc la Pluto. in the south part of Ameri -a.
beyond the Brazils. to the Havanna. in the lulf of Mexico.
and so perhaps to Spain. She had. no doubt. a great treasure
in her. but of no use. at that time. to any body : and what
became of her crew. I then knew not.

I found. besides these chests. a little cask full of liquor. of
about twenty gallons. which I got into my boat with much
ditlieulty. There were several muskets in the 'abin. and a
great powder-horn. with about four pounds of powder in it:
as for the mnskets. I had no occasion for them, so I left them.
but took the powder-horn. I took a tire-shovel and tongs.
Which I wanted extremely: as also two little brass kettles. a
copper pot to make chocolate. and a gridiron: and with this
cargo. and the dog. I came away. the tide. beginning to make
home again: and the same evening. about an hour within night.
I reached the island again. weary and fatigued to the last
degree. I reposcd that night in the. boat: and in the morning
I resolved to harbour what I had got in Inv new cave. and not
any it home to my castle. After refreshing myself. I got all
my cargo on shore. and began to examine the. particulars. The
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum. but not such as we
had at the Brazils, and. in a word. not at all good: but when
l canic to open the chests. I found several things of great use
to me: for example. I found in one a line. case of bottles. of an
extraordinary kind. and tilled with cordial waters. line and
very good: the bottles held about three pints each. and were
tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good snccades.
or sweetmeats. so fastened also on the. top. that the salt water
had not hurt them: and two more of the same. which the. water
had spoiled. I found some very good shirts. which were very
welcome to me: and about a dozen and a half of white linen
handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the former were also
very welcome. being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in
a hot day. Besides this. when I came. to the till in the chest.
I found there three great bags of pieces-of-eight. which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all: and in one. ot'them. wrapped
up in a paper. six doubloons of gold. and some smalI bars or
wedges of gold: I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.
In the. other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but.
by the circumstances. it must have belonged to the gunner's
mate: though there was no powder in it. except two pounds
of tine glazed powder. in three small flasks. kept. I suppose.
for charging their fowliug-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole.
I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for.
as to the money. I had no manner of occasion for it ; it was to
me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it all
for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings. which
were things I greatly wanted. but had none on my feet for
many years. I had indeed got two pair of shoes now. which
I took otl' the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the
wreck. and I found two pair more in one. of the chests. which
were very welcome to me: but they were not like our English
shoes. either for ease or service. being rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty
pieces-of-eight in rials. but no gold: I suppose this belonged
to a poorer man than the other. which seemed to belong to
some otlieer. Well. however. I lugged this money home to
my cave. and laid it up. as I had done. that before which I
brought from our own ship: but it was a great pity. as I said.
that the other part of this ship had not come to my share : for
I am satisfied I might have loaded my earme several times over
with money; and. thought I. if I ever escape to England. it
might lie here safe enough till I may come again and fetch it.
llaving now brought all my things on shore. and secured
them. I went back to my boat. and rowed or paddled her along
the shore. to her old harbour. where I laid her up. and made
the best of my way to my old habitation. where I found every
thing safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself. live after
my old fashion. and take care of my family ntl'airs: and. for a
while. I lived easy enough. only that I was more vigilant than
I used to be. looked out oftener. and did not go abroad so
much: and if at any time I did stir with any freedom. it was
always to the east part of the island. whereI was pretty well
satisfied the savages never came. and where I could go Without
so many precautions. and such a load of arms and ammunition
as I always carried with me if I went the other way. I lived
in this condition near two cars more; but my unlucky head.
that was always to let me now it was born to make my body
miserable. was all these two ears filled with projects and
designs. how. if it were possih e. I might get away from this

wreck. though my reason told me that there was nothing left
there worth the hazard of my voyage: sometimes for a ramble
one way. sometimes another; and I believe verily. if I had
had the boat that I went from Sallee in. I should have ventured

water. as usual. and my condition restored to what it "as
before; I had more wealth. indeed. than I had before, but was
not at all the richer: for I had no more. use for it than the
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March. the
four-and-tn entieth Iear of my first setting foot in this island
of solitude. I II as lying In my bed. or hammock. aIIakeI , very
well in health. had no pain. no distemper. no uneasiness of

could by no means close my III es. that Is. so as to sleep . no.
not a wink all night long. otherwise than as follows I--It Is
impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that
II hIrled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
nIeInorI . in this night' 3 time: I ran 0I er the whole history of
my life in miniature. or by abridgement. as I may call it. to
my coming to this island. and also of that part of my life since
I came to this island. In my reflections upon the state. of my
case since I came on shore on this island. I was comparing the
happy posture. of my affairs in the first years of my habitation
here. compared to the life of anxiety. fear. and care. which I
had lived in. ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the
sand; not that I did not believe the savages had frupuented
the island even all the while. and might have. been several
hundreds of them at times on shore there; but I had never
known it. and was incapable of any apprehensions about it:
my satisfaction was perfect. though my danger was the same.
and l was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had never
really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with
nmny very profitable relleetions. and particularly this one:
How infinitely good that Providence is. which has provided.
in its government of mankind. such narrow bounds to his sight
and knowledge of things: and though he walks in the midst of
so many thousand dangers. the sight of which. if discovered to
him. would distract his mind and sink his spirits. he is kept
serene and calm. by having the. events of things hid from his
eyes. and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.

A fter these thoughts had for some time entertained me. I
canie to reflect seriously upon the real danger! had been in
for so many years in this very island. and how I had walked
about in the greatest securit , and with all possible tranquillity.
even when perhaps nothing ut the brow of a hill, a great tree.
or the casual approach of night. had been between me. and the
worst kind of destruction. viz. that of falling into the hands of
cannibals and savages. who would have. seized on me with the
same view as I would on a goat or a turtle. and have thought
it no more a crime to kill and devour me. than I did a pigeon
or curlew. I would unjustly slander myself. if I should say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowledged. with great humility. all
these unknown deliverances were due. and without which I
nmst inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over. my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures.
I mean the. savages. and how it came to pass in the world. that
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity. nay. to something so much below
even brutality itself. as to devour its own kind: but as this
ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived
in! how far off the coast was from whence they came? what
they ventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats
they had? and why I might not order myself and my business
so. that I might be as able to go over thither as they were to
come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should
do VV 1th mV self VVheu IVVent thither; VV hat would become of
me. it I fell into the hands of the saV ages: or how l should
escape from them, if theV attacked me . 110, nor so much as
how it "as possible for me to reach the coast. and not be
attacked by some or other of them. VV ithout anV possibilitV of
deliV ering my self; and if I should not fall into their hands.
what I should do for provision. or VV hither I should bend my
course: none of these thoughts I say. so much as came in my
way; but my mind was whollV bent upon the notion of my
passing 0V er in my boat to the main land. I looked upon my
present condition as the most miserable that could possibly be ,
that I was not able to throw an self into auVr thing 1. but death.
that could be called VV orse; and if I reached the shore of the
main. I might perhaps meet VV ith relief, or I might coast along,
as I did on the African shore. till 1 came to some inhabited
country. and VV here I might find some relief; and after all.
perhaps. I might fall in VV 1th some. Christian ship that might
take me in , and it the worst came to the \Vurst. I could but
die. which would put an end to all these miseries at once.
Pray note. all this VV as the fruit of a disturbed mind, an im-

of mind. in my resignation to PrOVideuce. and waiting the

and I had. as it VV ere. no pun er to turn mV thoughts to any
thing but to the project of a my age to the main , which came
upon me VV 1th such force. and such an impetuosity ot desire.
that it was not to be resisted.

\Vheu this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
VV ith such Violence that it set an Very blood into a ferment,
and my pulse beat as it I had been 111 :1 fm er, merely VV 1th the
extraordinary ferV our of my mind about it, nature, as if I had

me into a sound sleep. One would haVe thought I should
have dreamed of it. but I did not, nor of any thing relating to
it: but I dreamed that as I VV as going out in the morning, as
usual, from my castle. I saw upon the shore tVVo canoes and
claw savages coming to land, and that they brought nith
them another savage. whom they were going to kill. in order
to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were
going to kill jumped away. and ran for his life : and I thought.
in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove
before my fortification, to hide himself ; and that I. seeing
him alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him that
way, showed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged
him : that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist
him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up.
and carried him into my cave. and he became my servant: and
that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself. Now I
may certainly venture to the main land; for this fellow will
serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither
to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being
devoured; what places to venture into. and what to shun. I
waked with this thought; and was under such inexpressible
impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream,
that the disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself.
and finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally
extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great
dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; that my only
way to go about to attempt an escape was. if possible. to get a
savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be one
of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten, and
should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with this difficult , that it was impossible to effect
this without attacking a w ole caravan of them. and killing
them all ; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and
might miscarry, but, on the other hand. I had greatly scrupled
the lawfulness of it to myself,- and my heart trembled at the
thoughts of shedding so much blood. though it was for my
deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments which occurred
to me against this, they being the same mentioned before: but
though I had other reasons to offer now. viz. that those men
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could;
that it was self-preservation. in the highest degree. to deliver
myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own
defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and
the like; I say, thou h these things argued for it, yet the
thoughts of shedding uman blood for my deliverance were
very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile
myself to for a great while. However, at last, after many secret
disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for
all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my
head a long time). the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at
length mastered all the rest; and I resolved. if possible, to get
one of those savages into m hands, cost what it would. My
next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was
very dificult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no pro-

SECTION XXII.

ROBINSON RESCUl-'S ONE OF THEIR CAPTIVES FROM THE SAVAGl-'S, \VHOM HE
NAMES FRIDAY, AND MAKES HIS SERVANT.

ABOUT a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and
by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing,
for want of an occasion to put them into execution), I was sur-
prised, one morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes
all on shore together on my side the island, and the people
who belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight. The
number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many,
and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to
take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-
handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and disoomforted :
however, I put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, if
any thing had presented. Having waited a good while, listening
to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient,
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to
the t0p of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so.
however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that
they could not perceive me by any means. Here I observed,
by the help of my perspective glass, that they were no less
than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that
they had meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not.
or what it was ; but they were all dancing, in I know not how
Rang barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round
, e re.1.56 .1113'1-13'1'1'11 1112s or

\Vhile I was thus looking on them. I perceived by my per-
specti3 e. two miserable 33' retches dragged from the boats. 33 here.
it seems. they were laid I13 . and 33' ere. 11o33 brought out for the.
slaughter. I perceir ed one 111 them immediately tall. being
knocked down. I suppose. with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way. and two or three others were at work '
immediately. cutting him open for their cooker3. Wllilt' "10
other 3ictim was lett standing by himself. till they should be
ready for him. III that very moinent. this poor 33 retch seeing
himselt a little at liberty. and unbound. nature inspired him
with hopes of life. and he started away from them. and ran
with incredible swiftness along the sands. directly towards me.
I mean towards that part of the coast 33 here my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frightened. I must acknowledge. when I per-
cei3' ed him run 1113' 33 ay. and especiall3 when. as I thought. I
saw him pursued by the 33 hole body: and now I e\pected that
part at 1113' dream 33' as coming to pass. and that he would cer-
tainly take shelter in my grove: but I could not depend. by
any means. upon my dream for the rest of it. viz. that the other
saI' ages would not pursue him thither. and find him there.
How'e3 er. I kept my station. and 1113' spirits began to reco3' er.
when I found that there was not above three men that follow ed
him' . and still more was I cut onr'Iged 33 hen I found that he
outstripped them eweedingly 111 running. and gained ground
of them. ' so that iI he could but hold it for halI an hour. I saw
easily he would fairly get an ay from them all.

There was between them ahd 1113 castle the creek. which I
mentioned oIten in the first part at 1113' story. 33 here I landed
my cargoes out ot the ship. and this I saw plainly he must
necessarily swim over. or the poor 33 retch would be taken
there: but when the my age escaping came thither. he made.
nothing of it. though the tide was then up; but plunging in.
swam through 111 about thirty strokes. or thereabonts. landed.
and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftuess. "'lueu the
three persons came to the. creek. I found that two of them
could s33'i111. but the third could not. and that, standing on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther. and
soon after went softly back again. which. as it happened. was
very well for him 111 the end. I observed. that the two who
swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over theI
creek as the fellow 33 as that fled from them. It came. now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly. that now
was the time to get me a servant. and perhaps a companion or
assistant. and that I was called plainly by Providence to save
this poor creature' s life. I immediately ran down the ladders
with all possible expedition. fetched my two guns. for they
were both at the foot of the ladders. as I observed above. and
getting 11p again. with the same haste. to the top of the hill, I
crossed toward the sea. and having a very short cut, and all
downhill. placed myself in the way between the pursncrs and
the pursued. holloing aloud to him that tied. who. looking back.
was at first. perhaps. as much frightened at me as at them; but
I beckoned with my hand to him to come back: and. in the
mean time. I slowly advanced towards the two that followed;
then rushing at once upon the. foremost. I knocked him down
with the stock of my piece. I was loath to tire. because I would
not have the rest hear; though. at that distance. it would not
have been easily heard. and being out of sight of the smoke too.
they would not have easily known what to make of it. Having
knocked this fellow down. the. other who pursued him stopped.
as it' he had been frightened, and I advanced apace towards
him: but as I came nearer. I perceived presently he had a
bow and arrow. and was fitting it to shoot at me: so I was
then necessitated to shoot at him first. which I did. and killed
him at the first shot. The poor savage. who tied but had stopped.
though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed. as he thought.
yet was so frightened with the tire. and noise of my piece. that
he stood stoekstill. and neither came forward nor went back--
ward. though he seemed rather inclined still to fly. than to
come on. I holloed again to him. and made signs to come for-
ward. which be easily understood. and came a little way; then
stopped again. and then a little farther. and stopped again:
and I could then perceive. that he stood trembling. as if he. had
been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed. as his two
enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me. and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of:
and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or
twelve steps. in token of acknowhalgmeut for saving his life.
I smiled at him. and looked pleasantly. and beckoned to him
to come still nearer: at length he came close. to me: and then
he kneeled down again, kissed the ground. and laid his head
upon the ground. and taking me by the foot. set my foot upon
his head; this. it seems. was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up. and made much of him, and
encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do
yet: for I perceived the savage whom I knocked down was not
killed. but stunned with the blow, and began to come to him-
self: so I pointed to him. and showed him the savage, that he
was not dead; upon this he spoke some. words to me. and
though I could not understand them. yet I thought the were
pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man 9 voice
that I had heard, my own excepted. for above twenty-five
years. But there was no time for such reflections now; the
savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to
sit up upon the ground. and I perceived that my savage began
to be afraid; but when I saw that. I presented my other piece
at the man. as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for
so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword,
which hung uaked' III a belt by my side. which I did. He no
sooner had it. but he runs to his enemy. and. at one blow. cut
oil his head so cleverlI . IIII II\ecutiouer in German) could have.

\I' hen he had done this. he comes laughing to me. in sign of
triumph. and brought me the sword again. and IIith abundance
of gestures. which I did not understand. laid it down. with the
head of the savage that he. had killed. just before me. But that
which astonished him most "as to know IIIIII I killed the
other Indian so far off: so pointing to him. he made signs to
me. to let him go to him . so I bade him go. as II ell as I could.
\\ hen he came to him. he stood like one amazed. looking at
him. turning him first on one side. then on the other. looked at
the "mold the bullet had made. II hieh. it seems. II as just in
his breast. II here it had made a hole. and no great quantity of
blood had followed: but he had bled iIIIIardly. for he was
quite dead. He took up his boII and mm" s. and came back:
so I turned to go aIIaI. and beckoned him to follow me. making
signs to him that more might come atter them. Upon this. IIII
made. signs to me that he should bury them with sand. that they
might not be seen bI the rest. if they followed; and so I made
signs to him again to do so. He fell to work . and. in an
instant. he had scraped a hole III the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the tirst III. and then dragged him into it. and
coIered him; and did so by the other also: I believe he had
buried them lIoth' In a quarter of an hour. Then calling him
away. I carried him. not to my castle. but quite away to my
caI e. on the. tarther part of the island. so I did not let my
dream come. to pass in that part. viz. that he came into my
grow for shelter. Here I . gave him bread and a bunch of
raisins to eat. and a draught of water. II hIclI I found he was
indeed in great distress for. by his running. and having re-
freshed him. I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep.
showing I him a place II here I had laid some rice straw. and a
blanket upon it, II hIch I used to sleep upon myself sometimes:
so the poor creature lay do" n. and II eat to sleep.

He was a comely. handsome fellow. perfectly 'well made.
with straight strong limbs. not too large..t tall. and well shaped;
and. as I reckon. about twenty-six wars of age. He had a
very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect. but
seemed to haIe something very manly III his face; and yet he.
had all the sweetness and softness of an European In his coun-
tenance too. especI ailly II hen he smiled. His hair was long and
black, not curled like II ool his forehead very high and large;
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The
colour of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and
yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians
and Virginians. and other natives of America are, but of a
bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it something
very agreeable. though not very easy to describe. His face
was round and plump; his nose small. not flat like the Negroes;
a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and
as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered, rather than slept. about half an
hour, he awoke again. and came out of the cave to me, for I
had been milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure just
by: when he espied me. he came running to me, la ing him-
selfdown again upon the ground, with all the possib e signs of
an humble thankful disposition, making a great many antic
gestures to show it. At last, he lays his head flat upon the
ground. close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before; and after this, made all the signs
to me of subjection. servitude, and submission, imaginable, to
let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I
understood him in many things. and let him know I was very
well pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak to
him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let him know
his name should be FRIDAY, which was the day I saved his
life: I called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise
taught him to say, Master; and then let him know that was to
be my name: I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and
to know the meaning of them. [gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop
my bread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like.
which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was
very good for him. I kept there with him all that night; but
as soon as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me. and
let him know I would give him some clothes; at which he
seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by
the place where he had buried the two men. he pointed exactly
to the place, and showed 'me the marks that he had made to
find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them
up again, and eat them. At this I appeared very angry, ex-
pressed my abhorrence of it. made as if I would vomit at the
thoughts of it. and beckoned with m hand to him to come
away; which he did immediately, wit great submission. I
then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies
were gone; and pulling out my glass. I looked. and saw
plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance of
them or their canoes; so that it was plaiu they were gone.
and had left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now160 IIIII'Izs'I'eIIt-zs or

more courage. and consequently more curiosity. I took my
man FridaI with me. giving him the sword in his hand. IIith
the MI and arrous at his back. II huh I found he cotIlIl use
I-erI de\tIIrouslI'. making him carrI one gun for IIIII. and l
two for myself: and IIIIIII IIII marched to the place II here
these Ire Itures had been: for I had II mind now to <<vet some.
tuller intelligence of them. \\ hen leame to the place. my
very blood ran chill in IIII veins. and my he Irt sunk within
me. at the horror of the speet tIIIIle. . indeed. it was II dreadtul
sight. at least it II as so to me. though Friday made nothing ot
it. The place was covered with human bones. the ground
dyed with their blood. and great pieces of tlesh lett here and
there. half-eaten. mangled. and scorched: and. in short. all
the tokens ot the triumphant feast the) had been making; there.
after a victory over their enemies. I saw three sculls. th e
hands. and the bones ot' three or four legs and feet. and abun-
dance of other parts of the bodies; and FridaI. bI his signs.
made IIIII understand that they brought (Wt'l' four prisoners to

pointinII' to himself. "as the. fourth; that there had been a

number ot'prisouers: all which II ere arried to seIerIIl places
by those II ho had taken them in the tight. in order to feast
upon them, as II as done here III these IIretIIhes upon those
they brought hither.

lI Iaused Friday to gutherall the smile. bones. flesh. and
whatever remained. and lay them together in a heap. and
make a great tire upon it. and burn them all to ashes. I
found Friday had still a hankering: stomach alter some oi the.
flesh. and was still II cannibal in his nature: but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it. and IIt the least
appearance of it. that he durst not discmer it: for I had.
bI some means. let him knou. that I would kill him it he
otl'ered it.

\\ hen he had done this. II II came back to our castle: and
there I fell to work for my IIIIIII Frida I and. first of all. I
gave him a pair of linen drawers. II hIeh I had out of the poor
gunner s chest I mentioned. which I found in the wreck: and
which. with a little alteration. titted him very well: and then
I made him a jerkin of goat's sskiu. as II ell as my skill would

a'lloII (for l was now "T0" II a tolerable good tailor): and I
gave. him a cap. which I made ot hare' 3 skin. very convenient
and fashionable enough: and thus he. was Ilothed for the
present. tolerably well. and II as mightv II ell pleased to see.
himself almost as well clothed as his master. It Is true. he
II ent aw kIIardly' In these clothes at first; wearing the. drawers
I as Iery awkward to him. and the sleeves of the waistcoat
gallcd his shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but after a
little easing them where he complained they hurt him. and
using himself to them. he took to them at length very well.
The next da after I came home to my hutch with him. I
began to COIISlt er where 1 should lodge him; and that lmight
do well for him. and yet be perfectly easy myself. I made a
little tent for him in the vacant place between my two forti-
fications. in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first.
.-\s there was a door or entrance there. into my cave, I made a
fornml framed doorcase. and a door to it of boards. and set it
up in the passage. a little within the entrance; and causing
the. door to open in the inside. I barred it up in the. night.
taking in my ladders too: so that Friday could no way come.
at me in the inside of my innermost wall. without making so
much noise in getting over that it must needs waken me; for
my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles.
covering all my tent. and leaning up to the side of the bill:
which was again laid across with smaller sticks. instead of
laths. and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice.
straw. which was strong. like. reeds; and at the hole. or place.
which was left to go in or out by the ladder. [ had placed a
kind of trapdoor. which. if it had been attempted on the.
outside. would not have opened at all. but would have fallen
down. aml make a great noise: as to weapons. I took them all
into my side every night. But I needed none of all this pre-
caution; for never man had a more faithful. loving. sincere
servant. than Friday was to me: without passions. sullenness.
or designs. perfectly obliged and engaged; his very atl'ections
were tied to me. like those of a child to a father; and I dare.
say. he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine.
upon any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave
me. of this put it out of doubt. and soon convinced me. that I
needed to use no precautions. as to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe. and that with
wonder. that however it had pleased God. in his providence.
and in the government of orks of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the wor of his creatures the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the
same reason. the same affections. the same. sentiments of kind-
ness and obligation. the same passions and resentmeuts of
wrongs. the same sense of gratitude. sincerity, fidelity. and
all the capacities of doing good. and receiving good. that he
has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer them occa-
sions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay. more ready,
to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed,
than we are. This made me very melancholy sometimes. in
reflecting. as the several occasions presented. how mean a use
we make of all these, even though we have these powers
enlightened by the great lamp of instruction. the Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of his word added to our understand-
ing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving
knowledge from so many millions of souls. who. if I might
judge by this poor savag . would make a much better use of
it than we did. From hence. I sometimes was led too far. to
invade the sovereignty of Providence. and as it were arraigu
the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things. that should
hide that light from some. and reveal it to others. and )et
e\pect a like dutv from both. but I shut it up. and checked
my thoughts with this conclusion: first. That we did not know
bv what light and law these should be condemned; but that as
God was necessarih. and, by the nature of his being. infinitely
holv and inst. so it could not be. but if these creatures were
all sentenced to absence from himself. it was on account of
sinuing against that light. which. as the Scripture says. was a
law to themselves. and by such rules as their consciences
would acknowledge to be just. though the foundation was not
discovered to us: and. secondly That still. as we all are the
clay in the hand at the potter. no vessel could sav to him.
\I In hast thou formed me thus. '

But to return to my new companion :--I was greatly de-
lighted with him. and made it 111v business to teach him every
thing that w as proper to make him useful. handy . and helpful;
but especially to make him speak. and understand me when I
spoke: and he was the aptest scholar that ever was . and par-
ticularly w as so merrv. so constantlv diligent. and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand
him. that it was verv pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my
life began to be so easy, that I began to say to myself. that
could I but have been safe front more savages. I cared not if

I w as never to remove from the place where I lived.
 

SECTION XXIII.

ROBINSON INSTRUCI'S AND CIVIIJZFS "IS MAN FRIDAY.--ENDBAVOURS TO GIVE
HIM AN IDEA 0F CHRISTIANITY.

AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I
thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way
of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I
ought to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me
one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill
a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but
as I was going, I saw a she goat lying down in the shade, and
two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday ;--
Hold, said I; stand still; and made signs to him not to stir:
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the
kids. The poor creature, who had, at adistance, indeed, seen
me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could
imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or per-
ceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel
whether he was not wounded; and, as I found presently,
thought I was resolved to kill him : for he came and kneeled
down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
' things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the
meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did: and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting
upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little
what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the
fowL II hich w as indeed a parrot. though I thought it had been
a hawk; I say. pointing to the parrot. and to IuI gun. and to
the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make it
fall. I made. him understand that I would shoot and kill that
bird , accordinglI. I fired. and bade him look. and immedi-
ately he saw the parrot fall. He. stood like one frightened
again. notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and I found he
was the more amazed. because he did not see me put any
thing into the gun. but thought that there must be some
wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing. able to
kill mau. beast. bird. or any thing near or far ml: and the
astonishment this created in him was such. as could not wear
otl' for a long time: and I believe. if I would have let him. he
would have worshiped me and my gun. As for the gun itself.
he would not so much as touch it for several days after; but
he would speak to it. and talk to it. as it' it had answered him.
when he was by himself ; which. as I afterwards learned of
him. was to desire it not to kill him. "'ell. after his astonish-
ment II as a little over at this. I pointed to him to run and
fetch the bird I had shot. II hII'lI he did. but SId' ed some time. -
for the parrot. not being quite dead. had fluttered awaI a good
distance from the place II here she fell: hoIIeIer. he tound
her. took her up. and brought her to 1119'. and as I had per-
ceived his ignorance about the gun befer. I took this advan-
tage to charge the gun. again. and not to let him see me do it.

that I might be readI for any other mark that might present.

but nothing more otlered at that time: so I brought home the
kid. and the same eIeuing I took the skin oil. and cut it out
as well as I could . and having a pot fit tor that purpose. I
boiled or steII ed some of the flesh. and made. some IerI good
broth. After I had begun to eat some. I gave some to my
man. II ho seemed IerI glad of it. and liked it I"erI II ell but
that which was strangest to him. was to see me eat salt with it.
He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat: and
putting a little into his own month, he seemed to nauseate it.
and would spit and sputter at it. washing his mouth with fresh
water after it: on the other hand. I took some meat into my
mouth without salt. and I pretended to spit and sputter for
want of salt. as fast as he had done at the salt; but it would
not do; he would nm or care for salt II ith his meat or in his

broth; at least. not for a great while. and then but a very
little.

HaIing thus fed him with boiled meat and broth. I was
resolved to feast him the next daI II Ith roasting a piece of the
kid: this I did, bI hanging it before the fire on a string. as I
had seen many people do In England. setting two poles up. one
on each side of the fire. and one across on the top. and tying
the string to the cross stick. letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired I'm much; abut when he came to taste
the flesh. he took so many ways to tell me. how well he liked
it. that [could not but understand him: and at last he told
me. as well as he could. he would never eat man's flesh any
more. which I was very glad to hear.

The next day. I set him to work to beating some corn out.
and sifting it in the manner I used to do. as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I. especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was. and that it was
to make bread ot' it: for after that I let him see me make my
bread. and bake it too : and in a little time Friday was able to
do all the work for me. as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider. that having two months to feed
instead of one. I must provide more. ground for my harvest.
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do: so I
marked out a larger piece of land. and began the fence in the
same manner as before. in which Friday worked not only very
willingly and very hard. but did it very cheerfully: and I
told him what it was for: that it was for corn to make. more
bread. because he was now with me. and that I might have
enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of
that part. and let me know that he thought I had much more
labour upon me on his account. than I had for myself; and
that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what
to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place: Friday began to talk pretty well. and understand the
names of almost every thing I had occasion to call for. and of
every place I had to send him to. and talked a great deal to
me; so that. in short, I began now to have some use for my
tongue again. which. indeed, I had very little occasion for
before. that is to say. about speech. Besides the pleasure of
talking to him. I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow him-
self: his simple unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and
more every day. and I began really to love the creature ; and.
on his side. I believe he loved me more than it was possible for
him ever to love any thing before.

I had a mind once to try it' he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer me. almost any question, I asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle! At which he smiled. and said. Yes, yes. we always
tight the better: that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight; and so we began the following discourse :--

Mssren. You always fight the better! how came you to be
taken prisoner then. Friday? -

FRIDAY. My nation beat much. for all that.

MASTER. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken '3 -

where me was; they take one. two. three, and me : my nation

F111n.11. Yes 1 ha1e been here; (points to the N. 11'. side
01 the island. 11 Inch it seems. 11 as their side.)

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerl1
been among the say ages 11ho used to come on shore on the

farther part of the island. on the same maneating occasions he
was now brought for: and. some time after. when I took the
courage to carry him to that side. being the same I formerly
mentioned he presently kne11 the place. and told me he was
there once 11 hen they eat 11p t11enty men. two 11 omen. and one.
child: he could not tell t11ent1 in English. but he numbered
them. by laying so many stones in a row. and pointing to me
to tell them 01 er.

I have. told this passage. because it introduces what fol-
lows: that after I had this discourse with him. I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore. and whether the
canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no danger.
no canoes e1 er lost. but that. after a little way out to sea.
there 11.11 a current and wind. al11 ays one way in the morning.
the other 111 the afternoon. This I understood to be no more
than the sets of the tide. as going out or coming in; but I
afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and
retina of the mighty river Oroonoko, 111 the mouth or gulf of
which river. as I found afterwards. our island lay: and that
this land which I perceived to the 1v. and N. w. was the great
island Trinidad. on the north point of the mouth of the river.
I asked Friday a thousand questions about the country. the
inhabitants. the. sea. the coast. and 11 hat nations were near: he
told me all he knew. with the greatest openness imaginable.
I asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of
people. but could get no other name than Caribs: from "hence
I easily understood. that these were the Caribbees. which our

maps place on the part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to
St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the
moon. that was. beyond the setting of the moon. which must
be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men.
like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before; and that they had killed much mans. that 'was his
word: by all which I understood, he meant the Spaniards.
whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole
country, and were remembered by all the nations. from father
to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island and get among those white men: he told me. Yes. yes.
you may go in two canoe. I could not understand what he
meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two
canoe: till, at last, with great difficulty. I found he meant it
must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of
Friday's discourse began to relish with me very well; and
from this time I entertained some hopes that. one time or
other. I might find an opportunity to make my escape from
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to
help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me.
and that he began to speak to me. and understand me. I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind: particularly I asked him one time. who made him '!
The poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought I
had asked him who was his father: but I took it up by ano-
ther handle. and asked him who made the sea. the ground we
walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me, it was one
old Benamuckee. that lived beyond all; he could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, much
older, he said. than the sea or the land. than the moon or the
stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all
things, why did not all things worship him? He looked very
grave. and with a perfect look of innocence said. All things
say 0 to him. I asked him if the people who die in his coun-
try went away any where.' He said. Yes; they all went to
Benamuckee: then I asked him whether these they eat up
went thither too? He said. Yes.

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven; that he governed '
the world by the same power and providence by which he
made it; that he was omnipotent, and could do every thing for
us. give ever thing to us. take every thing from us; and thus.
by degrees, opened his eyes. He listened with great atten-
tion. and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ
being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our
prayers to God. and his being able to hear us. even in heaven.
He told me one day. that if our God could hear us up beyond
the sun. he must needs be a greater God than their Benn-
muckee. who lived but a little 11.11 oil. and 1et could not hear
till the1-'11'ent up to the great mountains where he dwelt to
speak to him. I asked him if ever he. 11 cut thither to speak
to him .' He said. No . they never went that were 1oung
men; none went thither but the old men. 11 hom he called their
01111'okakee: that is. as I made. him explain it to me. their
religious. or clergy' . and that the1 11' cut to 8:11 0 (so he called
sa1i11g pra1e1's). and then came back. and told them 11 hat
Beuamue kee said. 131' this I observed that there 1s priestcraft
even among; the. most blinded ignorant pagans in the 11' orld;
and the policy at making a secret of religion. 111 order to pre-
serve the veneration ot the people to the clerg1 . is not 0nl1 to
be found 111 the lxomau. but perhaps among, 1' all religions 111 the
11 orld. e1' en among the. most brutish and barbarous savages.

I endem oured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday:
and told him. that the pretence of their old men going up to
the mountains to say 0 to their god Benamuckee. was a cheat ;
and their bringiuu' word from thence 11 hat he said 11 as much
more so: that it the1'1net 111th any answer. or spake with any
one there. it must be 11 ith an e111 spirit: and then I entered
into a long discourse with him about the de1il. the original of
him. his rebellion against God. his enmity to man. the reason
of 11. his settinn' himselt up in the. dark parts of the world to be
11orsh1ped instead of (-1111. and as God. and the many strata-
gems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin . how he
had a secret a1 cess to our pas.1ious and to our atlections. and
to adapt his snares to our inclinations. so as to cause us even
to be our own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our
011' 11 choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind
about the devil, as it 11 as about the being of a God: nature
assisted all 1111' arguments to evidence to him even the neces~
sity of a great First Cause. and overruling. governing P011 er.
a secret. directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of
paying homage to him that made us. and the like: but there
appeared nothing of this kind 111 the notion of an evil spirit; of
his original. his being. his nature. a11d.abo1e all. of his incli~
nation to do e1 il. and to draw as in to do so too: and the poor
creature puzzled me once in such a manner. by a question
merel1- natural and innocent that I scarce knew what to say to
him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of
God. his omnipotence. his aversion to sin. his being a consum-
ing fire to the workers of mi quity , how, as he had made us all.
he could destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he
listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After this.
I had been telling him how the devil 11' as God's enemy in the
hearts of men. and used all his malice and skill to defeat the
good designs of Providence. and to ruin the kingdom of Christ
in the world. and the like. 'Vell, says Friday. but you say
God is so strong. so great ; is he not much strong. much might
as the devil 2--Yes. yes, says 1. Friday. God is stronger than
the devil: God is above the devil. and therefore we pray to
God to tread him down under our feet. and enable us to resist
his temptations. and quench his fiery darts.--Bnt. says he again.
if God much stronger. much might as the devil. why God no
kill the devil. so make him no more do wicked! I was strangely
surprised at this question : and. after all. though I was now an
old man. yet I was but a young doctor. and ill qualified for a
casuist. or a solver of ditiieulties; and. at first, I could not tell
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him. and asked him
what he said; but he was too earnest for an answer. to forget
his question. so that be repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time. I had recovered myself a little.
and I said. God will at last punish him severely ; he is reserved
for the judgment. and is to be cast into the bottomless pit. to
dwell with everlasting tire. This did not satisfy Friday; but
he returns upon me. repeating my words. Reserve at last: me.
no understand; but why not kill the devil now : not kill great
ago f--You may as well ask me. said I. why God does not kill
you and me. when we do wicked things here that oll'end him i
'We are preserved to repent and be pardoned. l 10 mused some
time on this: W'cll. well. says he, mighty afl'eetionately. that
well: so you. I. devil. all wicked, all preserve. repent. God
pardon all. Here. I was run down again by him to the last
degree; and it was a testimony to me. how the mere notions of
nature. though they will guide reasonable creatures to the
knowledge of a God. and of a worship or homage due to the
supreme being of God. as the consequence of our nature. yet
nothing but divine revelation can form the. knowledge of Jesus

Ihrist. and of redemption purchased for us. of a Mediator of
the new covenant. and of an lntercessor at the footstool of
God's throne; I say. nothing but a revelation from Heaven
can form these in the soul: and that. therefore. the gospel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I mean the Word of God.
and the Spirit of God. promised for the guide and sanctifier of
his people. are the absolutely necessary instructors of the son ls
of men in the saving knowledge of God. and the means of
salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my man, rising up hastily. as upon some sudden occasion of
going out; then sendinghim for something a good way off. I
seriously prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage; assisting. by his Spirit, the heart of
the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge
of God in Christ. reconciling him to himself, and would guide
me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his conscience

might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When
I
he. came again to me. I entered into a long discourse with him
upon the subject 01 the redemption of man by the Sav mm of
the world. and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from
heaI en. viz. of repentance towards God. and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him. as well as I
could. why our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature
of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how. for that reason.
the fallen angels had no share. in the redemption; that he
fame only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the
ike.

I had. God knows. more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction. and must
acknowledge. II hat I believe all that act upon the same prin-
ciple IIill find. that in laIiIIg things open to him. I reallI
informed and instructed nII self III many things that either I
did not kuoII or had not tully considered before. but which
on urred uaturallI to mI mind upon searching into them. for
the information ot this poor savage; and I had more affection
in IIII inquiry after thing's upon this occasion than M er I felt
before . so that. II hether this poor II ild II retch II as the better
for me or no. I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me : my habitation grew
comfortable to me. beyond measure: and when l reflected. that
in this solitarI lit'e II hIeh I had been ('Ollllllt'tl to. I had not
onlI been unwed to look up to Heaven InI self. and to seek to
the hand that had brought me here. but "as no" to be made
an instrument. under ProIiIleuce. tOS s'aIe the life. and. for
aught I knew. the soul. of a poor savage. and bring him to the
true knowledge of religion. and of the Christian doctrine. that
he might kuoII Christ Jesus. in whom is life. eternal; I say.
II hen I reflected upon all these things. a secret on ran through
eI my part of mI soul. and I frequently rejoiced that an I
II as brought to this place. Much I had so often thought the
most dreadful of all allliItions that could possiblI have be-
fallen me.

I Iontinued in this thankful frame all the remainder of mI
time. and the com ersation \I hich employed the hours lIetII een
Friday and me IIas such. as made the three years which we
liI ed there together perfectly and completely happy. if any
such thing as complete happiness can be formed In .I subluuary
state. This savage "as now a good Christian. a much better
than I. though I have reason to hope. and bless God for it.
that we were equally penitent. and comforted. restored peni-
tents. \Ve had here the word of God to read. and no farther
oil' from his Spirit to instruct. than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself. in reading the Scriptures. to let him
kuOII . as II ell as I could. the meaning of II hat I read; and he
again. by his serious inquiries and 'questionings. made me. as
I said before, a much better scholar III the Scripture~kuowledge
than I should ever have been by my own mere private reading.
Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also, from
experience in this retired part of my life. viz. how infinite and
inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God. and
ot' the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus. is so plainly laid
down in the word of God. so easy to be received and under-
stood. that. as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable
of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to
the great work of sincere repentance for my sins. and laying
hold of a Saviour for life and salvation. to a stated reformation
in practice. and obedience to all God's commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor. I mean human; so. the
same plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening
this savage creature. and bringing him to be such a Christian.
as l have known few equal to him in my life.

As to all the disputes, wrangling. strife, and contention.
which have. happened in the world about religion, whether
uiceties in doctrines, or schemes of church government, they
were all perfectly useless to us. and. for aught I can yet see.
they have been so to the rest of the world. We had the sure
guide to heaven. viz. the word of God: and we had. blessed
be God. comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and
instructing us by his word. leading us into all truth, and
making us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his
word. And I cannot see. the least use that the greatest know-
ledge of the disputed points of religion. which have made such
confusions in the. world. would have been to us. if we could
have obtained it.--But I must go on with the historical part of
things, and take every part in its order.
 

SECTION XXIV.

ROBINSON AND FRIDAY BUILD A CANOE TO CARRY THEM TO FRIDAY'S COUNTRY.
--'I'HEIR SCHEME PREVENTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A PARTY OF SAVAGES.

AFTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted
him with my own history, or at least so much of it as related
to my coming to this place; how I had lived here, and how
long: I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave
him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I
made him a belt, with a frog hanging to it. such as in England
we wear hangers in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I
gave him a hatchet, which was not Only as good a weapon, in
some cases, but much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly Eng-
land, which I came from; how we lived, how we worshiped
God, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in
ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him, as near
as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in
pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat,
which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with
my whole strength then; but was now fallen almost all to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a great
while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied
upon? At last, says he, Me see such boat like come to place
at my nation. I did not understand him a good while; but, at
last, when I had examined farther into it, I understood by him.
that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the
country where he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven
thither by stress of weather. I presently imagined that some
European ship must have been cast away upon their coast. and
the boat might get loose. and drive ashore; but was so dull.
that I never once thought of men making their escape from a
wreck thither. much less whence they might come: so I only
inquired after a description of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him when he added. with some. warmth.
We save the white mans from drown. Then I presently asked
him. if there were any white mans. as he called them. in the
boat? Yes. he said: the boat full of white mans. I asked him
how many? He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him
then what became of them? He told me, They live, they dwell
at my nation.

This put new thoughts into my head: for I presently ima-
gined that these might be the men belonging to the ship that
was cast away in the sight of my island; as I now called it;
and who. after the ship was struck on the rock. and they saw
her inevitably lost. had saved themselves in their boat. and
were landed upon that wild shore. among the savages. Upon
this, I inquired of him more critically what was become of
them; he assured me they lived still there ; that they had been
there about four years; that the savages let them alone. and
gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass
they did not kill them. and eat them 2 He said. No. they make
brother with them; that is. as I understood him. a truce; and
then he added. They no eat mans but when make the war tight ;
that is to say. they never eat any men but such as come to fight
with them. and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the
top of the hill. at the east side of the island, from whence. as I
have said, I had. in a clear day, discovered the main or conti-
nent of America. Friday. the weather being very serene, looks
very earnestly towards the main land. and. in a kind of sur-
prise, falls a jumping and dancing. and calls out to me. for I
was at some distance from him. I asked him what was the
matter? 0 joy! says he; 0 glad! there see my country. there
my nation! I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face. and his eyes sparkled. and his counte-
nance discovered a strange eagerness. as if he had a mind to
be in his own country again. This observation of mine put a
great many thoughts into me. which made me at first not so
easy about my new man. Friday, as I was before; and I made
no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own nation
again, he would not only forget all his religion. but all his
obligation to me. and would be forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me. and come back perhaps with a
hundred or two of them. and make a feast upon me. at which
he. might be as merry as he used to be with those of his ene-
mies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poorI71 .1111'11\"'1s11111'1111

ROBINSON cnuson. 175

accordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the
other side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I
always kept it sunk in water) I brought it out, showed it him,
and we both went into it. I found he was a most dextcrous
fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift
again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, "'ell,
now, Friday, shall we go to your nation ? H e looked very dull
at my saying so; which, it seems, was because he thought the
boat too small to go so far: 1. then told him I had a bigger;
so th {next day I went to the place where the first. boat lay
whicfiy -- _made, but which I could not get into the water.

suit had' split and dried it. that it was in a manner rotten.

' 'Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we
would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home
in it. He answered not. one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him what was the matter with him? He asked
me again, Why/iyou angry mad with Friday '3 \Vhat me done!
I asked him what'he meant: I told him I was not angry with
him at'all. No angry! says he, repeating the words several
times; Why send Friday home away to my nation 'i--IV hy,
sa '5 I, Friday, did not you say, you wished you were there 1'
--- es, yes, says he, wish be both there; no wish Friday there,
no master there. In a word, he would not think of going there
Without me. I go there, Friday! says I; what shall I do
there? He returned very quick upon me at this: You do great
deal much good, says he; you teach wild mans be good, sober,
tame n ans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new
life.----- has! Friday, says I, then knowest not what thou sayest;
I am but an ignorant man myself.--Yes, yes, says he, you
teachee me good, you teachee them good.----No. no, Friday,
says I. you shall go without me; leave me here to live by
myself, as I did before. He looked confused again at that
word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to
wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. What must
I do with this? says I to him. You take kill Friday, says be.
What must I kill you for? said I again. He returns very
quick, What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no
send Friday away. This he spoke so earnestly, that 1 saw
tears stand in his eyes: in a word, I so plainly discovered the
utmost affection in him to me, am] a firm resolution in him,
that I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled
atl'eetion to me. and that nothing should part him from me. so
I found all the foundation ot hisdesire to go to his II" II country

careful to preserve them. not iIIIagiuing that I should III er have
this kind of uso tor them. [did not doubt but theI "1' re all
rotten. and. indeed. most of them were so. However, I found
two pieces. which appeared pretty good. and with these I went
to work; and with a great deal of pains. and awkward stitch-
mg. you may be sure. for want of needles. I. at length. made
a three cornered ugly thing. like what we call in England a
shoulder-ot'mnutton sail. to go with a boom at bottom. and a
little short sprit at the top. such as usually our ships' long~
boats sail with. and such as 1 best know how to manage. as it
was such a one I had to the heat in which I made my escape
from Barbary. as related in thetirst part of my story.

.I was near two months performing this last work. via. rig-
ging and titting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
eomplete. making a small stay. amt a sail. or t'oresail. to it. to
assist. it' we should turn to windward; and. which was more
than all. I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I
was but a bungling shipwright. yet. as I knew the usefulness.
and oven necessity of such a thing. I applied myself with so
touch pains to do it. that at last I brought it to pass: though.
considering tho many dull coutrivanees I had for it that failed.
I think it cost me almost as much labour as tanking the boat.

After all this was done. I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for. though he
knew very well how to paddle a canoe. he knew nothing what
belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was the most amazed
when he saw me work the boat to and again in tho sea by the
rudder. and how the sail gibbed. and tilled this way. or that
way. as the course we. sailed changed; I say. when he saw
this. he stood like. one astonished and amazed. However. with
a little use. I made all these things familiar to him. and he
became. an expert sailor. except that as to the compass. I could
make him understand very little of that. (la the. other hand.
as there was very little cloudy weather. and seldom or never
any fogs in those parts. there was the. less m'easion for a com-
pnss. seeing the stars were always to be. seen by night. and the
shore by day. except in the rainy seasons. and then nobody
cared to stir abroad. either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the soven-and-ttwntieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to he left out of the account.
my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest
of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with
the same. thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first; and
it' I had such cause. of acknowledgement at first. I had much
more so now. having such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me. and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and speedily delivered; for i had an invincible im-
pression upon my thoughts that my delirerance. was at hand.
and that I should not be another year in this plum. I went

I had been so good a husband of my rum. that I had a grea at
deal lett. \Vhen he drank it. I made him take the tno towling--
pII ees II hIeh we always carried. and loaded them with large
sIIan -sbot. as big as small pistol- bullets: then I took four
quskets. and loaded them II ith tIIo slugs. and the small bullets
each; and my two pistols I loaded II Ith II brace ot bullets each.
I hung my great sword. as usual. naked by "I" sideI and gave
I ridaI his hatchet. \Vhen I had thus prepared IIII self. I took
my perspective glass. and II eat up to the side ot the hill to
se e W hat I could discover: and I found quicklyI by my glass.
that there were one~aud- twenty sIIIIIges. three prisoners. and
three Ianoes: and that their whole business seemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies . II bar-
barous feast. indeed! but nothing more than. as I had observed.
I 'as usual with them. I observed also. that they were landed.
not II here theI had done when II'ridaI' made his escape. but
nearer to my creek. deg II here the shore II as low. and II here a
thick \Iood eame almost close doII II to the sea. This. with the
abhorrenee of the inhuman errand these II-retcbes came about.
tilled me with such indignation. that I 'Inne down again to
Friday. and told him I was resolved to go down to them. and
kill them all: and asked him if he would stand by me. He.
had now got over his fright. and his spirits being a little raised
with the dram I had given him. he was very cheerful. and told
me. as before. he would die II hen I bid die.

III this tit ot tury. I took and diIided the arms II I|I( II I had
charged. as before. between us: I '"u e I'riday one pistol to
stick in his girdle. and three guns upon his shoulder. and I
took one pistol. and the other three guns InIselt': and III this
posture. IIe. marehed out. I took II small bottle at rum in my
pocket. and gaIe I'ridav II large bag with more powder and
bullets: and. as to orders. I charged him to keep close behind
me. and not to stir. or shoot. or do any thing. till I bid bim' ,
and. in the. me: III time. not to speak II \Iord. III this posture.
I fe tcbed II compass to my right hand ot ueI II' a mile. as well to
wet or er the creek as to net into the wood. so that I might come
within shot of them before Ishonld be discovered. which I had
seen. by my glass. it II as easy to do.

While I II as making this march. my former thoughts return--
ing. I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that I
entertained anI fear of their number: for. as they were naked.
unarmed II retches. it is certain I was superior to them. . nay.
though I had been alone. But it occurred to my thoiights.

ROBINSON RELEASES A SPANIARD.--PRIDAY DISCOVERS "IS FATIIER.--ACOOM-
MODATION PROVIDED FOR THESE NEW GUESTS--WHO ARI-2 AFTERH'ARDS SENT
TO LIBERATE THE OTHER Sl'ANlARDS.----ARRIVAL Ol' AN ENGLISH VESSEL.

I HAD now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and
had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and
bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday--Now, Friday, said I, do as I bid thee. Friday said
he would. Then, Friday, says I, do exactly as you see me do;
fail in nothing. So I set down one of the muskets and the
fowling-pieee upon the ground, and Friday did the like by
his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him to do the like: then asking him if he was ready.
he said, Yes. Then fire at them, said I; and the same moment
I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
. that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
' and on my side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were.
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them
who were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not imme-
diately know which way to run. or which way to look, for
they knew not from whence their destructiori came. Friday
kept his eyes close upOn me that, as I had bid him, he might
observe what I did; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I
threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like: he saw me cock and present; he didIS? .\II\'I-'.\'I'I'IIII'..\' III-I

a great many times: II hen he went into him. he would sit don II

This atlair put an end to our pursuit ot the eanoe with the

the north-west. \\ huh was against them. that I could notnoalssos elitism-z. 185

suppose their boat could live. or that they ever reached their
own coast.

But. to return to Friday : he was so lmsy about his father.
that I conhl not find in my heart to take him off for some time:
but after I thought he could leave him a little. I called him to
me. and he came jumping and laughing. and pleased to the
highest extreme; then I asked him if he had given his father
any bread. He shook his head. and said. None: ugly dog
eat all up self. I then gave him a cake of bread. out of a little.
pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for him-
self. but he. would not taste it. but carried it to his father. I
had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins. so I gave
him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins. but I saw him come out of the. boat.
aml run away. as if he. had been lwwitohed. he ran at such a
rate: for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw:
I say. he ran at such a rate. that he was out of sight. as it
were. in an instant: and though I called. and hallooed out
too. after him. it was all one. away he went; and in a quarter
of an hour I saw him come back again. though not so fast as
he went: and as he "ante. nearer. I found his pace slacker.
because he had something in his hand. \Vhen he came up to
me. I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug. or pot.
to bring his father some. fresh water. and that he had two more
cakes or loaves of bread : the bread he. gave me. but the. water
he carried to his father: however. as I was very thirsty too. I
took a little sup of it. The water revived his father more than
all the rumor spirits I had given him. for he was just fainting
with thirst.

\Vhen his father had drunk. Icalled to him to know if there
was any water left: he said. Yes: and I bade him give it to
the poor Spaniard. who was in as much want of it as his father :
and l seutouc. of the cakesthat Friday brought. to the Spaniard
too. who was indeed very weak. and was reposiug himself upon
a green place under the shade of a tree : and whose limbs were
also very stitf. and very much swelled with the rude bandage
he had been tied with. \Vheu I saw that. upon Friday's
coming to him with the water. he sat up aml drank. and took
the. bread. and began to eat. I Went to him and gave him a
handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all the tokens
of gratitude and thankfnlness that could appear in any counte-
nance: but was so weak. notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the tight. that he eonld not stand up upon his feet:
he tried to do it two or three. times. but was really not able.
his aucles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade
him sit still. and caused Friday to rub his ancles. and bathe
them with rum. as he. had done his father's.

I observed the. poor affectionate creature. every two minutes.
or perhaps less. all the while he was here, turn his head about,lSti AIH'IIIN'I'I'RES or

to see if his father was in the same plaee and posture as he left
him sitting: and at last IIII found he was not to be seen: at
whieh he started up. and. without speaking a word. flew with
that sIIiftuess to him. that one eould searee pereeive his feet
to toneh the ground as he II eIIt' . but II hen he eame. he only
found he had laid himself IIIIII II to ease his limbs. so Friday
eame baeL to me pre seutlv. deg and then I spoke to the Spaniard
to let Fridav help him up. it he could. and lead him to the
boat. and "II II he should earry him to our dwellmg where I
would take eare of him. . but Fridav. a lush strong fellow.
took the Spaniard quite up upon his baek. and earried him
away to the boat. and set him down softly upon the side or
guuuel of the eauoe. with his feet in the inside of it; and then
lifting him quite in. he set him elose to his father: and pre-
seutly stepping out again. lauuehed the boat oil". and paddled
it along the shore faster than Ieould walk. though the II iuII
bleII pretty hard too: so he brought them both safe into our
ereeL. and leaIiIIg tlIeIII III the boat. ran away to It'tCII the othe

eauoe. -\s he passed me. I spoLe to him. and asked him
whither he went. He told me. Go feteh more boat: so an ay
he went like the wind. for sure IIIII er man or horse ran like
him . and he had the other I anoe in the er reek almost as soon
as I got to it by land; so he II afted me III er. IIIIII then went to
help our new guests out III the boat. II lIIeh he did: but they
were neither at them able to walk. so that poor Friday knew
not what to do.

To remedy this. I went to II orL III IIII thought. and ealliug
to FridaI to bid them sit IIIIII II IIII the. bank II lulu he came to
me. I soon made II kind ot haudbarroII to laI them IIII. and
Friday and I earried them both up together upon it. between
us. lint when II e got them to the outside ot our II all or for-
tilieation. we were at a worse loss than betore. for it was
impossible to get them over. and l was resolved not to break
it down: so I set to work again; IIIIII Friday IIIIII I. in about
two hours' time. made a very lIaIIIIsIIIIIe teut. eoverI-d with old
sails. and above that with lIIIuglIs of trees. being in the spaee
without our outward fenee, and between that and the grove of
young wood whiI-h I had planted: IIIIII here we made them
two beds of sueh things as I had. viz. of good riee straw. with
blankets laid upon it. to lie on. and another to eover them. on
eaeh bed.

Mv island was now peopled. and I thought myself very rich
in subjeets; and it II as a merry relleetiou. whieh I Irequently

try was my (III II mere propertI. so that I had an undoubted

there had been oee-Isiou for it. for me. It was remarkable.
too. I had but three subjects. and they were of three different
religions: my man Friday was a Protestant. his father was a
I'agan and a cannibal. and the Spaniard was a I'apist: how-
ever. I allowed liberty ot'conscience throughout my dominiom:
--But this is b the Way.

As soon as {had secured my two weak rescued prisoners.
and given them shelter. and a place to rest them upon. I began
to think of making some provision for them ; and the. tirst thing
I did. I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat. betwixt a kid
and a goat. out of my particular flock. to be killed; when I
cut oil' the hinder quarter. aml chopping it into small pieces. I
set Friday to work to boiling and stewing. and made them a
very good dish. I assure you. of tlesh and broth. having put
some barley and rice also into the broth: and as [cooked it
without doors. for I made no tire within my inner wall, so I
carried it all into the new tent. and having set a table there for
them. last down. and eat my dinner also with them, and. as
well as I could. cheered them. and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter. especially to his father. and. indeed. to
the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the
savages pretty Well.

After we had dined. or rather snpped. I ordered Friday to
take one ot'the cuiloes. and go and t'etch our muskets and other
tire-arms. which. for want of time. we had left upon the place of
battle: and. the. nest day. I ordered him to go and bury the
dead bodies of the savages. which lay open to the sun. and
would presently be otl'ensive. I also ordered him to bury the
horrid remains of their barbarous t'east. which I knew were
pretty much. and which I could not think of doing myself:
any. I conhl not bear to see them. it' I went that way; all
which he pnnctually performed. and etl'aced the very appear-
ance of the savages being there; so that when I went again. I
could scarce know where it was. otherwise than by the corner
of the Wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects: and. first. I set Friday to inquire (if his father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe.
and whether we might expect a return of them. with a power
too great for us to resist. Ilis tirst opinion was. that the
savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew
that night they went oil. but must. of necessity be drowned. or
driven south to those other shores. where they were as sure to
be devoured as thev were to be drowned. it' they were cast
away: but. as to what they would do. it' they came safe on
shore. he said he knew not; but it was his opinion. that they
were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being
attacked. the noise. and the tire. that he. believed they would
tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning.
not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared,IRS IIII3' II'TIIaizs or

eoneeive that II man I'ould dart tire. IIIIII speak thunder. and
kill at II distanee. without littiug up the IIIIIIII. as was IIIIIIII.
now: and this old savage was in the right; for. as I under-
stood sinee. by other hands. the savages never attempted to go
over to the island afterwards. they were so territied with the
aI'I'ouIIts given II3 those four men (tor. it seems. they did
eseape the seI.I) that they helieved 33 how er went to that en-

that I should agree to. aml no other. and to he IlirIIeteIl wholly
and absolutely by my orders. till they new lauded safely to

told IIIII he would tirst sIIe ar to IIIII himselt. that he. would
never stir from IIIII as long as he lived. till I gave him ordertl' .
and that he II onld take my sidet to the last drop ot his blood.
it there should happen the least hreaeh 0t faith among his
countrymen. He told IIIII they were all ot them very eivil.

the mercy and diser etion oi the savages: out of all hopes III
III er returning to then own eonnIrI': and that he was sure. if I
would undertake their reliet'. theI would live and die by me.

Upon these assuranees. I resolved to venture to relieve them.
if possible. and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over
to them to treat. But when we had got all things In readiness
to go. the Spaniard himself started an objection. which had so190 AIII Izs'r ones or

island. II heueI er we found oe asioa: and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts. it was impossible. III
least for me. to have the means of it out of mine. For this
purpose. I marked out several trees which I thought tit for
our work. and I set Friday and his father to cutting them
down; and then I caused the Spaniard. to whom I iIIIpartIId
IIII' thought IIII that atl'air. to oversee. and direct their work. I
showed them with what iIIdet'atigalIle pains I had hewed a
large tree into single planks. and l etinsed them to do the
like. till they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak. near two feet broad. thirty-live feet long. aml from two
inches to tour inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up.
any one may imagine.

.-\t the smue time. I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could: and. for this purpose. I made
Friday aml the Spaniard go out one day. nml myself with
Friday the next day (for we took our turns). and by this
means a e got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest: for whenever we shot the dam. we saved the kids. aml
added them to our tloek. llut. above all. the season for curing
the grapes coming on. I caused such a prmligious quantity to
be hung up in the sun. that. I believe. lmd we been at Alicant.
where tho raisins of the sun are cared. we could have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these. with our breed. was a great
part of our food. and was very good living too. I assure you.
for it is exceeding nourishing.

It was now harvest. and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the islaml. but. how-
ever. it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two
bushels of lmrley we brought in and thrcshed out above two
humlred aml twenty bushels. and the like in proportion of the
rice 3 which was store enough for our food to the next harvest.
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me:
or if we had been ready fora voyage. it would very plenti-
fnlly have victnalled our ship to have carried us to any part
of the world. that is to say. any part of America. When we
had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn. we fell to
work to make more wickerware. viz. great baskets. in which
we kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this part. and often blamed me that I did not make some
things for deli-ace of this kind of work; but I saw no need
of it.

And now having a full supply of food for all the guests l
extweuai. l gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main. to
see what he could do with those he had left behind them there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with him who
would not first swear. in the presence of himself aml the old
savage. that he would no way injure. tight with, or attack the
person he should timl in the islaml. who was so kind as to
semi for them in order to their deliverance: but that they
would stand by him. and defend him against all such attempts.
aml wherever they went. would be entirely under and sub-
jected to his command: and that this should be put in writing.
and signed with their hands. llow they were to have done
this. when I knew they had neither pen nor ink. was a ques-
tion which we never asked. Under these. instructions. the
Spaniard and the old savage. the father of Friday. went away
in one of the canoes which they might be said to collie in. or
rather were brought in. when they came as prisoners to be
devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with
a tirelock on it. and about eight charges of powder and ball.
charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not to
use either of them but upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work being the first measures used by
me. in view of my deliverance. for now twenty-seven years
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread. and of dried
grapes. sullic ient for tlIenIselVes for manyI daV s. and sufficient
for all the Spaniards for about eight daV' s tiine: and wishing
them a good voyage. I saw them gIII . agreeing VV itlI them about
a signal they should hangout at their return. by which I should
know them again when they came. back. at a "distance, before
tlIeV came IIII shore. They went away with a fair gale. on the.
day that the moon was at full. by my account in the. month of
Oct ober; but as for an exact reckoning of IlaVs. after I had
once lost it I could III-Ver recIIVIIr it again- . nor had I kept
own the number III VIIIIrs so puuctually as to be. sure I was
right; though as it prIIVed. VV hen [afterwards examined my
account. I tonnd I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened of which the like
has not perhaps been heard of" III lIistorV . l was fast asleep' III
my hntI II one. morning. when my man lIriday came running in
to me. and called aloud. Master. master. they are come. they
are come! I jumped up. and, regardless oi danger. [went
out as soon as I could get my clothes on. through my little.
grov e. which. by the VV ay. was by this time grown to be. a Very
thick wood; I say. regardless of danger. I went without my
arms. VV'IhiI h it was not my custom to do: but [was surprised.
when turning my eV- cs to the sea, I presently saw a boat at
about a lea gue and II half distance. standing III for the shore.
with a slIonlder-of-Inutton sail. as they call it and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed pre-
sently. that they did not come from that side which the shore
lay on. but from the southernmost end 0! the island. Upon
this. I called Friday III. and bade. him lie close. for these were
not the people we looked for. and that we. might not know yet
"lwtllt'r'llley were friends or enemies. III the next place. I
went in to ietch my perspective glass. to see what I could
make of them: and 'IIIaVing taken the ladder out, I climbed up
to the t0p ot the hill. as I used to do when l was apprehensive
of any thing, and to take my View the plainer. without being
discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill. when my
eye plaiIIlV discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two
leagues and a half distance from me, S. S. E. but not above a
league and a half from the shore. BV my observation, it
appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared
to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy of
seeing a ship. and one that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as
I cannot describe ; but yet I had some secret doubts hang about
me--I cannot tell from whence they came. bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to con-
sider what business an English ship could have in that part of
the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the
world where the English had any trafiic; and I knew there had
been no storms to drive them in there. as in distress; and that
if they were really English. it was most probable that they
were here upon no good design ; and that I had better continue
as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger.
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are
given us, I believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an invi-
sible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if
the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why
should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent
(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate. is not the ques-
tion). and that they are given for our good !

The present question abundantly confirms me in the 'ustice
of this reasoning; for' had I not been made cautious y this
secret admonition. come it from whence it will, I had been
undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as
you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in this
posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they
looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of land-
ing; however. as they did not come quite far enough, they did
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts. but
run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile
from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise they
would have landed just at my door. as I may say. and would
soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plun-
dered me of all I bad. When they were on shore, I was fully
satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them: one or
two I thought were Dutch. but it did not prove so; there were
in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed.
and, as I thought. bound; and when the first four or five of
them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat. as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using the
most passionate gestures of entreaty, aflliction, and despair,
even to a kind of extravagance; the other two, I could per-
ceive, lifted up their hands sometimes. and appeared concerned,
indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly
confounded at the sight. and knew not what the meaning of It
should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he
could, 0 master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well

11' was just at the top of high water when these people came
on shore; and partly while they rambled about to see what
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the
tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away,
'leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat,
who, as I found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy,'fell asleep; however, one ofthem waking a little sooner
than the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for him
to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about ;
upon which they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and
the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a
quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, who are per--
haps the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again : and
I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them oil from
the boat, Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll float next
tide: by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of
What countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very
close, not once daring to stir out of my castle, an y farther than
tO-my place of observation, near the top of the hill ; and very
glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it \ 'as no
less than ten hours before the boat could float again, and by
that time it would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to

I. He answered they had only two pieces. one of which they
left in the boat. \Vell then. said I. leave the rest to me: I see
they are all asleep. it is an easy thing to kill them all: but
shall we rather take them prisoners! He told me there were
two desperate villains among them. that it was scarce safe to
show any mercy to ; but it' they were secured. he believed all
the rest would return to their duty. I asked him which they
were! He told me he could not at that distance distinguish
them. but he would obey my orders in any thing I would direct.
\Vcll. says I. let us retreat out of their view or hearing. lest
they awake. and we will resolve t'nrther. So they willingly
went back with me. till the woods covered us from them.

book you. sir. said I. if I venture upon your deliverance.
are. you willing to make two conditions with me! lle antici-
pated my proposals. by telling me. that both he and the ship.
if recovered. should be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing: and. it' the ship was not recovered. he would
live and die. with me in what part of the world soever I would
send him; aml the two other men said the same. Well. says
I. my conditions are but two: first. 'l'hat while. you stay in this
island with me. you will not pretend to any authority here;
and it' I put arms in your hands. you will. upon all occasions.
give them up to me. and do no prejudice to me or mine upon
this island: and. in the mean time. he governed by my orders:
secondly. That it' the ship is. or may be recovered. you will
carry me and my man to England passage free.

lle gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of
man could devise. that he would comply with these most rea-
sonable demands: and. besides. would owe his life to me. and
acknowledge it upon all occasions. as long as he lived. Well
then. said I. here. are three mnskets for you. with powder and
ball: tell me. nest what you think is proper to be done. He
showed all the testimonies of his gratitude. that he was able.
but altered to be wholly guided by me. I told him i thought
it was hard venturing any thing: but the. best method I could
think of was to tire upon them at once. as they lay. and it' any
was not killed at the first volley. aml otl'ered to submit. we.
might save. them. and so put it wholly upon God's providence
to direct the shot. He said very modestly. that he was loath
to kill them. if he could help it: but that those two were incor--
ri-rible. villains. and had been the authors ot all the mutiny in
the ship, and if they escaped. we should lIII undone still; for

their sincerity that could be desired. and he IIas willing to
hIIIIcI II them. and spare their lives. II Inch I was not against.
only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while
they were on the island.

\Vhile this was doing. I sent Friday II ith the captain's mate
to the boat. with orders to secure her. and bring an ay the oars
and sails. which the3 did: and by and by three straggling
men. that were (happily for them) parted from the. rest. came
back upon hearing the "'lllls tired. and seeing the captain. who
before. was their prisoner. now their conqueror, they submitted
to be. bound also . and so our victory was complete.

It IIIIII remained that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances: I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment; and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and. indeed. as
my story is a whole collection of wonders,- it affected him
deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and
how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save
his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a
word more. After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just
where I came out, viz. at the top of the house, where l refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the
contrivances I had made, during my long, long inhabiting that
ilace.

' All I showed them, all I said to them. was perfectly amazing:
but. above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees.
which, having been now planted near twenty years. and the
trees growing much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in any part of it,
but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding
passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my residence.
but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have.
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him
that too another time: but at present our business was to con-
sider how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that;
but told me, he was perfectly at a less what measures to take,
for thatthere were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who _
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all
forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by
desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were
subdued, they would be brought to the gallows. as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies; and that,
therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a
number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something
was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on
board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their
landing upon us. and destroying us. Upon this, it presently
occurred to me. that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering
what was become of their comrades, and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat. to look for them ;
and that then, perhaps. they might come armed. and be too
strong for us: this he allowed to be rational. 'Upon this, I told
him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which
la upon the beach, so that they might not carry her 011': and
taiing every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim: accordingly we went on board, took the arms
which were left on board out of her. and whatever else we found
there. which was a bottle of brandy. and another of rum. a few
biscuit-cakes. a horn of powder. and a great lump of sugar in
a piece of canvass (the sugar was tive or six pounds) : all which
was very welcome to me. especially the brandy and sugar. of
which I had none left for manv years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars.
mast. sail and rudder of the boat were carried away before. as
above). we knocked it great hole in her bottom. that if they had
come strong enough to master as. yet they could not carry all
the boat. Indeed. it was not lunch in my thoughts that we
could be able to recover the ship: but my view was. that if
they went away without the boat. I did not much question to
make her tit again to carry us to the Leeward Islands. and call
upon our friends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them
still in my thoughts. .

"'hile we were thus preparing our designs. and had first. by
main strength. heaved the boat upon the beach so high. that
the tide would not lloat her all' at high water mark. and besides.
had broke a hole in her bottom too big to he quickly stopped.
and were set down musing what we should do. we heard the
ship tire a gun. and saw her make a waft with her ensign as a
signal for the boat to come on board: but no boat stirred : and
they tired several times. making other signals for the. boat. At
last. when all their signals and tiring proved fruitless. and they
t'ouml the boat did not stir. we saw them. by the help of my
glasses. hoist another boat out. aml row towards the shore:
and we found. as they approached. that there were no less than
ten men in her. and that they had tire arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the. shore. we had
a full view of them as they came. and a plain sight even of
their faces; because the tide having set them a little to the east
of the. other hot". they rowed up under shore. to come to the
some place where the other had landed. and where the. boat
lay: by this means. I say. we had a full view of them. and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the
boat. of whom. he said. there were three very honest fellows.
who. he was sure. were led into this conspiracy by the rest.
being overpowered and frightened: but that as for the boat-
swain. who. it seems. was the chief ollicer among them. and
all the rest. they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew.
and were. no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise;
and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be. too
powerful for us. I smiled at him. and told him that men in
our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing
almost every condition that could be was better than that which
we were supposed to be, in. we ought to expect that the con.
sequence. whether death or life. would be sure to be a deliver-
ance. I asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my
life. and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for!
And where. sir. said I. is your belief ot' my being preserved
here. on purpose to save your life. which elevated you a little
while ago: for my part. said I. there seems to me but one thing
amiss in all the prospect at it. What is that! says lte. Why.
said I. it is. that as you say there are three or four honest
t'ellows among them. which should be spared. had they been
all of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God's
providence had singled them out to deliver them into your
hands; for depend upon it. every man that comes ashore are
our own. and shall die or live as they behave to us. As [spoke
this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance. I found it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.

We had. upon the tirst appearance of the boat's conuug from
the ship. musidered of separating our prisoners: aml we had.
indeed. secured them etl'ectually. Two of them. of whom the
captain was less assured than ordinary. I sent with Friday. and
one of the three delivered men. to my cave. where othey were
remote enough. aml out ot'dauger of being heard or discovered.
or of finding their way out of the woods it' they could have
delivered themselves: here they left them bound. but gave
them provisions: and promised them. it' they continued there
quietly. to give them their liberty in a day or two; but that it"
they attempted their escape. they should be put to death without
mercy. They promised faithfully to hear their confinement
With patience. and were very thankful that they had such good
usage as to have provisions and light left them: for Friday
gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their com.
fort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over
them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were
kept pinioned. indeed. because the enptain was not free to trust
them ; but the other two were taken into my service. upon the
captain's recommemlation. and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us; so with them and the three honest
men we were seven men well armed: and I made no doubt we
should be able to deal well enough with the tea that were
coming. considering that the captain had said there were three
or four honest men among them also. As soon as they got to
the place where their other boat lay. they run their boat into
the beach. and came all on shore. hauling the boat up after
them. which i was glad to see: for l was afraid they would
rather have left the host at an anchor. some distance from the
shore. with some. hands in her. to guard her. and so we should
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore. the first thing
they did. they ran all to their other boat: and it was easy to
see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped. as
above. of all that was in her. and a great hole in her bottom.

After they had mused a while upon this. they set up two or
n :t
three great shouts. hallooing with all their might, to try if
they could make their companions bear; but all was to no
purpose: then they came all close in a ring. and fired a volley
of their small arms, which. indeed. we heard. and the echoes
made the woods ring; but it was all one; those in the cave we
were sure could not hear. and those in our keeping. though
they heard it well enough. yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this. that. as they
told us afterwards. they resolved to go all on board again. to
their ship. and let them know that the men were all mur-
dered. and the long--boat staved; accordingly. they immedi-
ately launched their boat again. and got all ot'them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this. believing they would go on board the ship again. and set
sail. giving their comrades over for lost. and so he should still
lose the ship. which he was in hopes we should have recovered :
but he was quickly as much frightened the other way.

They had not been long put otl' with the boat. but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct. which it seems they consulted toge-
ther upon. viz. to leave three men in the boat. and the rest to
go on shore. and go up into the country to look for their
fellows. This was a great disappointment to us. for now we
were at a loss what to do; as our seizing those seven men on
shore would he no advantage to us. if we let the boat escape;
because they would then row away to the ship. and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail. and so our
recovering the ship would be lost. However. we had no remedy
but to wait and see what the issue of things might present. The
seven men came on shore. and the three who remained in the
boat put her off to a good distance from the shore. and came to
an anchor to wait for them: so that it was impossible for us to
come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore, kept close
together. marching towards the top of the little hill under which
my habitation lay: and we could see them plainly. though they
could not perceive us. \Ve could have been very glad they
would have come. nearer to us, so that we might have fired at
them, or that they would have gone farther 011'. that we might
have come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of
the hill. where they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods. which lay towards the north-east part. and where the
island lay lowest. they shouted and hallooed till they were
weary : and not caring. it seems. to venture far from the shore.
nor far from one another, they sat down together under a tree.
to copsider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone. to sleep
there. as the other part of them had done. they had done the
job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger
to venture to go to sleep. though they could not tell what the
danger was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley
again, to endeavour to make their fel ows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their
pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and
we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal,
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up
to them before they could load their pieces again. But this
event did not happen; and we lay still a long time. very irre-
solute what course to take. At length I told them there would
be nothing done, in my opinion, till night: and then. if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get
between them and the shore, and so might use some stratagem
with them in the boat to get them on shore. \Ve waited a great
while. though very impatient for their removing; and were
very uneasy, when. after long consultations, we saw them all
start up, and march down towards the sea: it seems they had
such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship again. give
their companions over for lost. and so go on with their intended
voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I ima-
gined it to be, as it really was. that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again: and the captain. as
soon as I told him in thoughts, was ready to sink at the appre-
hensions of it: but presently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle. I
ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came an
shore when Friday was rescued. and as soon as they came to
a little rising ground. at about half a mile distance, I bade
them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the
seamen answer them, they should return it again; and then
keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the
others hallooed, to draw them as farinto the island, and among
the woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me, by
such ways as I directed them.

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate
hallooed: and they presently heard them, and answering, run
along the shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when
they were presently stopped by the creek. where the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to
come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. 'V hen
they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being
gone a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour
within the land. they took one of the three men out of her, to
go along with them, and left onl two in the boat. having
fastened her to the stump of a litt e tree on the shore. This
was what I wished for: and immediately leaving Frida and
the captain's mate to their business. I took the rest wi me.
and crossing the creek out of their sight. we surprised the two
men before they were aware: one of them lying on the shore.
and the other being in the boat. The fellow on shore was
between sleeping and waking. and going to start up ; the cap-
tain. who was foremost. ran in upon him. and knocked him
down: aml then called out to him in the boat to yield. or he
was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to per-
suade a single man to yield. when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down; besides. this was. it seems.
one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the
rest of the crew. and therefore was easily persuaded not only
to yield. but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In the
mean time. Friday and the captain's mate so well managed
their business with the. rest. that they drew them. by hallooing
and answering. from one hill to another. and from one. wood to
another. till they not only heartily tired them. but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and. indeed. they were heartily tired
themselves also. by the time they came back to us.

\Ve had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark.
and to fall upon them. so as to make sure. work with them. It
was several hours after Friday came back to me. before they
came back to their boat: and we could hear the foremost of
them. long before they came. quite up. calling to those behind
to come along ; and could also hear them answer. and complain
how lame and tired they were. and not able to come any faster;
which was very Welcome news to us. At length they came up
to the boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion
when they found the boat fast aground in the creek. the tide
ebbed out. and their two men gone. \Ve could hear them call
to one another in a most lamentable manner. telling one another
they were got into an enchanted island; that either there were
inhabitants in it. and they should all be murdered. or else there
were devils and spirits in it. and they should be all carried
away and devoured. They hallooed again. and called their
two comrades by their names a great many times; but no
answer. After some time. we could see them. by the little
light there was. run about. wringing their hands like men in
despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down in
the boat, to rest themselves : then come ashore again. and walk
about again. and so the same thing over again. My men would
fain have. had me. give them leave to fall upon them at once in
the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage,
so to spare them. and kill as few of them as leould ; and espe-
cially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men.
knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to wait.
to see if they did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure of
them. I drew my ambuscade 'nearer. and ordered Friday and
the captain to creep upon their hands and feet. as close to the
ground as they could, that they might not be discovered. and
get as near them as they could possibly. before they oli'ered to
tire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain.
who was the principal ringleader ot' the mutiny. and had now
shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest.
came walking towards them. with two more of the crew: the
captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much in
his power. that he could hardly have patience to let him come
so near as to be sure of him. for they only heard his tongue
before: but when they came nearer, the ca tain and Friday.
starting up on their feet, let fly at them. he hoatswain was
killed upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and
fell just by him. though he did not die. till an hour or two after;
and the third ran t'orit. At the noise of the tire. I immediately
advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz.
myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the
captain and his two men. and the three prisoners of war. whom
we had trusted with arms. We came upon them. indeed. in
the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I made
the man they had left in the boat. who was now one of us. to
call them I) name. to try if I could bring them to a parley.
and so mig it perhaps reduce them to terms; which fell out
just as we desired: for. indeed it was easy to think. as their
condition then was. they would be very willing to capitulate.
So he calls out, as loud as he could. to one of them. Tom
Smith! Tom Smith! Tom Smith answered immediately. Is
that Robinson? For it seems. he knew the voice. The other
answered. Ay. ay: for God's sake. Tom Smith. throw down

our arms and yield. or you are all dead men this moment.--
he must we yield to! Where are they? says Smith again.
Here they are. says he; here's our captain and fifty men with
him. have been hunting you these two hours: the boatswain is
killed. Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and it' you
do not yield. you are all lost.---\Vill they give us quarter then '.'
says Tom Smith. and we will yield.---l will go ask. it' you pro-
mise to yield. save Robinson: so he asked the captain; and
the captain himself then calls out. You, Smith. you know my
voice; if on lay down your arms immediately, and submit.-
you shall liave your lives, all but Will Atkins.
 

SECTION XXVII.

ATKINS ENTREATS THE CAPTAIN TO SPARE ms I.lFE.--TllPS LATTILR RECOVERS
HIS VLSSISL FRO)! TIIF. JIUTINEERS,---A.\'D ROBINSON Ll-ZAVIS THE ISLAND.

UPON this Will Atkins cried out, For God's sake, captain.
give me quarter; what have I done? They have all been as
bad as I: which, by the way, was not true neither; for, it
seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the
captain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously.
in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. How-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at dis-
cretion, and trust to the governor's mercy: by which he meant
me, for they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid
down their arms, and begged their lives; and I sent the man
that had parleyed with them, and two more,who bound them all;
and then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly with
those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon
them, and ,upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one
more out of sight for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with him, and at length upon the further wickedness
of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As
for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but the
commander's of the island ; that they thought they had set him
on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased
God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the
governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all
there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
manded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the mornin .

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet it had its
desired efl'eet: Atkins fell upon his knees. to beg the captain
to intercede with the governor for his life: and all the rest
begged of him. for God's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.

It now occurred to me. that the time of our deliverance was
come. and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship; so I
retired in the dark from them. that they might not see what
kind of a governor they had. and called the captain to me:
when I called. as at a good distance. one of the men was ordered
to speak again. and say to the captain. Captain. the commander
calls for you ; and presently the captain replied. Tell his excel-
leney I am just a coming. This more perfectly amused them.
and they all believed that the commander was just by with his
fifty men. Upon the captain's coming to me. I told him m
project for seizing the ship. which he liked wonderfully wel .
and resolved to put it in execution the next morning. But. in
order to execute it with more. art. and to be secure of success.
I told him we must divide. the prisoners. and that he should go
and take Atkins, aml two more of the worst of them, and send
them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was com-
mitted to Friday. and the two men who came on shore with the
captain. They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison: and
it was. indeed. a dismal place. especially to men in their con-
dition. The others I ordered to my bower. as I called it. of
which I have given a full description : and as it was fenced in.
and they pinioned. the place. was secure enough. considering
they were upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word. to try them. and tell me
whether he thought they might he trusted or no to go on board
and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him. of the condition they were brought to. and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the pre-
sent action. yet that if they were sent to England, they would
all be hanged in chains, to be sure: but that if they would join
in so just an attempt as to recover the ship. he would have the
governor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would he
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down .on their
knees to the captain. and promised. with the deepest Impreca-
tions. that the would be faithful to him to the last drop. and
that they shou d owe their lives to him. and would go with him
all over the world; that they would own him as a father as long
as they lived. Well, says the. captain. I must go and tell the
governor "hat you am. and see what I can do to bring him to
consent to it. So he. brought me an account ot' the temper he.
found them in. and that he verilv believed they would he faith-
lnl. However. that we might he very secure. I told him he
should go back again and choose out those live. and tell them.
that they might see IIII did not want IIIIIII. that he would take.
out those tiI II to be his assistants. and that the governor would
keep the other two. and the. three that were sent prisoners to
the castle (IIIII cave) as hostages for the tidelitI' of those fiI-III,
and that if tlIeI proI ed unfaithful in tho eIecution. the. live.
hostages should be hanged III chains alive on the shore. This
looked severe. and conIinced them that the governor was in
earnest: however. they had no way left them but to accept it ;
and it II as now the business of the prisoners. as much as of the
captain. to persuade the other the to do their tilll\'.

Our strength II as now thus ordered for the expedition. . first.
the. captain. his mate and passenger . second. the two prisoners
of the first gang. to II honI. having their charact ter from the
captain. I had given their libertII . and trusted them with arms:

pinioned. but. on the captains motion. had now released:
tonrth. these the released at lastI . so that they II ere tw'elI'e III
all. besides ith' we kept prisoners in the cave t'or hostages.

I asked the captain if he II as willing to venture with these
bands on board the ship: but as for IIIII and my man Friday. I
did not think it was proper for us to stir. having seven men left
behind . and it was emploIIuent enough for us to keep them
asunder. and supply them with I-ietunls. As to the five in the
cow. I resolved to keep them fast. but Friday went in twice
II day to them. to supply them with necessaries: and I made.
the other two carry provisions to a certain distance. where
Friday II as to take it.

\\ lien I showed IIII self to the two hostages. It was with the

Iaptain. who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look alter them: and that it was the goII'ernors
pleasure they should not stir any where but by InI' direction:
that it theI' did. they would be fetched into the castle and be
laid III irons: so that as II II neI er snllered them to see me as a
governor. I now appeared as another person. and spoke of
the governor. the garrison. the castle. and the like. upon all
occasions.

The captain now had no diflicultv before him. but to furnish
his two boats. stop the breach ot one. and man them. lle made.
his passenger captain ot one. II Ith tour ot the. men: and him-
sell. his mate. and the more. went in the other: and they con-
trived their business Iery well. for theI' came up to the. ship
about midnight. As soon as flow came. within call ot the ship.
he made Robinson hail them. aiId tell them tlIeII had brought
0!! the men and the boat but that it was a loiig time before
they had found them, and the like. holding them in a chat till
they came to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate
entering first. with their arms. immediately knocked down the
second mate. and carpenter with the butt end of their muskets.
being very faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all
the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks. and began
to fasten the hatches. to keep them down that were below:
when the other boat and their men entering at the fore-chains.
secured the forecastle of the ship. and the scuttle which went
down into the cook-room. making three men they found there
prisoners. When this was done. and all safe upon deck. the
captain ordered the mate. with three men. to break into the
round-house. where the new rebel captain lay. who having
taken the alarm. had got up. and with two men and a boy had
got fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate. with a crow.
split open the door, the new captain and his men tired boldl
among them. and wounded the mate with a musket ball. whic
broke his arm. and wounded two more of the men. but killed
nobody. The mate calling for help. rushed. however. into the
round-house. wounded as he was. and with his pistol shot the
new captain through the head. the bullet entering at his mouth.
and came. out again behind one of his ears. so that he never
spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded. and the ship
was taken effectually. without any more lives lost.

As soon as the sln ) was thus secured. the captain ordered
seven guns to be fire . which was the signal agreed upon with
me to give me notice of his success. which you may be sure I
was very glad to hear. having sat watching upon the shore for
it till near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the
signal plainly. I laid me down; and it having been a day of
great fatigue to me. I slept very sound. till I was something
surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up.
I heard a man call me by the name of Governor. Governor.
and presently I knew the captain's voice; when climbing up
to the top of the hill. there he stood. and pointing to the ship.
be embraced me in his arms. My dear friend and deliverer.
says he. there's your ship. for she is all your's. and so are we.
and all that belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship. and
there she rode within little more than half smile of the shore:
for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters
of her. and the weather being fair. had brought her to an anchor
just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being
up. the ca tain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I at rst lauded my rails. and so landed just at my door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise: for I saw
my deliverance. indeed. visibly put into my hands. all things
easy, and a la ship just ready to carry me awa whither I
pleased to go. ttirst. for some time, I was not ab e to answer

iim one word; but as he had taken me in his arms. I held fast
III him. or I should haIII fallen to the ground. lle perceived
the surprise. and inInIediatelI pulls a bottle out ot his pocket.
and gave me a drum of cordial. which he had brought on pur-
pose for me. Alter I had drank it. I sat down upon the ground' .
and though it brought me to my self. Ict it was It good while
before I could speal. a II III-d to him. All this time the poor
IIIIIII was in as great IIII ecstasy as I. only not under auI sur-
prise as I II as . and he said II thousand Kind and tender things
to me. to cIIIIIpose and bring me to my selt': but such was the
flood of on in IIII breast. that it put all my spirits into coutu--
sion; at last it broke out into tears: and in II little while utter
I recoIered IIII speech. I then took my turn. and embraced
him as IIII IleliIII-rer. and wer rejoiced together. I told him I
looked upon him as II Iuan sent from Heaven to IleliIer Inc.
and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain III wonders:

\\ hen we had talked II while the captain told me he had
lIIought me some little relresluuent. such as the ship allorded.
and such as the II retehes that had been so long I his masters had
not plundered lIiIu ot'. Upon this he called aloud to the boat.
and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the
governor; and. indeed it II as a present as it' I had been one
that was not to he Iarried aII III II Ith them. but asil' I had been
to do ell upon the island still. First. he had brought me a case

a bo\' of flour, a bag tull ot lemons. and two bottles of lime

what was a thousand times more useful to me. he brought me
si\ new clean shirts. sis IIIIrI good ueelII-loths. two pair of

II very good suit of clothes of his own. which had been worn

in the world of that kind so unpleasant. awkward and uneasy .
as it uas to me to II II Ir such clothes at first.
After these ceremonies were past. and after all his good
things were. brought into my little apartment. we began to
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had ; for it
was worth considering- whether we might venture. to take them
away with us or an. especially two ot'them. whom he knew to
he incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the cap-
tain said he knew thev were such rogues. that there was no
obliging them; and it' he. did carry them away. it must be in
irons. as malet'aetors. to be delivered over tojustice at the. first
English colony he could come at : and I found that the captain
himselt' was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him. that
it' he desired it. I would mulertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to nmke it their own request that he should leave them
upon the island. I should he very glad of that. says "W cap-
tain. with all my heart.---\\'ell. says I. I will send for them up.
and talk with them for you. So I caused Friday and the two
hostages. for they were now discharged. their comrades having
performed their promise; I say. I caused them to go to the
cave. and bring up the tire men. pinioned as they were. to the
bower. and keep them there till I came. After some time. I
came. thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called
governor again. Being all met. and the captain with me. I
caused the men to be brought before me. and I told them I had
got a full account of their villanons behaviour to the captain.
and how they had run away with the ship. and were preparing
to commit farther robberies. but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways. and that they were fallen into the pit
which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my
direction the ship had been seized: that she lay now in the
road: and they might see. by and by. that their new captain
had received the reward of his villany. and that they would
see him hanging at the yard-arm : that as to them. I wanted to
know what they had to say why I should not execute them as
pirates. taken in the fact. as by my commission they could not
doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest. that they had
nothing to say but this. that when they were taken. the captain
promised them their lives. and they humbly implored my
mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them :
for as for myself. I had resolved to quit the island with all my
men. and had taken passage with the captain to go for England ;
and as for the captain. he could not carry them to England
other than as prisoners. in irons. to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the. ship: the consequence of which. they
must needs know. would be the gallows; so that I could not
tell what was best for them. unless they had a mind to take
their fate in the island ; if they desired that. as I had liberty to
leave the island. I had some inclination to give them their lives.
if they thought they could shift 0n shore. They seemed very
thankful for it. and said they would much rather venture to
stay there than he. carried to England to be hanged: so I lefl
it on that issue.

l-lowever. the captain seemed to make some difiicnlty of it.
as if he durst not leave thent there. Upon this I scented a little
angry with the captain. and told him that they were my
prisoners. not his: and that seeing I had otl'ered them so much
favour. I would he as good as my word: and that it' he did not
think tit to consent to it I would set them at liberty. as l timml
them: and it' he did not like it. he might take them again if he
could catch them. Upon this they appeared very thankful.
and l accordingly set them at liberty. and hade them retire into
the woods to the place whence they came. and I would leave
them some tire-arms. some ammunition. and some directions
how they should live very well. it' they thought tit. Upon this
I prepared to go on board the ship: but told the captain I
would stay that night to prepare my things. and desired him to
go on board. in the mean time. and keep all right in the ship.
and semi the host on shore next day for me: ordering him. at
all events. to cause the new captain. who was killed. to be
hanged at the yard-arm. that these men might see him.

When the captain was gone. I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment. and entered seriously into discourse with them
on their circumstances. I told them I thought they had made
a right choice: that it' the 'aptnin had carried them away. they
would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain
Imaging at the yard-arm of the ship. and told theta they had
nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay. I then
told them I would let them into the story of my living there.
and put them into the way of making it easy to them : accord-
ingly. I gave them the whole history of the place. and of my
coming to it: showed them my flirtitications. the way I made
In bread. planted my corn. cured my grapes: and. in a word.
al that was necessary to make. them easy. I told them the
story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected.
for whont I left a letter. and made them promise to treat them
in mmmon with themselves. Here it may be noted. that the
captain had ink on board. who was greatly surprised that I
never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water. or
of something else. as I had done. things much more. ditlicult.

I left them my tirecarms. viz. tive nmskets. three t'owling-
pieces. and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of
powder left: for after the first year or two I used but little.
and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I
managed the goats. and directions to milk and t'atten them. and
to make both butter and cheese: in a word. I gave them every
part of my own story ; and told them l should prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more. and
some garden seeds. which I told them I would have been very
glad of: also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain
had brought me to eat. and bade them be sure to sow and
increase them.

Having done all this. I left them the next day. and went on
board the ship. We. prepared immediately to sail. but did not
weigh that night. The next morning early. two of the five men
cmne swimming to the ship's side. and making a most lament-
able complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the
ship. for God's sake. for they should be murdered. and begged
the captain to take them on board. though he hanged them
immediately. Upon this. the captain pretended to have no
power without me; but after some ditlicul , and utter their
solemn promises of amendment. they were to en on board. and
were some time afler soundly whipped and pickled: after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.

home. time after this. the boat was ordered on shore. the tide
being up. with the things promised to the. men; to which the
captain. at my intercession. caused their chests and clothes to
be added, which they took. and were. very thankful for. [also
encouraged them. by telling them that if it lay in my power to
semi any vessel to take them in. I would not forget them.

When I tool: leave of this island. I carried on board. for
reliques. the great goat-skin cap I had made. mv umbrella.
and one of my parrots: also I forgot not to take the mone I
formerly mentioned. which had lain by me so long useless. t at
it was grown rusty or tarnished. aml could hardly was for
silver. till it had been a little rubbed and handled: as also the
money I fouml in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I
left the island. the ltlth of December. as I found by the ship's
account. in the year ltitlti, after I had been upon it eight-and-
twenty years. two months. and nineteen days: being delivered
from this second captivity the same day of the mouth that I first
made. my escape in the. long-boat. from among the Moors of
Sallee. In this vessel. after a long voyage. I arrived in Eng-
land the. llth of J une, in the year [687. having been thirty-five
years absent.

"7 Ill-1N I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all
the world as if 1 had never been known there. My benefactor
and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in trust with.
was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was

I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her 1
would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude
for her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my
little stock would afford; which, at that time, would indeed
allow me to do but little for her; but I assured her I would
never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her
when I had suflicieut to help her, as shall he observed in its
proper place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my
father and mother were dead, and all the family extinct, except
that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my
brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead.
there had been no provision made for me: so that, in a word,
I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the
world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had
so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship

I had made IIII will. and had inade him. the. Portuguese

He told IIIII that was true: but that as there was no proof of
my being dead. he could not act as executor. until some cer-
tain account should come of my d Iath: and. besides. he was
not willing to intermcddlc with a thing so remote: that it was
true he had registered IIIII IIill and put in his elaiu : and could

\tter ra t'eIII IlaIs t'aIther conference II ith this ancient friend.
he brought me an account of the first si\ IIIIars income. of my
plantation. signed by my partner and the merchant trustees.
being alII'IaIs delivered in goods. viz. tobacco III roll. and sugar
in chests besides rIIuI. molasses. C\c. II hII b Is the consequence
ot a sIIgIIr-IIork: and I found. by this account that every year
theincomecoIII-IiderablII' Increased. but. asaboIe. thedisburse-
ments being large. the sum at first II as small: lIoII'IeI er. the.
old man let me see that he II as debtor to Inc four hundred and
sweaty moidores of gold. besides sixty chests of sugar. and
fifteen double rolls of tobacco. which were lost in his ship; he
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon. about eleven
years after my leaving the place. The good man then began
to complain of his misfortunes, mul how he had been obliged to
make use of my money to recover his losses. and buy him a
share in a new ship. However. my old friend. says be. you
shall not want a supplv in your necessity ; and as soon as my
son returns. you shall be fully satisfied. Upon this. he pulls
out an old pouch. and gives me one hundred and sixty Portu-
gal Iuoidores in gold; and giving the writings of his title to the
ship. which his son was gone to the Brazils in. of which he was
a quarter part owner. and his son another. he puts them both
into my hands. for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the. honesty and kindness of the
poor man to be able to hear this; and remembering what he
had done for me. how he hml taken me up at sea. and how
generously he. had used me on all occasions. and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me. I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if
his circumstam'es admitted him to spare so much money at that
time. and if it would not straiteu him! He. told me he could
not say but it might straiteu him a little; but. however. it was
my money. and I might want it more. than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of all'mttion. and l
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short. I took
one hundred of the moidores. and called for a pen and ink to
give him a receipt for them: then I returned him the rest, and
told him if ever I had possession of the plantation. I would
return the other to him also (as. indeed. [afterwards did):
and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship. I
would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the
money. I found he was honest enough to pay me: aml if I did
not. but came. to receive what he gave me. reason to expect. I
Would never have a penny more from him.

When this was past. the old man asked me if he. should put
me into a method to make my claim to mv plantation! I told
him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so.
if I pleased; but that if I did not. there were ways enough to
secure my right. and immediately to appropriate the profits to
my use: and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon Just
ready to go away to Brazil. he made me enter my name in a
public register. with his affidavit. allinning. upon oath. that I
was alive. and that l was the same person who took up the
land for the planting the said plantation at first. This being
regularly attested by a notary. and a procuration allixed. he
directed me. to send it, with a letter of his writing. to a mer-
chant of his acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.

Never was any thing more honourable than the proceedings

for the remainder of my life. To this I added u very haml-
some present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daugh-
ters. for such the captain's son informed me he had: with two
pieces of tine English broad-cloth. the best I could get in
Lisbon. tive pieces of black baize. and some Flanders lace ot' a
good value.

Having thus settled mv atl'airs. sold my cargo. and turned
all my etl'ects into good hills of exchange. my next dilliculty
was. which way to go to England: I had been lu-custonn-d
enough to the sea. am! yet I had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time: and though I could give no
reason for it. yet the ditliculty increased upon me so much.
that though I had once shipped my baggage. in order to go.
yet I altered my mind. and that not once. but two or three
times.

It is true. I had been very untbrtunato bv sea. aml this
might be some of the reasons: but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases ot'such moment : two ot'
the ships which I had singled out to go in. I mean more par-
ticalarly singled out than any other. having put my things on
board one of them. aml in the other to have agreed with the
captain; I sa '. two of these ships miscarried. viz. one was
taken by the Algerines. and the other was cast away on the
Start, near 'I'orbay. and all the people drowned. except three;
so that in either ot'those vessels I had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts. my old pilot. to
whom I couuuanieated every thing. pressed me earnestly not
to go by sea. but either to go by land to the. Groyne (Cornnna).
and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle. from whence it
was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris. and so to

lalais and Dover: or to go up to Madrid. and so all the way
by land through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed
against my going by sea at all, escept from Calais to Dover.
that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which. as I was
not in haste. and did not value the charge. was by much the
pleasanter way: and to make it more so. my old captain
brought an English gentleman. the son of a merchant in Lisbon.
who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up
two more English merchants also. and two young Portuguese
gentlemen. the. last going to Paris only: so that in all there
were sis of us. and live. servants: the tho merchants and the
two Portuguese contenting themselIes with one serIant be-
tween two to save the charge. . and as for me. [got an English
sailor to travel with me as II serI ant. besides my man Friday.
who was too much II stranger to be. 'IIpablc of supplying the
place of II servant on the road.

III this manner I set out trom Lisbon: and our company
being \'('I'_\ well mounted and armed. we made II little troop.
II hereot tIIIII' did IIIII the honour to call Inc captain. as well
because. I was the oldest man. as because I had two servants.
and. indeed. II as the original of the whole' 3onrncv

As I lIIIIe troubled you with none III mII sIIII ionrnals. so I
shall trouble IIoII now with none of an land ionrnal; but
some IIIIIII ntures that happened to us in this tedious and diffi-
cult JOIII'III'\ I must not omit.

W hen we came to Madrid we being all of us strangers to
Spain. were willing.r to stay sometime to see the court of Spain.
and to see what was worth observingI . but it being the latter
part of the summer. we hastened awaI. and set out from Ma-
drid about the middle of October; but when we came to the.
edge of Navarre. we were alarmed. at several towns on the
way. with IIII account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains. that several travellers were
obliged to come back to Pampelnna. after having attempted.
at IIII extreme hazard. to pass IIII.

\Vhen we came to Pampelnna itself. we found it so. indeed;
IIIIII to me. that had been always used to a hot climate. and to
countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on. the cold
was insnll'erable: nor. indeed. was it more painful than sur-
prising. to come. but ten IIIII's before out of Old Castile. where
the weather was not onlv warm. but very hot. and immediatelv
to feel a wind from the I'yrenean mountains so very keen. so
seII erelv cold. as to be intolerable. and to endanger bennmbing
and perisbing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Fridav was really frightened when he saw the. moun-
tains all covered with snow. and felt cold weather. which he
had never seen or felt before' In his life. To mend the matter.
when we came. to I'ampelnna. it continued snowing with so
much violence. and so long. that the. people said winter was
come. before its time . and the roads. which were ditlicnlt be--
fore. were noIvI quite impassable; for. III a word. the snow la}I
in some places too thick for us to travel. and being not hard
frozen. as is the case in the. northern countries. there was no
going without being III danger of being buried alive every step.
\Ve staI ed no less than twenty days at Pampelnna; II hen seeing
the winter coming on. and no likelihood of its being better. for
it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known
in the memory of man. i proposed that we should all go awa
to Fontarabia. and there take. shipping for Bourdeaux, whicli
was a very little voyage. But while I was considering this,
there came in four French gentlemen. who having been stopped
on the French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish.
had found out a guide. who, traversing the country near the
head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by
such ways, that they were not much incommoded with the
snow: for where they met with snow in any quantity. they
said it was frosen hard enough to hear them and their horses.
"he sent for this guide. who told us he would undertake to
carry us the same wa with no hazard from the snow. provided
we were armed su ciently to protect ourselves from wild
beasts; for. he said. upon these great snows it was frequent
for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the moun-
tains. being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being
covered with snow. \Ve told him we were well enough pre-
pared for such creatures as they were. if he would insure us
from a kind of two-legged wolves. which. we were told. we
were. in most danger from, especially on the French side of the
mountains. He satisfied as that there was no danger of that
kind in the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed to
follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with their
servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said. had
attempted to go. and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Palnpeluna. with our guide,
on the l5th of November; and. indeed, I was surprised, when,
instead of going forward. he came directly back with us on the
same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles;
when having passed two rivers, and come into the plain coun--
try, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the
country was pleasant. and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden
turning to his left, he approached the mountains another way:
and though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful,
yet he made so many tours, such meanders. and led us by such
winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the
mountains without being much encumbered with the snow;

ad, all on a sudden, he showed us the pleasant fruitful pro~
eiaces of Languedoc and Gascony, all (green and flourishing.
though, indeed, at a great distance, an we had some rough
way to pass still.

We were a little uneas . however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a nig t so fast. that we could not travel;
but he bid as be easy; we should soon be past it all: we found,
indeed, that we began to descend every day. and to come more
north than before; and so depending upon our guide, we
went on.
 

SECTION XXIX.

FRIDAY'S ENCOUNTER WITH A BEAR.---ROBINSON AND "IS FELLOW TRAVELLERS
ATTACKED BY A FIDCK 0F \VOLVES.--IIIS ARRANGEMENT 01" ms AFFAIRS,
AND MARRIAGE AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND.

IT was about two hours before night, when our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood; two of the wolves made at the
guide, and had he been far before us, he would have been de-
voured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened
upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that vio-
lence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to
draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.
My man Friday being next me, I bade him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight 'of the
- man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, 0 master! 0 master!
but, like a hold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, "
with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him, in the heal and
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Fridafl" ,'.
for he having been used to such creatures in his country, "he
had no fear upon him, .but went close up to him and shot him,
as above; whereas, any other of us would have fired at a farther
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endan-
gered shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I;
and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal
howling of wolves; and the noise. redoubled by the echo of
the mountains. appeared to us as if there. had been a prodigious
number of them ; and perhaps there was not such a tew as that
we had no cause of apprehensions: however. as Friday luul
killed this Wolf. the other that had fastened upon the horse left
him iuunediately, and fled. without doing him any damage.
having happily fastened upon his head. where the bosses of the
bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt:
for the raging creature had hit him twice. once in the arm. and
the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made
some defiance. he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disprder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the
we I'.

It is eas to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all Illt'lltlt't our pace. and rode up as fast as the way. which
was very ditlieult. would give us leave. to see what was the
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded
us before. we saw clearly what had been the case. and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide. though we did not pre-
sently discern what kiml of creature it was he had killed.

lint never was a tight managed so hardily. and in such a

surprising manner, as that which followed. between Friday and
the bear. which gave us all. though at first we were surprised
and afraid for him. the greatest diversion imaginable. As the.
bear is a heavy clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the
wolf does. who is swift and light. so he has two particular
qualities. which generally are the rule of his actions: first. as
to men. who are not his proper prey (he does not usually
attempt them. except they first attack him. unless he be ex-
cessive hungry. which it is probable might now be the case.
the ground being covered with snow). if on do not meddle
with him. he will not meddle with you; at then you must
take care to he ve civil to him. and give him the road. for he
is u very nice gent eman: he will not go a step out of his way
for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid. your best way is to
look another way. and keep going on: for sometimes if you
stop. and stand still. and look steadfastly at him. he takes it
for an ati'ront: but if you throw or toss any thing at him. and
:1 :. its him. though it were but a bit of stick as big as your
a. r. he thinks himself abused. and sets all other business
- 5= 3 to pursue his revenge. and will have satisfaction in point
ot aonour :--this is his first quality : the next is. if he be once
afl'ronted. be will never leave you. night nor day. till he has
his revenge. but follows, at a good round rate, till he over-
takes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide. and when we came
up to him. he was helping him oti' from his horse. for the man
was both hurt and frightened. when. on a sudden. we espied
the bear come out of the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was.

of the horses which made. the wolves so furious, seeing their
prey: and that at other times. they are really afraid ot a gun, .
but being excessive hungry. and raging on that account, the

danger; and that if we. had not. by the continued fire, and at

II hereas. had we been content to have sat still on horseback.
and fired as horsemen. they would not have taken the horses

wise; and withal they told us. that at last, if we had stood
altogether. and left our horses. they would have been so eager
to have. devoured them. that so might have come off safe.
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and being so
many in number. For my part. I was never so sensible of

SECTION XXX.

HE IS Skill-ID WITH A DFSIRE TO REVISIT HIS ISLAND--LOSES HIS WIFE--IS
TEMI'TED TO 60 '1'0 SEA AGAINo--T/tlil'is OUT A CARGO FOR ms COLONY.

I HAVE often heard persons of goodjudgment say, that all the
stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions, is
owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like : that people's
poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their de-
ceased friends, so realises it to them, that they are capable of
fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see
them, talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth,
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and they
really know nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people
after they are dead ; or whether there is any thing in the stories
they tell us of that kind, more than the product of vapours.
sick minds, and wandering fancies : but this I know, that my
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought me into
such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actu-
ally supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old castle,
behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and
the reprobate sailors I left upon the island; nay. I fancied I
talked with them, and looked at them steadily, though I was
broad awake, as at persons just before me; and this I did till
I often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented
to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the villany of the threeaoaIssos ('llt'h'ul-Z. 23.3

This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little
out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing;
I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with my-
self sedately, what business I had, after threescore years, and
after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed
in so happy and easy a manner; I say, what business had I to
rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only
for youth and poverty to run into ?

With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that
I had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child
of another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no
need to seek hazard for gain; that I was declining in years,
and ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained, than
of seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had said of
its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my
duty to go, I had no notion of that: so, after many of these
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagination,
reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people may always do
in like cases if they will: and, in a word, I conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my
thoughts, and which my present condition furnished me plenti-
fully with; and particularly, as the most efl'ectual method, I
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to engage in
some business that might effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for I found that thing return upon me
chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to do, nor any thing
of moment immediately before me. To this purpose I bought
a little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved to remove
myself thither. I had a little convenient house upon it; and
the land about it, I found, was capable of great improvement;
and it was many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted
in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land; and
particularly, being an inland country, I was removed from con-
versing among sailors, and things relating to the remote parts
of the world.

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family,
bought me ploughs, barrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, and
sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became, in one half-year,
a mere country gentleman: my thoughts were entirely taken
up in managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing,
planting, &c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable
life that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always
bred to misfortunes was capable of of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land; -I had no rent to pay, was
limited by no articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased:
what I planted was for myself, and what I improved was for
my family ; and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering,
I had not the least discomfort in any part of life as to this
world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle state
of life which my father so earnestly recommended to me, and
lived a kind of heavenly life, something like what is described
by the poet, upon the subject of a country life-

" ---- Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen
| Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach
3: upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its conse-
' quences, into a deep relapse of the wandering disposition,
which, as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon
recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent
distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon me, so that
nothing could make any more impression upon me. This blow
was the loss of my wife. It is not my business here to write
an elegy upon my wife, give a character of her particular
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my
affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the engine that, by her
prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I was in, from
the most extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in my
head, as above, and did more to guide my rambling genius
than a mother' s tears, a father's instructions, a friend's counsel,
or all my own reasoning powers, could do. I was happy in
listening to her tears, and in being moved b her entreaties;
and to the last degree desolate and dislocate in the world by
the loss of her.

\Vhen she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round
me. I was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was
in the Brazils, when I first went on shore there; and as much
alone, except as to the assistance of servants, as I was in my
island. I knew neither what to think nor what to do. I saw
the world busy around me; one part labouring for bread,
another part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures,
equally miserable, because the end they proposed still fled
from them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of
their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance;
and the men of labour spent their strength in daily struggling
for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured with:
so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work,
and working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of
\bvearisome life, and a wearisome life the only occasiOn of daily

read.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island; where I suffered no more com to grow, because I did
not want it: and bred no more goats, because I had no more
use for them; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in
twenty years.
All these thinI . . had I improved them as I ought to have
done. and as reason and religion had dictated to me. would
haIIte ItInght me to sc: Irch farther than human enjoyments for a

thought I was much more suitably emploI ed when l was

Nothing can be a greater demonstration ot II future state.
and ot' the existence of IIII invisible world. than the concurrence
of second causes with the ideas of things which we form III our
minds. perfectly reserved. and not communicated to any in the
world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering
was returned upon Inc. and I knew nothing of what he had in
his thought to say. when that very morning. before. he came. to
IIIII. I had. in a greatdeI II ofconfnsion ot' thonght.and revolving
eIIIer_I part ot nIII circumstances in mv mind. come to this

III-solution. viz. that I would go to Lisbon. and consult with
my old sea-captain; and so, if it was rational and practicable.
I would go and see the island again. and see what was become
of my people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts
of peopling the place. and carrying inhabitants from hence.
getting a patent for the possession. and I knew not what;
when. in the middle of all this. in comes my nephew, as I have.
said. with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the
East Indies.

I paused awhile at his words. and. looking steadily at him.
What devil. said I. sent you on this unlucky errand! My
nephew stared. as if he had been frightened, at first; but per-
ceiving that I was not much displeased with the proposal, he
recovered himself. I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal.
sir, says he; I dare say you would be pleased to see your new
colony there. where you once reigned with more felicity than
most of your brother-monarchs in the world.

In a word. the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that
is to say. the prepossession I was under. and of which I have
said so much, that I told him. in a few words. if he agreed with
the merchants I Would go with him: but I told him I would not
promise to go any farther than my own island. Whv. sir. says
be. you don't want to be left there. again. I hope? Why. said
I. can you not take me up again on your return! He told me
it would not be possible to do so; that the merchants would
never allow him to come that way with a laden ship of such
value. it being a month's sail out of his way. and might be
three or four. Besides. sir. if I should miscarry, said he, and
not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the condi-
tion you were in before.

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for
it: which was. to carry a framed sloop on board the ship. which
being taken in pieces. and shipped on board the ship. might.
by the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with
us. be set up again in the island. and finished. fit to go to sea.
in a few days.

I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities of my
nephew joined so effectually with my inclination. that nothing
could oppose me; on the other hand. my wife being dead. I had
nobody concerning themselves so much for me as to persuade
me to one way or the other, except my ancient good friend the
widow. who eamestly struggled with me to consider my years.
my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a long
voyage; and. above all. my young children. But it was all
to no purposes-<<I had an irresistible desire to the voyage;
and I told her I thought there was something so uncommon '."
the impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage. that It
would be a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to
stay at home: after which she ceased her expostulations, and
joined with me, not Only in making provision for my voyage.

SECTION XXXI.

R031NSON'S SI"? RELIEVE? THE CREW OF A FRENCH VESSEL THAT HAD
CAUGHT FIRE.

WE set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a
very fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might
be about the 20th of February, in the evening late, when the
mate, having the watch, came into the round-house, and told
us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he
was telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain
heard another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-
deck, where, for a while, we heard nothing; but in a few minutes
we saw a very great light, and found that there was some very
terrible fire at a distance: immediately we had recourse to our
reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could be no land
that way in which the fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred
leagues, for it appeared at W. N.W. Upon this we concluded
it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our hearing the
noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could not be far
011', we stood directly towards it, and were presently satisfied
we should discover it, because, the farther we sailed, the greater
the light appeared; though, the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive any thing but the light for a while. In about half
an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us, though not much
of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we could plainly
discern that it was a great ship on fire, in the middle of the
sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not
at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it: I presently
recollected my former circntnstam'ea. and in what condition l
was in. when taken up by the Portuguese captain; aml how
nmeh more deplorable. the circumstances ot' the poor creatures
belonging to that ship must be. if they had no other ship in
company with thetn. Upon this. I immediately ordered that
tiw nus should be tired. one soon at'ter another: that. it'
possi "0. we might give. notice to them that there was help for
them at haml. and that they might endeavour to save themselves
in their boat: for though we eonld see the tlmnes ot' the ship.
yet they. it being night. could see nothing of as.

"'e lay by some. time upon this. only driving as the burning
ship drove. waiting for day-light; when. on a sudden. to our
great terror. though we had reason to expect it. the ship blew
up in the air; and innm-diately. that is to say. in a few minutes.
all the tire was out. that is to say. the rest ot' the ship sunk.
This was a terrible and indeed an atllietiug sight. for the sake
of the poor men ; who. I concluded. must he either all destroyed
in the ship. or he in the utmost distress in their boat. in the
middle ot'the ocean: whieh. at present. by reason it was dark.
I could not see. llowever. to direet them as well as l eonld.
I caused lights to he hung out in all the parts of the ship
where we could. aml which we had lanterns for. and kept
tiring gnus all the night long: letting them know. by this. that
there was a ship not far all.

About eight o'clock in the morning. we tlifl'tWt'l't'tl the ship's
boats by the help ot'onr perspective glasses; timml there were
two of them. both thronged with people. and deep in the water.
We percei\ ed they rowed. the wind being against tlu'm: that
they saw our ship. aad.did their utmost to make us see them.

We immediately spread our maeirut. to let them know we
saw them. aml hung a wall out. as a signal for them to come
on board : and then made more sail. standing directly to tlwtn.
lu little more than halt'an hour. we emne up with them: aml.
in a word. took them all in. being no less than sisty-timr men.
women. and ehildren: for there were a great many passengers.

Upon the whole. we t'ound it was a French merchant-ship of
three hundred tons. lmme-btmnd from Quebec. in the river of
Canada. The master gave as a long aeeonnt ot' the distress at
his ship: how the. tire began in the steerage. bv the negligence
of the steersnmn : but on his crying out for help. was. as every
body thought. entirely put out: but they soon found that some
sparks ot' the first tire had gotten into some part of the ship so
ditlienlt to come at. that they could not elli'ctually quench it;
and afterwards getting in between the timbers. and within the
ceiling of the ship. it pmceeded into the hold. aml mastered all
the skill aml all the. application they were able to exert.

They had no more to do then. but to get into their boats.
"bieh. to their great comfort. were pretty large; being their
long-boat. ntul a great slmllop. besides a small skill. whieh was

sorrow; some stark raving. and downright lunatic; some ran
about the ship stamping with their feet. others wringing their
hands; some were dancing. some singing. some laughing.
more crying; many quite dumb. not able to speak a word;
others sick and vomiting; several swmmiag. and ready to
faint; and a few were crossing themselves. and giving tlod
thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that
were tlmnkt'ul afterwards. but the passion was too strong for
them at first. and they were not able to toaster it: they were
thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy: and it was but a
verv few that were eomposed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps. also. the case may have some addition to it from
the particular circumstance ot'that nation they belonged to ; I
mean the French. whose temper is allowed to be more volatile.
more passionate. and more sprightly. and their spirits more
fluid. than in other nations. I am not philosopher enough to
determine the cause ; but nothing I had ever seen before cann-
np to it. The eestasies poor Friday. my trusty savage. was
in. when he found his father in the. boat. came the nearest to
it; aml the surprise of the master and his two companions.
whom I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in
the island. came a little way towards it; but nothing was to
compare to this. either that I saw in Friday, or any where else
in my life.

It is further observable. that these extrm-aganees did not
show themselvm. in that ditli'reut manner I have mentioned.
in ditl'cmnt persons only; but all the variety Wmlltl appear. in
a short succession of moments. in one and the same person. .\
man that we saw this minute dunnb. and as it were stupid and
eontimaded. would the next minute be dancing and hallooiag
like an antic; aml the nest moment he tearing his hair. or
pulling his clothes to pieces. mnl stinaping them under his
feet. like a madman; in a few moments after that. we. would
have him all in tears, then sick. swmming. and. had not inane-
diate help been had. he would in a few moments have been
dead : and thus it was. not with one or two. or ten or tWeuty.
but with the greatest part of tln-m: and. if! remember right.
our surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty of them.

There Were. two priests among them. one an old man. and
the other a young man; and that which was strangest was. the
oldest man was the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board
our ship. and saw himself safe. he dropped down stone-dead.
to all amwarance; not the least sign of life could be perceived
in him: our surgeon iInnn-diately applied proper remedies to
recover him. and was the only man in the ship that believed
he was not dead. At length he opened a vein in his arm.
having first ehat'ed and rubbed the part. so as to warm it as
much as possible: upon this the blood. which only dropped at
tirst. tlowing freely. in three minutes after the man Opened his
eyes I and a quarter of an hour after that he spoke. grew better,
and in a little time quite well. After the blood was stopped.
he walked about; told us he was perfectly well: took a dram
ot'eordial which the surgeon gave him. and was what we called
come to himself. About a quarter of an hour after this. they
came running into the cabin to the surgeon. who was bleeding
a French woman that had fainted. and told him the priest was
gone stark mad. It seems he had beg run to revolve the change
of his I-ircIIIIIstaIIIIes in his mind. and again this put him into

l was heartily sorry that l disturbed him. and not only left
him. but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued
in that posture about three minutes. or little more. after I left
him . then came to me. as he had said he would, and. with a
great deal of seriousness and atl'ection. but with tears in his
eyes. thanked me. that had. under God giv en him. and so

II as nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men,
and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God.

After this. the young priest applied himself to his country-

success, though others were for a time out of all government

I cannot help committing this to writing. as perhaps it may
he useful to those into whose hands it may fall. for the guiding
themselves III all the extravagances of their assious. for if an
excess ot'joy can carry men out to such a ength beyond the
reach of their reason. what will not the extravagance: of anger.
rage. and a provoked mind, carry us to? And. indeed. here I
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions

of every kind. as well those of joy and satisfaction. as those of
sorrow and anger.

We were something disordered. by these extravaganees
among our new guests. for the first day: but when they had
been retired. lodgings provided for them as well as our ship
would allow. and they had slept heartily--as most of them
did, being fatigued and frightened--they were quite another
sort of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners. or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shown them. was wanting; the French. it is known.
are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain and
one of the priests came to me the next day. and desired to
speak with me and my nephew: the commander began to con-
sult with us what should he done with them: and. first. they
told us that we had saved their lives. so all they had was little
enough for a return to us for that kindness received. The
captain said they had saved some money. and some things of
value. in their boats. catched hastily out of the flames. and if
we would accept it. they were ordered to make an oti'er of it
all to us; they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in
our way. where. if possible. the might get a passage to France.
My nephew was for acceptingt ieir money at first word. and to
consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled
him in that part. for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a
strange country: and if the Portuguese captain that took me
up at sea had served me so. and took all I had for my deliver-
ance. I must have starved. or have been as much a slave at the
Brazils as I had been at Barbary. the mere being sold to a
Mahometan excepted: and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk. if not. in some cases. much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them
up in their distress. it was true. but that it was our duty to do
so. as we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be
so delivered. if we were in the like. or any other extremity;
that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they
would have done for us. if we had been in their case. and they
in ours: but that we took them up to save them. not to plun-
der them ; and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that
little from them which they had saved out of the tire. and then
set them on shore and leave them: that this would be first to
save them from death. and then kill them ourselves; save them
from drowning. and abandon them to starving; and therefore
I would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to
setting them on shore. I told them. indeed. that was an exceed- -
ing diflicult to us. for that the ship was bound to the East
Indies; an though we were driven out of our course to the248 AIII'I-IN'l'lIltl-IS III-'

SECTION XXXII.

BELIEVES THE CREW OF A BRISTOL SHIP, WHO ARE STAR\'ING.--ARRIVPSS A'l
HIS ISLAND.

THE wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty
00d; and as the winds had continued in the points between
. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed several opportunities
of sending them to France; for we met several ships bound to
Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's; but
they had been so long beating up against the wind. that they
durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for
the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take
in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after
this that we made the Banks of Newfoundland; where, to
shorten my story, we put all our French people on board a
bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and
afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get provisions
to victual themselves with. \Vhen I say, all the French went
on shore, I should remember, that the young priest I spoke of,
hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the
voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Core-
mandel; which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the
man, and had very good reason, as will appear afterwards:
also four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and
proved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West Indies,
steering away S.'and S. by E. for about twenty days together.

ROBINSON AND FRIDAY 60 ASHORB.--THE LAT'I'ER MEETS WITH HIS FATHER.--
ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED ON THE ISLAND AI'I'ER ROBINSON'S QUIT'I'ING 11'.

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked '
him if he knew where he was; he looked about a little, and
presently clapping his hands, cried, 0 yes, 0 there, 0 yes, 0
there, pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and
(tapering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.

Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find any body
here or no? and do you think we shall see your father? The
fellow stood mute as a stock a good while, but when I named
his father, the poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and
I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully. \Vhat
is the matter, Friday? says I; are you troubled because you
may see your father? No, no, says he, shaking his head, no
see him more: no, never more see him again. Why 30, said 1,
Friday? how do you know that? 0 no, 0 no, sa s Friday ; he
long ago die, long ago; he much old man. ell, well, says
I, Friday, you don't know ; but shall we see any one else then?
The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points to
the hill just above my old house; and though we lay half a
league off, he cries out, We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much
man there, and there, and there. I looked, but I saw nobody.
no, not with a perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because
I could not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found
upon inquiry the next day ; and there were five or six men all
together, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to
think of us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the Eng--
lish ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and in about half a quarter of an hour
after. We perceived a smoke arise from the side of the creek :
so I immediately ordered the boat out. taking Friday with me:
and hanging out a white flag. or a flag of trace. 1 went directly
on shore taking with me the young friar I mentioned. to whom
I lmd told the story of my living there. and the manner of it.
and every particular both of myself and those I left there: and
who was. on that account. extremely desirous to go with me.
We had besides about sixteen men well armed. if we had found
any new guests there which we did not know of ; but we had
no need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood. near high water.
We rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed my
eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved. and whom
I knew by his face perfectly well: as to his habit. I shall de-
scribe it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first
but myself: but there was no keeping Friday in the boat. for
the atleetionate creature had spied his father at a distance. a
good way oll' the Spaniards. where indeed lsaw nothing of
him; and if they had not let him go ashore. he would have
jumped into the sea. lie was no sooner on shore. but he flew
away to his father. like an arrow out of a bow. It would have.
aside any man shed tears. in spite of the tirmest resolution. to
have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he
none to his father: how be embraced him. kissed him. stroked
his face. took him up in his arms. set him down upon a tree.
aml lay down by him: then stood aml looked at him. as any
one would look at a strange picture. for a quarter of an hour
together; then lay down on the ground. and stroked his legs.
and kissed theta. and then got up again. and stared at him:
one would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would
have made a dog laugh the next day to see how his passion
ran out another way: in the morning he walked along the
shore. to and again. with his father several hours. always
leading him by the hand. as if he had been a lady: and every
now and then he would come to the boat to fetch something or
other for him. either a lump of sugar. a dram. a biscuit-cake.
or something or other that was good. In the afternoon his
frolies ran another wa ; for then he would set the old man
down upon the groan and dance almut him. and make a thouv
sand antic postures and gestures: and all the while he did this.
he would be talking to him, and telling him one story or other
of his travels. and of what had happened to him abroad. to
divert him. In short. if the same filial affection was to be
found in Christians to their parents in our part of the world.
one would be tempted to say. there would hardly have been
any} need of the fifth commandment.

at this is a digression: I return to my landing. It would
be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities
that the Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard. who.
as I said. I knew very well. was he whose life I had saved;
he came towards the boat. attended by one more. carrying a
tlag of trace also. . and he not only did not know me at first.
but lIII had no thou ghts. no notion of its being me that was
come. till [spoke to him. Senhor. said I. in Portuguese do
you not know me? At which he spoke not a word. but giving
his nmsket to the man that was with him. threw his arms abroad.
saIing somethingin Spanish that I did not perfectly hear. came
forward and embraced me. deg telling me he was inexcusable not
to know that face again. that he had once seen as if an angel
from heaven sent to save his life: he said abundance of very
handsome things. as a II ell bred Spaniard always knows how. .
and then beckoning to the person that attended him. bade him
go and II. Ill out his comrades. He then asked me if I would
walk to my old habitation. where lIII would give me possession
of my own house again. and where I should see they had made
but mean improvements: so I walked along with him: but.
alas! I could no more find the place again than if I had never
been there; for they had planted so many trees. and placed
them In such a posture. so thick and close to one another. and
in ten Iears' time they were grown so big. that. In short. the
place was inaccessible. c\cept by such windings and blind ways
as they themselves only. who made them. could find.

l asked them what put them upon all these fortifications: he
told me I II onld say there was need enough of it. when they
had given me an account how they had passed their time since
their arriving in the islaml. especially alter they had the mis-
fortune to find that I II as gone. He told IIIII he could not but
have some satisthctiou In my good fortune. when he. heard that
I II as gone in a good ship. and to my satisfaet t.Ion . and that he
had ottentimes a strong persuasion that. one time or other. he
should see me again. - but nothing that ever befall him in his
life. he said. was so surprising and afllictiug to him at first. as
the disappointnnInt he was under when he came back to the
island and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind. and of whom. he said. he had a long story to tell IIIII. the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the sa-
vages. only that their number was so small : and. says he. had
they been strong enough. we had been all long ago in purgatory:
and with that IIII cr rossed himself on the breast. But. sir. says
IIII. I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell you.
how. forced by necessity. we were obliged. for our own pre-
serIation. to disarm them. and make them our subjects. who
would not be content with being moderately our nIasterS. but
would be our murderers. I answered. I was heartily afraid
of it when I left them there. and nothing troubled me. at my
parting from thII island but that they \I ere not come back. that
I might have put them III possession of cIIIry thing first. and
left the others in a state of subjection, as the deserved; but
if they had reduced them to it, I was very g ad. and should
be very far from finding any fault with it: for I knew they
were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit
for any manner of mischief.

While I was thus saying this. the man came whom he had
sent back. and with him eleven men more. In the dress they
were in. it was impossible to guess what nation they were of:
but he made all clear. both to them and to me. First he turned
to me. and pointing to them. said. These, sir. are some of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to you; and then turning to
them. and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon
which they all came up. one by one. not as if they had been
sailors and ordinary fellows. and the like. but really as if they
had- been ambassadors of noblemen. and l a monarch or great
conqueror: their behaviour was to the last degree obligiug and
courteous. and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which
very well became them; and. in short, they had so much more
manners than I. that I scarce knew how to receive their civili-
ties. much less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in. the island.
after my going away. is so very remarkable. and has so many
incidents. which the former part of my relation will help to
understand, and which will. in most of the particulars, refer to
the account I have already given. that I cannot but commit
them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come
after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first
person. which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said
1's. and said he's. and he told me'r. and I told Mac's, and the
like; but I shall collect the facts historically. as near as I can
gather them out of my memory, from what they related to me.
and from what I met with in my conversing with them and
with the place.

In order to do this succinctly. and as intelligibly as I can, I
must go back to the circumstances in which I left the island.
and in which the persons were of whom I am to speak. And
firlt. it is necessary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's
father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives I had rescued
from the savages) in a large canoe. to the main. as I then
thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions that he left
behind him, in order to save them from the like calamity that
he had been in, and in order to succour them for the present;
and that. if possible, we might together find some way for our
deliverance afterwards.

When I sent them away. I had no visible appearance of. or
the least room to ho e for, my own deliverance, any more than
I had twenty years fore, much less had I any foreknowledge
of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an Enghsh ship
coming on shore. there to fetch me all: and it could not but be
II very great surprise to them. when they came back. not only
to find that l was gone. but to find three strangers left on the
spot. possessed of all that I had left behind me. which would
otherwise. have. heeu their own.

The first thing. however. which I inquired into. that I might
begin where I left oll. was of their own purtI . and I desired
he would give IIIII a particular account of his voyage hack to
his countrymen with the boat. II hen I sent him to fetrh them
men He told IIIII there was little variety in that part. for
nothing rIIIIIarkIIhle happened to them on the way. having had
IIe ry IIIIlIn weather and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen.
it could not he doubted. he said. hat that they were ovetjov ed
to see him (it seems he was the principal IIIaII among them. the
captain ot the vessel they had been shipw reeked III having been
dead some. time): they were. he said. the more surprised to
see him. beIIause they knew that he was fallen into the hands
of the savages. who. they were satisfied. would devour him.
as they did all the rest of their prisoners: that when he told
them the story of his deliverance. and in what manner he. was
furnished for carrying them away. it was like a dream to them.
and their astonishment. he said. was somewhat like that of
Joseph's brethren. when he told them who he was. and told
them the story ot'his esaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when
he showed them the arms. the powder. the hall. and provisions.
that he brought them for their journey or IIIII.age they were
restored to themselves. took II just share of the Jay at their
de liveranee. and immediately prepared to come away with
him.

1 heir first business was to get canoes: and III this they were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part ot it. but to
trespass upon their friendly savages. and to borrow two large
canoes. or periaguas. on preteuIIe ot going out II fishing. or for
pleasure. III these they came away the next morning. It
seems they wanted IIII time to get tilt'tlllttt'ltt's ready. . for they
had no baggage. neither elothes uor provisions. nor any thing
in the world but II hat they had on them. and a few roots to
II at. ot which they used to make their bread.

They were in all three II IIeks absent. and III that time. lltt-
luckily for them. I had the occasion oll'ered for my IIsI'ape. as
l IIIIIIItioIIIId' III my other part. and to get otl' from the island.
leaving three of the most impndeut. hardened. ungoverned.
disagreeable villains behind me. that any man could desire to
meet with: to the poor Spaniards' great ngel' and disappoint-
meat. Iou may be sure.

The only just thing the rogues did was. that when the Spa-
niards came ashore. they gave my letter to them. and gave
them proIisious. and other reliel. as I had ordered them to do. .
also they gave them the long paper of directions which I had
left with them. containing the particular methods which i took
for managing every part of my life there ; the way how I baked
my bread. bred up tame goats. and planted my corn: how I
cured at grapes. made my pots. and. in a word. every thing
I did ; a I this being written down. they gave to the Spaniards
(two of them understood English well enough): nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing else. for
they agreed very well for some time. They gave. them an
equal admission Into the house. or cave. and they began to live
very sociably; and the head Spaniard. who had seen pretty
much of my methods. and Frida 's father together. managed
all their alliiirs: but as for the Englishmen. they did nothing
but ramble about the island. shoot parrots. and catch tortoises;
and when they came home at night. the Spaniards provided
their suppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this. had the
others but let them alone ; which. however. they could not find
in their hearts to do long. but. like the dog in the manger. they
would not eat themselves. neither would they let the others
eat. The dilli'rences. nevertheless. were at first but trivial.
and such as are not worth relating. but at last. it broke. out into
open war: and it began with all the rudeness aml insolence
that can be imagined. without reason. without provocation.
contrary to nature. and. indeed. to common sense: and though.
it is true. the first relation of it came from the Spaniards them-
selves. whom I may call the accusers. yet when I came to
examine the fellows. they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come. to the particulars of this part. I must
supply a defect in my former relation; and this was. I forgot
to set down. among the rest. thatjust as we were weighing the
anchor to set sail. there happened a little quarrel on board of
our ship. which I was once afraid would have turned to a
second mutiny: nor was it appeased till the captain. rousing
up his courage. and taking us all to his assistance. parted them
by force. and making Me of the most refractory fellows pri-
soners. he laid them in irons: aml as thev had been active in
the former disorders. and let full some ugly. dangerous words.
the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng-
land. and have them hanged there for mutiny. and running
away with the ship. This. it seems. though the captain did
not attend to do it. frightened some other men in the shi :
and some of them had put it into the. heads of the rest that t m
captain only gave them good words for the present. till they
should come. to some English port. and that then they should
be all put into gsol. and tried for their lives. The mate got
intelligence of this. and acquainted as with it: upon which it
was desired that 1. who still passed for a great man among
them. should go down with the mate. and satisfy the men. and
tell them that they might be assured. it' they behaved well the

AMONG THE SE'I'I'LEIKS.

THEY were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me,
had given them the possession of it, and nobody else had any
right to it; and that they should build no houses upon their
ground, unless they would pay rent for them.
The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked them
to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were
5- that they had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded ;
and one of them merrily said, if they were the ground-land-
lords, he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, and
made improvements, they would, according to the custom of
landlords, grant a long lease: and desired they would get a
scrivener to draw the writings. One of the three, cursing and
raging, told them they should see they were not in jest; and
going to a little place at a distance, where the honest men had
- made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and
' claps it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire;
and it would have been all burned down in a few minutes, if

that there were any inhabitants in the plaee: or to have fallen
upon them so elli'ctaally. as that not a man of thetn should
have escaped. which could only have been by getting in be-
tween them and their boats: but this presence of mind was
wanting to "win. which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a
great while.

We need not doubt. but that the governor aml the man with
him. surprised with this sight. ran back innnediatelv. and raised
their fellows. giving theta an account of the imminent danger
they were all in. and they again as readily took the alarm:
but it was inumssible to persuade them to stay eloso within.
where they were. but they must all run out to see how things
stood.

While it was dark. indeed. they were well enough. and they
had opportunity enough. for some hours. to view them by the
light of three tires they had made at a distance from one
another; what they were doing they knew not. and what to
do themselves they knew not. For. tirst. the enemy were too
many: aml. secondly. they did not keep together. but were
divided into several parties. atul Were. on shore in several
planes.

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight :
and as they found that the. fellows ran straggling all over the
shore. they made no doubt but. first or last. some of them
would chop in upon their habitation. or upon some other place
where they would see. the token of inhabitants; and they were
in great perplesitv also for fear of their flock of goats. which
would have been little less than starving them, if they should
have been destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon
was. to dispatch three men away before it was light. two Spa-
niards and one linglislunaa. to drive. all the goats away to the
great valley where the cave was. and. if need were. to drive
them into the very cave itself. 'Iould they have seen the. sa-
vages all together in one body. and at a distance from their
canoes. thev resolved. if there had been a hundred of them. to
have attacked them: but that could not be obtained ; for they
were some of them two miles otl' front the. other: and. as it
appeared afterwards. were of two dill'erent nations.

After having mused a great while on the course. they should
take. and beating their brains in considering their present cir-
cnmstauces. they resolved. at last. while it was still dark. to
semi the old savage. Friday's father. out as a spv. to learn. if
possible. something concerning them; as what they came. for.
what they intended to do. and the. like. The. old man readily
undertook it: and stripping himself quite naked. as most of
the savages were. away he went. After he had been gone an
hour or two. he brings word that he. had been among them
utnliseovered: that he found they were two parties. and of
two several nations. who had war with one. another, and had a
great battle III the Ir IIIIn country' . and th. It both sides having.Ir
IIIIIl sII IIIrIIl prisoners taken in the tight. they III-re. by mere
IIIIIIIIIIII. landed all on the same island. for the devouring the Ir
prisoners and making mIIrrII. but their eoming so by IIlIIInIIe to

but lIII did not pIIrI-IIiIe that they had any notion ot any body

end of telling his story. when they could pIIrIIeiII.I by the.
unusual noise they IIIIIIIII. that the two little armies were
engaged in a bloody tight.

sat'ety eonsisted m it. IIIIII that tlIIII had nothing to do but lie

IIIIII "II II the rest would go III III and it II as so to II tittle.
lint it "as impossible to prevail. IIspeII ially upon the IIIIIIglislI-
lIIt'tl' I their I nriositI was so impurtuuate upon their pruden-

used some 'aution too. I'i'II. they did not. go openly. just by

themselves to aIIIantage. where they might seeurelv see them
IIIIInage the tight. and. as they thought. not be seen by them . but
it seems the sIII'aII'I-s did see them. as we shall find hIIreaIter.

but then, that party II hII II "as nearest our people' 3 habitatioli
began to appear \Ieake st. and. after some time more. some. of
them began to tly' . IIIIII this put our IIIIIII again into II great
eousternation. lest anyone of those that tled should run into

be IIIIIIII with their words. orby klioekinp; them down IIitII the
stocks at their muskets. but not by shooting them. tor tear of
raising an alarm by the noise.

As they II\pected. it fell out: three ot the routed army fled
for life. and crossing- the creek. ran IlirIIIItly into the place. not
in the least knowing II hither they went. but running as into a
thiek wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad
gave notice of this within, with this addition, to our men's
great satisfaction. viz. that the conquerors had not pursued
them. or seen which way they were gone; upon this. the Spa-
niard governor. a man of humanity. would not suffer them to
kill the three fugitives. but sending three men out by the top
of the hill. ordered them to go round, come in behind them.
and surprise and take them prisoners. which was done. The
residue of the conquered people tied to their canoes. and got
011' to sea; the victors retired. made no pursuit. or very little.
but drawing themselves into a body together. gave two great
screaming shouts. which they supposed was b way of triumph.
and so the light ended: and the same day. a ut three o'clock
in the afternoon. they also marched to their canoes. And thus
the Spaniards had their island again free to themselves, their
fright was over, and they saw no savages in several years
after.

After they Were all gone. the Spaniards came out of their
den. and viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-
thirty meu dead on the spot: some were killed with great long
arrows. some of which were found sticking in their bodies;
but most of them were killed with great wooden swords, six-
teen or seventeen of which they fimnd in the field of battle,
and as many bows. with a great many arrows. These swords
were strange. great. unwieldy things. and they must be very
strong men that used them : most of those men that were killed
with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say.
or. as we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and
several their arms and legs broken ; so that it is evident they
light with inexpressihle rage and fury. We found not one
man that was not stone-dead. for either they stay by their
enemy till they have. quite killed him. or they carry all the
wounded men that are not quite dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while:
the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences
appeared terrible to the last degree, especially upon sup-
posing that some time or other they should fall into the hands
of those creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies,
but kill them for food. as we kill our cattle; and they professed
to me. that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton.
though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead,
had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled
their minds with such unusual terror. that they were not them-
selves for some weeks after. This, as I said. tamed even the
three English brutes [ have been speaking of. and. for a great
while after. they were tractable. and went about the common
business of the whole society well enough; planted, sowed.
reaped. and began to be all naturalised to the country. But
some time after this, they fell into such simple measures again,

as brought them into a great deal of trouble.3
N
They had taken three prisoners. as I observed; and these
three being lusty. stout young fellows. they made them ser-
vants. aml taught them to work for them ; and. as slaves. the
did well enough; but thev did not take their measures wit
them as I did by my man l'riday. viz. to begin with them upon
the principle. of having saved their lives. aml then instruct
them in the rational principles of life; much less of religion.
civilizing. and reducing them by kind usage and atl'ectionate
arguings; but as they gave them their food every day. so they
gave them their work too. and kept them fully employed in
drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it. that they never
had them to assist them. and fight for them. as I had my man
Friday. who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my
bones.

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends.
for common danger. as I said above. had etli-ctnally reconciled
them. they began to consider their general circumstances; and
the first thing that came under their consideration was. whether.
seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island.
and that there were more remote and retired parts ofit equally
adapted to their way of living. and manifestly to their advan-
tage. they should not rather move their habitation. and plant
in some more proper place for their safety. and especially for
the security of their cattle and corn.

Upon this. after long debate. it was concluded that they
would not remove their habitation: because that. some time.
or other. they thought thev might hear from their governor
again. meaning me: and if l should send any one to seek them.
I should be sure. to direct them to that side: where. if they
should find the place demolished. they would conclude the
savages had killed as all. and we were gone; and so our sup-
ply would go too. But as to their corn and cattle. they agreed
to remove them into the valley where. my cave was. where the
land was as proper for both. and where. indeed. there was land
enough : however. upon second thoughts. they altered one. part
of their resolution too. and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither. aml plant part of their corn there: and so
if one part was destroyed. the other might be saved. And one
part of prudence they used. which it was very well they did.
viz. that they never trusted those three savages. which they
had prisoners. with knowing any thing of the plantation they
had made in that valley. or of any cattle. they had there. much
less of the. cave there. which they kept. in case of necessity. as
a safe retreat : aml thither they carried also the two barrels of
powder which I had sent them at my coming away. But.
however they resolved not to change their habitation: yet
they agreed. that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall
or fortification. and then with a grove of trees. so seeing their
safety consisted entirely in their being concealed. of which
they were now fully convinced. they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more. effectually than before. For this
purpose. as I planted trees. or rather thrust in stakes. which
in time all grew up to he trees. for some good distance before
the entrance into my apartments. they went on in the same
manner. and filled up the rest of that whole s are of ground.
from the trees I had set. quite down to the si e. of the creek.
where. as I said. I landed my floats. and even into the very
ooze where the tide flowed. not so much as leaving any place
to land. or any sign that there had been an landing thereabout:
these stakes also being of a wood very orward to grow. as l
have. noted formerlv. they took care to have them generally
much larger and taller than those which I had planted; and
as they grew space. so the planted them so very thick and
close together. that when t ey had been three or four years
grown. there was no pierciu with the eye any considerable
way into the plantation: am, as for that part which I had
planted. the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh. and
among them they placed so many other short ones. and so
thick. that. in a word. it stood like a pallisado a quarter of a
mile thick. and it was next to impossible to penetrate it. but
with a little army to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees. they stood so close.

llut this was not all z for they did the same by all the ground
to the right hand and to the left. and round even to the top of
the hill. leaving no way. not so much as for themselves to come
out. but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill. and
then lifted up. and placed again from the first stage up to the
top: and when the ladder was taken down. nothing but what
had wings. or witchcraft to assist it. could come at them. This
was excellently well contrived; nor was it less than what they
afterwards found occasion for; which served to convince me.
that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to
justify it. so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set
it to work ; and if we listened carefully to the voice of it. I am
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our
lives are now, by our own negligence. subjected to: but this
by the way.

I return to the sto .--They lived two years after this in
perfect retirement. an had no more visits from the savages.
They had indeed an alarm given them one morning. which put
them into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniards
being out early one morning on the west side, or rather end.
of the island (which was that end where I never went. for fear
of being discovered). they were surprised with seeing above
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They made
the best of their way home. in hurry enou h; and giving the
alarm to their comrades. they kept close a I that day. and the
next. going out only at night to make their observation: but27I'I Iovssruass ol-'

theI had the good luck to be mistaken: for wherever the
sin ages uent. theI did not land that time on the island. but
pursued some other design.

And now they lIaIl another broil with the three Englishmen:
one at whom. a most turbulent fellow. being in a rage at IIIIII
ot' the three slaves. which I mentioned they had taken. because
the fellow had not done something right which he hid him do.
and seemed a little untractahle in his showing him. drew a
hatchet out of a frog-belt. in which he wore it by his side. and
fell upon the poor savage. not to correct him. but to kill him.

he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage: which
the Spaniard perIeiIiIIg. avoided the blow. and with a shovel

came in to help their man. and a third Englishman fell in upon
them. 'l'hev had none of them any tire-arms. or anv other
weapons but hatchets and other tools. II\c.ept this third Eng I'-
lishnIIuI. . he lmd one ot IuI' rustI eutlasses. IIithwhich he made

set the whole t'IIIuilv in an uproar. and more help coming in.
theI took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question
was. what should be done with them! T heI' had been so often
Inntinous. and were so IerI furious so desperate and so idle
withal. tlIeI knew not what course to take with them. tor the)
were mischieIous to the highest degree. and Ialued not what
hurt they did to any man. . so that in short. It was not safe to
"III with them.

The Spaniard who II as governor told them. III so IIIaIII II ords.
that it theI had been ot his ow II couIItrI he would have hanged
them . for all laws and all governors were to preserve soeietI .
and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be ex-
pelled out ot it: but as they were Englishmen. and that it II as
to the generous kindness ol IIII Englishman that theI all owed
their preservation and deliIcranee. he would use them with
all possible leIIitI. and would leave them to the iudgtnent of
the other two Englishmen. who were their couIItrI men.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up. and said they
desired it might not be left to them . F Ior. saIs he. I am sure.
we ought to sentence them to the gallows: and with that he
giIes an account how \\ ill \thins. one ot the three. had pro-
posed to have all the five Englishmenjoin to ther. and murder
all the Spaniards when they were in their a eep.

When the Spanish governor heard this. he calls to Will
Atkins. llow. Seuhor Atkins. would you murder us all .'
What have you to say to that! The hardened villain was so
far from denying it. that he said it was true: and. G---d d--n
him. they would do it still. before they had done with them.
Well. hat Senhor Atkins. says the Spaniard. what have we
done to you. that you will kill us.' And what would you get
by killing us! And what must we do to prevent your killing
us.' Must we. kill you. or you kill us! Why will you put us
to the necessity of this. Senhor Atkins? says the Spaniard
ver ' calmly. and smiling. Seahor Atkins was in such a rage
at t it'- Spaniard's making a jest of it. that. had he not been
held by three men. aml withal had no weapon near him. it was
thought he would have attempted to have. killed the Spaniard
in the middle of all the company. This hairbrain carriage
obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done: the
two Englishmen. and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage.
were of the opinion that they should hang one of three. for an
e\ample to the rest: and that particularly it should be he that
had twice attempted to commit nmrder with his hatchet ; and.
indeed. there was some reason to believe he had done it. for
the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the
wound he had received. that it was thought he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said no : it was an Englishman
that had saved all their lives. and he would never consent to
put an Englishman to death. though he. had murdered half of
them; any. he said. if he had been killed himself by an Eng-
lishman. and had time left to speak. it should be that they
should pardon him.

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard.
that there was no gainsayiag it; and as merciful counsels are.
tnost apt to prevail. where. they are so earnestly pressed. so
they all came into it: but then it was to be. considered what
should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they
designed: for all agreed. governor and all. that means were to
be used for preserving the society from danger. After a long
debate. it was agreed. first. that they should be disarmed. and
not permitted to have either gun. powder. shot. sword. or any
weapon : and should he turned out of the society. and left to
live where they would. and how they would. by themselves:
but that none of the rest. either Spaniards or English. should
converse with them. speak with them. or have any thing to do
with them: that they should be forbid to come within a certain
distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they offered
to commit any disorder. so as to spoil. burn. kill. or destroy
any of the corn, plantings. buildings. fences, or cattle belonging

boards and pots. and such things. they were quite out of their
element. aml could make nothing of it: and when the rainy
season came on. for want at a cave in the earth. they could not
keep their grain dry. and it was in great danger ot' spoiling:
aml this lmmbled them much: so they came and begged the
Spaniards to bet i them. which they very readily did: and in
four days workm a great hole in the side of the bill for them.
big enough to secure their corn and other things from the rain:
but it was but a poor place. at best. compared to mine. and
es iecially as mine was then. for the Spaniards had greatly
en urged it. and made several new apartments in it.

About three quarters of a year alter this separation. at new
t'rolic took these rogues. which. together with the former vil-
lanv they had connaitted. brought mischief enough upon them.
and had very near been the. ruin of the whole colony. The
three new associates began. it seems. to be weary of the lube.
rions life they led. and that without ho ie of betterin their
circumstances; and a whim took them. t mt they \thllit make
a voyage to the continent. from whence the savages came. and
would try it' they could seize upon some prisoners among the
natives there. and bring them home. so to make them do the
laborious part ot'their work for them.

The project was not so preposterous. it' they had gone no
farther: but they did nothing. nml proposed nothing. but had
either misehiet' in the design. or mischief in the event: and. it"
I may give my opinion. they seemed to be under a blast from
lleaven: for it' we will not allow a visible curse to pursue
visible crimes. how shall we reconcile the events of things with
the divinejnstiee.' It was certainly an apparent vengeance on
their crime ot' mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state
they were in: and they showed not the least remorse for the
crime. but added new villanies to it. such as the iiece of mon-
strous cruelty of wounding a poor slave. because 0 did not. or
perhaps could not. understand to do what he directed. and to
wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple all his life.
and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be. had for
his care; and what was still worse. the murderous intent. or.
to do justice to the crime. the intentional murder. for such to
be sure it was. as was atterwards the formed design they all
laid. to murder the Spaniards in cold blood. and in their
sleep.
 

SECTION XXXV.

THE MUTINOUS ENCLISHMEN ARE DISMISSED FROM THE ISLAND--RETURN WITH
SEVERAL CAPTIVE SAVAGES--TAKB THE FEMALES AS WIVES.--ARRI\'AL 0!"
SAVAGBS.

BUT I leave observing, and return to the story :---The three
fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very
humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them: the
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was
this :----'l'hat they were tired of living in the manner they did ;
and that they were not handy enough to make the necessaries
they wanted, and that having no help, they found they should
be starved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take
one of the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms
and ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would go
over to the main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them
from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very
honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were
running into ; told them they had suffered such hardships upon
that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy.
tell them they would be starved, or murdered, and bade them
consider of it.

The men replied audacionsly, they should be starved if they
stayed here, for they could not work,'and would not work,
and they could but be starved abroad; and if they were mur-
dered, there was an end of them ; they had no wives or children
to cry after them: and, in short, insisted importunately upon
their demand; declaring they would go, whether they would
give them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and
he in no condition to defend themselves: and that though they
could ill spare their tire-arms. having not enough for them-
selves. yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol and
a enthuse. and each man a hatchet. which they thought was
sutlieieat for them. In a word. they accepted the offer; and
having baked them bread enough to serve them a month. and
given them as much goat's-flesh as they could eat while it was
sweet. and a great basket of dried grapes. a pot of fresh water.
and a young kid alive. they boldly set out in the canoe for a
voyage over the sea. where it was at least forty miles broad.

The boat. indeed. was a large one. and would very well have
carried fifteen or twenty men. and therefore was rather too big
for them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze. and tlood
tide with them. they did well enough. They had made a must
of a long pole. and a sail of four large goats' skins dried.
which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went
merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them. Bum viag'e:
and no man ever thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards were often saying .to one another. and to the
two honest Englislnnea who remained behind. how quietly and
comtiirtabl y they lived. now these three turbulent fellows were
gone; as for their coming again. that was the remotest thing
from their thoughts that could be imagined: when. behold.
after two-aad-twenty days' absence. one of the Englishmen.
being abroad upon his planting work. sees three strange men
coming towards him at a distance. with guns upon their
shoulders.

Away runs the Englishman. as if he was bewitched. comes
frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard. and tells him
they were all undone. for there. were strangers landed upon the
island. but could not tell who. The Spaniard. pausiaga while.
says to him. How do you mean. you cannot tell who! They
are the savages to be sure.---No. no. says the Englishman;
they are. men in clothes. with arms.--Nay then. says the Spa-
niard. why are you concerned! If they are not savages, they
must be friends; for there is no Christian nation upon earth
but will do us good rather than harm. ,

\Vhile. they were debating thus. came the three Englishmen.-
amt standing without the wood. which was new planted. hal-
looed to them: they presently knew their voices. and so all
the wonder of that kind ceased. But now the admiration was
turned upon another question. viz. \Vhat could be the matter.
and what made them come back again!

It was not long before. they brought the men in, and inquir-
iug where they had been. and what they had been doing, they
gave them a full account of their voyage in a few words, viz.
That they reached the land in two days. or something less;
but finding the people alarmed at their coming. and preparing
with bows and arrows to tight them, they durst not go on282 sovaaroaas 0F

Will! them. have killed two or three of them the next morning.
and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. But having
taken their leave. with all tho respect and thanks that could
well pass between people. where. on either side. they under-
stood not one word they could any. they utt otl' with their boat.
and came back towards the first islamll; where. when they
arrived. they set eight of their prisoners at liberty. there being
too many ot'tbem tor their occasion.

In their voyage. they endeavoured to have some communi-
cation with their prisoners ; but it was impossible to make them
understand any thing; nothing they eonld say to them. or give
them. or do for them. but was looked upon as going to murder
them. They first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures
screamed at that. especially the women. as if they had just felt
the knife at their throats: for they immediately eonchnled they
were unbound on pn rose to be killed. If they gave them any
thing to eat. it was {be same thin : they then concluded. it
was for fear they should sink in tles I. and so not be fat enough
to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly. the
party presently concluded. it was to see whether he or she was
fattest. aml tittest to kill first: nay. atler they had brought
them quite over. and began to use. them kindly. and treat them
well. still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper
for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage. the Spaniard asked them
where their new tinnily was: and being told that they had
brought them on shore. and put them into one of their hats.
and were come up to beg some victuals for them. they (the
Spaniards) aml the other two Englishmen. that is to say. the
whole eolouy. resolved to go all down to the place and see
them: and did so. and Friday 'a father with them.

W hen they came into the but. there they sat all bound: for
when they had brought theta on shore. they bound their hands.
that they might not take the boat and make their escape:
there. I say. they sat. all of them stark naked. First. there
were three men. lusty. oomelv fellows. well shaped. strai bt
and titir limbs. about thirt to thirty-five years of age: and ve
women. whereof two mig it be from thirty to forty; two more.
not above four or tlve-and-tweuty; and the titlh. a tall oomelv
maiden. about sixteen or seventeen. The women were well
favoured. agreeable )ersons. both in shape and features. only
tawny; and two of diein. had they been perfect white. would
have passed for very handsome women. even in London itself.
having pleasant agreeable countenauces. and of a very modest

where. when the mischief which followed happened. they
secured their wives and children. so as they could never be.
found; the having. by sticking innumerable stakes and poles
of the woml which. as I said. grew so readily. made the grove
unpassuble. except in some places where they climbed up to
got over the outside part, and then went on by ways of their
own leaving.

As to the three reprobates. as l justlv call them. though
they were much civilized by their settlement compared to
what they were. before. and were not so quarrelsouie. having
not the same opportunity; yet one of the certain companions
of a prolligate mind never left them. and that was their idle-
ness. It is true. they planted corn. and made. fences: but
Solomon's words were never better verified than in them. " I
went by the vineyard of the slothful. and it was all overgrown
with thorns ;" for when the Spaniards came to view their crop.
they could not see it in some places for weeds. the hedge had
several gaps in it. where the wild goats had got in and eaten
up the corn : perhaps here and there. a dead bush was crammed
in. to stop them out for the present. but it was only shutting
the stable-door after the steed was stolen: whereas. when they
looked on the colony of the other two. there was the very face
of industry and success upon all they did; there. was not a
weed to he seen in all their corn. or a gap in any of their
hedges : and they. on the other hand. verified Solomon's words
in another place. " that the. diligent hand Inaketh rich ;" for
every thing grew and thrived. and they luul plenty within and
without: they had more tame cattle than the others. more
utensils and necessaries within doors. and yet more pleasure
and diversion too.

It is true. the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly within doors. and having learned the English ways of
dressing and cooking from one. of the other I'Ininslunen. who.
as I said. was a cook's mute on board the ship. they dressed
their hashauds' vietuals very nicely and well; whereas the
others could not be brought to understand it; but then the
husband. who. as I say. had been cook's mate. did it himself.
llut as for the husbands of the three wives. they loitered about.
fetched turtles' eggs. and caught fish and birds: in a word.
any thing but labour. and they fared accordingly. The diligent
lived well and comfortably: and the slothful lived hard and
lieggarlv : and so. I believe. generally speaking. it is all over
the world.

But I now come to a scene. different from all that had hap-
pened before. either to them or to me; and the original of the
story was this: Early one morning. there came. on shore five or
six canoes of Indians or savages. call them which you please.
and there is no room to doubt thev came upon the. old erraiul
of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was now so familiar

SECTION XXXVI.

SEVERAL SAVAGES KILLED; THE REMAINDER LEAVE THE lSl..~\.\'l).---J\ FLEET
OF THEM AFTERWARDS ARRIVED--A GENERAL BATTLE--THE SAVAGES ARE
OVERCOME, ASD TIIANQUILLITY RESTOHED.

THEIR next halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood,
which was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they both
took their standing, resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, before two of the savages
appeared running directly that way, as if they already had
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them ;
and a little way farther they espied three more coming after
them, and five more beyond them, all coming the same way :
besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance,
running another way; for, in a word, they ran every way.
like sportsmen beating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they
should stand and keep their posture, or fly ; but, after a very
short debate with themselves, they considered, that if the
savages ranged the country thus before help came, they might
perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would
be lost; so they resolved to stand them there; and if they
were too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top
'of the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend them-
selves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted,
though all the savages that were landed, which was near fifty,
were to attack them. .

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether

sIIIIIges III-re their IIII II IIIIIIIItrIt'IIll'I. IIIt they were most ter-
rihlII afraid of them. and perhaps the more for the knowledge
theI had of them.

When they eamII there. tlIeI found the. Isavages had been In

along with them . II here how ever. they II ere obliged to bind

The prisoners now began to lIII II IIIIrtlIeII to them: and they
were so afraid ot their esIIIIpiIIg.t that they II ere onee rIIsIIlIiIIg
to kill them all. be liIII'iIIg they II ere under an absolute neces-

present. that they should he. sent out of the way. to my old
cave in the valley. and he kept. there. with two Spaniards to
guard them . and give them food tor their sulIsistenee. II mm
was done; and they were bound there. hand and foot for that
night.

W hen the Spaniards came. the two Englishmen III-re. so en-
couraged. that theI could not satisfy themselves to stay any
longer there: but taking the of the Spaniards and themselves.
with four Innskets and a pistol among them. and two stout
quarter-stares. away they went in quest of the savages. And
first they came. to the tree. II here the men lay that had been
killed: but it II as easy to see that some more. of the savages
had been there. for they had attempted to carry their dead men
away. and had dragged two of them a good way. but had given
it or er. From thence they adI aneed to the first rising ground,
where. they had stood and seen their camp destroIed, and
where tIIIII had the mIIrtitieation still to see some of the smoke. '
but neither could they here see any of the savages. They then
resolved, though with all possible caution, to go forward.
towards their ruined plantation ; but a little before they came.
thither, coming in sight of the seashore, they saw plainly the
savages all embarked again in their canoes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way to come at
them. to give them a parting blow ; but, upon the whole. they
were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their
improvements destroyed. the rest all agreed to come amt help
them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies.
'l'heir three countrymen. who were not yet noted for having
the least inclination to do any good. yet as soon as they heard
of it (for they living remote eastward, knew nothing of the.
matter till all was over). came. and offered their help and
assistance. and did. very friendly. work for several days. to
restore their habitation. and make necessaries for them. And
thus. in a little time. they were set upon their legs again.

About two days after this. they had the farther satisfaction
of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore.
and, at some. distance from them. two drowned men: by which
they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at
sea. which had overset some of them; for it had blown very
hard the night after they went otl'.

However, as some might miscarry. so. on the other hand.
enough of them escaped to inform the rest. as well of what they
had done as of what had happened to them, and to whet them
onto another enterprise of the. same nature; which they. it
seems, resolved to attempt. with sufficient force to carry all
before them: for except what the first man had told them of
inhabitants, they could any little of it of their own knowledge.
for thev never saw one man; and the fellow being killed that
had allirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm it to
them.

It was five or six months after this before they heard any
more of the savages. in which time our men were in hopes they
had either forgot their former bad luck. or given over hopes of
better: when, on a sudden. they were invaded with a most
formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full
of savages, armed with bows and arrows. great clubs. wooden
swords. and suchlike engines of war ; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastermost
side of the island. our men had that night to consult and con-
sider what to do; and. in the first place, knowing that their
being entirely concealed was their only safety before. and
would be much more so now, while the number of their enemies
was so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down
the hats which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive
.III av theirI' goats to the old care; because. they supposed the
savages would go direetly thither. as soon as it was day. to
play the old game III er again. though they did not now land

II IIIry thick throng, he orders three of his men to tire. having
loaded their nmskets with six or seven bullets a piece. about
as big as large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or
wounded they knew not. but the consternation and surprise
was inexpressible among the savages: they were frightened
to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise. and see their
men killed. and others hurt. but see nobody that did it; when.
in the middle of their fright. \Vill Atkins and his other three
let fly again among the thickest of them: and in less than a
minute the. first three being loaded again. gave them a third
vo e. P.

Hgd \Vill Atkins and his men retired immediately. as soon
as they had tired. as they were ordered to do. or had the rest
of the body been at hand. to have. poured in their shot con-
tinually. the savages had been ett'ectuallv routed: for the terror
that was among them came principally from this. viz. that they
were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning. and could
see nobody that hurt them: but 'Vill Atkins. staying to load
again. discovered the cheat: some. of the savages who were at
a distance spving them. came upon them behind; and though
.Atkins and his men tired at them also. two or three times. and
killed above twenty. retiring as fast as they could. yet they
wounded Atkins himself. and killed one of his fellow English-
men with their arrows. as thev did afterwards one Spaniard.
and one of the Indian slaves who came. with the women. This
slave was a most gallant fellow. and fought most desperately.
killing five of them with his own hand. having no weapon but
one of the armed staves and a hatchet.

tiur men being thus hard laid at. Atkins wounded. and two
other men killed. retreated to a rising ground in the wood:
and the Spaniards. after firing three volleys upon them. re-
treated also: for their number was so great. and they were so
desperate. that though above fifty of them were killed. and
more than as many wounded. yet they came on in the teeth of
our men. fearless of danger. and shot their arrows like a cloud:
and it was observed that their wounded men. who were not
quite. disabled. were made outrageous by their wounds. and
fought like madmen.

When our men retreated. they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman that were killed. behind them: and the savages.
when they came up to them. killed them over again in a
wretched manner. breaking their arms. legs. and heads. with
their clubs and wooden swords. like true savages; but finding
our men were gone. they did not seem to pursue them. but
drew themselves up in a ring. which is. it seems. their custom.
and shouted twice. in token of their victory; after which. the
had the mortification to see several of their wounded men fal .
dying with the mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up

together upon a rising ground. Atkins. though he was wounded.
in 3
would have had them march and charge again all together at
once: but the Spaniard replied. Senlior Atkins. you see. how
their wounded men tight: let them alone till morning; all the
wounded men will be still' and sore with their wounds. and faint
with the loss of blood : and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
This advice was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily. That
is true, senhor. and so shall I too: and that is the reason I
would go on while I am warm.-Well. Senhor Atkins, says
the Spaniard. you have behaved gallautly. and done your part;
we will fight for you. if you cannot come on; but I think it
best to stay till morning: so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night. and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men.
and a great noise and hurry among them where they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night; especially
if they could come to give them but one volley before they
were discovered. which they had a fair opportunity to do; for
one of the Englishmen. in whose quarter it was where the fight
began. led them round between the woods and the seaside
westward. and then turning short south. they came so near
where the thickest of them lay. that. before they were seen or
heard, eight of them fired in among them. and did dreadful
execution upon them ; in half a minute more. eight others fired
after them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that
abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while they
were not able to see who hurt them. or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition.
and then divided themselves in three bodies. and resolved to
fall in among them all together. They had in each body eight
persons, that is to say. twenty-two and the two women. who,
by the way, fought desperately. They divided the tire-anus
equally in each party. and so the halberds and staves. They
would have had the women kept back. but they said they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus formed their
little army. they marched out from among the trees. and came
up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud
as they could: the savages stood altogether. but were in the
utmost confusion. hearing the noise of our men shouting from
three quarters together: they would have fought if they had
seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some
arrows were shot. and poor old Friday was wounded, though
not dangerously ; but our men gave them no time. but. running
up to them. fired among- them three ways. and then fell in with
the but-ends of their muskets. their swords. armed stares, and
hatchets. and laid about them so well. that. in a word, they
set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their
lives which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mor-
tally wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty
of them; the rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured
through the woods and over the hills, with all the speed fear
and nimble feet could help them to; and as we did not trouble
ourselves much to pursue them. they got all together to the
seaside where they landed, and where their canoes lay. But
their disaster was not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible
storm of wind that evening from the sea, so that it was impos-
sible for them to go off ; nay. the storm continuing all night.
when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven
by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that it required
infinite toil to get them ofi' ; and some of them were even dashed
to pieces against the beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest
that night; but having refreshed themselves as well as they
could, they resolved to march to that part of the island where
the savages were tied, and see what posture they were in.
This necessarily led them over the place where the fight had
been, and where they found several of the poor creatures not
quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds; for a truly great man, though
obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no
delight in his misery. However, there was no need to give
any orders in this case; for their own savages, who were their
servants, dispatched these poor creatures with their hatchets.

At length, they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there a -
peered about a hundred still: their posture was generally
sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their
mouth, and the head put between the two hands, leaning down
upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shots of them, the
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired, without
hall. to alarm them: this he did, that by their countenance he
might know what to expect, viz. whether they were still in
heart to fight. or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited
and discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This
stratagem took; for as soon as the savages heard the first gun
and saw the flash of the second, they started up upon their
feet in the greatest consternation imaginable: and as our men
advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yelling away. with a kind of howling nonse, which our men did
not understand, and had never heard before; and thus they
ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been
calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not
then consider that this might probably have been the occasion
of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted,
or. at least, to come so many, and so often, as would quite
desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore.
who. notII'ithstanding his w.onnd kept always with them.
proved the best counsellor III this case. . his adv Ice IIIIII. to
Me the advantage that otl'ered. and clap III hetIIeen them and
their boats. and so deprive them ot the. capacit3 of ever return-

any mercy. the3 fell to work with their canoes. and destroyed
theIu eIery one that the storm had not destroyed before. I at
the sight of II hIeh the. sIIIages raised a hideous cry in the
woods. which our people. heard plain enough. after II lneh they
ran about the island like distracted men: so that. in a word.
our men did not really know at first what to do II Ith them.
Nor did the Spaniards. with all their prudence. consider. that
II hIlc they made those people thus desperate. they ought to
have kept a good guard at the same time upon their planta-
tions' . for though. it is true. they had IlrIven .III III their cattle.
and the Indians did not find out their main retreat. I mean my
old astle at the hill. nor the. can: in the I'Ialle3. 3et they found
out my plantation at the bower. and pulled it all to pieces. and
all the fences and planting about it: trod all the corn under
foot. tore. up the vines and grapes. being just then almost ripe.
and did our men an inestimable. .danngII. though to tlIemselI es
not one. farthing' s worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions.
yet they were in no condition to pursue them. or hunt them up
and don II. for as they were too nimble ot foot for our men.
II hen they found them single. so our men durst not go abroad
single. for fear of being surrounded with their numbers. The
best was. they had no weapons; for though they had bows.
they had no arrows left. nor any materials to make anyI , nor
had they any edgetool or weapon among them.

The. extremity and distress they were reduced to was great
and indeed dep orable. . but. at the same time. our IIIIIII III ere
also brought to very bad circumstances by them; for though
their retreats were. preserved. vet their provision Iv as destroyed.
and their harvest spoiled. . and what to do. or which II av to
turn themselves. they knew not. The only refuge they had
now was. the stock ot cattle they had In the valley by the. (III II
and some little corn IIlIich grew there. and the plantation of
the three Englishmen. Will Atkins and his comrades. who
were now reduced to two; one ot them being killed by an
arrow. II Inch struck him on the side ol his head. just under the

temples. so that he. nev er spoke more: and It II as very remark-

able. that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor
sava ge slave with his hatchet. and II ho afterwards intended to
have murdered the. Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse. at this time
than mine III as at any time. after I first discovered the grains
ot barleII and rice. iIIId got into the manner of planting and
raising my corn. and my tame cattle: for now thev had. as I
may sav. a hundred wolves upon the island. which would
devour eII erII thing they could come at. yet could be hardly
come at themselves.

When they saw II hat their circumstances were. the first
thing they concluded was. that they II ould. it possible. driv c
them up to the farther part ot the island. south-west. that if
any more savages came on shore. they might not find one ano-
ther: then that they would daily hunt and harass them. and
kill as many of them as they could come at. till they had

reduced their number; and if they could at last tame. them.
and bring them to any thing. they II ould give them corn. and
teach them how to plant and lim upon their daily labour.

III order to this. they so followed them. and so terrified
them with their guns. that III a few days. if any of them fired a
gun at an Indian. if he did not hit him. yet he would fall down
for fear and so dreadfully frightened they were. that they
kept out of sight farther and farther till. at last. our men
following them. and almost every day killing or. wounding
some ot them. theI kept up in the woods or hollow places so
much. that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of302 Aliv'tas'rlet-zs or

food: and many were afterwards found dead in the woods.
without any hurt. absolutely starved to death.

\Vbeu our men found this. it nnule their hearts relent. and
pity moved them. espeeially the Spaniard governor. Who was
the most gentleman-like. generous-inhaled own. that I ever
met with in my life: nml be proposed. if possible. to take one

so far as to he able to net as interpreter. and go among tla'm.
and see it' they might he brought to some eonditions that might

It was some while before any of them eould be taken; but
being weal>> and haltlstnrved. one of them was at last surprised
aml made a prisoner. He was sullen at tirst. and would neither
eat nor drink; but timliug hiniselt' kindly used. and vietuals
given him. aml no violeuee otl'ered him. he at last grew traet-
able. and mate to himself. They brought old l'ridnv to him.
who talked often with him. nml told him how kind the others
would he to them all : that they would not only save their lives.
but would give them part ot'the islnml to live in. provided they
would give satistaetiou that they would keep in their own
bounds and not eome beyoml it to injure or preiudiee others:
and that they should have eorn given them to plant and make
it grow for their bread. aml some bread given them for their
present subsisteuee: aml old Friday bade the fellow go and
talk with the rest ot' hiseonutrytnea. and see what they said to
it : assuring them. that it" they did not agree inuumlintely. they
should be all destroyed.

The poor wretehes. thoroughly luuubled. aml redueed in
number to about thirty-seven. elosed with the proposal at tho
tirst otlbr. and begged to have some food given them: upon
whieh. twelve Spaniards and two linglislunen. well armed.
with three Indian slaves and old Friday. marched to the plnee
where they were. The three Indian slaves earried them a large
quantity ot~ bread. some riee boiled up to cakes and dried in
the sun. and three live goats: and they were ordered to go to
the side of a hill. where they sat down. ate their provisions
very thankt'nllv. and were the most faithful t'ellows to their
words that eould be thought of; for. eseept when they enme
to beg vietuals and direetioas. they never eame out of their
bounds: and there they lived when I eame to the island. and
I went to see tliem.

'l'hey bml taught them both to plant eorn. make bread. breed
tame goats. aml mill. them: they wanted nothing but wives.
and they soon would have been a nation. They were eoutiaed
to a neek of land. sarroumled with high roelvs behind them.
and lying plain towards the sea before them. on the south-east
corner of the island. They had land enough. and it was very
good and fruitful : about a mile aml a halt' broad. nml three or

lived well enough ; though. it was true. they were not so indus-
trious as the other two. as has been observed already.

tine thing. however. cannot be omitted. viz. that as for reli-
gion. I do not know that there was any thing of that kiml
among them: they often. indeed. put one another in mind that
there was a God. by the. very common method of seamen. viz.
swearing by his name: nor were their poor ignorant savage
wives much better for having been married to Christians. as
we must call them; for as they knew very little of God them-
selves. so they were utterly incapable of enterin into any dis-
course with their wives about a God, or to tal any thing to
them concerning religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives
had made from them was. that they had taught them to speak
English pretty well; and most. of their children. which were
near twenty in all. were taught to speak English too. from their
first learning to speak. though they at first spoke it in a very
broken manner. like their mothers. There was none of these
children above six years old when I came thither. for it was
not much above seven years that thev had fetched these five
savage ladies over: but they had all been pretty fruitful. for
they had all children. more or less: I think the cook's mate's
wife was big of her sixth child; nml the mothers were all a
good sort of well governed. quiet. laborious women. modest
and decent. helpful to one another. mighty observant and sub-
jeet to their toasters (I cannot call them husbands). and wanted
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian religion. and
to be legally married: both which were happily brought about
afterwards by my means. or. at least. in consequence of my
coming among them.

ROBINSON LEARNS FROM THE SI'ANIARDS THE DIFHCUIJ'IES THEY HAD TO
BNCOUNTI-Znu--HE FURNISIIES THE PEOPLE WITH TOOLS, Bub--THE FRENCH
BOOLESIAS'I'IC.

HAVING thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my runagate English, I must say something of
the Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in
whose story there are some incidents also remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their circum-
stances when they were among the savages. They told me
readily that they had no instances to give of their application
or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a poor, miserable,
dejected handful of people; that if means had been put into
their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves to despair,
and so sunk under the weight of their misfortune, that they
thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and
sensible man, told me he was convinced they were in the
wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give themselves
up to their misery, but always to take hold of the helps which
reason offered, as well for present support as for future deliver-
ance : he told me that grief was the most senseless insignificant
passion in the world, for that it regarded only things past,
which were generally impossible to be recalled, or to be reme-
died, but had no views of things to come, and had no share in
any thing that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the
affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this be repeated a
Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat in just theROIIIII'sos cnIIsIIIt. 307

same II orIls that he spoke it in. yet I remember I made it into
an English proIIIrb ot my own. thus:

III trouble to be troubled.

II greater presence ot mind. in their distress. than any people
that ever IIII met with: that their unhappy nation and the
Portuguese were the worst men in the world to struggle with
misfortunes; for that their first step in dangers. after the com-
nIon ell'orts were over. was to despair. lie. down under it. and
die. without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for
escape.

I told him their case and mine diil'ered eseeediIIglI-I . that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries. without
snpplI of food. or present sustenance till they could provide:
that. it was true. I had this disadvantage and discomfort. that

more one that was able. and had humanity enough. to contri-

voyage ; l say. considering all this. hoth of them came to me.
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island.
and he entered among my family. as they 'alled it. I agreed
to this readily: and they had a little plot of ground allotted
to tlu-m. where they had three tents or houses set up. sur-
rounded with a basket-work. pallisadoed like :\tkins's. adjoin-
ing to his plantation. 'I'heir tents were eontrived so that they
had each of them a room apart to lodge in. and a middle tent.
like a great storehouse. to lay their goods in. and to eat and
drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their
habitation to the same plaee; and so the island was divided
into three eolonies. and no more. viz. the Spaniards. with old
Friday. and the tirst servants. at my old habitation under the
hill. whieh was. in a word. the 'apital eity: and where they
had so enlarged and extended their works. as well under as
on the outside of the hill. that they lived. though perfectly
eoneealed. yet full at large. Never was there sueh a little
eity in a wood. aml so hid. in any part of the world: for l
verily believe a thousand men might have. ranged the island a
month. and. if they had not. known there was sueh a thing.
and looked on purpose for it. they would not have found it:
for the trees stood so thiek aml so elose. amt grew so fast-
woveu one into another. that nothing but cutting them down
tirst eould discover the place. eseept the only two narrow
entrauees where they went in and out could be. found. which
was not very easy : one of them was close down at the water's
edge. on the side of the ereek, aml it was afterwards above
two hundred yards to the plaee; and the other was up a
ladder at twiee. as I have already formerly deseribed it: and
they had also a large wood thick-planted on the top of the
hill. eontaining above an acre. which grew apaee. and eon-
eealed the plaee from all diseovery there. with only one narrow
place between two trees. not easily to be disrovered. to enter
on that side.

The other colony was that of \V ill Atkins. where. there
were four families of Englishmen. I mean those I had left
there. with their wives and children ; three savag 's that were
slaves; the widow and the children of the, Englishman that
was killed: the. young man and the maid: and. by the way.
we made a wife of her before. we went away. There was also
the two carpenters aml the. tailor. whom I brought with me
for them; also the smith. who was a very neeessary man to
them. especially as a gnnsmith, to take 'are of their arms:
and my other man. whom I called Jack of all trades. who was
in himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was not only
a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow : and before
I went away we married him to the honest maid that came
with the vouth in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say
r314 Insz'rvIIss or

something of the. French eeelosiastic that I had brought with
me out of the ship's IIrIIII II how I took III I at sea. It is true.

I told him his carriage II as so modest. that I could not but
achuonledge it; that it II as true. we were such people as they
called hIIretiIIs. but that IIII was not the. first Iatholic I had
conI ersed II ith. without falling I into iIIconI enionees. or carrying
the questions to any height III debate, ' that he. should not find
himsell the II orso used for being of a diII'orent opinion from
us . and it' no did not eoIIIerse. without any dislike on either
side. it should be his fault. not ours.

He replied. that he thought all our conversation might be
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his business to
cap principles with every man he. IIonI'ersed with; and that he
rather desired me. to converse II ith him as a gentleman than
as a roligionist. and that. if I would give him leave at any time
to discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply

' .L-I.-~__MM
with it. and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also
to defend his own opinions as well as he could ; but that. without
my leave. he would not break in upon me with any such thing.
He told me further. that he would not cease to do all that
became him. in his otlice as a priest as well as a private
Christian. to procure the good of the ship. and the safety of
all that was in her; and though, perhaps. We would not Join
with him, and he could not pray with us. he hoped he might
pray for us. which he would do upon all occasions. In this
manner we conversed: and. as he was of the most obliging.
gentlemanlike behaviour. so he was. if I may be allowed to say
so. a man of good sense. and. as I believe. of great learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the
many extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which
had bet'alleu him in the few years that he had been abroad in
the world ; and particularly this was very remarkable. viz. that
in the voyage he Was now engaged in. he had the misfortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped. and never to go to the
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed.
That his first intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he
went on board a ship bound thither at St. Male: but. being
forced into Lisbon by bad weather. the ship received some
damage by running aground in the mouth of the river Tagus.
and was obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a
Portuguese ship there bound to the. Madeiras, and ready to
sail. and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there
bound to Martiuico, he went on board. in order to sail to the
Madeiras; but the. master of the Portuguese ship. being but
an inditli'rent mariner. had been out of his reckoning. and they
drove to Fayal; where. however. he happened to find a very
good market for his cargo, which was com. and therefore
resolved not to go to the Madeiras. but to load salt at the isle
of May. and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy
in this exigenee but to go with the ship. and had a pretty good
voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the place where they
catch the fish); where. meeting with a French ship bound
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada. and from
thence to Martinico. to carry provisions, be thought he should
have. an opportunity to complete his first design; but when he
came to Quebec the master of the ship died, and the vessel
proceeded no farther: so the next voyage be shipped himself
for France. in the ship that was burned when we took them
up at sea; and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I
have already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five
v0yages, all, as I may call it. in one voyage, besides what I
shall have occasion to mention farther of the same person. . _
But I shall not make digression into other men's stones,
which have no relation to my own: I return to what concerns

our afl'airs in the island.

SECTION XXXVIII.

ROBINSON'S DISCOURSE WITH THE MLESlASTlC AS TO INTRODUCING MARRIAGES
AMONG THE PEOPLE--MARRIAGE PERFORMED.--A1KINS CONVERTS HIS WIFE.

HE came to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the
while we were upon the island, and it happened to be just when
I was going to visit the Englishmen's colouy, at the farthest
part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me, with a
very grave countenance, that he had for two or three days
desired an opportunity of some discourse with me, which he
hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he thought it
might in some measure correspond with my general design,
which was, the prosperity of my new colony, and perhaps
might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, in the.
way of God's blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse,
and turning a little short, How, sir, said I, can 'it be said that
we are not in the way of God's blessing, after such visible
assistances and wonderful deliverances as we have seen here.
and of which I have given you a large account ?--If you had
pleased, sir, said he, with a world of modesty, and yet with
great readiness, to have heard me, you would have found no
room to be displeased, much less to think so hard of me, that
I should suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances
and deliveranccs; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in
the way of God's blessing, as your design is exceeding good.
and will prosper: but, sir, though it were more so than is
even possible to you, yet there may be some among you that
arenot equally right in their actions: and you know, that in
the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in the campIIoIIIssoN meson. 3l7

removed God's blessing from them. and turned his hand so
against them. that six and thirty ot' them.though not concerned
in the crime. were the objects ot divine vengeance. and bore
the II eIght ot that punishment.

l was sensibly touched with his discourse. and told him his
inference was so just. and the whole design seemed so sincere.
and II us really so religious III its own nature. that l was very
sorrI I lmd interrupted him. and begged him to go on: and.
in the menu time. because it seemed that what we had both to
say might take up some time. I told him I was going to the
II} nglislunen' s phmtatious. IIIIII asked him to go with me. and
IIII might discourse of it by the way. He told IIIII he would
the more willingly wait on IIIII thither. because there. partly
the thing II as acted which he desired to speak to me about; so
II II II alked on. and I pressed him to be tree and plain with me.
in what he had to say.

\V by then. sir. saIs he. be pleased to give IIIII leave to lay
down a few propositions. as the foundation at what I have to
saI. that Wt' may not ditl'cr III the general principles. though
we quI be of some ditleriug opinions in the practice at particu-
lars. IIirst. sir. though IIII ditler in some ot the doctrinal
articles of religion. and it is very unhappy it is so. especially
in the Iase before us. as I shall show afterwards. yet there are
some general principles in which we hoth agree. viz. that there.
is II God. . and that this God haI iug giIeII us some stated general
rules for our \t'l" Ice and obedience. we. ought not willingly
and knowingly to otl'eud him. either by neglecting to do what
he has commanded. or by doing what he has expressly tor-
hidden; and let our ditlereut reli gions be what the will. this
general principle Is readily owned by us all. thatt Ie blessing
ot trod does not ordIIIarIlI t'ollow presumptuous siuning against
his comnnde . and every good (.hristian will be ati'ectionately
concerned to prevent any that are under his care living In a
total neglect of God and his cmnmands. It Is not your men
being Protestants. II hateIcr my opinion may lIII ot such. that
discharges me. from being concerned for their souls. and from
endeavouring. it' it lies hIIt tore IIIII. that they should live III as
little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible. espe-
I iallI it you <<he IIIII leave to meddle. so tar III your circuit.

I could not IIIt imagine what he aimed at. and told him I
granted all he had said. and thanked him that he would so
tar concern himselt tor IIsI . and begged he would explain the
particulars of what he had observed. that. like Joshua. to
take his own parable. I might put away the accursed thing
trom us.

\Vhy then. sir. says he. I will take the liberty you give me. .
and there are three things. II inch. if I am right. must stand In
the way of God s blessing upon Iour endeavours here. and
Which l should rejoice. tor your sake. and their own. to see.
removed: and. sir. I promise myself that you will fully agree
with me in them all, as soon as I name them; especially
because I shall convince you that every one of them may, with
great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be remedied.
First, sir, says he, you have here four Englishmen, who have
fetched women from among the savages, and have taken them
as their wives, and have had many children by them all, and
yet are not married to them after any stated, legal manner,as
the laws of God and man require; and therefore are yet, in
the sense of both, no less than fornicators, if not living in
adultery. To this, sir, I know you will object that there was
no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to
perform the ceremony, nor any pen and ink, or paper, to
write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between
them: and I know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has
told you, I mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to
make when they took those women, viz. that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the wa1, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement
with the women, as wives, but only an agreement among
themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. But, sir, the
essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called it, being a
Roman) consists not only 1n the mutual consent of the parties
to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal and
legal obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the man
and woman, at all times, to 01m and acknowledge each other ,
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to engage in
no other contract while these subsist, and, on all occasions, as
ability allows, to provide honestly for them and their children ,
and to oblige the women to the same, or like conditions,
mutatis mutandis, on their side. Now sir, says he, these men
may, when they please or when occasion presents, abandon
these women, disown their children, leave them to perish, and
take other women, and marry them while these are living:
and here he added; with some warmth, How, sir, is God
honoured in this unlawful liberty? and how shall a blessing
succeed your endeavours in this place, however good 1n them-
selves, and however sincere in your design, while these men,
who at present are your subjects, under your absolute govern-
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to li1e in open

adultery. '
I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more

with the convincing arguments he supported it with; for it
was certainly true, that though they had no clergyman upon
the spot, yet a formal contract on both sides, made before
witnesses, and confirmed by any token which they had all
agreed to be bound by, though it had been but breaking a
stick between them, engaging the men to own these women for
their wives upon all occasions, and never to abandon them or
their children, and the women to the same with their husbands,
had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God; andl

3. was done when

ROBINSON causes. 319

' it was a great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to

have got off my 1young; priest by telling him that all that part
was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past re-

? medy; they could do nothing in it now.

Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom, you are

, right in this, that, it being done in your absence. you could not

1 be charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you,

flatter not yourself that you are not therefore under an obliga-
tion to do your utmost now to put an end to it. How can you
think but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all the
guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon you? because it is

. certainly in your power now to put an end to it, and in nobody's

power but yours.

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; but I
imagined that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should
part them, and not suffer them to live together any longer:
and I said to him I could not do that, by any means, for that
it would put the whole island into confusion. He seemed
surprised that I should so far mistake him. No, sir, says he,
I do not mean that you should now separate them, but legally
and effectually marry them now; and as. sir, my way of
marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to, though
it will be effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may
he as well before God, and as valid among men; I mean, by
a written contract signed by both man and woman, and by all
the witnesses present, which all the laws of EurOpe would
decree to be valid.

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sin--
cerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse
as to his own party or church, and such true warmth for pre-
serving the people that he had no knowledge of or relation to;
I sa , for preserving them from transgressing the laws of God,
the ike of which I had indeed not met with any where : but,
recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a written
contract. which I knew he would stand to, I returned it back
upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse with
the men upon the point now, when I came to them; and I
knew no reason why they should scruple to let him marry
them all, which I knew well enough would be granted to be
as authentic and valid in England as if they were married by
one of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done in this
matter, I shall speak of by itself.

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much
his debtor for the first. and thanked him heartily for it. He
told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the
second, and hOped I w0uld take it as well; and this. was,.that
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine. as he called
them. had III ed with those women for almost seven I'.ears had
taught them to speak English. and even to read it. and that
they were. as he pereeu ed II omen ot tolerable understanding.
and capable ot instruction. In they had not. to this hour.

and instruct them: and it I'on giI'e IIIII III IIe. and God his

particular taith we all embrace. and that m en while. you stay
here Upon this I said. I shall not only giIe you IIIaIII. but
give you II thousand thanks for it. What followed on this
account. I shall mention also again in its place.

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame. Why. really. says lIII. it is of the same nature; and I
will proceed. IIsIIiIIII,I your leave. with the same plainness as
before. . it is about IoIIr poor savages. who are. as I may say.
your conquered subjects. It Is II IIIasiIn. sir. that Is. or ought
to IIII. rIIIIIIiIIeIl IIIIIoIIg IIII Christians. of II but church or pre-

IIioIIs. It Is on this principle that our church III-ads Inissionaries
iIIto Persia. India. (' lIinII: and that our clergy. eveu ot the
superior sort. willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages.
and the most dangerous residence among IIIIIrdeIIers IIIIII bar-
barians. to teach them the knowledg I of the true God. and to
bring them over to embrace the 'hristian faith. Now. sir.
you have such an opportunity here. to have six or seven IIIIII
IlIirtI poor sava-ges brought over trom idolatry to the know-
ledge ot t-oIl. their Maker and IIIIdeIIIIIIIr. that I wonder how
you can pass such IIII ocI asion of doing}, Iood. whiI b Is really
worth the II\peIIsII III II IIIIIII s whole life.

I was now struck IIIIIIIb. indeed. IIIIII IIIIII not one word to
say. I had here a spirit of true. Christian 201" for God and
religion before me. let his particular principles be of what kind
soI-I er as for IIIII. I IIIIII not so much as entertained II thought
u! this III IIII III-art before. and I believe I should not have
thought III it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves. and
people whom. had II II IIIIII IIIII work for them to do. we would
have used as such. or would have been glad to have transported
tlIeIII III any other part of the world: for our business was to
get rid oI them: IIIIII We would all have been satisfied if they
had been sent to any IIoIIIItrv. so they had never seen their
own. But to the ease :--I say. I was confounded at his dis-
course. IIIIII knew not what answer to make him.

IIII looked earnestly at IIIII. sIIIIiIIII me in some disorder-
Sir. says he. I shall beI IIIry sorrv it what I have said gives
Ion IIIII/ otI'IIucII. ---No. no. said I. I IIIII offended with nobody
but my self; but I IIIII perfectly confounded. not only to think
that I should never take any notice of this before. but with
reflecting what when I IIIII able to take of It now. You know.
sir. said I. what IIirIIIIIIIstIIIIIIIIs I am in. I I am bound to the

Would be an insutI'IIrIIble piece of injustice to detain their ship
here. the IIIIIII lIiIIg all this while at I iotnals and wages on the

eight days more. and I have been here thirteen alreadyIIlo
that I am perfectly unable. to engage. in this work. unless I
would suffer myself to be left behind here again: in which
case. it this siIIIrle ship should IIIisIIarry in any part of her
_\'IoI age. I should be just in the same condition that I was left
in here at first. and from which I have been so wonderfully

P 3
delivered. He owned the case was very hard upon me, as to '

my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether
the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth ven-
turing all I had in the world for. I was not so sensible of
that as he was. I returned upon him thus: Why, sir, it is a
valuable thing, indeed, to be an instrument in God's hand to
convert thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but
as you are an ecclesiastic. and are given over to the work, so
that it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your profession,
how is it then that you do not rather ofi'er yourself to undertake
it, than press me to do it!

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along.
and putting me to a full stop, made me. a very low how. I
most heartily thank God and you. sir, said he, for giving me
so evident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think our-
self discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, will
most readily do it. and think it a happy reward for all the
hazards and difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage

as l have met with, that I am dropped at least into so glorious
a work.

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke '

this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and
his colour came and went. as if he had been falling into fits:
in a word. he was fired with the joy of being embarked in such
a work. I paused a considerable while before I could tell
what to say to him; for l was really surprised to find a man
of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ordinary rate of men. not of his profession only, but even
of any profession whatsoever. But after I had considered it
awhile, i asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he
would venture. on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for

perhaps his life. and at last might not know whether he should
be able to do them good or not '2

He. turned short upon me. and asked me what I called a

venture? Pray, sir, said be, what do you think I consented to :

go in your ship to the East Indies fort--Nay, said I, that I
know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians.---Doubtless
it was, said he: and do you think, if I can convert these
thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ. it is not worth
my time, though I should never be fetched oil' the island again!
nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls
than my life. is, or the life .of twenty more of the same profes-
sion? Yes, sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed
Virgin thanks all my days, if I could he made the least happy
instrument of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were

never to set my foot otl' this island, or see my native country .

any more. But since on will honour me with putting me
into this work, for whic I will pray for you all the days of
my life, I have one humble petition to you besides--What is
that? said I. Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your
man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to
assist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or
they to me.

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons:
he had been the companion of my travels; he was not only
faithful to me, but sincerely afi'ectionate to the last degree;
and I had resolved to do something considerable for him if he
outlived me. as it was probable he would. Then I knew that
as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite
confound him to bring him to embrace another profession;
and he would never, while his eyes were open. believe that his
old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and this
might. in the end, ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn
him back again to his first idolatry. However, a sudden
thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I told him
I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any
account whatever, though a work that to him was of more
value than his life. ought to be to me of much more value than
the keeping or parting with a servant. But, on the other hand.
I was persuaded that Friday would by no means agree to part
with me; and I could not force him to it without his consent,
without manifest injustice: because I had promised I would
never put him away, and he had promised and engaged to me
that he would never leave me unless I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one
word of their language, nor they one. word of his. To remove
this difficulty, I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood, and he should serve him as
an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to con-
Vfil'tl them; but Providence gave another very happy turn to
a t iis.

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When
we came to the Englishmen. I sent for them all together, and
after some account given them of what I had done for them,
viz. what necessary things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were very sensible of. and
very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous
life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the
clergyman had taken of it; and arguing how unchristian and
irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were married
men or bachelors? They soon explained their conditions to
me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the other
three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them With what
conscience they could take those women, and lie vnth them as
they had done call them their II Ives, and have so many chil-
dren by them. and not be lawtnl|_I married to them!

"I hey all gIIIe IIIII the meme r I expect t.ed viz. that there was

to keep them as their W'i'l's. and to maintain them and own

companions. I desired. the French gentleman not to say anv
thing to them till the business was thorough ripe; and l tolil
him what answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter. they all -ame to me. and
told me they had been considering what I had said; that they
were glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company. and they
were very willing to give me the satistaetlon I desired. and to
be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were far
from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest when they chose them. So
I appointed them to meet me the next morning; and. in the
mean time. they should let their wives know the meaning of
the marriage. law; and that it was not only to prevent any
seandal. but also to oblige them that they should not tbrsake
them. whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the
thing. and were very well satislied with it. as indeed they had
reason to be: so they failed not to attend all tog ether at my
apartment next morning. where I brought out my clergyman;
aml though he. had not on a minister's gown. after the manner
of England. or the habit of a priest. after the manner of Franee.
yet having a blaek vest. something like a eassmtk. with a sash
round it. he did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his
language. I was his interpreter. But the seriousness of his
behaviour to them. and the sernples he made of marrying the
women beeause they were not baptized and protessed Chris-
tians. gave them an eseeeding reverence for his person : and
there was no need. after that. to inquire whether he was a
clergyman or not. Indeed. I was afraid his sernples would
have been carried so far. as that he would not have married
them at all ; nay. notwithstamling all I was able to say to him.
he resisted me. though modestly. yet very steadily: and at last
refused absolutely to marry them. unless he had first talked
with the men and the. women too; and though at first I was a
little backward to it. yet at last I agreed to it with a good will.
pereeiving the. sincerity of his design.

When he 'ame to them. he let them know that I had ae-
quaiuted him with their cireumstam'es. and with the present
design; that he was very willing to perform that part of his
function. and marrv them. as I had desired: but that. before
he eonld do it. he inust take the liberty to talk with them. He
told them. that in the sight of all iuditli'rent men. and in the
sense of the laws of society. they had lived all this while in
open tbrni'ation; and that it was true, that nothing but the
eonsenting to marry. or elfeetually separating them from one
another. eonld now put an end to it; but there was a ditlicnlty
in it too. with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony.
which he was not fully satisfied about. viz. that of marrying
one that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolater and
a heathen, one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not -
see that there was time left to endeavour to persuade the
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom
they had. he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which
they could not be baptized. He told them he doubted they
were but indifferent Christians themselves; that they had but
little knowledge of God or of his ways. and therefore he could
not expect that they had said much to their wives on that head
yet; but that, unless they would promise him to use their
endeavours with their wives to persuade them to become Chris-
tians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them in the
knowledge. and belief of God that made them. and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them;
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages ;
nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian reli-
gion, and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law.

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as l
eould ; only sometimes adding something of my own, to con-
vince them how just it was, and how I was of his mind: and I
always very faithfully distinguished between what I said from
myself. and what were the clergymau's words. They told me
it was very true what the. gentleman said, that they were very
indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had never
talked to their wives about religion. Lord, sir, says \Vill
Atkins, how should we teach them religion! wh . we know
nothing ourselves; and besides, sir, said he, sbou d we talk to
them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it would
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves?
And if we should tell them that we believe all the things we
speak of to them, such as of good people oing to heaven, and
wicked people to the devil, the would as ' us where we intend
to go ourselves. that believe allthis, and are such wicked fel-
lows as we indeed are 2 Why, sir, 'tis enough to give them a
surfcit of religion at first hearing; folks must have some reli-
gion themselves before they pretend to teach other people.--
\V ill Atkins. said I to him, though I am afraid that what you
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she
is in the wrong; that there is a God, and a religion better than
her own; that her gods are idols: that they can neither hear
nor speak; that there is a great Being that made all things.
and that can destroy all that he has made; that he rewards
the good and punishes the bad; and that we are to be judged
by him at last for all we do here? You are not so ignorant,
but even nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and
I am satisfied you know it all to be true. and believe it your-
self--That is true, sir. said Atkins; but with what face can I
say any thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell me
immediately it cannot be true ?---Not true! said I; what do
you mean by that ?--Why, sir, said he, she will tell me it can-
not be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or can
punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the
devil, that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to every body else; and that I
should be sutl'ered to live, that" have been always acting so
contrary to what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought
to have done.---Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou
speakcst too much truth; and with that [ informed the clergy-
man of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know.
0, said the priest, tell him there is one thing will make him
the best minister in the world to his wife, and that is, repent-
ance; for none teach repentance like true penitents. He wants
nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the better
qualified to instruct his wife: he will then be able to tell her
that there is not only a God, and that he is the just rewarder
of good and evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and with
infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to punish those
that offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live: that
oftentimes he suffers wicked men to go a long time, and even
reserves damnation to the general day of retribution: that it
is a clear evidence of God and of a future state, that righteous
men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment,
till they come into another world; and this will lead him to
teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last
judgment. Let him but repent for himself, he will be an excel-
lent preacher of repentance to his wife.

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all
the while. and who, we could easily perceive, was more than
ordinarily affected with it: when being eager, and hardly suf-
fering me to make an end--I know all this, master, says he,
and a great deal more; but I have not the impudence to talk
thus to my wife. when God and my conscience know, and my
wife will be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have
lived as if I had never heard of a God or future state, or an
thing about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and wit
that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the tears stood
in his eyes), 'tis past all that with me.~--Past it, Atkins? said
I ; what dost thou mean by that '!---I know well enough what I
mean, says he; I mean 'tis too late, and that is too true.

I told the cler man, word for word, what he said: the poor
zealous priest,-- must call him so, for, be his opinion what it
will, he had certainly a most singular affection for the good of
other men's souls, and it would be hard to think he had not the
like for his own,--I say, this affectionate man could not refrain
from tears; but, recovering himself, said to me," Ask him but
one question: Is be easy that it is too late; or is be troubled,
and wishes it were not so? I put the question fairly to Atkins;
and. he answered. with a great deal of passion, How could any .
man be easy in a condition that must certainly end in eternal
destruction .' that he was far from being easy; but that, on the
contrary, he believed it would, one time or other. ruin him.
What do you mean by that! said I. 'Why. he said, he believed
he should one time or other cut his throat, to put an end to the
terror of it.

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his
face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon
it, says, If that be his case, we may assure him it is not too
late; Christ will give him repentance. But, pray. savs he.
explain this to him; that as no man is saved but by Christ.
and the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him,
how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he
think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine
mercy! Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear,
but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we.
that are Christ's servants. are commanded to preach mercy at
all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely
repent; so that it is never too late to repent.

[ told Atkins all this. and he heard me with great earnest-
ness; but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest.
for he said to me. he would go and have some talk with his
wife; so he went out awhile. and we talked to the rest. I
perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of reli-
gion, as much as I was when I went rambling away from my
father; and yet there were none of them backward to hear
what had been said; and all of them seriously promised that
they would talk with their wives about it. and do their endea-
vours to persuade them to turn Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer
they gave. but said nothing a good while; but at last shaking
his head. We that are Christ's servants. says he, can go no
farther than to exhort and instruct; and when men comply.
submit to the reproot'. and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can
do; we are bound to accept their good words; but. believe me.
sir. said he. whatever you may have known of the life of that
man you call Will Atkins. I believe he is the only sincere con-
vert among them: I take that man to be a true penitent: I will
not despair of the rest: but that man is apparently struck with
the sense of his past life. and I doubt not, when he comes to
talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into
it; for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of
teaching ourselves. I know a man. who. having nothing but a
summary notion of religion himself. and being wicked and
profiigate to the last degree in his life. made a thorough re-
formation in himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that
poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
- to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a thorough
convert, makes himself a penitent, and who knows what may
follow 2
, Upon this discourse, however, and their promising. as above,
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity,
he married the other two couple; but \Vill Atkins and his wife
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile,
was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and turning to
me, said, I entreat ou, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth
here, and look; I are say we shall find this poor man some-
where or other talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her
already something of religion. I began to be of the same
mind; so we went out together, and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very thick
that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and
far harder to see in than to see out; when coming to the edge
of the wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse: I stopped short till
my clergyman came up to me, and then having showed him
where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
gOod while. We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and then
down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the woods, to the trees. Now, says the clergyman. you
see my words are made good, the man preaches to her; mark
him now, he is telling her that our God has made him and her,
and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c.--
I believe he is. said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins
start upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his
hands. We supposed he said something, but we could not hear
him; it was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half
a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks
to her again; we perceived then the woman very attentive, but
whether she said any thing to him, we could not tell. While
the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the tears run
plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks, and I could hardly
forbear myself; but it was a great afiliction to us both that we
were not near enough to hear any thing that passed between
them. Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear of
disturbing them; so we resolved to see an end of this piece of
still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without the
help of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her.
and talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times we
could see him embrace her most passionately; another time we
saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then
kiss her again, with a kind of transport very unusual ; and after
several of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again,
and lend her his hand to help her up, when immediately lead-330 Invsx 'l' uni-:s or

together. and continued so about two minutes.

have the same charity for us: I pray daily for your being all

' pray to God, though they were all to be protestants at first,
rather than they should continue pagans or heatheus; tirmly
believing. that he that had bestowed the first light to them

SECTION XXXIX.

ATKINS RELATES HIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS WIFE.--'I'IIE LATTER BAI'TIZED
BY THE PRIESTo--'AOCOUNT OF THE S'I'ARVING STATE OF THOSE ON BOARD 'I'IlI-J
RESCUED VESSEL--ROBINSON'S DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND.

I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious
papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reason-
ing; and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such a
temper was universal. we might be all catholic Christians,
whatever church or particular profession we joined in; that a
spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right prin-
ciples; and as he thought that the like charity would make us
all catholics, so I told him I believed had all the members of
his church the like moderation, they would soon all be pro--
testants.--And there we left that part; for we never disputed
at all.

However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by
the hand, My friend, says I, Iwish all the clergy of the Romish
church were blest with such moderation, and had an equal share
of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion: but I must
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or
Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition.----It may be 50,
said he; I know not what they would do in Spain or Italy;
but I will not say they would be the better Christians for that
severity; for I am sure there is no heresy in abounding with
charity.

As \Vill Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there
was over, so we went back our own way ; and when we came
back, we found them waiting to be called in: observing this, I
asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had
seen him under the bush or not: and it was his opinion we
should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear what
he would say to us; so we called him in alone, nobody being
in the place but ourselves, and I began with him thus:

Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you 1' What
was our father? '

.A. A better man than ever I shall be: Sir, my father
was a clergyman.

R. C. What education did he give you?

W. A. He would have taught me well, sir; -but I despised
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was.

R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that despises reproof is
brutish.

W. A. Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered my
father: for God's. sake, sir, talk no more about that; sir, I
murdered my poor father.

Pn. Ha! a murderer!

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as he
spoke) and looked pale: it seems he believed that Will had
really killed his father.

R. C. N o, no, sir, I do not understand him so: Will Atkins,
explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with
your own hands?

W. A. No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the thread
of all his comforts, and shortened his days: I broke his heart
by the most ungrateful, unnatural return, for the most tender
and afi'ectionate treatment that father ever gave, or child could
receive.

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort
this confession: I pray God give you repentance for it, and
forgive that and all your other sins; but I asked you because
I see that though you have not much learning, yet you are not
so ignorant as some are in things that are good; that you have
known more of religion, a great deal, than on have practised.

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort e confession that I
make about my father, conscience does; and whenever we
come to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indul-
gent pareuts are certainly the first that touch us; the wounds
they make lie deepest, and the weight they leave will lie
heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins;
I cannot hear it.

{W. A. You hear it, master! I dare say you know nothing
0 it. -

R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say
every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul
for my ingratitude and bad usage of a good, tender father; a
father much like yours, by our description : and I murdered
my father as well as you, ill Atkins; but I think, for all
that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.

I would have said more, if I could have restrained my pas-
sions; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much
sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave of the discourse
and retire; for I was surprised with what he had said, and
thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, Did I not say, sir, that when
this man was converted he would preach to us all? I tell you,
sir, if this one man be made a true penitent, here will be no
need of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.--But
having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with
Will Atkins. But Will, said I, how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now?

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a
dart through my very soul ; I have been talking about God and
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian of her, and she has preached such a sermon to me as
I shall never forget while I live.

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you; but
when you were moving re igious arguments to her, conscience
has flung them back upon you.

W. A. Aye, sir, with such force as is not to be resisted.

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you
and your wife; for I know something of it already.

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it;
I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it;
but let her have said what she will. and though I cannot give
you an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved
to amend and reform my life.

B. C. But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will?
For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She
has preached a sermon, indeed, if she has wrought this upon

on.

y W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws about
marriage, and what the reasons were that men and women were
obliged to enter into such compacts, as it was neither in the
power of one nor other to break: that otherwise, order and
justice could not be maintained, and men would run from their
wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families he kept entire, nor inheritances
be settled by legal descent.

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her
understand what you meant by inheritance and families? They
know no such things among the savages, but marry any how.
without regard to relation, consanguinity, or family; brother
and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father and the
daughter, and the son and the mother.

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps,
for any farther relations, they may not be so exact as we are;
but she tells me they never touch one another in the near
relationship you speak of.

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much
better than in her count-y.

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?

W. A. Ay, ay; there began our dialogue. I asked her if
she would be married to me our way. She asked me what way
that was. I told her marriage was appointed by God; and here
we had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife
had, I believe.

N. B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I
took down in writing, just after he had told it me, which was
as follows:

WIFE. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in
your country?

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.

WIFE. No your God in my country; my country have the
great old Benamuckee God.

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is;
God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea,
and all that in them is.

WIFE. No makee de earth; no you God makee all earth;
no makee my country.

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.

WIFE. No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to laugh.

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious
than he at first.

d W. A. That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any more, my
ear.

Wire. Why, you say you God makee all?

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you
and me, and all things; for he is the only true God, and there
is no God but him; he lives for ever in heaven.

W1 re. Why, you no tell me long ago?

W. A. That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wretch.
and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing
before, but have lived without God in the world myself.

WIFE. What, have you a great God in your country, you
no know him? No say 0 to him? No do good thing for him?
That no possible.

W. A. It is true ; though, for all that, we live as if there was
no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

WIFE. But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you
good live?

W. A. It is all our own fault.
WIFE. But you say me he is great, much great, have much
great power, can makee kill when he will, why he no makee
kill when you no serve him, no say 0 to him, no be good
mans 1'

W. A. That is true, he might strike me dead; and I ought
to expect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but
God is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.

Wire. But then do you not tell God thankee for that too?

W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy,
any more than I have feared God for his power.

WIFE. Then you God no God; me no think believe he be
such one, great much power, strong: no makee kill you, though
you make him so much angry.

W. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing
in God? What a dreadful creature am I ! and what a sad truth
is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the conversion
of heathens!

WIFE. How me think you have great much God up there
(she points up to heaven), and yet no do well, no do good thing?
Can he tell? Sure he no tell what you do?

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hears us
speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do
not speak. -

WIFE. What! he no hear you curse, swear, speak de great
damn ? .

W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. -

WIFE. Where he then the much great power strong?

W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this
proves him to be the true God; he is God, and not man, and
therefore we are not consumed.

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror. to
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and
hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that
we do, and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he
had done.

WIFE. Merciful! What you call that!

W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities and
spares us.

WIFE. So then he never makes kill, never angry when you
do wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able.

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely
great, and able to punish too; and sometimes. to show his
justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger to destroy sinners
and make examples; many are cut of in their sins.

WIFE. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you, may
be, that he no makee you kill: so you makee de bargain with
him, you do bad thing, he no be angry at you when he be angry
at other mans. _

W. A. No. indeed; my sins are all presumptions upon his

1

i
goodness; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me.
as he has done other men. '

WIFE. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what
yon,say to him for that? You no tell him thankee for all that
too .

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true.

WIFE. Why he no makee you much good better? you say
he makes you.

W. A. He made me, as he made all the world: it is I have
deformed myself and abused his goodness, and made myself an
abominable wretch.

WIFE. I wish you makee God know me; I no makes him
angry, I no do bad wicked thing.

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a
poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and
he such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her
about God, but what the reproach of his own carriage would
make most irrational to her to believe; nay, thatalready she
had told him that she could not believe in God, because he.
that was so wicked, was not destroyed.

W. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to
know God, not God to know you; for he knows you already,
and every thought in your heart.

Wire. Why then he know what I say to you now; he
know me wish to know him; how shall me know who makes
me 1'

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach
thee ; I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive
me, that am unworthy to teach thee.

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him
to make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he
said he fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God
to enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and to pardon his sins. and accept of his being the
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of
religion: after which he sat down by her again, and their
dialogue went on.--'l'his was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and hold up his hands.

WIFE. What you put down the knee for? What you hold
up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What
is all that?

W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submission
to him that made me; I said O to him, as you call it; and as
yozr old men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed
to im.

Wire. What you say 0 to him for?

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes, and (your under-
standing, that you may know him, and be accepte by him.

er2. Can he do that too? '

Q
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.

WIFE. But now he hear what you say!

W. A. Yes; he has bid us pray to him, and promised to
hear us.

Wire. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid
you? What, you hear him speak?

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that
God has revealed himself to us by his word, and what his
word was; but at last he told it her thus:

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former days.
even from heaven, by plain words; and God has inspired
good men by his Spirit; and they have written all his laws
down in a book.

WIFE. Me no understand that; where is book?

\V. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book; but
I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and help you
to read it.

Here he embraced her with great affection; but with inex-
pressible grief that he had not a Bible.

WIFE. But how you makee me know that God teachee them
to write that book?

IV. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God.

WIFE. \Vhat rule? What way you know him?

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but what
is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly
good, as well as perfectly happy; and because he forbids, and
commands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself,
or evil in its consequence.

WIFE. That me would understand, that me fain see: if he
teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all
thing. he hear me when I say 0 to him, as you do just now;
he makes me good, if I wish to be good; he spare me, no
makee kill me, when I no be good: all this you say he do, yet
he be great God: me take, think, believe him to be great
God; we say 0 to him with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her
up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to
instruct her in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and
that by some good providence, if possible, she might some
time or other come to have a Bible, that she might read the
word of God, and be taught by it to know him.--This was the
time that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and saw him
kneel down by her, as above. _

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too
long to be set down here; and particularly she made him
promise that since he confessed his own life had been a wicked
abominable course of provocations against God, that he would
reform it, and not make God angry any more; lest he should
make him dead, as she called it, and then she would be left
alone, and never be taught to know this God better; and lest

he should be miserable. as he had told her wicked men would
be, after death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both,
but particularly to the young clergyman; he was indeed
wonderfully surprised with it, but under the greatest amiction
imaginable that he could not talk to her, that he could not
speak English, to make her understand him; and as she spoke
but very broken English, he could not understand her; how-
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me that he believed
that there must be more to do with this woman than to marry
her. I did not understand him at first, but at length he
explained himself, viz. that she onghtto be baptized. I agreed
with him in that part readily, and was for going about it
presently. No, no; hold, sir, said he; though I would have
her be baptized by all means, yet I must observe that Will
Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life, and has given
her just ideas of the being of a God; of his power, justice, and
mercy: yet I desire to know of him if he has said any thing to
her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the
nature of faith in him, and redemption by him: of the Holy
Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and a future state.

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor
fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said
something to her of all those things, but that he was himself so
wicked a creature, and his own conscience so reproached him
with his horrid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehen-
sions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention
she should give to those things, and make her rather contemn
religion than receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her
mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those
things, and that if I would but discourse with her, she would
make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not be
lost upon her.

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as inter-
preter between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated
him to begin with her; but sure such a sermou was never
preached by a popish priest in these latter ages of the world :
and, as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error
of a Roman catholic; and that I took him to be such a clergy-
man as the Roman bishops were, before the church of Rome
assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men.
In a word. he brought the poor woman to embrace the know-
ledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder'
and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a God,

Q 2
but with joy and faith; with an afl'ection, and a su rising
degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined. much ess to
be expressed; and, at her own request, she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that
he would perform that oflice with some caution, that the man
might not perceive he was of the Roman church, if possible,
because of other ill consequences which might attend a difi'er-
ence among us in that very religion which we were instructing
the other in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel,
nor proper things for the office, I should see he would do it in
a manner that I should not know by it that he was a Roman
catholic myself, if I had not known it before; and so he did;
for saying only some words over to himself in Latin, which I
could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water
upon the woman's head. pronouncing in French very loud.
" Mary" (which was the name her husband desired me to
give her, for I was her godfather), " I baptize thee in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;"
so that none could know any thing by it what religion he was
of. He gave the benediction afterwards in Latin, but either
Will Atkins did not know but it was French, or else did not
take notice of it at that time.

As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the
marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very
affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in, but to support the couvictions
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his
crimes: represented to him how God had honoured him with
being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of
the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he did
not dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did, he would
see the heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage
converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great
many good things to them both; and then recommending
them to God's goodness, gave them the benediction again, I
repeating every thing to them in English; and thus ended the
ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and agreeable
dag to me that ever I passed in my whole life.

ut my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts hung
continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages,
and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have under-
taken it; but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was
impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would
put it into a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction ;
of which by and by.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the
the young man I had taken out of the famished ship's company
came to me, and told me he understood I had a clergyman
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married
to the savages; that he had a match, too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two Christians, which
he hoped would not be disagreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island:
so I began to persuade him not to do any thing of that kind
rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary circum-
stance. I represented to him that he had some considerable
substance in the world, and good friends, as I understood by
himself, and the maid also; that the maid was not only poor,
and a servant, but was unequal to him, she being six or seven
and twenty years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen;
that he might very probably, with my assistance, make a
remove from this wilderness, and come into his own country
again; and that then it would be a thousand to one but he
would repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say more,
but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal
of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing
of that kind in his thoughts; and he was very glad to hear
that I had an intent of putting them in a way to see their own
country again; and nothing should have put him upon sta ing
there, but that the voyage I was going was so exceeding ong
and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the reach of
all his friends; that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I
would settle him in some little property in the island where he
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and
he would settle himself here like a planter, waiting the good
time when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem
them; and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I
came to England: that he would give me some letters to his
friends in London, to let them know how good I had been to
him, and in what part of the world, and what circumstance I
had left him in; and he promised me that whenever I redeemed
him, the plantation. and all the improvements he had made
upon it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly
mine.

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his
youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I
would deliver his letters, and do his business efl'ectually; and
that he might depend I should never forget the circumstances
I had left him in: but still I was impatient to know who was
the person to be married; upon which he told me it was my
Jack of all trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably
surprised when he named the match; for indeed I thought it
very suitable. The character of that man I have given already ;
and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and
religious young woman; had a very good share of sense, was
agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handsomely, and
to the purpose, always with decency and good manners, and
neither too backward to speak, when requisite, nor imperti-
nently forward, when it was not her business; very handy
and housewifely, and an excellent manager; fit, indeed, to
have been governess to the whole island, and she knew very
well how to behave in every respect.

The match being pr0posed in this manner, we married them
the same day; and as I was father at the altar, as I may say,
and gave her away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed
her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for
their plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal
the young gentleman made to give him a small pr0perty in the
island, put me upon parceling it out amongst them. that they
might not quarrel afterwards about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfect!
reformed, exceedingly pious and religious, and, as far as
may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily
believe he was a true penitent. He divided things so justly,
and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I
caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting
out the bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and
testifying that I gave them thereby severally a right to the
whole possession and inheritance of the respective plantations
or farms, with their improvements, to them and their heirs,
reserving all the rest of the island as my own property, and a
certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years,
if I, or any one from me, or in my name, came to demand it,
producing an attested copy of the same writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were
able to give themselves: only I made them promise me to live
in love and good neighbourhood with one another; and so I
prepared to leave them.

One thing I must not omit. and that is, that being new
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was but odd to have seven
and thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independent,
and, indeed, unemployed: for, excepting the providing them-
selves food, which they had difficulty enough to do sometimes,
they had no manner of business or property to manage. I
proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he should
go to them, with Friday's father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them into
their several families as servants, to be maintained for their
labour, but without being absolute slaves; for I would not
admit them to make them slaves by force, by any means;
because they had their liberty given them by capitulation, as it
were articles of surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all
very cheerful along with him: so we allotted them land, and
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in the several families we
had settled; and thus my colony was in a manner settled, as
follows :--The Spaniards possessed my original habitation.
which was the capital city, and extended their plantations all
along the side of the brook, which made the creek that I have
so often described, as far as my bower; and as they increased
their culture, it went always eastward. The En lish lived in
the north-east part, where Will Atkins and is comrades
began, and came on southward and south-west, towards the
back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great
addition of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that
they need not jostle one another for want of room. All the
east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any of the
savages should come on shore there only for their usual
customary barbarities, they might come and go; if they
disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them: and no doubt
but they were often ashore, and went away again, for I never
heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any
more.

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend
the clerg man that the work of converting the savages might
perhaps e set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and
told him that now I thought it was put in a fair way; for the
savages being thus divided among the Christians, if they would
but every one of them do their part with those which came
under their hands, I hoped it might have a very good effect.

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. But
how. says he, shall we obtain that of them? I told him we
would call them all together, and leave it in charge with them.
or go to them, one by one, which he thought best: so we
divided it, he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all papists,
and I to the English, who were all protestants; and we recom-
mended it earnestly to them. and made them promise that
they would never make any distinction of papist or protestant
in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but teach
them the general knowledge of the true God, and of their
Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that
they would never have any differences or disputes one with
another about religion.

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it so, for
such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was
not standing in the world again), there I found the young
woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were
become intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman,
had perfected the work Will Atkins had begun; and though
it was not above four days after what I have related, yet the
new-baptized savage woman was made such a Christian as I
have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation in
the world.

It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to
them, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with
them, I had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself
less considering for them than my good friend the widow was
for me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent than
ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort and
instruction of those that made much better use of them than I
had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to
Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman
and Atkins's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion
together, for Will Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy,
I asked if they were together now, and he said yes; so I went
into the house, and he with me, and we found them together
very earnest in discourse. 0 sir, sa s Will Atkins, when
God has sinners to reconcile to himse f, and aliens to bring
home, he never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new
instructor ; I knew I was as unworthy as I was incapable of
that work; that young woman has been sent hither from
heaven; she is enough to convert a whole island of savages.
The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I
desired her to sit still; I told her she had a good work upon
her hands, and I hoped God would bless her in it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book
among them, though I did not ask: but I put in hand into
my pocket, and pulled out my Bible; Here, says to Atkins,
I have brought you an assistant that perhaps you had not
before. The man was so confounded that he was not able to
speak for some time; but recovering himself, he takes it with
both his hands, and turning to his wife, Here, my dear, says
he, did not I tell you our God, though he lives above, could
hear what we said? Here's the book I prayed for when you
and I kneeled down under the bush; now ad has heard us,
and sent it. When he had said so, the man fell into such
transports of passionate joy, that between the joy of having it,
and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like
a child that was crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a
mistake that none of us were aware of, for she firmly believed
God had sent the book upon her husband's petition. It is
true, that providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a
consequent sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult
matter, at that time, to have persuaded the poor woman to
have believed that an express messenger came from heaven on
purpose to bring that individual book; but it was too serious
a matter to suffer any delusion to take place; so I turned to
the young woman, and told her we did not desire to impose
upon the new convert, in her first and more ignorant under-
standing of things, and begged her to explain to her that God
may be very properly said to answer our petitions, when, in
the course of his providence, such things are in a particular
manner brought to pass as we petitioned for; but we did not
expect returns from Heaven in a miraculous and particular
manner, and it is our mercy that it is not so.

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that
there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here; and I should
have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the
world to have had it so. But the surprise of joy upon Will
Atkins is really not to be expressed; and there, we may be
sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful
in the world for any thing of its kind than he was for the Bible;
nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a Bible from a better
principle; and though he had been a most profligate creature,
headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this man is
a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children, viz.
that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor
ever despair of the success of their endeavours, let the children
be ever so refractory, or, to appearance, insensihle of instruc-
tion ; for, if ever God, in his providence, touches the conscience
of such, the force of their education returns upon them, and
the early instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have
been many years laid asleep, but, some time or other, they
may find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man,
however ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge,
he found he had some to do with now more ignorant than
himself, and that the least part of the instruction of his good
father that now came to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his father
used to insist so much on the inexpressible value of the Bible,
the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons:
but he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now, when being to talk to heatheus, savages, and barbarians,
he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occa-
sion, though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our
ship, among their goods. which were not yet brought on shore.
And now having said so many things of this young woman, I

Q 3
cannot omit telflling one story more of her and myself, which
has something 111 it very informing and remarkable.

I have related to what extremity the poor 101111111 woman was
reduced how her mistress was st11r1 ed to death, and died on
board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole
ship's company was reduced to the last extremity. The gen-
tle11 oman and her son, and this maid, 11' ere first hardly used
as to proiisions, and at last totally neglected and starved, 1 that
is to say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.--Une day y.
being disc-nursing with her 011 the extremities they suilered, I
asked her it she could describe. by 11 hat she had felt, what it
was to star1' e. and 11011 it appeared. ' She told me. she believed
she could. and she told her tale very distinctly. thus:

First. sir, said she, we had for some days fared exceeding
haul, and snil'ered very great hunger: but at last we were
wholly 11 1th11ut food oi any kind, except sugar, and a little
wine and 11.1ter. The first day, after I had received no food
at all I found myself, towards evening, first empty and sick
at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to y 1111 ning and
sleep. I laid down 011 a couch in the great cabin to sleep,
and slept about three hours. and a1111Led a little refreshed.
l1a11ug taken a glass oi wine when I la1 down . after being
about three hours awake, it being about five 0 clock in the
111111111ng, I found myself empty. and my stomach sickish, and
lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and
ill. and thus I continued all the second day, with a strange
variety first hungr1, then si1 k a11'ain, 111th reachings to vomit.
The second night, being obliged to go to bed again without
any food, more than a draught oi fresh 11' ater. and being asleep.
I dreamed I 1111s at Barbadoes. and that the market was
mightil1 stocked with pro11s10ns, that I bought some. for my
mistress, and went and dined very heartil1. I thought my
stomach was as fall after this as it would have been after a
good dinner; but when l a11'aked, I 11113 exceedingly snnk' 111
1111' spirits to find my selfin the extremity oi famine. The last
glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of
its M1" 1110' some spirit to supply nourishment, but there being
no substance 111 the stomach tor the digesting office to work
upon, I found the only eilect of the nine was. to raise dis-
agreeable inmes from the stomach into the head, and I lay ,
as the1 told me, stupid and senseless, as One dr11i1k,for some
time. The third day, in the morning ,after a night ofstrange,
confused, and inconsistent dreamS. and rather dOlelg than
sleepi11g,l a11aked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I
question, had not m1- understanding returned and conquered
it. whether. it I had been a mother, and had had a little child
with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted
about three hours; during which time I was twice raging mad
as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and

as he can now inform you.
In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down, and

struck my face against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my
mistress lay, and, with the blow, the blood gushed out of my
nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin. I sat down
and bled into it a great deal; and as the blood came from me,
I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or fever I was
in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the hunger: Then
I grew sick, and reached to vomit. but could not, for I had
nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled some
time, I swooned. and they all believed I was dead: but [came
to myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my
stomach, not to be described, not like the colick, but a gnawing,
eager pain for food; and towards the night it went off, with a
kind of earnest wishing or longing for food, something like, as
I suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I took another
draught of water, with sugar in it; but my stomach loathed
the sugar, and brought it all up again: then I took a draught
of water without sugar, and that stayed with me; and I laid
me down upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would
please God to take me away; and composing my mind in
lmpes of it, I slumbcred awhile, and then waking, thought
myself dying, being light with vapours from an empty stomach:
I recommended my soul then to God. and earnestly wished
that somebody would throw me into the sea.

All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,
expiring, but bore it with much more patience than I: gave
the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master.
who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it;
and I believe it saved his life.

Towards the morning I slept again ; and when I awoke, I
fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that had a second
fitof violenthunger: I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful
condition: had my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her,
I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as
much relish. and as unconcerned, as ever I did eat the flesh of
any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I was
going to bite my own arm: at last I saw the basin in which
was the blood I had bled at my nose the day before: I ran to
it, and swallowed it with such haste. and such a greedy appe--
tite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid
it should be taken from me now. After it was down, though
the thoughts of it filled me with horror. yet it checked the fit
of hunger, and I took another draught of water, and was
composed and refreshed for some hours after. This was the
fourth day ; and thus I held it till towards night; when, within
the compass of three hours, I had all the several circumstances
over again, one after another. viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry.
pain in the stomach. then ravenous again. then sick, then
lunatic, then crying. then ravenous again, and so every quarter
of an hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly: at night I
laid me down. having no comfort but in the hope that I should
die before morning.

All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger was now turned
into a disease; and I had a terrible. colick and gripi'ng. by
wind. instead of food. having found its way into the bowels;
and in this condition I lay till morning. when I was surprised
with the cries and lamentations of my young master. who called
out to me that his mother was dead ; I lifted myself up a little,
for I had not strength to rise. but found she was not dead,
though she was able to give very little. signs of life.

I had then such convulsiOns in my stomach, for want of
some sustenance, that I cannot describe; with such frequent
throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard
the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail! and halloo and jump
about as if the}r were distracted.

I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much
less: and my young master was so sick, that I thought he had
been expiring; so we could not open the cabin door, or get
any account what it was that occasioned such confusion; nor
had we any conversation with the ship's company for two days,
they having told us that they had not a mouthful of any thing
to eat in the ship; and this they told us afterwards, they
thought we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we
were. in when you were sent to save our lives: and how you
found us. sir, you know as well as I, and better too.

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death. as. I confess. I never met with. and was
exceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe
it to be a true account, because the youth gave me an account
ofa good part of it; though, I must own, not so distinct and
so feeling as the maid; and the rather. because it seems his
mother fed him at the price of her own life ; but the poor maid,
though her constitution being stronger than that of her mis-
tress. who was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might
struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be sup-
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress.
who might be allowed to keep the last bit something longer
than she parted with any to relieve the maid. No question.
as the case is here related, if our ship. or some other, had not
so providentially met them, a few days more would have ended
all their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one
another; and that even, as their case stood, would have served
them but a little while, they being five hundred leagues from
any land, or any possibility of relief, other than in the miracu-
lous manner it happened: but this is by the way ; I return to
my disposition of things among the people.

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I
did not think fit to let them know any thing of the sloop I had
framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I
found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of divisions
among them, that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and
left it among them, they would, upon every light disgust,
have separated, and gone away from one another, or perhaps
have turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves,
instead of a plantation of sober and religious people, as I
intended it: nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cann0n
that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my
nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I thought it
was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against any
that should invade them, but not to set them up for an otl'ensive
war, or to go abroad to attack others; which, in the end,
would only bring ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved
the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service another
way, as I shall observe in its place.

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good
circumstances and in a flourishing condition, and went on
board my ship again the 6th of May, having been about twenty-
five days among them; and as they were all resolved to stay
upon the island till I came to remove them, I promised to send
them farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an
opportunity: and, particularly, I promised to send them some
cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows; as to the two cows and
calves which I brought from England, we had been obliged.
by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of
hay to feed them.CO

ADVENTURES OF

 

SECTION XL.

ENCOUNTER "'l'I'll SAVAGES AT SEA.--FIIII)AY.S'I)I'IATII.--ROIH.\'SO.\' FIXDS HIS
FORMER PARTNER IN THE BRAINS--SANS FOR THE EAST INDIES.

Tm: next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the Brazils,
in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our
passage but this: that about three days after we had sailed,
being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E.
running, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we
were driven something out of our course, and once or twice
our men cried out, Land to the eastward ; but whether it was
the continent or islands we could not tell by any means. But
the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth, and the weather
calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards the land
with Something very black; not being able to discover what it
was, till after some time, our chief mate going up the main-
shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a perspective,
cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant
by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. Nay, sir, says
he, don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too; for I
believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them
paddle along, for they are coming towards us apace.

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew
the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it. but said, two or three times,
we should all be devoured. I must confess, considering we
were beealmed, and the current set strong towards the shore.
I liked it the worse; however, I bade them not be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near to know
that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on apaee
towards us; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl
all our sails: as for the savages, I told them they had nothing
to fear but fire, and therefore they should get their boats out,
and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other by the
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in that
posture: this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready
with sheets and buckets to put out any fire these savages would
endeavour to fix to the outside of the ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they
came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by
Christians: though my mate was much mistaken in his calcu-
lation of their number. yet when they came up we reckoned
about a hundred and twenty-six; some of them had sixteen
or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least six
or seven.

When they came nearer to us. they seemed to be struck
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless
they had never seen before; nor could they, at first, as we
afterwards understood, know what to make of us; they came
boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about
to row round us; but we called to our men in the boats not to
let them come too near them. This very order brought us to
an engagement with them, without our designing it; for five
or six of the large canoes came so near our longboat that our
men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they
understood very well, and went back, but at their retreat
about fifty arrows came on board us from these boats, and one
of our men in the lougboat was very much wounded. How--
ever, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we handed
down some dealboards into the boat, and the carpenter pre-
sently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them
from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near, as that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their design; and I easily
found they were some of my old friends. the same sort of
savages that I had been used to engage with; and in a short
time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came
directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon
us. till they came so near that they could hear us speak : upon
this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot
any more arrows. and made all our guns ready; but being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and call out aloud to them in his language, to know
what they meant; which accordingly he did. Whether they
understood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had
called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or nighest
boat to us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping down,
showed us their naked backsides. just as if, in English, saving
your presence, they had bid ns kiss --: whether this was a
defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in
mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately
Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for
him, poor fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their
arrows, and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no
other man being 1n their sight. The poor fellow was shot with
no less than three arrows, and about three more fell very near
him; such unlucky marksmen they were!

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and
companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a
broadside as thev had never heard 111 their lives before, to be
sure. Thev 11 ere not above half a cable length off when we
fired; and our <<runners took their aim so 11ell that three or
four of their canoes were 01' erset, as we had reason to believe,
by one shot only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave
us no great ofl'ence; neither did I know for certain whether
that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us
might be understood so by them or not; therefore, 111 return,
I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them
111th powder only, which I knew would frighten them suffi-
cientlv- , but when they shot at us directly, with all the fury
they w ere capable of, and especially as they had killed my poor
Friday, 11 hom I so entirely 101 ed and valued, and who. indeed.
so well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before
God and man, but would have been 1ery glad if I could have
overset every canoe there, and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many 11c
wounded, at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry
ne1er was seen among such a multitude; there were thirteen
or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the men
all set a swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits.
scoured mm as fast as they could, taking but little care to
save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so
I suppose that many of them were lost; and our men took up
one poor fellow swimming for his life, ab01 e an hour after they
were all gone.

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound
a great mam , but, in shOrt, we never knew any thing how it
went with them, for they fled so fast, that in three hours, or
thereahouts, we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze of
wind springing up the same e1 ening, we weighed, and set sail
for the Brazils

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen
that he would neither eat not speak, and we all fancied he
would starve himself to death : but I took a way to cure him :
for I made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and~.l

make him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and
so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak:
nor would that do, but they really did throw him into the sea,
and came away from him; and then he followed them, for he
swam like a cork, and called to them, in his tongue, though
the knew not one word of what he said: however, at last they
too him in again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor
did I ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again; but I was the most disc0n-
solate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would
have been very glad to have gone back to the island to have
taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion; but it could
not be; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said,
and it was a long time before we could make him understand
any thing; but, in time, our men taught him some English,
and he began to be a little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired
what country he came from, but could make nothing of what
he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he spoke
in the throat in such a hollow. odd manner, that we could never
form a word after him; and we were all of opinion that they
might speak that language as well if they were gagged as other--
wise; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just
as a hunting horn forms a tune, with an open throat. He told
us, however, some time after, when we had taught him to speak
a little English, that they were going with their kings to fight
a great battle. 'Vhen he said kings, we asked him how many
kings? He said they were five nation (we could not make him
understand the plural s), and that they all joined to go against
two nation. We asked him what made them come up to us!
He said, " To makee te great wonder look." Here it is to be
observed, that all those natives, as also those of Africa, when
they learn English, always add two e's at the end of the words
where we use one; and they place the accent upon them, as
makee, takee, and the like; and we could not break them of
it ;dn3y, I cauld hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last
1e 1 .

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my
last leave of him: Poor honest Friday! We buried him with
all the decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a
coffin, and throwing him into the sea; and I caused them to
tire eleven guns for him: and so ended the life of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and most afl'ectionate servant, that
ever man had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in
about twelve days' time we made land, in the latitude of five
degrees south of the line, being the north-eastermost land of
all that part of America. We kept on S. by E. in sight of the
shore four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in
three days came to an anchor of the bay of All Saints, the old
place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good and
evil fate.

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I
had, and vet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted
to hold the least correspondence on shore: not my partner
himself, who was alive. and made a great figure among them.
not my two merchant trustees. not the fame of my wonderful
preservation in the island. could obtain me that favour; but
my partner remembering that I had given five hundred moi-
dores to the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and two
hundred and seventy-two to the' poor, went to the monastery.
and obliged the prior that then was. to go to the governor. and
get leave for me personally, with the captain and one more.
besides eight seamen. to come on shore, and no more; and this
upon condition absolutely capitulated for, that we should not
offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person
away without licence. They were so strict with us as to land-
ing any goods. that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on
shore three bales of English goods. such as fine broad-cloths.
stufi's. and some linen, which I had brought for a present to
my partner.

He was a very generous. open-hearted man: though, like
me. he came from little at first: and though he knew not that
I had the least design of giving him any thing. he sent me on
board a present of fresh provisions, wine. and sweetmeats.
worth above thirty moidores. including some tobacco, and
three or four fine medals of gold : but I was even with him in
my present. which, as I have said. coasisted of fine broad-cloth.
English stufi's. lace, and fine hollands: also I delivered him
about the value of one hundred pounds sterling, in the same
goods. for other uses; and I obliged him to set up the sloop,
which I had brought with me from England, as I have said, for
the use of my colony. in order to send the refreshments I
intended to my plantation.

Accordingly. he got handsz and finished the sloop in a very
few days, for she was already framed; and I gave the master
of her such instructions as that he could not miss the place;
nor did he miss them, as I had an account from my partner
afterwards. I got him s00n loaded with the small cargo I sent
them; and one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me
there, offered to go with the sloop and settle there. upon my
, letter to the governor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient quan-
tity of land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes and
tools for his planting work, which he said he understood.
having been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into
the bargain. I encouraged the fellow. by granting all he
desired; and. as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we
had taken prisoner of war to be his slave. and ordered the
governor Spaniard to give him his share of every thing he
wanted with the rest. '
When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me
there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his
acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of the church.
I know not what the matter is with him, says he, but on my
conscience I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been
obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition ; that he
would be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape,
with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let them go
to my island, and allot them a plantation, he would give them
a small stock to begin with; for the officers of the Inquisition
had seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing left
but a little household stuff, and two slaves: and, adds be,
though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him fall into
their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does.

I granted this presently, and jomed my Englishman with
them; and we concealed the man, and his wife and daughters,
on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then
having put all their goods on board some time before, we put
them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay.

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner;
and their stocks, indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in pre-
parations, and a farm; but nothing to begin with, except as
above: however, they carrried over with them, which was
worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugarcanes,
with some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Portugal man,

understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the

island, I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and five
calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big
with pig, two mares, and a stonehorse. For my Spaniards,
according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women to
go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and use them
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor prosecuted man had two daughters, and that
there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted ; the rest had
wives of their own, though in another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose,
was very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with
this addition, between sixty and seventy peOple, besides little
children, of which there were a great many. I found letters at
LOndon from them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to
England, of which I shall also take some notice immediately.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums
would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect
to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own
harms, much less by those of other men, to beware of the like;
not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and disappointments;
not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation. nor made
cautious by afflictions and distress beyond imitation.
I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man ;
at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire
him to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve him.
Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone directly
to the island; had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with
all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my people; taken
a patent from the government here to have secured my pro- .
perty, in subjection only to that of England; had I carried
over cannon and ammunition, servants, and people to plant,
and taken possession of the place, fortified and strengthened it
in the name of England, and increased it with people, as I
might easily have done; had I then settled myself there, and
sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might also have
done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have
fitted her out again for our supply ; had I done this, and stayed
there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common sense:
but I was possessed with a wandering spirit, and scorned all ,_
advantages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the
people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, l
majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing for 3
them as if I had been father of the whole family, as well as of i
the plantation: but I never so much as pretended to plant in 1'
the name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge any
prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation more
than another: nay, I never so much as gave the place a name. ,
but left it, as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people >>'
under no discipline or government but my own ; who, though
I had influence over them as a father and benefactor, had no
authority or power to act or command one way or other, farther
than voluntary c0nsent moved them to comply: yet even this.
had I stayed there, would have done well enough; but as I
rambled from them, and came there no more, the last letters I
had from any of them were by my partner's means. who after-
wards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word.
though I had not the letter till I got to London. several years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly, were mal-
content with their long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead:
that five of the Spaniards were come away; and though they had
not been much molested by the savages, yet they had had some
skirmishes with them; and that they begged of him to write to
me to think of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that
they might see their country again before they died.

But I was gone a wildgoose chase, indeed! and they that
will have any more of me must be content to follow me into a
new variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein
the justice of Providence may be duly observed; and we may
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires. '
make the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish
us most severely with those very things which we think it
would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. Whether I
bad business or no business, away I went: it is no time now
to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct,
but to come to the history; I was embarked for the voyage,
and the voyage I went.

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest popish
clergyman; for let their opinion of us, and all other heretics
in general, as they call us, be as uncharitable as it may, I verily
believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good of all
men: yet I believe he was upon the reserve in many of his
expressions, to prevent giving me offence; for I scarce heard
him once call on the blessed Virgin, or mention St. J ago or his
guardian angel, though so common with the rest of them:
however, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sincerity and
pious intentions on his own part; and I am firmly of opinion,
if the rest of the papish missionaries were like him, they would
strive to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, where
the have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to
In ia, Persia, China, &c. the most wealthy of the heathen
countries; for if they expected to bring no gains to their
church by it, it may well be admired how they came to admit
the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian saints.
But this by the by.

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked
me leave to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound
never to finish any voyage he began. How happy had it been
for me if I had gone with him! But it was too late now: all
things Heaven appoints for the best: had I gone with him, I
had never had so many things to be thankful for, and the
reader had never heard of the second part of the travels and
adventures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must here leave exclaim-
ing at myself, and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils
we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good
Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course generally
south--east, now and then a storm, and some contrary winds.
but my disasters at sea were at an end; my future rubs and
cross events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear
the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on
board, who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at
the Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days for
stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to.
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle with it;
my nephew, the captain, and the supercargo, adjusting all
those things between them as they thought fit.v

\Vn stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take
in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast of
Coromandel. We were indeed informed that a French man of
war of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships. were gone for
the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had
some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way.
and we heard no more of them. '

I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of
places, journals of our voyages, variations of the compass. lati-
tudes, trade winds. &c.; it is enough to name the ports and
places which we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our
passing from one to another. We touched first at the island of
Madagascar, where. though the people are fierce and treacher--
ous, and very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with
them a while; they treated us very civilly; and, for some
tritles which we gave them. such as knives. scissors, &c. thev
brought us eleven good fat hullocks of a middling size, which
we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending.
and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had fur-
nished ourselves with provisions; and I. who was always too
curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I came.
was for going on shore as often as I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one evening: and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came thronging
about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance; but as we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the people, we cut
three bougbs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only
of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other
side sets up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles,
towards them. nor they to come past your three poles, or
boughs, towards you; so that you are perfectly secure within
the three poles, and all the space between your poles and
theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, traffic, and
commerce. When you go there, you must not carry your
weapons with you :_ and if they come into that space. they stick
up their javelms and lances all at the first poles, and come on
unarmed; but if any violence is offered them, and the truce
thereby broken, away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of
their weapons, and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening when we went on shore, that a
greater number of their pe0ple came down than usual, but all
very friendly and civil; and they brought several kinds of
provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had; their women also brought as milk and roots, and several
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made

us a little tent or but of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore
all night.

I know not what was the occasion. but I was not so well
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat riding at an
anchor about a stone's cast from the land, with two men in her
to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore; and
getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I
spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the
cover of the branches of the trees all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake,
to bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all
like to be murdered; at the same time I heard the fire of five
muskets, which was the number of the guns they had, and that
three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so
easily frightened with guns as the savages were in America.
where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the
noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three fusees we had on board, to land and assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too
much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into
the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they
could, being pursued by between three and four hundred men.
Our men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees
with them; the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they
were of small use to them.

W'e took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough
too, three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was
still worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our
men in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore;
for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were
glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches, and
two or three loose boards. which, to our great satisfaction, We
had by mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been day-
light, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they
could have seen but the least part of any of us, they would
have been sure of us. We had, b the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as they stood pe ting us from the shore with
darts and arrows ; and having got ready our fire-arms, we gave
them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of them.
had wounded several ; however, they stood thus in battle array
on the shore till break of day, which we suppose was that they
might see the better to take their aim at us.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor or set up our sail, because we must needs 'stand up in
the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a
bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of distress to
the ship, which though she rode a league off, yet my nephew
the captain, hearing our firing. and by glasses perceiving the
posture we lay in. and that we fired towards the shore, pretty
well understood us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he
stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and then
sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us: but we
called to them not to come too near, telling them what condi-
tion we were in; however they stood in near to us, and one of
the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping
one boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to
the boat; upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving
our anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of the
arrows; we all the while lying close behind the barricado we
had made.

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore.
that we could lay her side to the shore, she run along just by
them, and poured in a broadside among them loaded with
pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides
the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among them.

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time
to examine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed, our

i

l
supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me upon it;
for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched
us after we had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out that an old woman,
who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it within our
poles, and a young woman with her, who also brought some
roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether she was
mother to the young woman or no they could not tell) was
selling us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to
the wench that was with her, at which the old woman made a
great noise: however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but
carried her out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it
being almost dark: the old woman went away without her,
and, as we may suppose, made an outcry among the people
she came from; who, upon notice. raised this great army upon
us in three or four hours; and it was great odds but we had
all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they
had made: the rest came 08' free, all but the fellow who was
the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became of him a
great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though
the wind presented, and made signals for him. and made our
boat sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain,
so we were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had
suffered for it, the loss had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on
shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing of him or
them; it was the third night after the action that I had a great
mind to learn, if I could by any means. what mischief we had
done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men I went
with had been under my command, before I engaged in athing
so hazardous and mischievous as I was brought into by it.
without design.

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours
before midnight, at the same place where the Indians stood
drawn up in the evening before: I landed here, because my
design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the
field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the mischief
we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise one or
two of them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange. -

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the
other. We neither saw nor heard any body stir when we

R
landed: and we marched up, one body at a distance from the 1
other. to the place; but at first could see nothing, it being
very dark; till by and by our boatswain, who led the first
party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made them
halt awhile; for knowing by the circumstances that they were
at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for my
coming up there. We concluded to halt till the moon began
to rise, which we knew would be in less than an hour. when
we could easily diSeern the havoc we had made among them.
IVe told thirty-two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were
not quite dead; some had an arm, and some a leg shot oil".
and one his head; those that were wounded, we suppose, they
had carried away.

\Vhen we had made, as I thought. a full discovery of all we
could come to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on
board ; but the boatswaiu and his party Sent me word that they
were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs. as they called them. dwelt, and asked me to go along
with them: and if they could find them, as they still fancied
they should, they did not doubt of getting a good booty; and
it might be they might find Tom Jefl'ry there; that was the
man's name we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough
what answer to have given them ; for I should have commanded
them instantly on board. knowing it was not a hazard fit for
us to run. who had a ship. and ship-loading in our charge, and
a voyage to make which depended very much upon the lives
of the men ; but as they sent me word they were resolved to
go. and only asked me and my company to go along with
them. I positively refused it. and rose up, for I was sitting on
the ground. in order to go to the boat. One or two of the men
began to importune me to go; and when I refused. began to
grumble. and say that they were not under my command, and
they would go. Come. Jack, says one of the men, will you
go with me? I'll go for one. Jack said he would.--and then
another.-----and. in a word, they all left me but one, whom I
persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the super-
cargo and I, with the third man, went back to the boat. where
we told them we would stay for them, and take care to take in
as many of them as should he left; for I told them it was a
mad thing they were going about, and supposed most of them
would run the fate of Tom Jeffry.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, &c.; so
away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship and
the voyage, that their lives were not their own. and that they
were intrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they
miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and
that they could not answer for it to God or man. But I might

I
as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship; they were
mad upon their journey, only they gave me good words, and
begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but they
would be back again in about an hour at farthest; for the
Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile 011', though
they found it above two miles before they got to it.

Well. they all went away; and though the attempt was
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, et, to give them their due, they went about it as warily
as bold y: they were gallantly armed, for they had every man
a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol ; some of them had
broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain
and two more had poleaxes; besides all which, they had
among them thirteen hand-grenadoes: bolder fellows and
better provided, never went about any wicked work in the
world.

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, and
they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a circum-
stance, which none of them were aware of, set them on fire
with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came
to the few Indian houses which they thought had been the
town. which was not above half a mile off, they were under a
great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or
thirteen houses; and where the town was, or how big, they
knew not. They consulted, therefore, what to do, and were
some time before they could resolve; for if they fell upon
these, they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one but
some of them might escape, it being in the night,.though the
moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run and raise all
the town, so they should have a whole army upon them:
again, on the other hand. if they went away and left those
untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell
which way to look for the town: however, the last was the
best advice ; so they resolved to leave them, and look for the
town as well as they could. They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded.
would be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow
certainly belonged to the town before them, or to the town
behind them; and if they untied her, they should see which
way she went; if she went back, they had nothing to say to
her ; but, if she went forward, they would follow her: so they
cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow
went on before them, directly to the town; which. as they
reported, consisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and
in some of these they found several families living together.

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep
could make them: and, first, they called another council, to

-consider what they had to do ; and, in a word, they resolved
R 2
to divide themselves into three bodies. and so set three houses
on fire in three parts of the town; and as the men came out,
to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they need not be
asked what to do then), and so to search the rest of the houses
for plunder: but they resolved to march silently first through
the town, and see what dimensions it was of, and if they might
venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them : but while they were animating one another
to the work, three of them, who were a little before the rest,
called out aloud to them, and told them that they had found
Tom J efi'ry : they all ran up to the place, where they found the
poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut.
There was an Indian house just by the tree, where they found
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been
concerned in the fray with us before, and two or three of them
wounded with our shot; and our men found they were awake,
and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their
number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them,
as before, that they swore to one another they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian that came into their hands
should have any quarter; and to work they went immedi-
ately, and yet not so madly as might be expected from the
rage and fury they were in. Their first care was to get some-
thing that would soon take fire, but, after a little search. they
found that would be to no purpose; for most of the houses
were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the
country is full; so they presently made some wildfire, as we
call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands;
and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or
five places, and particularly that house where the Indians
were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened
creatures began to rush out to save their lives, but met with
their fate in the attempt; and especially at the door, where
they drove them back, the boatswain himself killing one or
two with his poleaxe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenado. and
threw it among them, which at first frightened them, but, when
it burst, made such havoc among them, that they cried out in
a hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who were in
the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the
grenado, except two or three who pressed to the door, which
the boatswain and two more kept, with their bayonets on the
muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched all that came in their
way: but there was another apartment in the house, where
the prince or king, or whatever he was, and several others
were; and these were kept in till the house, which was by this
time all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were
smothered together.

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not
waken the people faster than they could master them; but the
fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were
glad to keep a little together in bodies; for the fire grew so
raging, all the houses being made of light combustible stuff,
that they could hardly bear the street between them; and
their business was to follow the fire, for the surer execution:
as fast as the fire either forced the maple out of those houses
which were burning, or frightened them out of others, our
people were ready at their doors to knock them on the head,

still calling and hallooing one to another to remember Tom
Jefl'ry.

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy,
and especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it
being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the captain,
who was roused by his men, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy,
not knowing what the matter was, or what danger I was in,
especially hearing the guns too, for by this time they began to
use their fire-arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind
concerning me and the supercargo, what would become of
us; and, at last, though he could ill spare any more men,
yet not knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes
another boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes on
shore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat,
with no more than two men; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know
what was doing; for the noise continued, and the flame in-
creased; in short, it was next to an impossibility for any man
in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had
happened, or their concern for the safety of the men: in a
word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, let
what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with
the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage. the
interest of the owners and merchants. &c. and told him I and
the two men would go, and only see if we could at a distance
learn what was like to be the event. and come back and tell
him. It was all one to talk to my nephew. as it was to talk to
the rest before; he would go, he said; and he only wished he
had left but ten men in the ship; for he could not think of
having his men lost for want of help; he had rather lose the
Ship. the voyage, and his life and all; and away he went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to
persuade them not to go; so, in short, the captain ordered
two men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more.
leaving the longboat at an anchor; and that when they came
back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more come
after us : so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two
were lost in the late quarrel which brought this mischief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of
the ground we trod on ; and being guided by the fire, we kept
no path, but went directly to the place of the flame. If the
noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the
poor people were now quite of another nature, and filled us
with horror. 1 must confess I was never at the sacking a city,
or at the taking a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver
Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man,
woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the
city of Magdeburg, and cutting the throats of twenty-two
thousand of all sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing
itself before, nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror that
was upon our minds at hearing it. However, we went on. and
at length came to the town, though there was no entering the
streets of it for the fire. The first object we met with was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house
was consumed : and just before it, plain enough to be seen by
the light of the fire. lay four men and three women killed.
and, as we thought. one or two more lay in the heap among
the fire; in short, there w<< re such instances of rage altogether
barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what was human,
that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it;
or if they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be
every one of them put to the worst of deaths. But this was
not all: we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went
on just as the tire went on; so that we were in the utmost
confusion. W'e advanced a little way farther; and, behold.
to our astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a most
dreadful manner, came flying as if they had wings, and after
them sixteen or seventeen men, natives. in the same terror and
consternation, with three of our English butchers in the rear;
who, when they could not overtake them, fired in among
them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our
sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies.
and that we would murder them as well as those that pur-
sued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the
women. and two of them fell down, as if already dead, with
the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me. and my blood ran chill in
my veins, when 1 saw this: and I believe, had the three
English sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our
men kill them all: however, we took some ways to let the
poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them ; and
immediately they came up to us, and kneeling dOWn with
their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save
them, which we let them know we would; whereupon they
crept all together in a huddle close behind us, as for protection.
I left my men drawn up together, and charging them to hurt
nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and see
what devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to
do, and to command them of; assuring them that if they
stayed till daylight, they would have a hundred thousand men
about their ears: I say, I left them, and went among those
flying pe0ple, taking only two of our men with me; and there
was indeed a piteous spectacle among them; some of them
had their feet terribly burned, with trampling and running
through the fire, others their hands burned ; one of the women
had fallen down in the fire, and was very much burned before
she could get out again; and two or three of the men had
cuts in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; and
another was shot through the body, and died while I was there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was,
but I could not understand one word they said; though, by
signs, I perceived some of them knew not what was the occasion
themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this out-
rageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back
to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the
town, through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and
put an end to it, cost what it would: accordingly, as I came
back to my men. I told them my resolution, and commanded
them to follow me; when at the very moment came four of
our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps
of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as
if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo; and with much ado one
of them made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and
came up to us.

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come :
and without waiting to hear me, Captain, says he, noble
captain ! I am glad you are come; we are not half done yet:
villanous hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor
Tom has hairs upon his head : we have sworn to spare none of
them : we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth:
and thus he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little.
Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing? I won't have
one creature touched more, upon pain of death: I charge you,
upon your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or
you are a dead man this minute.--Why, sir, says he, do you
know what you do, or what they have done? If you want a
reason for what he have done, come hither: and with that he
showed me the poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time
would have been forward enough; but I thought they had
carried their rage too far, and remembered Jacob's words to
his sons Simeon and Levi--" Cursed be their anger, for it was
fierce; and their wrath, for it was crue ." But I had now a
new task upon my hands; for when the men I carried with
me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to
restrain them as I should have had with the others; nay, my
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing,
that he was only concerned for fear of the men being over-
powered; aud as to the people, he thought not one of them
ought to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the
murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be used like
murderers; upon these words, away ran eight of my men. with
the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work;
and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came
away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight. much
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands. .

I got nobody to come back with me but the snpercargo and
two men. and with these walked back to the boat. It was a
very great piece of folly in me, I confess. to venture back as
it were alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the
alarm had run over the country, there stood about forty men,
armed with lances and bows, at the little place where the
twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by
accident I missed the place, and came directly to the seaside;
and by the time I got to the seaside it was broad day ; imme-
diately I took the pinnace and went on board, and sent her
back to assist the men in what might happen.

I observed, about the time that I came to the boat side, that
the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in
about half an hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our
men's fire-arms, and saw a great smoke: this, as I understood
afterwards, was our men falling upon the men who. as I said.
stood at the few houses on the way, of whom they killed
sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on fire, but did
not meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace,
our men began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two
bodies as they went, but straggling here and there in such a
manner, that a small force of resolute men might have cut
them all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole
country; and the men were surprised, and so frightened, that
I believe a hundred of them would have tied at the sight of but
five of our men ; nor in all this terrible action was there a man
that made any considerable defence; they were so surprised
between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men
in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves ;
for if they fled one way they were met by one party; if back
again, by another; so that they were eve where knocked
down: nor did any of our men receive therfeast hurt, except
one that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his
hands burned.

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed,
with all the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as
well for his acting so out of his duty, as commander of the
ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him. as in his
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men, in
so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me
very respectfully, but told me that when he saw the body of
the poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel and bar-
barous a manner, he was not master of himself, neither could
he govern his passion ; he owned he should not have done so.
as he was commander of the ship; but as he was a man, and
nature moved him, he could not hear it. As for the rest of
the men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it
well enough; so they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number they had killed;
but according to the best of their accounts, put all together,
they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty people.
men, women, and children, and left not a house standing in
the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite
dead (for his throat was so cut that his head was half off), it
would do him no service to bring him away; so they only took
him down from the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.

However just our men thought this action. I was against
them in it, and I always, after that time, told them God would
blast the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed
that night to be murder in them: for though it is true that
they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had
broken the truce, and had violated or debauched a young
woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently, and On
the faith of the public capitulation.

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were after-
wards on board. He said it was true that we seemed to break
the truce, but really had not; and that the war was begun the
night before by the natives themselves, who had shot at us.
and killed one of our men without any just provocation; so
that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might also
be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an
extraordinary manner; that though the poor man had taken
a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been
murdered, and that in such a villanous manner; and that they
did nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God
allowed to be done to murderers.

One would think this should have been enough to have

warned us against going on shore amongst heathens and bar-
barians: but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at
their own expense; and their experience seems to be always
of most use to them when it is dearest bought.

\Ve were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence
to the coast of Coromandel, Only to touch at Surat: but the
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal;
where if he missed his business outward-bound, he was to go
up to China, and return to the coast as he came home.

The first disaster that bet'ell us was in the gulf of Persia,
where five of our men venturing on shore on the Arabian side
of the gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all
killed or carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew
were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get off
their boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retribution
of Heaven in this case: but the boatswain very warmly told
me. he thought I went farther in my censures than I could
show any warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii.
4, where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the
tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans;
but that which put me to silence in the case was, that not one
of these five men who were now lost were of those who went
on shore to the massacre of Madagascar. so I always called it,
though our men could not bear to hear the word massacre with
anv patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on the subject had worse
consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had
been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time,
and told me he found that I brought that affair continually
upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it, and
had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in par--
ticular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no command
in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged
to bear it; that they did not know but I might have some ill
design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an account for
it when they came to England; and that, therefore, unless I
would resolve to have done with it. and also not to concern
myself any farther with him, or any of his afi'airs, he would
leave the ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done. and then told
him. that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of
Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind
freely about it, though not more upon him than any of the
rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was true :
nor did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all;
and what concern I had in the voyage was none of his business:
that I was a considerable owner in the ship; in that claim. I
conceived I had a right to speak even farther than I had done,
and would not be accountable to him or any one else; and
began to be a little warm with him. He made but little reply
to me at that time, and I thought the affair had been over.
We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being
willing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo,
in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards evening was
preparing to go on board, when one of the men came to me,
and told me he would not have me trouble myself to come
down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on heard
any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so
insolent a message; and I asked the man, who bade him
deliver that message to me? He told me, the cockswain. I
said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them know he
had delivered his message, and that I had given him no answer
to it.

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told
him the story; adding, what I presently foresaw, that there
would be a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him to go im-
mediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint
the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence.
for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected
on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all
the inferior oflicers, as soon as I was gone 08' in the boat. came
up, and desired to speak with the captain; and there the
boatswain, making a long harangue, and repeating all he had
said to me, told the captain, in a few words, that as I_was now
gone peaceably on shore, they were "loath to use any violence
with me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would other-
wise have done, to oblige me to have gone; they therefore
thought fit to tell him. that as they shipped themselves to serve
in the ship under his command, they would perform it well
and faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no
farther with him; and at that word all, he turned his face
toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed
on between them. at which all the seamen, being got together
there, cried out, One and all! one and all!

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, you may he
Sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would con-
snder of the matter; but that he could do nothing in it till he
had spoken to me about it. He used some arguments with
them to show them the unreasonableness and injustice 0f the
thing: but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands
round before his face, that they would all go on shore, unless
he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any more
on board the ship. . _ .

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
to me. and did not know how I might take it: so he began to
talk smartly to them; told them that I was a very considerable
owner of the. ship. and that. in justice. he could not put me out
of my own house; that this was next door to serving me as
the famous pirate Kidd had done. who made a mutiny in the
ship. set the captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and
ran away with the ship; that let them go into what ship they
would. if ever they came to England again it would cost them
very dear; that the ship was mine. and that he could not put
me. out of it: and that he would rather lose the ship and the
voyage too than disoblige me so much; so they might do'as
they pleased: however. he would go on shore and talk with
me. and invited the boatswain to go with him. and perhaps
they might accommodate the matter with me. But they all
rejected the proposal. and said they would have nothing to do
with me any more; and if I came on board. they would all go
on shore. "'ell. said the captain. if you are all of this mind.
let me go on shore and talk with him. So away he came to
me with this account. a little after the message had been
brought to me from the coekswain.

I was very glad to see. my nephew. I must confess: for l
was not without apprehensions that they would confine him by
violence. set sail. aml run away with the ship: and then I had
been stripped naked in a remote country. having nothing to
help myself; in short. I had been in a worse case than when I
was alone in the island. But they had not come to that length.
it seems. to my satisfaction; and when my nephew told me
what they had said to him. and how they had sworn and shook
hands that they would. one and all. leave the ship it' I was
suffered to come on board. I told him he should not be con--
cerned at it at all. for I would stay on shore: I only desired
he would take care and send me all my necessary things on
shore. and leave me a suflieient sum of money, and I would
find my way to England as well as 1 could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew. but there
was no way to help it but to comply; so. in short. he went on
board the ship again. and satisfied the men that his uncle had
yielded to their importnnity. and had sent for his goods from
on board the ship; so that. the matter was over in a few hours.

the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what
course I should steer.

INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUTCH-

I WAS now alone in the most remote part of the world, as I
think I may call it, for l was near three thousand leagues by
sea farther oil from England than I was at my island; only,
it is true, I might travel here by land over the great Mogul's
country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up
the gulf of Persia, and take the way ofthe caravans, over the
Desert of Arabia. to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by
sea again to Italy, and so overland into France ; and this put
together might at least he a full diameter of the globe, or
more.

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Aehin, on
the island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for
England. But as I came hither without any concern with the
English East India Company. so it would be difficult to go
from hence without their licence, unless with great favour of
the captains of the ships, or the Company's factors, and to
both I was an utter stranger.

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without
me; a treatment I think a man in my circumstances scarce
ever met with, except when pirates running away with the
ship, and setting those that would not agree with their villany
011 shore. Indeed, this was 11e\t door to it, both ways; how-
ever. my nephew left me two servants, or rather one companion
and one serv ant . the first was clerk to the purscr, whom he
engaged to go with me. and the other was his 01111 servant. I
took me also a good lodging 111 the house of an Englishwoman,
11 here se1eral merchants lodged, some French, two Italians,
or rather Jews, and one Englishman' . here I was handsomely
enough entertained: and that I might not be said to run rashly
upon any thing, I stay ed here above nine months considering
what course to take. and how to manage myself. I had some
English goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of
money; my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of
eight. and a letter of credit for more, it' I had occasion, that I
might not be straitened. 11'l1ate1 er might happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and. as l
originallv intended I bought here some very good diamonds.
which. of all other things, were the most proper for me, in
my present circumstances; because I could always carry my
whole estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my
return to England. but none falling out to my mind, the E 11g-
lish merchant who lodged with me. and whom I had contracted
an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one morning.
Country man, savs he, I have a proiect to communicate to you.
11 1111 h. as it suits with my tl1oughts,m may, for an ght I know,
suit 111th yours also, when 1011 shall have thoroughly con-
sidered it. Here we are posted, you by accident, and I by
my own choice. in a part of the world very remote from our
01111 1"onntry . but it is in a country 11 here, by us who under-
stand trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got.
If you will put one thousand pounds to my one thousand
pounds we 111ll hire a ship here, the first we can get to our
minds; 1011 shall be captain. I'll be merchant, and we '11 go a
trading 1oyage to China: for what should we stand still for!
The whole world is in motion, rolling round and round; all
the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and earthly. are busy
and diligent' . why should we be idle.' There are no drones 1n
the 11 orld but men: why should we be of that number?

I liked this prOposal wry well, and the more because it
seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in so
friendlv a manner. I will not say but that I might. by my
loose unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a pro.
pass] for trade, or indeed anv thing else , whereas, otherwise,
trade was none of my element. However, I might perhaps
say with some truth, that if trade was not my element, rambling
was, and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which
I had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me.

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to
our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to
get English sailors; that is to say, so many as were neces

to overn the voyage and manage the sailors which we should
pic up there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast-
men. With these we found we could do well enough, having
Indian seamen, such as the were, to make up.

There are so many trave lers who have wrote the history of
their voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little
diversion to any body to give a long account of the places we
went to, and the people who inhabit there; these things I leave
to others, and refer the reader to those journals and travels of
Englishmen of which many I find are published and more
promised every day; it is enough for me to tell you that we
made this voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and from
thence to Siam. where we exehanged some of our wares for
opium and some arrack; the first a commodity which bears a
great price among the Chinese. and which, at that time, was
much wanted there. In a word, we went up to Suskan, made
a very great voyage, were eight months out, and returned to
Bengal; and l was very well satisfied with my adventure. I
observe that our people in England often admire how oflicers
which the Company send into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do.
and sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy thousand
pounds at a time; but it is no wonder, or at least we shall see
so much farther into it, when we consider the innumerable
ports and places where they have a free commerce, that it will
he none; and much less it will be so when we consider that at
those places and ports where the English ships come, there is
such great and constant demands for the growth of all other
countries, that there is a certain vent for the returns, as well
as a market abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by my first adventure, and such an insight into the
method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger,
I should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought
no farther for making any fortune; but what was all this to a
man upwards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the
world than a covetous desire of gaining by it? And, indeed,
I think it is with great justice I now call it restless desire, for
it was so. When I was at home, I was restless to go abroad;
and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say.
what was this gain to me? I was rich enough already. nor had
I any uneasy desires about getting more money; and therefore
the profit of the voyage to me was of no great force for the
prompting me forward to farther undertakings; hence I thought
that by this voyage I had made no progress at all, because I
was come back, as I might call it, to the place from whence I
came, as to a home: whereas my eye, which. like that which
Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing, was still
desirous of wandering and seeing more. I was come into a
part of the world which I was never in before, and that part.
in particular, which I had heard much of. and was resolved to
see as much of it as I could ; and then I thought I might say
I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

But my fellow traveller and I had different notions: I do
not name this to insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were
the mostjust. and the most suited to the end of a merchant's
life ; who, when he is abroad upon adventures. it is his wisdom
to stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is like to
get the most money by. My new friend kept himself to the
nature of the thing. and would have been content to have gone
like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward and
forward. provided he could. as he called it, find his account in
it. On the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad rambling
boy. that never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was
not all: I had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer
home, and yet the most unsettled resolution imaginable which
way to go. In the interval of these consultations, my friend.
who was always upon the search for business, proposed another
voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a
loading of cloves from the Manillas. or thereabouts; places,
indeed, where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging partly
to the Spaniards; though we went not so far. but to some
other, where they have not the whole power, as they have at
Batavia, Ceylon, 8w.

We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief
ditliculty was in bringing me to come into it: however. at last.
nothing else offering. and finding that really stirring about and
trading. the profit being so great, and, as I may say. certain,
had more pleasure in it, and had more satisfaction to my mind.
than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the unhappiest
part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we made very
successfully, touching at Borneo. and several islands whose
names I do not remember, and came home in about five months.
We sold our spice. which was chiefly cloves and some nut-
megs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the
gulf; and making near five of one, we really got a great deal
of money.

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me:
Well now. said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my
indolent temper, is not this better than walking about here.
like a man of nothing to do, and spending our time in staring
at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans l--'Vhy, truly,
says I, my friend, I think it is. and I begin to be a convert to
the principles of merchandising; but I must tell you, said I.
by the way, you do not know what I am doing; for if I once
conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as I
am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you;
for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still.

But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after this
there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster,
not an European trader, of about two hundred tons burthen;
the men. as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the
captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he lay by at
Bengal; and having, it seems, got money enough, or being
willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public
notice he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my
new partner heard of it, and I had a eat mind to buy it; so
I went to him, and told him of it. e considered awhile, for
he was no rash man neither; but musing some time, he re-
plied, She is a little too big; but, however, we will have her.
Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agreeing with the master,
we paid for her, and took possession. When we had done so,
we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to join them
with those we had, for the pursuing our business; but on a
sudden, they having received, not their wages, but their share
of the money, as we afterwards learned, not one of them was
to be found; we inquired much about them, and at len h were
told that they were all gone together by land to Agra, t e great
city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to travel to
Surat, and o by sea to the gulf of Persia.

Nothing ad so much troubled me agood while as that I
should miss the opportunity of going with them; for such a
ramble, I thought, and in such company as would both have
guarded and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my
great design; and I should have both seen the world and gone
homewards too: but I was much better satisfied a few days
after, when I came to know what sort of fellows the were;
for, in short, their history was, that this man they cal ed cap-
tain was the gunner only, not the commander; that they had
been a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on
shore by some of the Malays. who had killed the captain and
three of his men; and that after the captain was killed, these
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the
Ship. which they did, and brought her to Bengal, leaving the
mate and five men more on shore; of whom hereafter.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came
honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess,
examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we never
inquired anything of the seamen, who would certainly have
falter-ed in their account. contradicted one another, and per-
haps contradicted themselves; or one how or other we should
have had reason to have suspected them; but the man showed
us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or
some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called
himself by that name, and we could not contradict him ; and
withal having no suspicion of the thing, we went through with
our bargain.

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and
some Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the
south-east for cloves, &c. that is to say, among the Philippine
and Molucca isles; and, in short, not to fill up this part of my
story with trifies, when what is to come is so remarkable, I
spent, from first to last. six years in this country, trading from
port to port, backward and forward. and with very good suc-
cess. and was now the last year with my new partner, going
in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but design~
ing first to Siam, to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up
and down a great while in the straits of Malacca. and among
the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those difiicult seas
than we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not
able. by all our industry, to find out where it was. This forced
us to make some port; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did. directed the captain to put into the river of
Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thomp-
son. captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship
upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great bay
or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and
going often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one
day an Englishman, and he was, it seems, a gunner'smate on
board an English East India ship which rode in the same river.
at or near the city of Cambodia; what brought him hither
we knew not; but he comes to me, and speaking English, Sir.
says he, you are a stranger to me, and I to you, but I have
something to tell you that very nearly concerns you.

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at first
I had known him, but I did not: If it very nearly concerns me.
said I , and not yourself, what moves you to tell it to me ?-I
am moved. says he, by the imminent danger you are in, and,
for aught I see. you have no knowledge of it.---I know no
danger I am in. says I. but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot
find it out; but I intend to lay her aground to-morrow, to see
if I can find it.----But. sir, says he, leaky or not leaky. find it
or not find it. you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to you: do you
know, sir, said he, the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen
leagues up this river '2 and there are two large English ships
about five leagues on this side. and three Dutch.---Well, said
I, and what is that to me ?--\Vhy, sir, said he, is it for a man
that is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a port
and not examine first what ships there are there, and whether
he is able to deal with them? I suppose you do not think you
are a match for them? I was amused very much at his dis-
course, but not amazed at it, for I could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you
would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have
to be afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships: 1
am no interloper; what can the have to say to me? He looked
like a man half angry and h f pleased, and pausing awhile,
but smiling, Well, sir, says he, if you think yourself secure,
you must take your chance; I am sorry your fate should blind
you against good advice; but assure yourself, if you do not
put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked
by five longboats full of men. and perhaps, if you are taken,
you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be exa-
mined afterwards. I thought, sir, added he, I should have met
with a better reception than this, for doing you a piece of
service of such importancee--I can never be ungrateful, said I,
for any service, or to any man that offers me any kindness; but
it is past my comprehension what they should have such a
design upon me for: however, since you say there is no time
to be lost, and that there is some villanous design on hand
against me, I will go on board this minute, and put to sea
immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim
without stopping it: but, sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant
of the cause of all this? Can you give me no further light into
it ?--I can tell you but part of the story, sir, says be; but I
have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could per-
suade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for it:
but the short of the story is this, the first part of which, I sup-
pose, you know well enough, viz. that you was with this ship
at Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by the
Malays, with three of his men; and that you, or some of those
that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are
since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and you will
all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with
very little ceremony; for you know merchant ships show but
little law to pirates, if they get them into their power.--Now
you speak plain English. said I, and I thank you; and though

know nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for I
am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship; yet seeing
such a work is doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean
honestly, I will be upon my guard--Nay, sir, says he, do not
talk of being upon your guard; the best defence is, to be out
of the danger; if you have any regard for your life, and the
lives of all your men, put to sea, without fail, at high water;
and as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too
far out before they can come down; for they will come awav
at high water, and as they have twenty miles to come, you will
get near two hours of them by the ditference of the tide, not
reckoning the length of the way: besides, as they are only
boats, and not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out
to sea. especially if it blows.---Well, said I, you have been
very kind in this; what shall I do for you to make you amends!
----Sir. says he, you may not be willing to make me any amends,
because you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I will
make an offer to you; I have nineteen months' pay due to me
on board the ship ** ', which I came out of England in; and
the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' pay due to
him; if you will make good our pay to us, we will go along
with you: if you find nothing more in it, we will desire no
more; but if we do convince you that we have saved your
lives. and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will
leave the rest to you.

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board.
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's
side. my partner, who was on board. came out on the quarter-
deck. and called to me, with a great deal of joy. 0 ho! 0 ho!
we have stopped the leak! we have stopped the leak !---Say
you so? said I, thank God; but weigh anchor then imme-
diately--Weigh! says he : what do you mean by that? \Vhat
is the matterf--Ask no questions. said I; but all hands to
work, and weigh without losing a minute. He was surprised.
but. however. he called the captain, and he immediately ordered
the anchor to be got up; and though the tide was not quite
down, yet a little land breeze blowing. we stood out to sea.
Then I called him into the cabin, and told him the story; and
we called in the men. and they told us the rest of it: but as it
took up a great deal of time. before we had done a seaman
comes to the cabin door, and called out to us that the captain
bade him tell us we were chased. Chased! says I ; by what!
--By five sloops. or boats, says the fellow, full of men.--Very
well, said I -, then it is apparent there is something in it. In
the next place I ordered all our men to be called up, and told
them there was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for
pirates. and asked them it' they would stand by us. and by one
another; the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they
would live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what
way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them; for
resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the last drop;
He said readily that the way was to keep them off with our
great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them with
our small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but when
neither of these would do any longer, we should retire to our
close quarters; perhaps they had not materials to break Open
our bulk-heads. or get in upon us.

The gunner had. in the mean time. orders to bring two guns
to bear fore and aft. out of the steerage, to clear the deck. and
load them with musket-bullets and small pieces of old iron,
and what came next to hand; and thus we made ready for
light: but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind enough,
and could see the boats at a distance. being five large long-
boats, following us with all the sail they could make.

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were
English) outsailed the rest, Were near two leagues ahead of
them, and gained upon us considerably, so that we found they
would come up with us; upon which we fired a gun without
ball, to intimate that they should bring to: and we put out a
flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but they came crowding '
after us, till they came within shot, when we took in our white
flag, they having made no answer to it, and hung out a red
flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding this, they
came on till they were near enough to call to them with a
speaking-trumpet which we had on board; so we called to
them, and bade them keep ofl'. at their peril.

It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to
come under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter; upon
which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended
upon the strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the
ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside; when immedi-
ately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled
so true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and
bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail, and run-
ning all to the head of the boat to keep her from sinking; so
she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat
crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that was behind.
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which
we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her take out
the men: we called again to the foremost boat, and ofi'ered a
truce, to parley again, and to know what her business was with
us; but had no answer, only she crowded close under our
stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow.
run out his two chase guns, and fired again at her, but the shot
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and
came on: but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired
among them a second time, one shot of which, though it missed
the boat itself. yet fell in among the men, and we could easily
see had done a great deal of mischief among them ; but we too '
no notice of that. wore the ship again, and brought our quarter
to bear upon them, and firing three guns more. we found the
boat was almost split to pieces; in particular, her rudder and
a piece of her stern was shot quite away; so they handed her
sail immediately, and were in great disorder. But to complete
their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again:
where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat was
sinking. and some of the men already in the water: upon this
I immediately manned out our pinnace, which we had kept
close by our side, with orders to pick up some of the men, if
they could, and save 'them from drowning, and immediately
come on board the ship with them, because we saw the rest of
the boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed
their orders, and took up three men. one of whom was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover
him. As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail
we could make, and stood farther out to sea; and we found
that when the other three boats came up to the first, they gave
over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I knew
not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I
apprehended, I resolved that we should change our course.
and not let any one know whither we were going: so we stood
out to sea eastward. quite out of the course of all European
ships, whether they were bound to China or any where else
within the commerce of the European nations.

When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two
seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this should be:
and the Dutchman let us into the secret at once, telling us that
the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more than
a thief, that had run away with her. Then he told us how the
captain, whose name too he told us, though I do not remember
it now, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the
coast of Malacca. with three of his men; and that he, this
Dutchman, and four more. got into the woods, where they
wandered about a great while, till at length he, in particular.
in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam off to a
Dutch ship, which, sailing near the shore in its way from
China, had sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he
durst not come to that part of the shore where the boat was,
but made shift in the night to take the water farther off, and
swimming at great while. at last the ship's boat took him up.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the
rest in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who
had run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of
pirates. which were gone a cruising in her; and that they had
already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very
richly laden.

This latter part was found to concern us directly, though we
knew it to be false; yet, as my partner said very justly, if we.
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepos-
session against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to
have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at
their hands; and especially considering that our accusers had
been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing
from them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungo-
verned passion have executed; and therefore it was his Opinion
we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came.
without putting in at any port whatever; because there we
could give a good account of ourselves, could prove where we
were when the ship put in, of whom we bought her, and the
like; and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put
upon the necessity of bringing it before the prOper judges, we
should be sure to have some justice, and not to be hanged first
and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's Opinion; but after a little
more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very
great hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we
were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and that if
the alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on
every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English
elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it were, running
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English
sailor's opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we
should certainly be taken. This danger a little startled my
partner, and all the ship's company, and we immediately
resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the
coast of China; and, pursuing the first design as to trade, find
- some way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back in
some of the vessels of the country, such as we could get. This
was approved of as the best method for our security; and
accordingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty
leagues off from the usual course to the eastward. This,
however, put us to some inconvenience; for, first, the winds,
when we came to that distance from the shore, seemed to be
more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we call it,
from the E. and E. N. B. so that we were a long while upon
our voyage. and we were but ill provided with victuals for so
long a run; and, which was still worse, there was some danger
that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us,
whereof some were bound that way, might be got in before
us, and if not, some other ship bound to China might have
information of us from them, and pursue us with the same
vigour.

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself,
including the late escape from the longboats, to have been in
the most dangerous condition that ever I was through my past
life; for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was never
pursued for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thing that
merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less thievish ;
I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I
had been nobody's enemy but my own: but now I was
embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though I
was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that.
innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had been under
a supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious
to make an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or384 AM INTURl-ZS or

sentlv make the men all prisoners or slaves. and it was not
long before we found a piece of their kindness this way, on the
occasion follow mg.

I have. observed above. that our ship sprung a leak at sea.
and that we could not find it out; and it happened that. as l
have said, it was stopped unexpectedly. in the happy minute
of our being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships in
the bay of Siam; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, We resolved, while we were at
this place, to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy things
we had on board, and clean her bottom; and, if possible, to
find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened
the ship, and brought all our guns and other inoveables to one
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her
bottom ; but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her on
dry ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such
a sight, came wondering down the shore to look at as; am!
seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and
heeling in towards the shore, am! not seeing our men, who
were at work on her bottom with stages, and with their boats
on the otl' side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast
away, and lay so fast on the ground. On this supposition.
they all came about us in two or three hours' time, with ten or
twelve l. rge boats, having some of them eight, some ten men
in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board and
plundered the ship; and if they had found us there, to have
carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever they call
him, for we knew nothing of their governor.

When they came up to the ship and began to row round
her, they discovered as all hard at work on the outside of the
ship's bottom and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as
every seafaring man knows how. They stood for a while
gazing at us, and we, who were a little surprised, could not
imagine what their design was; but being willing to be sure,
we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were
at work to defend themselves with, if there should he occasion ;
and it was no more than need; for in less than a quarter of an
hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was
really a wreck ; and that we were all at work endeavouring to
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by
that motion, that we were endeavouring to save some of our
KOOdS; upon this they took it for granted we all belonged to
them, and away they came directly upon our men, as if it had
been in a line of battle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened.
for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to
know what they should do. I immediately called to the men
that worked upon the stages, to slip them down, and get up
the side into the ship; and bade those in the boat to row
round, and come on board; and those few of us who were on
board worked with all the strength and hands we had, to bring
the ship to rights; but, however, neither the men upon the

S
stages nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered.
before the Cochin Chinese were upon them; and two of their
boats boarded our longhoat, and began to lay hold on the men
as their prisoners.

The first man they laid hold on was an English seaman, a
stout. strong fellow, who. having a musket in his hand. never
ollered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool. as l
thought; but he understood his business better than I could
teach him, for he grappled the pagan. and dragged him by
main force. out of their boat into ours, where taking him by
the. ears. he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the
fellow died in his hands; and, in the mean time. a Dutchman.
who stood next. took up the musket, and with the butt-end of
it so laid about him. that he knocked down five of them who
attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little towards
resisting thirty or forty men, who fearless, because ignorant
of their danger, began to throw themselves into the longhoat.
where we had but five men in all to defend it : but the following
accident, which deserved our laughter. gave our men a com-
plete victory.

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had calked her to
stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat.
one filled with boiling pitch. and the other with rosin. tallow.
and oil, and such stuff as the Shipwrights use for that work;
and the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle
in his hand, with which he supplied the men that were at work
with the hot stuff; two of the enemy's men entered the boat
just where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladle full of the stuff, boiling hot,
which so burned and scalded them. being half naked, that they
roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out. Well done.
Jack ! give them some more of it: and stepping forward him-
self. takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he
and his man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short.
of all the men in the three boats there was not one that escaped
being scalded and burned with it, in a most frightful, pitiful
manner, and made such a howling and crying, that I never
heard a worse noise: for it is worth observing, that though
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has
a particular way of exclamation, and makes noises as different
from one another as their speech. I cannot give the noise
these creatures made a better name than howling, nor a name
more proper to the tone of it: for I never heard any thing
more like the noise of the wolves, which. as I have said, I
heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger
was imminent before, but, as we got this victory without any
bloodshed, except of that man the fellow killed with his naked
hands, and which I was very much concerned at, for I was
sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even though it was
in my own defence, knowing they came on errands which
they thought just, and knew no etter; and that though it
may be a just thing, because necessary (for there is no necessary
wickedness in nature), yet I thoug t it was a sad life, when
we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow creatures
to preserve ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still, and I
would even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would take
away the life even of the worst person injuring me; and I
believe all considering people who know the value of life
would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the
consideration of it.

But to return to my story :--All the while this was doing,
my partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board,
had with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights,
and having got the guns into their places again, the gunner
called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would
let fly among them. I called back again to him, and hid him
not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without
him; but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook,
who was on board, took care of: but the enemy was so
terrified with what they had met with in their first attack,
that they would not come on again; and some of them who
were farthest ofi', seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright,
began, as we suppose, to see their mistake, and give over the
enterprise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got
clear of this merry fight, and having got some rice, and some
roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days
before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward,
whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be
surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more
than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore
got all our things on board the same evening. and the next
morning were ready to sail: in the mean time, lying at anchor
at some distance from the shore, we were not so much con-
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing
posture, if any enemy had presented. The next day, having
finished our work within board, and finding our ship was
perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have
gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform our-
selves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships
that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little
before; so we kept on N. E. towards the island of Formosa,
as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant

s 2
ship. as a Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean
is of an Algerine man of war.

\Vhen we were thus got to sea. we kept on N. E. as if we
would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands, and this
we did that we might not fall into the way of any of the
European ships; and then we steered north, till we came to
the latitude of 22 deg. 30 min. by which means we made the
island Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in
order to get water and fresh provisions, which the people
there, who are ver courteous and civil in their manners.
supplied us with wil ingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually
with us in all their agreements and bargains, which is what
we did not find among other people, and may be owing to the
remains of Christianity which was once planted here by a
Dutch missionary of protestants, and is a testimony of what I
have often observed, viz. that the Christian religion always
civilises the people and reforms their manners, where it is
received, whether it works saving efl'ects upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all
the ports of China where our European ships usually come;
being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any of their hands,
especially in this country; where, as our circumstances were.
we could not fail of being entirely ruined.

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved
to put into the first trading port we should come at; and
standing in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us,
with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who knowing us to be
an European ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we
were glad of, and took him on board; upon which, without
asking us whither we would go, be dismissed the boat he came
in, and sent it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the
old man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to
him about carrying us to the gulf of Nanquin, which is the
most northern part of the coast of China. The old man said
he knew the gulf of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked us
what we would do there 2 I told him we would sell our cargo
and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought
silks, &c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at Macao,
where we could not have failed of a market for our opium to
our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all
sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at Nanquiu.

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were
gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go
and see the great city of Peking, and the famous court of the
monarch of China. Why then, says the old man, you should
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there,
you may go up within five leagues of the great canal. This
canal is a navigable stream, which goes through the heart of
that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some
considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up
to the city of Peking, being in length near two hundred and
seven leagues.

We 1, said I, Senhor Portuguese, but that is not our business
now; the great question is, if you can carry us up to the city
of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Peking afterwards?
He said we could do so very well, and that there was a great
Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a
little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had
much rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in
too frightful a figure ; and we depended upon it that a Dutch
ship would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to
fight them; all the ships they trade with into those parts being
of great burden, and of much greater force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and said to me, Sir,
you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I suppose
they are not now at war with your nation Z--No, said I, that's
true; but I know not what liberties men may take when they
are out of the reach of the laws of their own country.--Why,
says he, on are no pirates; what need you fear? They will
not medd e with peaceable merchants, sure.

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my
face at that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels
appointed by nature to circulate it, for it put me into the
greatest disorder and confusion imaginable : nor was it possible
for me to conceal it so, but the old man easily perceived it.

Sir, says he, I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way you
think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can.
---Why, senhor, said I, it is true, I am a little unsettled in my
resolution at this time, whither to go in particular; and I am
something more so for what you said about pirates. I hope
there are no pirates in these seas ; we are but in an ill condition
to meet with them, for you see we have but a small force, and
are but very weakly manned.--0, sir, says he. don't be con-
cerned, I do not know that there have been any pirates in
these seas these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but you may
be assured she is gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of
any great force, or fit for the work: she was not built for a
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew that
was on board, after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malayans, at or near the island of Sumatra.
--\Vhat! said I, seeming to know nothing of the matter, did
they murder the captain t--No, said he, I don't understand
that they murdered him: but as they afterwards ran away
with the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed him
into the hands of the Malayans, who did murder him; and
perhaps they procured them to do it.-----\Vhy then, said I.
they deserve death as much as if they had done it themselves.
--Nay. says the old man, they do deserve it; and they will
certainly have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch
ship; for they have all agreed together, that if they meet that
rogue they'll give him no quarter.----Bnt, said I to him. you
say the pirate is gone out of these seas; how can they meet
with him then I--Why, that's true, says be, they do say so:
but he was, as I tell you. in the bay of Siam, in the river
Cambodia; and was discovered there by some Dutchmen who
belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore when they
ran away with her; and some English and Dutch traders
being in the river, they were within a little of taking him:
nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well seconded by
the rest. they had certainly taken him; but he, finding only
two boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at those
two, and disabled them before the others came up. and then
standing oil to sea, the others were not able to follow, and so
he got away; but they have all so exact a description of the
ship, that they will be sure to know her; and wherever they
find her they have vowed to give no quarter either to the
captain or seamen, but to hang them all up at the yardarm.--
\Vbat! said I, will they execute them right or wrong; hang
them first, and judge them afterwards 2--0 sir, says the old
pilot, there is no need to make a formal business of it with
such rogues as those; let them tie them back to back, and set
them a diving, 'tis no more than they deserve.

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could
do no harm. so that I turned short upon him: Well now.
senhor, said I, this is the very reason why I would have you
carry us up to Nanqnin, and not put back to Macao, or to any
other part of the country where the English or Dutch ships
come; for be it known to you, senhor, those captains of the.
English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent
fellows, that neither know what belongs to justice, or how to
behave themselves as the laws of God and nature direct; but
being proud of their ofiices, and not understanding their power,
they would act the murderers to punish robbers; would take
upon them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guilty without due inquiry: and perhaps I may live to bring
some of them to account for it. when they may be taught how
justice is to be executed ; and that no man ought to be treated
as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime, and
that he is the man.
With this I told him that this was the very ship they at-
tacked, and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had
with their boats, and how foolishly and cowardly they behaved.
I told him all the story of our buying the ship, and how the
Dutchman served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe
the story of killing the master by the Malayans was true, as
also the running away with the ship; but it was all a fiction
of their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates. and
they ought to have been sure it was so before they had vcn-
tured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men, whom
we killed there In just defence, to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we
were very much in the right to go away to the north; and that
if he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China.
which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the
country; and, said he, though you will not get so good a ship,
yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else. I told him I
would take his advice when I came to any port where I could
find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to buy this. He
replied, I should meet with customers enough for the ship at
Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well
to go back again; and that he would procure me people both
to buy one and sell the other. Well but, senhor, said I. as
you say they know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest innocent
men into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be murdered in cold
blood; for wherever they find the ship, they will prove the
guilt upon the men, by proving this was the s ip, and so inno-
cent men may probably be overpowered and murdered.--Why,
says the old man, I'll find out a way to prevent that also ; for
as I know all those commanders you speak of very well, and
shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them
to rights in the thing, and let them know that they had been
so much in the wrong; that though the people who were on
board at first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true
that they had turned pirates; and that, in particular, these
were not the men that first went off with the ship, but inno-
cently bought her for their trade; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the
time to come.

While these things were passing between us, by way of
discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about
thirteen days' sail came to an anchor at the south-west point
of the great gulf of Nanquin; where, by the way, I came by
accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into their
hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a loss as I was. and would very gladly have
been safe on shore almost any where: however, I was not in
such perplexity neither. but I asked the old pilot if there was
no creek or harbour which I might put into and pursue my
business with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of
the enemy. He told me, if I would sail to the southward
about forty-two leagues. there was a little port called Quin-
chang, where the fathers of the mission usually landed from
Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in; and if I
thought to put in there, I might consider what farther course
to take when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a place for merchants, except that at'some certain times
they had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan
came over thither to buy the Chinese merchandises.

\Ve all agreed to go back to this place; the name of the
port, as he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not
particularly remember it, having lost this, together with the
names ot' many other places set down in a little pocket-book.
which was spoiled by the water by an accident; but this I
remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we corre-
sponded with called it by a different name from that which
our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above.
Quinchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place,
we weighed the next day. having only gone twice on shore
where we were to get fresh water; on both which occasions
the people of the country were very civil to us, and brought
us abundance of things to sell to us. I mean of provisions.
plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls, but nothing without
money.

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not
till five days. but it was very nmch to our satisfaction; and I
was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot on
shore. resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, though not
every way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot on
board that unhappy vessel more; and. indeed, I must acknow-
ledge, that of all the circumstances of life that ever I had any
experience of, nothing makes mankind so completely miserable
as that of being in constant fear. \Vell does the Scripture say.
" The fear of man brings a snare ;" it is a life of death, and
the mind is so entirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of no
relief.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, b
heightening every danger. representing the English and Date
captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or of distin-
guishing between honest men and rogues; or between a story
calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole voyage,
progress, and design ; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the goods
we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly showing
ourselves, and entering into such and such ports; and even
our very manner, the force we had, the number of men, the
few arms, little ammunition, short provisions ; all these would
have served to convince any men that we were no pirates.
The opium and other goods we had on board would make it
appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it
was said, had the names of all the men that were in the ship,
might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portuguese,
and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and
many other particular circumstances, might have made it
evident to the understanding of any commander. whose hands
we might fall into, that we were no pirates. But fear, that
blind, useless passion. worked another way, and throw us into
the vapours; it bewildered our understandings, and set the
imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that
perhaps might never happen. \Ve first supposed, as indeed
every body had related to us, that the seamen on board the
English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so.
enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating
off their boats and escaping, that they would not give them-
selves leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no; but
would execute us off hand, as we call it, without giving us any
room for a defence. We reflected that there really was so
much apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce
inquire after any more; as, first, that the ship was certainly
the same, and that some of the seamen among them knew her,
and had been on board her; and, secondly, that when we had
intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they were coming
down to examine us, we fought their boats and fled; so that
we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being
pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary; and, as I often
said, I know not but I should have been apt to have taken
those circumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned,
and my case was theirs; and have made no scruple of cutting
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps consider-
ing. what they might have to offer in their defence. .

But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions:
and both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dream.
ing of halters and yard-arms, that is to say, gibbets ; of fighting,
and being taken; of killing, and being killed; and one night
I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamemdown,
that I struck my doubled fist against the side of the cabin I lay

in, with such a force, as wounded my hand ggievously, broke
s
my knuckles. and cut and bruised the flesh. so that it awaked
me out of my sleep.

Another apprehension I had was. the cruel usage we might
meet with from them if we fell into their hands: then the story
of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch might
perhaps torture us, as they did our countrymen there, and
make some of our men. by extremity of torture. confess those
crimes they never were guilty of. or own themselves and all
of us to be pirates. and so they would put us to death with a
formal appearance of justice ; and that they might be tempted
to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo. which was worth
four or five thousand pounds. put all together.

These things tormented me and my partner too, night and
day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no
authority to not thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to
them. they could not answer the destroying us. or torturing us.
but would be. accountable for it when they came to their own
country: this. I say. gave me no satisfaction; for if they were
to act thus with us. what advantage would it be to us that they
should be called to an account for it! or if we were first to be
murdered. what satisfaction would it be to us to have them
punished when they came home!

I cannot refrain taking notice. here what reflections I now
had upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how
hard I thought it was, that I. who had spent forty years in a
life of continual difliculties. and was at last come. as it were.
to the port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest
and plenty. should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own
unhappy choice ; and that I. who had escaped so many dangers
in my youth. should now come to be hanged in my old age.
and in so remote a place, for a crime which I was not in the.
least inclined to, much less guilty of.

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in;
and I should be considering that this seemed to me to be a
disposition of immediate Providence. and I ought to look upon
it and submit to it as such; that although I was innocent as
to men. I was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and
I ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my life
were most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution; and that I ought
to submit to this. just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had
pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place,
and then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions:
that I would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel
of merciless wretches in cold blood ; that it were much better
to have fallen into the hands of the savages. though I was sure
they would feast upon me when they had taken me, than those
who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tor-
tures and barbarities; that in the case of the savages I always
resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and why should I not
do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me at least,
to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to
think of being eaten by men? for the savages, give them their
due, would not eat a man till he was killed and dead. but that
these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. When-
ever these thoughts prevailed, I wassure to put myself into a
kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed fight; my blood
would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged, and I
always resolved to take no quarter at their hands; but, even
at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship
and all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to
boast of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater
was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my
partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load
upon his back, which he was to carry up abill, and found that
he was not able to stand longer under it; but that the Portu-
guese pilot came and took it off his back, and the hill disap-
peared, the ground before him appearing all smooth and plain ;
and truly it was so; the were all like men who had a load
taken off their backs. or my part, I had a weight taken 03'
fr0m my heart that it was not able any longer to bear; and, as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship.
When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our
friend, got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods, which,
by the way, was much the same: it was a little house, or but,
with a larger house adjoining to it, all built with canes, and
palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves,
of which, it seems, there were not a few in that country; how-
ever, the magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a
soldier with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who stood sentinel
at our door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little
piece of money, about the value of threepence, per day, so
that our goods were kept ve safe.

The fair, or mart, usually ept in this place, had been over
some time; however, we found that there were three or {our
junks in the river, and two Japaners, I mean ships from Japan,
with goods which they had bought in China, and were not
gone away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to
get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who
were in town, and who had been there some time canverting
the people to Christianity ; but we thought they made but
poor work of it, and made them but sorryChrisfians when
they had done; however, that was none of our business. One
of these was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon;
another was a Portuguese, and the third a Geuoese; but
Father SimOn was courteous, easy in his manner, and very
agreeable company; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they came
about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate themselves among, the
inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity. We often ate
and drank with those men; and though, I must confess, the
conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so
far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people
to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more
than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son. in a tongue which
they understand not, and to cross themselves, and the like;
yet it must be confessed that the religionists. whom we call
missionaries, have a firm belief that these people will be saved,
and that they are the instruments of it: and, on this account,
they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage, and the
hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself,
with the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work.

But to return to my story: This French priest, Father
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the
mission, to go up to Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese
emperor, and waited only for another priest, who was ordered
to come to him from Macao, to go along with him; and we
scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that
journey: telling me how he would show me all the glorious
things of that mighty empire. and, among the rest. the greatest
city in the world; a city, said he, that your London and our
Paris put together, cannot be equal to. This was the ci of
Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely ful of
people; but as I looked on those things with difi'erent eyes
from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in a few
words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak more
particularly of them.

But, first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with
him one day, and being very merry together, I showed some
little inclination to go with him ; and he pressed me and my
partner very hard. and with a great many persuasions, to
consent. Why, Father Simon. says my partner. should you
desire our company so much? you know we are heretics, and
you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company with any
pleasure.-O, says he, you may perhaps be good catholics in
time: my business here is to convert heathens, and who knows
but I may convert you too i--Very well, Father, said I, so
you will preach to us all the way 2--1 will not be troublesome
to you. says be; our religion does not divest us of good man-
ners: besides. we are here like countrymen; and so we are,
compared to the place we are in; and if you are huguenots,
and I a catholic, we may all be Christians at last; at least,
we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, without being
uneasy to one another. I liked this part of his'disconrse ve
well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest that I had
left in the Brazils; but this Father Simon did not come up to
his character by a great deal; for though Father Simon had
no appearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had
not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere affec-
tion to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic had.

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor so-
liciting us to go with him; we had something else before us
at first, for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise
to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what we should
do, for we were now in a place of very little business; and
once I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and
the city of N anquin; but Providence seemed now more visibly,
as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in our affairs; and I
was encouraged, from this very time, to think I should one
way or other get out of this entangled circumstance, and be
brought home to my own country again, though I had not the
least view of the manner. Providence, I say, began here to
clear up our way a little: and the first thing that offered was,
that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to
us, who inquired what goods we had; and, in the first place,
he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it,
paying us in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own
coin, and some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces
each. While we were dealing with him for our opium, it came
into my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship too, and
I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him; he shrunk up
his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him; but in
a few days after he came to me, with one of the missionary
priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to
make to me, which was this :--he had bought a great quantity
of goods of us, when he had no thoughts of pro sals made to
him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, be ad not money
enough to pay for the ship: but if I would let the same men
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to
go to Japan; and would send them from thence to the Philip-
pine islands with another loading, which he would pay the
freight of before they went from Japan; and that at their
return he would buy the ship. I began to listen to his pro-
posal, and so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that
I could not but begin to entertain a notion of going myself
with him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands away to
the South Seas; accordingly I asked the Japanese merchant
if he would not hire us to the Philippine islands, and discharge
us there. He said. No, he could not do that, for then he
.could not have the return of his cargo ; but he would discharge
us in J apan, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking
him at that proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser
than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the dangers,
as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel,
and treacherous peOple; likewise those of the Spaniards at the
Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they.

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion:
the first thing we had to do was, to consult with the captain of
the ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to
go to Japan: and while I was doing this, the young man whom
my nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels
came to me, and told me that. he thought that voyage promised
very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage,
and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if I
would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a mer-
chant. or how I pleased to order him; that if ever he came to
England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a
faithful account of his success, which should be as much mine
as I pleased. I was really loath to part with him; but con-
sidering the prospect of advantage, which really was consider-
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it
as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; but I told him I would
consult my partner, and give him an answer the next day. My
partner and I discoursed about it, and my partner made a most
generous offer: You know it has been an unlucky ship, said
he, and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if our
steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, will
leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best
of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with
success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of
the ship's freight to us; the other shall be his own.

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young
man, made him such an ofl'er, I could do no less than offer him
the same: and all the ship's company being willing to go with
him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and took
a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him; protected him at Japan, and got
him a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans in gene-
ral have not lately obtained; paid him his freight very punc-
tually; sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and
China wares. and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking
with the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, and
a great quantity of cloves and other spices; and there he was
not only paid his freight very well, and at a very good price.
but not being willing to sell the ship then. the merchant fur-
nished him goods on his own account; and with some money,
and some spices of his own which he brought with him, he
went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards, where he sold his
cargo very well. Here, having got a good acquaintance at
Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship; and the governor of
Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast
of Mexico, and gave him a licence to land there, and to travel
to, Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe with all
his men. He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained allow-
ance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found means, some-
how or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure; and
about eight years after came to England exceeding rich, of
which I shall take notice in its place; in the mean time, I
return to our particular affairs.

Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it came
before us, of course, to consider what recompense we should
give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the
design against us in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they
had done us a very considerable service, and deserved well at
our hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues
too; for as the believed the story of our being pirates, and
that we had rea ly run away with the ship, they came down to
us not only to betray the design that was formed against us,
but to go to sea with us as pirates; and one of them confessed
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing
brought him to do it : however, the service they did us was not
the less; and, therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to
them, I first ordered the money to be paid them which they
said was due to them on board their respective ships; over
and above that, I gave each of them a small sum of mone in
gold, which contented them very well; then I made the ng-
lishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made second
mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain; so they
were both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable,
being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.

We were now on shore in China: if I thought myself
banished and remote from my own country at Bengal, where
I had many ways to get home for my money, what could I
think of myself now, when I was got about a thousand leagues
farther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of
prospect of return? All we had for it was this, that in about
four months' time there was to be another fair at the place
where we were, and then we might be able to purchase all
sorts of the manufactures of the country, and witbal might
possibly find some Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin,
that would be to be sold, and would carry us and our goods
whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our articular persons were not obnoxious,
so if any English or utch ships came thither, perhaps we
might have an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage
to some other place in India, nearer home. Upon these hopes
we resolved to continue here; but, to divert ourselves. we
took two or three journeys into the country. First. we went
ten days journey. to the city of Nanqnin. a city well worth
seeing. indeed; they say it has a million of people. in it: it is
regularly built. the. streets all exactly straight. and cross one
another in direet lines. which gives the figure of it great advan-
tage. But when I come to compare. the miserable people of
these. countries with ours, their fabrics. their manner of living.
their government. their religion. their wealth. and their glory.
as some call it. I must confess that I scarcely think it worth
my while. to mention them here. It is very observable. that we
wonder at the grandeur. the. riches. the pomp. the ceremonies.
the government. the manufactures. the commerce. and conduct
of these people : not that it is to be wondered at. or. indeed. in
the least to be. regarded. but because. having a true notion of
the. barbarity of those countries. the rudeness and the igno-
rance that prevails there. We do not expect to find any such
thing so far oll'. Otherwise. what are. their buildings to the
palaces and royal buildings of Europe! \Vhat their trade to
the universal commerce of England. Holland. France. and
Spain! \Vhat are. their cities to ours. for wealth. strength.
gaiety of apparel. rieh furniture. and infinite variet 2 What

navigation. our merchant fleets. our large and powerful navies?

empire: one English. Dutch. or French man of war of eighty
guns. would be able to tight almost all the. shipping belonging
to China: but the greatness of their wealth. their trade, the
power of their government. and the. strength of their armies.
may be a little surprising to us. because. as I have said. con-
sidering them as a barbarous nation of pagans. little better
than savages. we. did not expect such things among them: and
this. indeed. is the. advantage with which all their greatness
and power is represented to us : otherwise. it is in itself nothing
at all ; for what I have said of their ships may be said of their
armies and troops. all the forces of their empire. though they
were. to bring two millions of men into the field together. would
be able to do nothing but ruin the country. and starve them-
selves. if they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders. or to
fight a disciplined army ; one good line of German cuirassiers.
or of French cavalry. might withstand all the horse of China;

body of our infantry. posted so as not to be. surrounded. though
they were not to be one to twenty in number; nay, I do not
boast if I say that thirty thousand German or English foot.
and ten thousand horse. well managed. could defeat all the
forces of China: and so of our fortified towns. and of the art
of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns; there is
not a fortified town in China could hold out one month against
the batteries and attacks of an European army; and, at the
same time, all the armies of China could never take such a
town as Dunkirk. provided it was not starved; no, not in a
ten years' siege. They have tire-arms, it is true, but they are
awkward and uncertain in their going off; and their powder
has but little strength. Their armies are badly disciplined,
and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat; and, therefore,
I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home.
and heard our people say such tine things of the power, glory.
magnificence. and trade of the Chinese; because, as far as I
saw, they appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of
ignorant sordid slaves, subjected to a gov'ernment qualified
only to rule such a people: and were not its distance incon-
ceivably great from Muscovy, and tho Muscovite empire in a
manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Izar
of Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their coun-
try, and conquer them in one campaign: and had the Czar
(who is now a growing prince) fallen this way, instead of
attacking the warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself
in the art of war, as they say he has done; and if none of the
powers ot' Europe had envied or interrupted him. he might by
this time have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten
by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one
to six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so
their navigation, commerce. and husbandry is very imperli'ct,
compared to the same things in Europe: also in their know-
ledge, their learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they are
either very awkward or defective, though they have g obes
and spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics, and think
they know more than all the world besides; but they know
little of the motions of the heavenly bodies: and so grossly and
absurdly ignorant are their common people, that when the sun
is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is
going to run away with it; and they fall a cluttering with all
the drums and kettles in the country, to fright the monster
away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made
in all the accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make
no more such; it is none of my business, nor any part of my
design; but to give an account of my own adventures through
a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long variety of changes,
which, perhaps, few that come after me will have heard the
like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people I have yet to
pass through, more than relates to my own story, and which
my concern among them will make necessary.
 

SECTION XLIII.

JOURNEY TO l'l'lKINGo--ROBINSON JOINS A CARAVAN PROCEEDING TO MOSCOW.
--IlPS.\'()OXTItES WITH THE TARTARS.

I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China.
about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned
from Nanquin: I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Peking,
which 1 had heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned
me daily to do it. At length his time of going away being set,
and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived
from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either to
go or not; so I referred it wholly to my partner, and left it
wholly to his choice, who at length resolved it in the atlirma-
tive, and we prepared for our journey. \Ve set out with very
good advantage, as to finding the way, for we got leave to
travel in the retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of
viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where they
reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with
great attendance, and with great homage from the people, who
are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being obliged to
furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in their
journeys. That which I particularly observed, as to our tra--
velling with his baggage, was this, that though we received
suflicient provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the
country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were obliged to
pay for every thing we had, after the market price of the
country, and the Mandarin's steward collected it duly from
us; so that our travelling in the rctinue of the Mandarin,
though it was a very great kindness to us, was not such a
mighty favour in him, but was a great advantage to him, con-
sidering there were above thirty other people travelled in the
same manner besides us, under the protection of his retinue:
for the country furnished all the provisions for nothing to him.
and et he took our money for them.

\ 0 were twenty-five days travelling to Peking, through a
country infinitely populous, but I think badly cultivated; the
husbandry, the economy, and the Way of living miserable.
though they boast so much of the industry of the pe0ple; I
say miserable, if compared with our own, at not so to these
poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of the people
is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty.
in some parts, which adds to that which call their misery;
and I must needs think the naked savages of America live
much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as
they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are.
proud and insolent, and in the main are in many parts mere
beggars and drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible; and.
if they can, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves,
which is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as the contempt
of all the world but themselves.

1 must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here ; and
yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very con-
venient for travellers: but nothing was more awkward to me
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the
midst of the grossest simplicit and ignorance ; and my friend
Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these occa-
sions, to see the beggarly pride of these people: for example,
coming by the house of a country gentleman, as Father SimOn
called him, about ten leagues oil' the city of Nanquin, we had
first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house
about two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit
was very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew, being a
dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes
almost on every side; it covered a tatl'ety vest, as greasy as a
butcher's, and which testified that his honour must be a most
exquisite sloven. His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling
creature, and he had two slaves followed him on foot to drive
the poor creature along; he had a whip in his hand, and he
belaboured the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did
about the tail; and thus he rode by us, with about ten or
twelve servants, going from the city to his country seat, about
half a league before us. \Ve travelled on gently, but this figure
of a gentleman rode away before us, and as we stopped at a
village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the
country seat of this great man, we saw him in a little place
before his door, eating his repast. It was a kind of a garden,404 am :srcuas or

but he was easy to be seen: and we were given to understand
that the more. we looked at him the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree. something like the palmetto. which etl'ec-
tually shaded him over the head. and on the south side: but
under the. tree. was also placed a large umbrella. which made.
that part look well enough; he sat lolling back in a great
elbow-chair. being a heavy corpuleut man. and had his meat
brought him by two women slaves; he had two more. one of
which fed the. squire with a spoon. and the. other held the dish
with one hand. and scraped otl' what he let fall upon his wor-
ship's beard and tatl'cty vest with the other; while the great
l'at brute thought it below him to employ his own hands in any
of those familiar otlices. which kings and monarchs would rather
do than he troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.

I took this time to think what pains men's pride puts them
to. aml how troublesome a haughty temper. thus ill managed.
must be to a man of common sense: and leaving the poor
wretch to please himself with our looking at him. as it' we
admired his pomp. though we really pitied and contemned
him. we pursued our journey; only Father Simon had the
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country
justice had to feed on in all his state. which he had the honour
to taste of. and which was. I think. a mess ot'boilcd rice. with
a great piece of garlic in it. and a little bag tilled with green
pepper, and another plant which they have there. something
like our ginger. but smelling like musk. and tasting like mus-
tard ; all this was put together. and a small piece of lean mutton
boiled in it. and this was his worship's repast; four or five.
servants more attended at a distance. who, we supposed. were
to eat of the same after their master.

As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled. he was re-
spected as a king. surrounded always with his gentlemen. and
attended in all his appearances with such pomp. that I saw
little of him but. at. a distance: but this I observed. that there
was not a horse in his retinuc but that our earriers' pack-horses
in England seemed to me to look much better: though it was
hard to judge rightly. for they were so covered with equipage.
mantles. trappings. the. that we could scarce see any thing but
their feet and their heads as they went along.

I was now light-hearted. and all my trouble and perplesity
that l have given an account of being over, I had no anxious
thought about me. which made this journey the pleasanter to
me; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in passing or
fording a small river my horse fell. and made me free of the.
country. as they call it. that is to say. threw me in; the place
was not deep. but. it wetted me all over. I mention it. because
it spoiled my pocket-book. wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion to remember.
and which, not taking due care of. the leaves rotted, and the
words were never after to be read. to my great loss as to the
names of some places I touched at in this journey.

At length we arrived at Peking; I had nobody with me but
the youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend
me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and
my partner had nobody with him but one servant, who was a
kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to
see the court, we bore his charges for his company. and to use
him as an interpreter, for he understoml the language of the
country, and spoke good French, and a little English; and.
indeed, this old man was a most useful implement to us every
where; for we had not been above a week at Peking, when he
came laughing. Ah, Senhor Inglese. says he, I have something
to tell you will make your heart glad.---My heart glad! says
I; what can that be '! I don't know any thing in this country
can either give me joy or grief, to any great dcgree.---Yes,
yes. said the old man, in broken English, make on glad, the
sorry.---Why, said I , will it make you sorry !-- ecause, said
he. you have brought me here twenty-five days' journey. and
will leave me to go back alone, and which way shall I get to
my port afterwards without a ship, without a horse, without
pecune: so he called money, being his broken Latin, of which
he had abundance to make us merr with. In short, he told
us there was a great caravan of uscovite and Polish mer-
chants in the city, preparing to set out on their journey by
land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and he was sure
we would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him
behind, to go back alone.

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and
had scarce power to speak to him for came time; but at last I
turned to him, How do you know this? said I. Are you sure
it is true ?---Yes, says he; I met this morning in the street an
old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them ;
he came last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Ton-
quin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind,
and is now resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so
down the river Wolga to Astracan.-----Well, senhor, says I,
do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be
a method for my return to England, it shall be your fault if
you go back to Macao at all. We then went to consult toge-
ther what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his
atfairs? He told me he would do just as I would; for he had
settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his efl'ccts in
such good hands, that as we had made a good voyage here, if
he could vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as might
be worth the carriage, he would be content to go to England,
apd then make his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's
8 ms.
llaving resolved upon this. we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot wouhl go with us we would hear his charges to Moscow.
or to England. it' he pleased; nor. indeed. were we to be
esteemed over generous in that neither. it' we had not rewarded
him farther. the service he had done us being really worth
more than that: for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea.
but he had been like a broker for us on shore; and his pro-
curing for us the. Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds
in our pockets. So we consulted tog 9ther about it. and being
willing to gratify him. which was but doing him justice. aml
very willing also to have him with us besides. for he was a
most necessary man on all occasions. we agreed to give him a
quantity of coined gold. which. as l compute it. came to about
one hundred aml seventy-live pounds sterling. between us. aml
to hear all his charges. both for himself and horse. except only
a horse to carry his goods. Having settled this between our-
selves. we callcd him to let him know what we had resolved. I
told him he had complained of our being to let him go back
alone. and l was now to tell him we were resolved he should
not go back at all; that as we had resolved to go to Europe
with the caravan. we resolved also he should go with us; aml
that we 'alled him to know his mind. He shook his head. aml
said. it was a longjourney. aml he had no permit to carry him
thither. or to subsist himself when he 'ame there. "'12 told
him we believed it was so. and therefore we had resolved to do
something for him that should let him see how sensible we were
of the service he had done us. and also how agreeable he was
to as; aml then I told him what we. had resolved to give him
here. which he might lay out as we would do our own: and
that as for his charges. if he would go with us we Would set
him safe on shore (life and casualties excepted) either in M us-
covy or England. which he would. at our own charge. except
only the carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like
a man transported. aml told us he would go with us over the
whole world; and so we all prepared for our journey. How-
ever. as it was with us. so it was with the other merchants:
they had many things to do; and instead of being ready in five
weeks. it was four months and some days before all things were
got together.

It was the beginning of February. our style. when we set out
from Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone express
back to the port where we had first put in. to dispose of some
goods which we had left there; and l. with a Chinese merchant
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Peking on his own all'airs. went to Nanquin. where I bought
ninety pieces of fine damasks. with about two lmndred pieces
of other very tine silks of several sorts. some mixed with gold.
and had all these brought to Peking against my partner's
return; besides this, we bought a very large quantity of raw
silk. and some other goods. onr cargo amounting. in these
goods only. to about three thousand tive hundred pounds ster-
ling; which. together with tea. aml some tine calicoes. and
three cmnels' loads of nutmegs and cloves. loaded in all
eighteen camels for our share, besides those we rode upon:
which, with two or three spare horses. and two horses loaded
with provisions. made us, in short, twenty-six camels and
horses in our retiaue.

The company was very great, and. as near as I can remem-
ber. made betWeen three and four hundred horse. and upwards
ot'one hundred and tWenty men. very well armed, and provided
for all events: for as the eastern caravans are subject to be
attacked by the Arabs. so.are these by the Tartars; but they
are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs. nor so barbarous.
when they prevail.

The company consisted of people of several nations; hut
there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of
Moscow, though of them some were Livonians; and to our
particular satisthction. tive of them were Scots, who appeared
also to he men of great expin'ience in business, and of very
good substance.

When we had travelled one day's journey. the guides. who
were live in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants.
that is to say. all the passengers except the servants, to a great
emmcil, as they called it. At this council every one deposited
at certain quantity of money to a common stock. for the neces-
sary expense of buying forage on the way. where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting
horses, and the like: and here they constituted the journey. as
they call it, viz. they named captains and officers to draw as all
up, and give the word of command, in case of an attack, and
give every one their turn of command; nor was this forming
us into order any more than what we found needful upon the
way. as shall be observed.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous.
and is full of potters and earth makers, that is to say, people
that temper the earth for the China-ware; and as I was coming
along. our Portugal pilot. who had always something or other
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me he
would show me the greatest rarity in all the country. and that
I should have this to say of China. after all the ill--humoured
things I had said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not
to be seen in all the world beside. I was very importnnate to
know what it was: at last he told me it was a gentleman's
house built with China-ware. Well, as s I. are not the mate-
rials ot' their buildings the product of t neir own country, and
so it is all China ware. is it not l--No, no, says he, I mean it
is a house all made of China-ware, such as you call it in Eng-
land, or as it is called in our country, porcelain.--Well, says
I, such a thing may be; how big 1s it? Can we earn it in a
box upon a camel. ' If we can, we will buy it.--Upon a camel!
says the old pilot, holding up both his hands; why there IS a
family of thirty people lives 111 it.

I was then curious, indeed. to see it; and when I came to it.
it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house
built, as we. call it in England, with lath and plaster; but all
this plastering was really China-ware, that is to say, it was
plastered with the earth that makes china-11 are. The outside.
11 Inch the sun shone hot upon. was glazed. and looked very
w,ell perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the
large thna-n are in England 13 painted, and hard as if it had
been burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wain-
scot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little
square tiles we call galley -tiles in England, all made of the
finest China, and the figures exceeding fine, indeed, 111th ex-
traordinary varietv of colours. mixed with gold; mauv tiles
making but one figure but joined so artificially. the mortar
being made at the same earth, that it was very hard to see
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the. same
composition. and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use
in several parts of England; as hard as stone. and smooth, but
not burned and painted. except some smaller rooms, like
closets, which were all as it were paved with the satne tile:
the ceiling, and all the plastering work in the whole house.
were of the same earth: and. after all, the roof was covered
with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was
a China \1 arehouse, indeed, truly and literally to be called so.
and had I not been upon the journey, I could have stayed
some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They told
me there 11' ere fountains and fish-ponds 111 the. garden, all paved
on the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues set
up in rows 011 the walks. entirely formed of the porcelain
earth, and burned whole.

As this is one at the singularities of China, so they may be
allowed to excel 111 it; but I am very sure they excel 1n their
accounts ot it: for they told me such incredible things of their
performance 111 croc kery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in par-
ticular. of one workman that made a ship with all its tackle,
and masts and sails, 1n earthen-11 are, big enough to carry fifty
men. If they had told me he launched it, and made a voyage
to J a an in it, I mi ght ha1e said something to it, indeed, but
as it 11 as, I knew the 11 hole ot the story, which was, in short.
asking pardon for the w,ord that the fellow lied; so I smiled,
and said nothing to it.

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for
which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of

three shillings; and told me, if it had been three days journey
without the wall, as it was three days within, he must have
fined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next
council day: I promised to be more orderly; and, indeed, I
found afterwards the orders made for keeping all together
were absolutely necessary for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for
a fortification against the Tartars; and a very great work it is.
going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where the
rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did.
no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a
thousand English miles, but that the country is live hundred in
a straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without mea-
suring the windings and turnings it takes; it is about four
t'athoms high. and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our
orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to
look at it on every side, near and far off, I mean that was
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who had been
extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to
hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing
to keep out the Tartars ; which he happened not to understand
as] meant it, and so took it for a compliment; but the old
pilot laughed: 0, Senhor Inglese, says he, you speak in colours.
---ln colours! said I ; what do you mean by that?-- \Vhy you
speak what looks white this way. and black that way; gay one
way. and dull another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep
out Tartars; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to
keep out Tartars. I understand you, Senhor Inglese; I under-
stand you ; but Senhor Chinese understood you his own way.
---W'ell, says I, senhor, do you think it would stand out an
army of our country peeple, with a good train of artillery, or
our engineers, with two companies of miners? Would not
they batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in
battalia; or blow it up in the air. foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left ?--Ay, ay, says he, I know that.
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave
him leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then almost
out of their country, and he was to leave us in a little time
after this; but when he knew what I said. he was dumb all the
rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the
Chinese power and greatness while he stayed.

_After we passed this mighty nothing. called a wall, some-
thing like the Picts' wall. so famous in Northumberland. built
by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns and
cuties, as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the
Tartars. who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be
resnsted by the naked inhabitants of an open country. And

killed the second with his pistol. and the third ran away; and
thus ended our light: but we had this mistiirtnne attending it,
that all our mutton we had in chase got away. We had not a
man killed or hurt; but as for the 'l'artars. there were about
live of them killed; how many were wounded we knew not;
but this we knew. that the other party were so frightened with
the noise ot'onr guns, that they made oll', and never made any
attempt upon us.

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions. and there-
fore the 'l'artars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about
live days we entered a vast. great. wild desert, which held as
three days and nights' march; and we were obliged to carry
our water with us in great leathern bottles. and to encamp all
night. just as l have heard they do in the desert of Arabia.

i asked our guides whose dominion this was in; and they
told me this was a kind of border, that might be called no
man's land. being a part oftlreat Karakathay, or Grand 'l'ar-
tary : but. however, it was all reckoned as Inelonging to China.
but that there was no eare taken here to preserve it from the
inroads ot' thieves. and therelbre it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march. though we were to go over some
much larger.

In passing this wilderness. which was at lirst very frightful
to me, we saw. two or three times, little parties ol'the 'l'artars.
but they seemed to be upon their own all'airs, and to have no
design upon us: aml so. like the man who met the devil, if
they had nothing to say to us. we had nothing to say to them;
We let them go. Once, hoWever. a party of them came so near
as to stand and gave at us; whether it was to consider if they
should attack us or not. we knew not; but when We were
passed at some distance by them, we made a rear guard of
forty men. and stood ready for them. letting the :aravan pass
half a mile or thereabouts before us: but after a while they
marched otl': only we found they saluted us with live arrows
at their parting, one of which wounded a horse, so that it
disabled him, and we left him the next day. poor creature, in
great need of a good farrier: they might shoot more arrows.
which might fall short of us, but we saw no more arrows or
'l'artars that time.

We travelled near a month after this. the ways not being so
good as at first. though still in the dominions of the ernperor
of China. but lay for the most part in villag as. some of which
were fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartars. When

1'2
we were come to one of these towns (it was about two days and
a half journey before. we were to come to the city of Naum),
I wanted to buy a camel. of which there are plenty to be sold
all the way upon that road. and horses also. such as they are.
because. so many caravans coming that way they are often
wanted. The person that I spoke. to. to get me a camel. would
have gone and fetched one for me: but I. like a fool. must be
otlieious. and go myself along with him: the place was about
two miles out of the village. where. it seems they kept the
camels and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot. with my old pilot and a Chinese. being
very desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place.
it was a low marshy ground. walled round with a stone wall.
piled up dry. without mortar or earth atnong it. like a park.
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. llaving
bought a camel. and agreed for the price, I catne away. attd
the Chineseman that went with me. led the. camel. when on a
sudden came up the. Tartars on horseback : two ofthem seized
the fellow and took the 'atuel front him. while the other three
stepped up to me and my old pilot. seeing us. as it were.
unarmed. for I had no weapon about me but my sword. Which
could but ill defend me against three horsomen. The first that
came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword. for they
are arrant cowards: but a second coming upon my left. gave
me a blow on the head. which I never felt till afterwards. and
wondered. when l cattle to myself. what was the matter. and
where I was. for he laid me flat on the ground ; bttt my never-
failing old pilot. the Portuguese (so Providence. unlocked for.
directs deliverances from dangers which to us are. nntbrescen).
had a pistol in his pocket. which I knew nothing of. nor the
Tartars neither; if they had. I suppose they would not have
attacked us: but cowards are always boldest when there is no
danger. The old man seeing me down. with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold
of his arm with one. hand. and pulling him down by main force
a little towards him with the other, shot him in the head, and
laid him dead upon the spot. He then immediately snapped
up to him who had stopped as. as I said. and before he could
come fort and again. made a blow at him with a scimitar which
he always were. but missing the man. cut his horse in the. side
of his head, cut one of the cars off by the root. and a great
slice. down by the side of his face. The poor beast. enraged
with the wound. was no more. to be. governed by his rider.
though the fellow sat well enough too. but away he flew. and
carried him quite ontof the pilot's reach; and at some distance
rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and -fell
upon him.

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel. but he had no weapon: however, seeing the Tartar
down, and his horse fallen upon him. away he runs to him,
aml seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he had by his
side. something like a pole-axe. but not a pole-axe neither, he
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian
brains out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to
deal with still ; and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor
come on to tight him. as he apprehended, but stand stock-still,
the old man stood still too. and fell to work with his tackle, to
charge his pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the
pistol, away he scoured. and left my pilot, my champion I
called him afterwards, a complete victory.

By this time I was a little recovered; for I thought when I
first began to wake. that I had been in asweet sleep; but, as I
said above, I wondered where l was, how I came upon the
ground, and what was the matter; but a fizw moments after.
as sense returned. I felt pain, though I did not know where;
so I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody;
then I felt my head ache; and then, in a moment, memory
returned. and every thing was present to me again. ljuniped
upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my sword. but no
enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie dead. and his horse
standing very quietly by him; and, looking farther. I saw my
champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese
'had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand: the old
man, seeing me on my fleet, came running to me. and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been
killed; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt; but
it was not much, only what we call a broken head; neither did
I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the blow, for
it was well again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we
lost a camel and gained a horse; but that which was remark-
able, when we came back to the village, the man demanded to
be paid for the camel; l disputed it, and it was brought to a
hearing before the Chinese judge of the place. To give him
his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and impar-
tiality; and, having heard both sides, he gravely asked the
Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel. whose
servant he was? I am no servant, says he, but went with the
stranger.--At whose request? says the justice. At the stran-
ger's request, says he. Why then, says the justice. you were
the stranger's servant for the time; and the camel being de-
livered to his servant, it was delivered to him, and he must
pay for it.

[confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to
say: but, admiring to see such just reasoning upon the conse-
quence, and an accurate stating of the case, [paid willingly
for the camel, and sent for another; but, you may observe, l
didgmt go to fetch it myself any more, for I had had enough
0 t at.

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire; they
call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this
I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathay,
which, I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the
walls with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those who
understand it laugh at you.

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this
city, when messengers were sent express to every part of the
road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a
guard sent for them; for that an unusual body of 'l'artars,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, it was care-
fully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had
two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese,
on our left, and three hundred more from the city of Naum,
and with these we advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers
from Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear,
and our men on each side of our camels, with our baggage,
and the whole caravan in the centre: in this order, and well
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the
next day, when the did appear, it was quite another thing.

It was early in e morning, when, marching from a well
situated little town, called Changu, we had a river to pass,
which we were obliged to ferry; and, had the Tartars had
any intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us,
when the caravan being over, the rear guard was behind; but
they did not appear there. About three hours after, when we
were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles
over, behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy
was at hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for they came
on upon the spur. '

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind;
and, being near me, called out, Senhor Inglese, says he, those
fellows must be'encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if
the Tartars come on, they will never stand it.--I am of your
mind, said I; but what must be done ?--Done! says he, let
fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing, and
encourage them ; and they will fight like brave fellows in brave
company; but, without this, they will every man turn his
back. Immediately I rode up to our leader, and told him,
who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty of us
marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest
made a line of rescue; and so we marched, leavin the last
two hundred men to make a body by themselves, an to guard
the camels; only that, if need were, they should send a hun-
dred men to assrst the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company
they were: how many we could not tell, but ten thousand,
we thought, was the least: a party .of them came on first and
viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our
line; and, as we found them within gun-shot; our leader
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done; but they
went off, and I suppose back, to give an account of the recep-
tion they were like to meet with; and, indeed, that salute
cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood
awhile to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave
over their design, and said no more to us for that time; which
was very agreeable to our circumstances, which were but very
indifi'erent for a battle with such a number.

Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we
thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected to the
value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day.
This is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred
soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the
Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the
Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country, which
lies from this city west for about two hundred miles, as deso-
late and unfit for use ; and more especially being so very
remote, and so difficult to send tr00ps thither for its defence:
for we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy, properly
so called.

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful
deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing over;
and which, as I said, was to be called no man's land; and, on
the 13th of A ril, we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite
dominions. think the first town, or fortress, whichever it
ma be called, that belonged to the czar of Muscovy, was

ed Arguna, being on the west side of the river Arguna.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was so
soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least,
in a country governed by Christians; for though the Musco-
vites do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians,

et such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their way.
t would certainl occur to any man who travels the world as
I have done, and who had any power of reflection, what a
blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name of
God and II Redeemer is known. adored. and worshiped: and
not where the people. given up by Heaven to strong delusions.

WE were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth,
if [understand any thing of the surface of the globe, that is to
be found in any part of the world; we had, at least, twelve
thousand miles to the sea, eastward; two thousand to the
bottom of the Baltic sea, westward ; and above three thousand,
if we left that sea and went on west, to the British and French
channels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian or
Persian sea, south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen
sea, north. Nay, if some people may be believed, there might
be no sea, north-east, till we came round the pole, and con-
sequently into the north-west, and so had a continent of land
into America, the Lord knows where; though I could give
some reasons why I believe that to be a mistake. .

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while
before we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing to
observe there but this: first, that all the rivers run to the east;
as I understood by the charts, which some in our caravan had
with them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the great river
Yamour, or Amour; which river, by the natural course of it,
must run into the East sea, or Chinese Ocean. The story
they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked up with

bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz. three feet about, and
'1' 3
twenty or thirty feet high. I must be allowed to say. I believe
nothing of it : but. as its navigation is of no use, because there
is no trade that way. the Tartars. to whom it alone belongs.
dealing in nothing but cattle, so nobody. that ever I heard of.
has been curious enough either to go down to the mouth of it
in boots. or come up from the mouth of it in ships. as far as I
can find: but this is certain. that this river running cast. in
the latitude. of about fifty degrees. carries a vast concourse of
rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that
latitud ': so we are. sure of sea there.

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several
considerable rivers. whose streams run as due north as the
Yamour runs east. and these are all found to join their waters
with the great river Tartarus, named so from the northernmost
nations of the Mogul 'l'artars; who. as the Chinese say. were
the first 'l'artars in the world; aml who. as our geographers
allege. are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward. as well as all the other
rivers I am yet to speak of. make it evident that the northern
ocean bounds the land also on that side; so that it does not
seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend
itself to join with America on that side. or that there is not a
communication between the northern and eastern ocean: but
of this I shall say no more; it was my observation at that time,
and therefore I take notice of it in this place.

We new advanced from the river Argnna by easy and
moderate journeys, and were. very visibly obliged to the care
the Czar of Museovy has taken to have cities aml towns built
in as many places as it is possible to place them. where his
soldiers keep garrison. something like the stationary soldiers
placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire ;
some of which that I had read of were placed in Britain. for
the security of commerce. and for the lodging travellers: and
thus it was here; for wherever we. came. though at these
towns and stations the garrisons and govemors were Russians
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans;
sacrificing to idols. and worshiping the sun. moon. and stars.
or all the host of heaven; and not only so. but were, of all the
heathens and pagans that ever I met with. the most barbarous,
except only that they did not eat men's flesh. as our savages
of America did.

Some instances of this we met within the country between
Arguna, where we enter the Mnscovite dominions, and a cit
of Tartars and Russians together, called Nertzinskoi. in whic I
is a continued desert or forest. which cost as twenty days to
travel over. In a village, near the last of these places. I had
the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most
hrutish and unsutl'erable: they had, I suppose, a great sacrifice
that day; for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree, an
idol, made of wood. frightful as the devil: at least. as any
thing we can think of to represent the devil can be made: it
had a head not so much as resembling any creature that the
world ever saw; ears as big as goats' horns. and as high:
eyes as big as a crown piece: a nose like a crooked ram's
horn. and a mouth extended tour-cornered. like that of a lion.
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under hill: it was
dressed up in the filthiest manner that you could suppose: its
upper garment was of sheep-skins. with the wool outward : a
great Tartar bonnet on the head. with two horns growing
through it: it was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or
legs. nor any other proportion of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village :
and. when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they
made no distinction by their habits, all laying flat upon the
ground round this lormidahle block of shapeless wood : I saw
no motion among them any more than if they had been all
logs of wood. like the idol. and at. first I really thought they
had been so; but, when I came a little nearer. they started
up upon their feet. and raised a bowling cry as if it had been
so many deep-mouthed hounds. and walked away. as if they
were displeased at our disturbing them. A little way off from
the idol. and at the door of a tent or hut. made all of sheep-
skins and cow-skins dried. stood three butchers,---l thought
they were such; when I came nearer to tbem.l found they
had long knives in their hands ; and in the. middle of the tent
appeared three sheep killed. aml one young lmllock or steer.
These, it seems. were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol :
the three men were priests belonging to it. and the seventeen
prostrated wretches were the people. who brought the offering.
and were making their prayers to that stock.

I confess, I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgohlin than ever I was at any thing in my
life; to see God's most glorious and best creature. to whom
he had granted so many advantages, even by creation above
the rest of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable
soul. and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities
adapted both to honour his Maker and be honoured by him.
sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid as to prostrate
itself to a frightful nothing. a mere imaginary object. dressed
up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their
own contrivance. adorned only with clouts and ragsz and that
this should be the effect of mere ignorance. wrought up into
hellish devotion by the devil himself; who, envying to his
Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures. had deluded
them into such sordid and brutish things as one would think
should shock nature itself! _

but this was IIII advoIIIurII IpIitI: out of his way; so, I say, we
resolved upon our work. only we three and my man-servant.

and to put it in execution that night about midnight, with all
the secrecy imaginable.

However, upon second thoughts we were willing to delay it
till the next night. because. the caravan being to set forward
in the morning. we supposed the governor could not pretend
to give them any satisfaction upon us when We were out of his
power. The Scots merchant. as stead in his resolution for
the enterprise, as bold in executing, rought me a Tartar's
robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet. with a bow and
arrows. and had provided the same for himself and his coun-
tryman. that the people, if they saw us. should not determine
who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible
matter with aqua vitae, gunpowder. and such other materials
as we could get; and. having a good quantity of tar in a little
pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and
found that the. people had not the least jealousy of danger
attending their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the. moon
gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same
posture and place that it did betbre. The people seemed to be
all at their rest; only. that in the great hut. or tent. as we
called it. where we saw the three priests whom we mistook for
butchers. we. saw a light: and going up close to the door. we
heard people talking as if there were five. or six of them: we
concluded, therefore, that it" we set wildfire to the idol. these
men would come. out immediately and run up to the place to
rescue it from the destruction that we intended for it: and
what to do with them we knew not. Once we thought of
carrying it away and setting fire to it at a distance, but when
we came to handle it. we found it too bulky for our carriage;
so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was for set-
ting fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures that
were there on the head. when they came. out; but I could not
join with that: l was against killing them. if it were possible
to avoid it. "fell. then. said the Scots merchant, I will tell
you what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners.
tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol
destroyed.

As it happened. we had twine or packthread enough about
us, which we used to tie our firelocks together with; so we
resolved to attack thesc people first. and with as little noise as
we could. The first thing we did. we knocked at the door.
when, one of the priests coming to it. we immediately seized
upon him. stopped his mouth. and tied his hands behind him,
and led him to the idol. where we gagged him that he might

not make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on
the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door. expectin that another
would come out, to see what the matter was: at we waited
so long till the third man came back to us; and then nobody
coming out, we knocked again gently. and immediately out
came two more, and we served them just in the same manner.
but were obliged to go all with them. and lay them down by
the idol some distance from one another; when. going back.
we found two more were come out to the door. and a third
stood behind them within the door. We seized the two, and
immediately tied them. when the third stepping back. and cry-
ing out. my Scots merchant Went in after 1m. and. taking out
a composition we had made, that would only smoke and stink.
he set fire to it and threw it in among them: by that time the
other Scotsman and my man. taking charge of the twO may:
already bound. and tied together a so by the arm. led them
away to the idol. and left them there to see if their idol would
relieve them. making haste back to us.

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the but with so
much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw
in a small leather bag of another kind, which flamed like a
candle, and following it in. we found there were but four
people, and. as we supposed. had been about some of their
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared. in short. frightened to
death. at least so as to sit trembling and stupid. and not able
to speak neither. for the smoke.

In a word. we took them. bound them as we had done the
other, and all without any noise. I should have said we brought
them out of the house. or' but, first; for indeed we were not
able to incur the smoke an more than they were. When we
had done this. We carried t em all together to the idol: when
we came there we fell to work with him; and first we daubed
him all over, and his robes also, with tar. and such other stuff
as we had, which was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we
stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gunpowder; then
we wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and
then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to see if we could find an thing else to
help to burn him; when my Scotsman remem mad that by
the tent, or hut, where the men Were, there lay a heap of dry
forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remember; away he
and the other Scotsman ran and fetched their arms full of that.
When we had done this. we took all our prisoners. and brought
them, having untied their feet and ungagged their mouths. and
made them stand up. and set them before their monstrous idol,
and then set fire to the whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour. or thereabouts. till the
powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up,
and, as we could perceive. had split and deformed the shape of
it: and, in a word, till we saw it burned into a mere block or
log of wood: and setting dry forage to it. we found it would
be soon quite constituted; so we began to think of going away :
but the Scotsman said. No, we must not go. for these poor de-
luded wretches will all throw themselves into the tire. and burn
themselves with the idol. So we resolved to stay till the titrage
was burnt down too. and then came away and left them.

After the. feat was pertbrined. we appeared in the morning
among our fellow travellers. exceedingly busy in getting ready
for our journey; nor could any man suggest that we. had been
any where but in our beds. as travellers uught be summsed to
be. to fit themselves for the fatignes of the day's journey.

But the affair did not end so: the next day came a great
nmnber of the mnntry people to the town gates. and in a most
outrageous manner denmnded satisthctioa ofth Russian gov-er.
nor for the insulting their priests. and burning their Cltlltll

',hi-Thaungu. The people of Nertzinskoi were at first in a
great consternatiml. for they said the Tartars were already no
less than thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent
out messengers to appease them. and gave them all the. good
words imaginable; assuring theta that he knew nothing of it.
and that there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad. so
that it could not be. from any body there; but if they could let
him know who did it. they should be exemplarily punished.
They returned haughtily that all the country reverenced the
great Chain Chi-Thaungu. who dwelt in the sun. and no mortal
would have dared to otl'er violence. to his image but some Chris-
tian misereant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war
against him and all the Russians. who. they said. were. mis-
creants and Christians.

The governor. still patient. and umvilling to make a breach.
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him. the
czar having strictly charged them to treat the eonquered
country with g-ntleness and civility. gave them still all the
good words he could. At last he told them there was a cara-
van gone towards Russia that morning. and perhaps it was
some of them who had done them this injury ; and that if they
would be satisfied with that. he would send after them to
inquire into it. This seemed to appease them a little: and
accordingly the governor sent after us. and gave us a particular
account how the thing was; intimating withal. that if any in
our caravan had done it. they should make their escape: but
that. whether we had done it or no, we should make all the
haste forward that was lmssible: and that. in the mean time.
he would keep them in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor; however. when it
came to the caravan. there was nobody knew any thing of the
matter: and as for us that were guilty. we were least of all
suspected. However. the captain of the caravan for the time.
took the hint that the governor gave us. and we travelled two
days and two nights without any considerable stop. and then
we lay at a village called l'lothns: nor did we make any long
stop here. but hastened on towards .larawena. another of the
czar of Mnscovy's colonies. and where we expected we should
be safe. lint upon the second day's march from l'lothus. by
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance. some of our
people began to he sensible we were pursued. We had entered
a great desert. and had passed by a great luke called Sehaks
User. when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on
the other side of the lake. to the north. we travelling west. We
observed they went away west. as we did. but had supposed
we would have taken that side of the lake. whereas We very
happily took the south side; and in two days more they dis-
appeared agaiu: for they. believing We were still before them.
pushed on till they came to the river lldda. a very great river
when it passes further north. but when we came to it We timed
it narrow and fordahle.

The third day. they had either found their mistake. or had
intelligence of us. and came pouring in upon us towards the
desk of the evening. We had. to our great satisfaction. just
pitched upon a place for our eiunp. which was very convenient
for the night; for as we were open a desert. though hut at the
beginning of it. that was above live hundred miles over. We had
no towns to lodge at. and. indeed, expected none but the city
Jarawena. which we had yet We days march to: the desert.
however. had some tow woods in it on this side. and little
rivers. which ran all into the great river lldda; it Was in a
narrow strait. between little. but very thick woods. that we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to he attacked
before morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what We were pursued for: but
as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go almut in norms in
that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every
night against them. as against armies of robbers; and it was
therefore no new thing to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most
advantageous camp; for we lay between two woods. with a
little rivalet running just before our front. so that we could
not be surrounded. or attacked any way but in our front or
rear. We took care also to make our front as strong as we
could. by placing our packs. with our camels and horses. all in
a line, on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in our
rear.

in this posture we eucamped for the night: but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished our sitiuition. They did
not come on us like thieves. as we expected. but sent three
messengers to us. to demand the men to he delivered to them
that had abused their priests. and burned their god Cham Chi-
Thaungn with fire, that they might burn them with tire; and
upon this, they said, they would go away. and do us no farther
harm. otherwise they would destroy us all. Our men looked
very blank at this message, and began to stare at one another,
to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces: but.
nobody was the word; nobody did it. The leader of the cura--
van sent word he. was well assured that it was not done by any
of our camp; that we were peaceable merchants. travelling on
our business; that we had done no harm to them or to any one
else; and that. therefore, they must look farther for their one-
mies who had injured them. for we were not the people; so
desired them not to disturb us. for. if they did. we should
defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer;
and a great crowd of them came running down in the morning.
by break of day, to our camp 3 but seeing us in such an unac-
countable situation, they durst come no farther than the brook
in our front. where they stood, and showed us such a number
that indeed terrified us very much: for those. that spoke least
of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and looked
at us awhile. and then setting up a great howl. they let fly a
cloud of arrows among us; but we were well enough fortified
for that. for we sheltered under our baggage. and I do not
remember that one of us was hurt.

Some time after this. we saw them move a little to our right.
and expected them on the rear: when a cunning fellow. a
Cossack of Jarawena. in the pay of the M nscovites. calling to
the leader of the. caravan. said to him. I'll go semi all these
people away to Siheilka; this was a city four or five days'
journey at least to the right. and rather behind us. So he takes
his bow and arrows. and getting on horseback. he rides away
from our rear directly. as it were back to Nertzinskoi; after
this. he takes a great circuit about, and comes directly on the
army of the Tartars. as if he had been sent express to tell them
along story. that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-
Thaungu were gone to Siheilka. with a caravan of miscreants.
as he called them. that is to say. Christians; and that they had
resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Ton-
gueses.

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar. and perfectly
spoke their language; he oouutert'eited so well, that they all
took it from him. and away they drove in a most violent hurry
to Siheilka. which, it seems, was five days' journey to the
north; and in less than three hours they were entirely out of
our sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor whether
they went to Siheilka or no. So we passed away safely on to
J arawena. where there was a garrison of Muscovites. and there
we rested five days: the caravan being exceedingly fatigued
with the last day's hard march. and with want of rest in the
nig it. '
From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us
twenty-three dnys' march. We furnished ourselves with some
tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night:
and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or
waggons of the country. for carrying our water or provwions;
and these carriages were our defence. every night, round our
little camp: so that had the Tartars appeared, unless the had
been very numerous indeed, they would not have been a dc to
hurt us.

We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long
journey; for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and
scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of the sable hunters.
who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary. of which this country
is a part; and the frequently attack small caravans, but we
saw no numbers 0 them together.

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country
pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and
castles, settled by the czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of
stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans, and defend the
country against the 'l'nrtars. who would otherwise make it
ve dangerous travelling; and liis czarish majesty has given
sue strict orders for the well tarding the caravans and mer-
chants, that, if there are any Enters heard of in the country,
detachments of the garrisons are always sent to see the travel-
lers safe from station to station. And thus the governor of
Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by
means of the Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him.

ofl'ered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any
danger, to the next station.

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe
we should find the country better inhabited, and the people
more civilized; but I found myself mistaken in both: for we
had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass through, where we
saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; only,
as they were conquered by the Muscovites, the were not so
dangerous; but for rudeness of manners, an idolat , no
people in the world ever went beyond them: they are c othed
all in skins of beasts, and their houses are built of the same;
you know not a man from a woman, neither by the ruggedness
of their countenances nor their clothes; and in the winter,
when the ground is covered with snow, they live under ground
in vaults, which have cavities going from one to another.

If the Tartars had their Chant Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every but and every
cave: besides, they worship the stars, the sun. the water, the
snow, and, in a word, every thing they do not understand, and
they understand but ve little; so that every element, every
uncommon thing, sets t em a sacrificing. i met with nothing
peculiar to myself in all this country. which I reckon was.
from the desert I spoke of last. at least four hundred miles.
half of it being another desert. which took as up twelve days
severe travelling. without house or tree : and we. were obliged
again to carry our own provisions. as Well water as bread.
After we Were out of this desert. aml had travelled two days.
we came to Janezay. a Mascovite city or station on the great
river .lanezay (chisey). which, they told as there, parted
Europe from Asia.

Here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed.
except in the Muscovite garrisons; all the country between
the river Uby and the river Janezay is as catirelv pagan. and
the people as barbarous. as the remotest ot' the 'I'artnrs; nay.
as any nation. for anght I know. in Asia or America. I also
found. which I observed to the Mnscovite governors whom I
had an opportunity to converse with. that the poor pagans are
not much wiser. or nearer Christianity. for being nmlcr the
Mnscovitc government. which they acknowledged was true
enough; but that, as they said. was none of their business;
that it' the czar expected to convert his Siberian. 'l'ongnese. or
Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen among
them. not soldiers; and. they added. with more sincerity than
I expected, that they found it was not so much the wncern of
their monarch to make the people Christians as it was to make
them subjects.

From this river to the great river Oby. we crossed a wild
uncultivated country. barren of people and good management.
otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant. fruitful. and agreeable
country. \Vhat inhabitants We found in it are all pagans.
except such as are sent among them from Russia: for this is
the country. I mean on both sides the river Oby, whither the
Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished. and
from whence it is next to impossible they should ever come
awav.

I have nothing material to say of my particular all'airs till I
came to Tobolski. the capital city of Siberia, where I continued
some. time on the following occasion.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey. and
winter began to came on space; whereupon my partner and I
called a council about our particular atl'airs. in which we found
it proper, as we were bound for England. and not for Moscow.
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of
sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter
time; and. indeed. they have such things that it would be
incredible to relate the particulars of. by which means the
Russians travel more. in the winter than they can in summer.
as in these sledgcs they are able to run night and day; the.
snow being frozen, is one universal covering to nature. by
which the hills. vales. rivers. and lakes. are all smooth and

hard as a stone. and they run upon the surface, without any
regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this
kind; I was bound to England. not to Moscow. and my route
lay two ways: either I must go on as the caravan went. till I
came to Jaroslaw. and then go otl' west for Narva. and the gulf
of Finland. and so to Dantzic. where I might possibly sell my
China cargo to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan
at a little town on the "wins. from whence I had but six days
by water to Archangel. and from thence might be sure of ship-
ping either to England. llollaad. or Hamburgh.

Now. to go any of these journeys in the winter would have
been preposterous: for as to Dantzic. the Baltic would have
been frozen up. and lcould not get passage: and to go by land
in those countries was far less safe than among the Mogul 'l'ar-
tars: likewise. to go to Archangel in October. all the ships
would be gone from thence. and even the merchants who dwell
there in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter. when
the ships are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity
of cold to encounter. with a scarcity of provisions. and must
lie in an empty town all the winter: so that. upon the whole.
I thought it much my better way to let the caravan go. and
make provision to winter where l was. at Tobolski. in Siberia.
in the latitude of about sixty degrees. where l was sure of
three things to wear out a cold winter with. viz. plenty of pro-
visions. such as the country atl'orded. a warm house. with fuel
enough, and excellent company.

I was now in a quite different climate from my beloved
island. where. I never felt cold. except when I had my ngue;
on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my
back. and never made any tire but without doors. which was
necessary for dressing my food. 8w. Now I made me three
good vests. with large robes or gowns over them. to hang down
to the feet. and button close to the wrists; and all these lined
with furs. to make them sullieicntly warm.

As to a warm house. I must confess I greatly disliked our
way in England of making tires in every room in the house in
open chimneys. which, when the tire was out. always kept the
air in the. room cold as the climate; but taking an apartment
in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimne to be built
like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms. ike a stove;
the. funnel to carry the smoke went up one way. the door to
come at the fire went in another. and all the rooms were kept
equally warm. but no tire seen. just as they beat the bsgnios
in England. By this means. we had always the same climate
in all the rooms. and an equal heat was preserved; and how
cold soever it was without, it was always warm within: and
yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke.

that conquers a city. But. my lord. said I. shall I take the
liberty to ask you a question I--With all my heart. says he.
If the door of your liberty was opened, said 1- , II ould you not
take hold of it to deliver you from this exile .---I-lold, said he;
your question is subtile, and requires some serious. just dis-
tinctions. to give it a sincere answer; and I will give it you
from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I know of In this
world would move me to deliIer my'selt front this state of
banishment. except these two; first. the enjoyment of my
relations; and. secondly. a little warmer climate: but 1 pro-
test to you. that to go back to the pomp of the court. the
glory. the poII er. the hurry of a minister of state: the wealth.
the gaiety. and the pleasures of a courtier; if my master should
send me word this moment that he restores me to all he ba-
nished me from. I protest. if I know an self at all I would not
leaIe this wilderness. these deserts. and these frozen lakes. for
the palace at Moscow. ----But. my lord. said I. perhaps you not
only are. banished from the pleasures of the court. and from
the gum er. authority. and II ealth you enon ed before. but you
may be absent too trom some of the com euiences of life; your
estate. perhaps. confiscated. and your efleets plundered . and
the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary
demands of life. --AIe. says he. that Is as you suppose me to
be a lord. or a prmt e. &c. , so. indeed. I anI' . but you are now
to consider me only as a man. a human creature. not at all
distinguished from another : and so I can suffer no want. unless
I should be visited with sickness and distempers. However.
to put the question out of dispute, you see our manner; we
are. in this place, five persons of rank; we live perfectly re-
tired. as suited to a state of banishment; we have something
rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes. which keeps us
from the mere necessity of hunting for food; but the poor
soldiers, who are here without that help. live in as much plenty
as we. who go into the II oods and catch sables and foxes; the
labour of a month will maintain them a year . and. as the II ay
of living Is not expensive. so it is not hard to get sufficient to
ourselI es. So that obiection Is out of doors.

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable
conversation I had with this truly great man. . in all which he
showed that his mind II as so inspired with a superior know-
ledge of things. so supported by religion. as well as by a mat
share of wisdom. that his contempt of the world II as really as
much as he had e\pressed. and that he II as always the same
to the last. as II Ill appear in the story I am going to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dark. dreadful winter.
I thought it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as
look abroad II Ithout being wrapped III furs, and a mask of fur
before IIII face. or rather a hood. with only a hole for breath.
and two for sirrht: the little daylight we had was, as we
reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a day, and
six at most; only that the snow lying on the ground con--
tinually, and the weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our
horses were kept, or rather starved, underground, and as for
our servants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves and
horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to
thaw and take care of. lest they should mortify and fall off.

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being
close. the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double.
Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the
season; bread good enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish
of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton and of the buli'aloes.
which is pretty good meat. All the stores of provisions for
the winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured: our
drink was water, mixed with aqua-vine instead of brandy;
and for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, they
have excellent good. The hunters, who venture abroad all
weathers, frequently brought us in fine venison, and sometimes
bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last. We had
a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends, as
above. and we lived very cheerfully and well, all things con-
sidered.

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and
the weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers began
to prepare sled es to carry them over the snow, and to get
things ready to e going; but my measures being fixed, as I
have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic.
I made no motion ; knowing very well that the ships from the
south do not set out for that part of the world till May or June,
and that if I was there by the beginning of August. it would
be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; and there-
fore I made no-haste to be gone, as others did: in a word, I
saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away before
me. It seems, every year they 0 from thence to Muscovy
for trade. viz. to carry furs, and uy necessaries, which they
bring back with them to furnish their shops: also others went
on the same errand to Archangel ; but then they all being to
come back again, above eight hundred miles, went all out
before me.

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up:
and. as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all
these people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go whither
they would, why they did not then go away to any part of the
world, wherever they thought fit; and I began to examine
what should hinder them from making such an attempt. But
my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject with
the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus: Con-
sider, first, sir, said he, the place where we are ; and, secondly,

U
the condition we are in ; especially the generality of the people
who are banished hither. We. are surrounded with stronger
things than bars or bolts; on the north side an unnavigable
ocean, where ship never sailed. and boat never swam; every
other way. we have above. a thousand miles to pass through
the czar's own dominions. and by ways utterly impassable.
except by the roads made by the government. and through
the towns garrisoned by his troops; so that we. could neither
pass undiscovered by the road. nor subsist any other way ; so
that it is in vain to attempt it.

I was silenced, indeed. at once. and found that they were in
a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in
the castle at Moscow: however. it came. into my thoughts that
I might certainly be made. an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person; and that. whatever hazard I ran. I
would certainly try it'l could carry him off. Upon this I took
an occasion. one evening. to tell him my thoughts. I repre-
sented to him that it was very easy for me. to carry him away.
there being no guard over him in the country; and as I was
not going to Moscow. but to Archangel. and that! went in the
retinue of a caravan. by which I was not obliged to lie in the
stationary towns in the desert. but could encamp every night
where I would. we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
angel. where I would immediately secure him on board an
English ship. and carry him safe along with me; and as to
his subsistence. and other particulars, it should be my care.
till he. could better supply himself.

Ile heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me
all the while. I spoke; nay. I could see in his very face that
what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his
colour frequently changed. his eyes looked red. and his heart
fluttered. that it might be even perceived in his countenance;
nor could he immediately answer me when I had done. and as
it were. hesitated what he would say to it: but after he had
paused a little. be embraced me. and said. How unhappy are.
we. unguarded creatures as we are. that even our greatest
acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made
temptcrs of one another! My dear friend, said be. your otl'er
is so sincere, has such kindness in it. is so disinterested in
itself, and is so calculated for my advantage. that I must have
very little knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at
it. and acknowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for
it. But did you believe I was sincere. in what I have often
said to you of my contempt of the world '! Did you believe I .
spoke my very soul to you. and that I had really obtained that
degree of felicity here that had placed the above all that the
world could give me? Did you believe I was sincere when I
told you I would not go back. if I was recalled even to be all
that I once was in the court, with the favour of the czar my
master? Did you believe me, my friend, to he an honest man;
or did you believe me to be a boasting hypocrite? Here he
stopped, as if he would hear what I would say; but, indeed,
I soon after perceived that he stopped because his spirits were
in motion, his great heart was full of struggles, and he could
not go on. I was, I confess, astonished at the thing as well as
at the man, and I used some arguments with him to urge him
to set himself free; that he ought to look upon this as a door
opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by
Providence, who has the care and disposition of all events, to
do himself good, and to render himself useful in the world.

He had by this time recovered himself : How do you know,
sir, says he warmly. but that, instead of a summons from
Heaven. it may be a feint of another instrument; representing
in alluring colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin!
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to my former
miserable greatness; there I am not sure but that all the seeds
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain
in nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, again
overwhelm me: and then the happy prisoner, whom you see
now master of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave
of his own senses. in the full of all personal liberty. Dear sir,
let me remain in this blessed confinement. banished from the
crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the
expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the future happiness
which I now have in my new, but shall then, I fear, quickly
lose sight of; for I am but flesh; a man, a mere man; have
passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me
as any man: 0 be not my friend and tempter both together!

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw. The
struggle in his soul was so great, that though the weather was
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweat. and I
found he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or
two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him
again, and then I withdrew to to own apartment.

About two hours after, I hear somebody at or near the door
of my room, and I was going to open the door, but he had
opened it, and came in. My dear friend, says he, you had
almost overset me, but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that
I do not close with your offer; I assure you it is not for' want
of sense of the kindness of it in you ; and I came to make the
most sincere acknowledgment of it to on; but I hope I have
got the victory over myself.---My lord), said I, I hope you are
fully satisfied that you do not resist the call of Heaven.--Sir,
said be, if it had been from Heaven, the same power would have
influenced me to have accepted it: but I hope, and am fully
satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I declined it; and I have
intinite satisfaction in the parting. that you shall leave IIIII an
honest man still. though not a free man.

I had nothinII' to do but to IIeIpIiesI e. and make prothssious
to him ot m_I haIing no end III it but II sincere desire to serIe
him. He einhraced Ine Iery passionately . and assured me he
was svnsihle III that. and should always acknowledge it; and
with that he otl'ered Ine II very tine present of sahles. too much.
indeed. for me to accept from II IIIIIII in his circumstances. and
I would have avoided them. hut he would not he refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with II
small present of tea. and two pieI-esot' China damask. and four
little wedges of Japan gold. which did not all weigh IIlIoI'II six
ounces or thereahout. but were far short of the value of his
sahles. which. when I came to England. I found worth near
two hundred pounds. IIII aeeeptId the tea. and one piece of
the damask. and one. ot the pieces ot Irold which had a line
stamp upon it. of the. Japan coinage. which I found he took
for the rarity oI it. hut would not take any more. . and he sent
word hI my serIant that IIII desired to speak with me.

I made no hesitation. hut told him I would do it. I made
some ee remonv in letting him understand that it was wholly
on his account; and that se eing I could not prevail on him. I
would show my respect to him by my concern for his son . but
these things are too tedious to repeat here. He. sent away the.
next day for his son; and III about twenty days he. came. back

me. and. in short. we. concerted the manner of our travelling,
and may thing pmpe.r for the Journev.

I had hought a considerable quantity of sahlI-s. IIII lt'Ii fox-
skins. tine ermines, and such other furs as are Iery rich. in
that city, in exchange for some. ot the goods I had brought
from China ; in particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which
I sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better price than I could have got at London ;
and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose
business more particularly than mine was merchandise. was
mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the trallic we
made here.

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place.
a city, I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it
is so far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it
should be much talked of. We were now reduced to a ver
small caravan. having only thirty-two horses and camels in al ,
and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was
proprietor of eleven of them: it was most natural also that I
should take more servants with me than 1 had before; and the
young lord passed for my steward; what great man I passed
for myself. I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that
we met with in our whole journey ; I call it the worst. because
the way was very deep in some places, and very uneven in
others; the best we had to say for it was, that we thoilght we
had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear, and that they
never came on this side the river Oby, or at least but very
seldom; but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had a faithful Muscovite, or rather a Sibe-
rian servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the country,
and led us by private roads. so that we avoided coming into
the principal towns and cities upon the great road. SIICII as
Tumcn, Soloy Kamskoi, and several others; because the
Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious
and strict in their observation upon travellers, and searching
lest any of the banished persons of note should make their
escape that way into Muscovy ; but by this means, as we were
kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and
we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents. when we might
have had very good accommodation in the cities on the way:
this the young lord \ 'as so sensible of , that he would not allow
us to lie abroad when we came to several cities on the way.
but lay abroad himself, with his servant, in the woods, and
met us always at the appointed places.

We were just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary between Europe
and Asia, and the first city on the European side was called
Soloy Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the great city on
the river Kama; and here we thought to see some evident
alteration in the people; but we were mistaken: for as we had
a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long
in some places, but not above two hundred miles over where

we passed it, so till we came past that horrible place, we found
u 2
very little ditl'ereuce between that country and the Mogul 'l'ar-

tary: the people are mostly pagans. and little better than the
savages ot' \Inerica; their houses and towns tall at idols. and
their II III III living wholly barbarous. except in the cities. as

in passing this forest. I thought. indeed. we must (after all
our dangers were to our imagination escaped. as before) have
been plundered and robbed. and perhaps murdered. by II troop
ot thieves; ot what country they were I am yet at a loss to
know. but they II ere all on horseback. carried bows atnl arrows.
and were at tirst about t'ortI -ll\'t' in number; they came so
near to us as to be within two musket-shots. aml asking no

earnestly upon us tw ice. ' at length they placed themselves just
in our nay. . upon which II c drew up in a little line. before.
our camels being not aboI II sixteen IIIIIII in all; and being
drawn up thus IIIII halted. and sent out the Siberian scrIant.
who attended his lord. to see who they new: his master was
the more willing to let him go. because he was not .I little.
apprehensive. that they were a Siberian troop sent out utter
him. The man came. up near them with II flag at truce. and
called to them. . but though he spokesevernl ot their languages.
or dialects of languages rather. he could not understand It
word they said : however. after some signs to him not to come
nearer to them. at his peril. the fellow came back no II iscr
than he IIIIIIIIt . only that by their dress. he said. he believed
them to be some 'l'artars ot' l\almuck. or III the Circassinn
hordes. and that there must be more ot them upon the great
desert. though he never heard that any at them were seen so
far north before.

About an hour after. they again made a motion to attack Its.
and rode round our little II ooIl to see where they might break
in; but finding us always ready to face them. they went otl
again . and II II resolved not to stir for that night.

This was small comfort to us; hoIIever. II II had no rcmedy' .
there was. on our left hand. at about a quarter ot a mile dis-
tance. a little. grove. and very near the road. I immediately
resolved we should advance to those trees. and loud y ourselves
as well as we. could there. I for. first. I considered that the trees

would in a great measure cover as from their arrows . and. in
the next place. they could not come to charge. us in a body: it

'as, indeed. my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it. and
who had this excellcney attending him. that he was always

rcadicst and most apt to dIrIIct and encourage us in cases of the
most danger. We advanced iInIIIediatcly, with what speed we
could, and gained that little wood; the Tartars, or thieves, for
we knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not
attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we found, to
our great satisthction, that it was a swampy piece of ground,
and on the one side a very great spring of water, which run-
ning out in a little brook, was, a little farther, joined by another
of the like size; and was, in short, the source of a considerable
river, called afterwards the Wirtska: the trees which grew
about this spring were not above two hundred, but very large,
and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in we saw
ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they attacked
us on foot.

While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some
hours, without perceiving they made any movement, our l'or-
tuguese, with some help, out several arms of trees half otl', and
laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in a
manner fenced us in. About two hours before night they came
down directly upon us: and though we had not perceived it,
we found they had been joined by some more of the same, so
that they were near tourseore horse; whereof, hoWever, we
fancied some were Women. They came on till they were within
half shot of our little wood, when we tired one musket without
bail, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off: but they came on with
a double fury up to the wood side, not imagining we were so
barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old pilot
was our captain, as Well as our engineer, and desired us not to
tire upon them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might
be sure to kill; and that when we did tire, we should be sure
to take good aim; we bade him give the word of command,
which he delayed so long, that they were some of theln within
two pikes length of us when we let fly. We aimed so true that
we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, as
also several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets at least.

They were terribly surprised with our tire, and retreated
immediately about one hundred rods from us, in which time
we loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that dis-
tance, we sallied out, and catched four or five of their horses,
whose riders we supposed were killed: and coming up to the
dead, we judged they were Tartars, but knew not how they
came to make an excursion such an unusual length.

We. slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of
the night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the
entrances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We
waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very un-
welcome discovery, indeed; for the enemy, who we thought

-were discouraged with the reception they met with. were now

greatly increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or
tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us: and this little
camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three quar-
ters of a mile from us. We were, indeed, surprised at this
discovery; and now. I confess. I gave myself over for lost,
and all that I had; the loss of my effects did not lie so near
me. though very considerable. as the. thoughts of falling into
the hands of such barbarians. at the latter end of my journey.
after so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone through,
and even in sight of our port. where we expected safety and
deliverance. As to my partner, he. was raging. and declared
that to lose his goods would be his rain. and that he would
rather die than be starved; and he was for fighting to the last
drop.

The young lord. as gallant as ever flesh showed itself. was
for fighting to the. last also; and my old pilot was of the
opinion that we were able to resist them all in the situation we.
were then in; and thus we spent the day in debates of what
we should do: but towards evening we found that the number
of our enemies still increased, and we did not know but by the
morning they might be a still greater number; so I began to
inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski, if there
were no private ways, by which we might avoid them in the
night. and perhaps retreat to some town. or get help to guard
as over the desert. The Siberian, who was servant 'to the
young lord, told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not
fight, he would engage to carry us ofl' in the night, to a way
that went north, towards the river Petrou. by which he made
no question but we might get away, and the Tartars never the
wiser: but, he said, his lord had told him he would not retreat,
but would rather choose to fight. I told him he mistook his
lord; for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the
sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave enough, by what he
had showed already; but that his lord knew better than to
desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five hundred, unless
an unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and that, if he
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we had nothing
else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his lordship gave
him such orders he would lose his life if he did not perform it:
we soon brought his lord to give that order, though privately.
and we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice.

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire
in our little camp. which we kept burning, and prepared so as
to make it burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we
were still there; but as soon as it was dark, and we could see
the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having all our
horses and camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide,
who I soon found steered himself by the north star.

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be
lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon
began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning we were
got above thirty miles, having almost spoiled our horses. Here
we found a Russian village, named Kermazinskoy, where we
rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night we set out again, and travelled
till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as before;
and about seven o'clock we passed a little riVer, called Kirtza.
and came to a good large town inhabited by Russians, called
Ozomoys; there we heard that several troops of Kalmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now com-
pletely out of danger of them, which was to our great satisfac-
tion. Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses; and
having need enough of rest, we stayed five days; and my
partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian who brought
us thither the value of ten pistoles.

In five days more we came to Veuslima, upon the river
Wirtmgda, and running into the Dwina: we were there, very
happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river being
navigable, in seven day's passage, to Archangel. From hence
we came to Lawrenskoy the 3d of July; and providing our-
selves with two luggage boats, and a barge for our own conve-
nience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe at Archangel
the 18th; having been a year five months and three days on
the journey, including our stay of eight months at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival
of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Ham-
burgher come in above a month sooner than any of the English
ships; when, after some consideration that the city of Ham-
burgh might happen to be as good a market for our goods as
London, we all took freight with him; and, having put our
goods on board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board to take care of them; by which means my young
lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never
coming on shore again all the time we stayed there; and this
he did that he might not be seen in the city, where some of the
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and discovered
him.

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the
same year; and after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner and
I found a very good sale for our goods, as well those of China
as the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the produce, my
share amounted to three thousand four hundred and seventy-
tive pounds seventeen shillings and threepence, including about
six hundred pounds worth of diamonds which I purchased at

Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the

Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved442 ADVENTURES or ROBINSON cnusoe.

to seek protection, and could correspond with those of his
father's friends who were left alive. He did not part without
testimonies of gratitude for the service I had done him, and his
sense of my kindness to the prince his father.

To conclude, having stayed near four months in Hamburgh.
I came from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked
in the packet, and arrived in London the 10th of January,
1705; having been absent from England ten years and nine
months. And here I resolved to prepare for a longer journey
than all these, having lived a life of infinite variety seventy-
two years, and learned sufficiently to know the value of retire-
ment, and the blessing of ending our days in peace.
