PREFACE. ^£/^c., 
 
 Progress and improvement characterize almost every art and 
 science ; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic has 
 received many miportant additions and improvements, which have 
 appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises pub- 
 lished upon this subject. 
 
 In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to com- 
 bine, and to present in one harmonious whole, all these modem im- 
 provements, as well as to introduce some new methods and practical 
 operations not foimd in other works of the same grade ; in short, to 
 present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science than 
 an art; to teach him methods of thought , and how to reason, rather 
 than what to do; to give imity, system, and practical utility to the 
 science and art of computation. 
 
 The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the 
 privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the 
 thinking Qxidi the labor necesseiry to the study of Arithmetic ; hence 
 the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of 
 ** notes," '* suggestions," and superfluous operations so common to 
 most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the 
 cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that 
 vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind. 
 
 The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not superi- 
 ority over, others of the kind in the follo'W'ing particulars, viz. : In 
 the mechanical and typographical style of the work; the open and 
 attractive page ; the progressive and scientific a)rangement of the 
 subjects ; clearness and conciseness of definitio7is ; fullness and accu- 
 racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses; 
 brevity and pei'spicuity of rules; and in the very large number of

 PREFACE. 
 
 examples prepared and Arranged wiOi apeeial reference to their practical 
 utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The an- 
 swers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner may 
 acquire the discipline resulting from verifying the operations. 
 
 Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of Com- 
 mon Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Proportion, An- 
 alysis, Alligation, and the Eoots, as it is believed these articles contain 
 some practical features not common to other authors upon these subjects. 
 
 The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial 
 changes of the last few years are especially noticable. The ^different 
 kinds of United States' Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are de- 
 scribed, and their comparative value in commercial transactions illus- 
 trated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and Currency, 
 and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in trade, are taught 
 and illustrated, and many other things that every commercial student 
 and business man ought to know and understand. 
 
 There has also been added a full and practical presentation of the 
 Metric System of Weights and Measures, containing many new and orig- 
 inal improvements in the arrangement, notation, and applications, not 
 before presented to the public, and which greatly simplify and adapt the 
 system to general use. 
 
 It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is impossi- 
 ble; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific, compre- 
 hensive, and complete system, suflSciently full for the business man and 
 the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories, and yet com- 
 bining and systematizing real improvements of a practical and useful 
 nature. How nearly this end has been attained the intelligent and ex- 
 perienced teacher and educator must determine.

 DEFINITIONS. 
 
 1. ftnantity is any thing that can be increased, dimmished, 
 or measured. 
 
 3. Mathematics is the science of quantity. 
 
 3. A Unit is one, or a single thing. 
 
 4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units. 
 
 5, An Integer is a whole number. 
 
 6. The Unit of a Number is one of the same kind or 
 name as the number. Thus, the unit of 23 is 1 ; of 23 dollars, 
 1 dollar ; of 23 feet, 1 foot. 
 
 7, Like Numbers have the same kind of unit. Thus, 74, 
 16, and 250 ; 7 dollars and 62 dollars ; 19 pounds, 320 pounds, 
 and 86 pounds ; 4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches. 
 
 8, An Abstract Number is a number used without refer- 
 ence to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17; 365 ; 8540. 
 
 O, A Concrete Number is a number used with reference 
 to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars ; 365 
 days ; 8540 men. 
 
 Notes. 1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and is called Unity. 
 
 2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Nufnbers, 
 Denomination means the name of the unit of a concrete number. 
 
 10. Arithmetic is the Science of numbers, and the Art of 
 computation. 
 
 11. A Sign is a character indicating an operation to be 
 performed. 
 
 12. A Rule is a prescribed method of performing an op- 
 eration.

 KOTATION AND NUMERATION. 
 
 13. ITotation is a method of writing or expressing numbers 
 by characters ; and, 
 
 14. Numeration is a method of reading numbers,expressed 
 by characters. 
 
 15. Two systems of notation are in general use — the 
 Roman and the Arabic. 
 
 Note. The Roman Notation is supposed to have been first used 
 by the Romans; hence its name. The Arabic Notation was intro- 
 duced into Europe by the Arabs, by whom it was supposed to have 
 been invented. But investigations have shown that it was adopted by 
 them about 600 years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin- 
 doos more than 2000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes 
 called the Indian Notation, 
 
 THE ROMAN NOTATION 
 
 16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers, 
 thus : 
 
 Letters, I V X L C D M 
 
 one 
 hundred, hundred, thousand. 
 
 Values, one, five, ten, fifty, . «3« , . «!« 
 
 17. The Roman notation is founded upon five principles, 
 as follows : 
 
 1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre- 
 sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred. 
 
 2d. If a letter of any value be placed after one of greater 
 value, its value is to be united to that of the greater. Thus, 
 XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred. 
 
 3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater 
 value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater. Thus, 
 IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred. 
 
 Define notation. Numeration. WTiat systems of notation are now 
 in general use ? From what are their names derived ? What are used 
 to express numbers in the Roman notation ? What is the value of each? 
 What is the first princijjle of combination ? Second ? Third ? 
 
NOTATION AND NUMERATION. '9 
 
 4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters, 
 each of greater value, its value is to be ta/cen from the united 
 value of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen, 
 XXIX twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four. 
 
 5 th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value 
 one thousand fold. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou- 
 sand ; L fifty, and L fifty thousand.

 THE ARABIC NOTATION 
 
 18. Employs ten characters or figures to express numbers. 
 Thus, 
 Kgures, 0123456789 
 
 Names and ') "*"gh' °^^> *wo, three, four, five, six, Beven, eight, nine- 
 values, 5 ^.jph'er, 
 
 10, The first character is called naughty because it has no 
 value of its own. The other nine characters are called signif- 
 icant figures, because each has a value of its own. 
 
 20, The significant figures are also called Digits, a word de- 
 rived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies^n^er. 
 
 31 • The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero. 
 
 The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic, 
 and by combining them according to certain principles, all 
 numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most 
 important of these principles.* 
 
 22, Each of the nine digits has a value of its own ; hence 
 any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by one 
 figure. 
 
 * Fractfonal and uecimal notation, and the notation of compound nombers, will bft 
 
 discussed in ttieir appropriate places. 
 
 What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation ? "\Miat 
 is the value of each ? What general name is given to the significant 
 figures ? Wliy ? Numbers less than ten, how expressed ? 
 
 
 S3. As we have no single character to represent ten, we 
 express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0, 
 thus, 10. In the same manner we represent 
 
 2 tens, 
 
 3 tens, 4 tens, 5 tens, 
 
 6 tens. 
 
 7 tens, 
 
 8 tens, 9 tens.

 "When a number is e 
 
 ;xpress€ 
 
 d by two 1 
 
 Sgures, the right 
 
 hand figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens. 
 
 We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing 
 the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respectively 
 in the place of units. Thus, 
 
 eleven, twelve, thirteen, fonrteen, fifteen, sixteen, serenteen, eighteen, nineteen. 
 
 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 
 
 In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and 
 SO, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens. 
 Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93. 
 The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures 
 is 99. 
 
 25, We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at the 
 left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left hand of 
 one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write two hun- 
 dred, three hundred, &c., to nine hundred. Thus, 
 
 one two three four five six seven eight nine 
 hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred., hundred, hundred, hundred, 
 
 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900. 
 
 26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the 
 right hand figure is called unitSy the second figure tens, and 
 the left hand figure hundreds. 
 
 As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are always 
 used to denote the absence of value in the places they occupy. 
 
 Tens, how expressed ? The right hand figure called what ? Left 
 hand figure, what ? What is the greatest number that can be expressed 
 by two figures ? One hundred, how expressed ? When numbers are 
 expressed by three figures, what names are given to each } 
 
 
 we express tens and units with hundreds, by writing, in place 
 of the ciphers, the numbers representing the tens and units. 
 To express one hundred fifty we write 1 hundred, 5 tens, and 
 units; thus, 150. To express seven hundred ninety-two, 
 we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2 units ; thus, 
 
 I 
 
 The greatest number that can be expressed by three figures 
 is 999. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE, 
 
 1. Write one hundred twenty-five. 
 
 2. Write four hundred eighty-three. 
 
 3. Write seven hundred sixteen. 
 
 4. Express by figures nine hundred. 
 
 5. Express by figures two hundred ninety. 
 
 6. Write eight hundred nine. 
 
 7. Write five hundred five. 
 
 8. Write five hundred fifty-seven. 
 
 27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at 
 the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at the left hand 
 of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of one 
 cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two 
 thousand, three thousand, &:c., to nine thousand ; thus, 
 
 one two three four five six seven eight nine 
 
 thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand. 
 
 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, GOOO, 7000, 8000, 9000. 
 
 38. When a number is expressed by four figures, the 
 places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hundreds^ 
 thousands. 
 
 Use of the cipher, what ? Greatest number that can be expressed by 
 three figures ? One thousand, how expressed ? IIow many figures 
 used ? Names of each ? 
 
 
 To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, we 
 write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish 
 to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun- 
 dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in the 
 place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the place <^ 
 units J thus, 
 
 i -3 
 
 5 c 2 .1^

 4 2 6 9 
 
 The greatest number that can be expressed hj four figures 
 is 9999. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE. 
 
 Express the following numbers by figures : — 
 
 1. One thousand two hundred. 
 
 2. Five thousand one hundred sixty. 
 
 3. Three thousand seven hundred forty-one. 
 
 4. Eight thousand fifty-six. 
 
 5. Two thousand ninety. 
 
 6. Seven thousand nine. 
 
 7. One thousand one. 
 
 8. Nine thousand four hundred twenty-seven. 
 
 9. Four thousand thirty-five. 
 
 10. One thousand nine hundred four. 
 Read the following numbers : — 
 
 11. 76; 128; 405; 910; 116; 3416; 1025. 
 
 12. 2100; 5047; 7009; 4670; 3997; 1001. 
 
 20. Next to thousands come tens of thousands, and next 
 to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds 
 come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed 
 by removing the unit, 1, one place to the left of the place 
 
 Greatest number expressed by four figures ? 
 expressed ? Hundreds of thousands ? 
 
 
 of thousands, or by writing it at the left hand of four ci- 
 phers; thus, 10000; and one hundred thousand is expressed 
 by removing the unit, 1, still one place further to the left, or 
 by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers ; thus, 100000. 
 We can express thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of 
 thousands in one number, in the same manner as we express 
 units, tens, and hundreds in one number. To express five 
 hundred twenty-one thousand eight hundred three, we write 5 in 
 the sixth place, counting from units, 2 in the fifth place, 1 in 
 the fourth place, 8 in the third place, in the second place, 
 (because there are no tens,) and 3 in the place of units; 
 thus,

 Por convenience in reading large numbers, we may point 
 them oif, by commas, into periods of three figures each, count- 
 ing from the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables 
 us to read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with 
 facility. 
 
 30, Next above hundreds of thousands we have, succes- 
 sively, units, tens, and hundreds of millions, and then follow 
 units, tens, and hundreds of each higher name, as seen in the 
 following

 units, tens, hundreds, &c., are said to express different orders 
 of units.

 and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order, 5 
 units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order. 
 1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order, (millions,) 3 
 units of the fifth order, (tens of thousands,) and 6 units of the 
 third order, (hundreds.) 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE. 
 
 "Write and read the following numbers : — 
 
 1. One unit of the third order, four of the second. 
 
 2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of the 
 first. 
 
 3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second. 
 
 4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four 
 of the third, one of the second, seven of the first. 
 
 5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second. 
 
 6. Nine units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three 
 of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first. . 
 
 7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four of 
 the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the sec- 
 ond. 
 
 8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh, six 
 of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five of the 
 fifth, two of the third, eight of the first. 
 
 Units of different orders are what } 
 
 
 32. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations, we 
 derive several important principles, which we will now pre- 
 sent. 
 
 1st. Figures have two values, Simple and Local. 
 
 The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken alone ; 
 thus, 2, 5, 8. 
 
 The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with an- 
 other figure or figures in the same number ; thus, in 842 the 
 simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2 ; but the 
 local value of the 8 is 800 ; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40 ; and of 
 the 2 is 2 units. 
 
 Note. "When a figure occupies units* place, its simple and local 
 values are the same. 
 
 2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, expresses 
 tens ; in the third place, hundreds ; in the fourth place, thou- 
 sands ; and so on. 
 
 Sd. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun- 
 dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place, 
 make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next place 
 at the left, we readily see that the Arabic method of notation 
 is based upon the following 
 
 TWO GENERAL LAWS. 
 
 I. The different orders of units increase from right to lefty 
 and decrease from left to right, in a tenfold ratio. 
 
 II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases 
 its local value tenfold ; and every removal of a figure one place 
 to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold^ . 
 
 Thus, 
 
 6 is 6 units. 
 60 is 10 times 6 units. 
 600 is 10 times 6 tens. 
 6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds. 
 60000 is 10 times 6 thousands. 
 
 First principle derived ? What is the simple value of a figure ? Local r 
 Second principle ? Third ? First law of Arabic notation ? Second ? 
 
 
 4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place from 
 
 units of the first order, not upon the value of the figures at the 
 
 right of it. Thus, in 425 and 400, the value of the 4 is the 
 
 same in hoth numbers, being 4 units of the third order, or 4 
 
 hundred. 
 
 Note. Care should be taken not to mistake the local value of a 
 figure for the value of the whole number. For, although the value of 
 the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two numbers, 425 and 400, the value 
 of the whole of the first nvmaber is greater than that of the second. 
 
 5th. Every period contains three figures, (units, tens, and 
 hundreds,) except the left hand period, which sometimes con- 
 tains only one or two figures, (units, or units and tens.) 
 
 33. As we have now analyzed all the principles upon 
 which the writing and reading of whole numbers depend, we 
 will present these principles in the form of rules. 
 
 RULE FOR NOTATION. 
 
 I. Beginning at the left hand^ write the figures belonging to 
 the highest period. 
 
 II. Write the hundreds^ tens, and units of each successive 
 period in their order ^ placing a cipher wherever an order of 
 units is omitted. 
 
 RULE FOR NUMERATION. 
 
 I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each, 
 commencing at the right hand, 
 
 II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately, 
 and give the name to each period, except the last, or period 
 of units. • 
 
 34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be 
 well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point them off, 
 over each period write its name, thus, 
 
 Trillions, Billions, Millions, Tliousands, Unttn. 
 
 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 
 
 Fourth principle ? What caution is given ? Fifth principle ? Rule 
 for notation ? Niuneration ? 
 
 
 and then write the given numbers underneath, in their appro- 
 priate places.

 MENTAL EXERCISES. 
 
 35. 1. Henry gave 5 dollars for a vest, and 7 dollars for 
 a coat ; how much did he pay for both ? 
 
 Analysis. He gave as many dollars as 5 dollars and 7 dollars, 
 which are 12 dollars. Therefore he paid 12 dollars for both. 
 
 2. A farmer sold a pig for 3 dollars, and a calf for 8 dol- 
 lars ; how much did he receive for both ? 
 
 3. A drover bought 5 sheep of one man, 9 of another, and 
 3 of another ; how many did he buy in all ? 
 
 4. How many are 2 and 6? 2 and 7? 2 and 9? 2 and 8? 
 2 and 10 ? 
 
 5. How many are 4 and 5 ? 4 and 8 ? 4 and 7 ? 4 and 9 ? 
 
 6. How many are 6 and 4 ? G and 6 ? 6 and 9 ? 6 and 7 ? 
 
 7. How many are 7 and 7? 7 and 6? 7 and 8? 7 and 10? 
 7 and 9 ? 
 
 8. How many are 5 and 4 and 6 ? 7 and 3 and 8 ? 6 and 9 
 and 5 ? 
 
 36. From the preceding operations we perceive that 
 Addition is the process of uniting several numbers of the 
 
 same kind into one equivalent number. 
 
 37. The Sum or Amount is the result obtained by the 
 process of addition. 
 
 38. The sign, -|-, is called plus, which signifies more. 
 When placed between two numbers, it denotes that they are 
 to be added ; thus, 6 -f- 4, shows that 6 and 4 are to be added. 
 
 39. The sign, = , is called the sign of equality. When 
 placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies 
 that they are equal to each other; thus, the expression 
 6 -f- 4 z= 10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that 
 the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10. 
 
 Define addition. The sum or amount? Sign of addition? Of 
 equality ?

 store, 475 dollars for a clerk, and 3G7 dollars for other ex- 
 penses ; what is the amount of his expenses ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Arranging the num- 
 -S^«§ hers as in Case I, we first add the 
 ^11 column of units, and find the sum 
 725 to be 17 units, which is 1 ten and 
 475 7 units. We write the 7 units in 
 gQj the place of units, and the 1 ten in 
 the place of tens. The sum of the 
 figures in the column of tens is 15 
 tens, which is 1 hundred, and 5 
 tens. We write the 5 tens in the 
 „ ^ , ^ 1 Kon place of tens, and the 1 hundred in 
 
 Total amount, 1567 f, , e\ i i ^ir 
 
 the place oi hundreds. We next 
 add the column of hundreds, and find the sum to be 14 hundreds, 
 which is 1 thousand and 4 hundreds. We w rite the 4 hundreds in 
 the place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands. 
 Lastly, by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens 
 and hundreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds 
 6 tens and 7 units, or 1567. 
 
 This example may be performed by another method, which 
 is the common one in practice. Thus : 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Arranging the numbers as before, we 
 725 add the first column and find the sum to be 17 units ; 
 
 475 writing the 7 units under the column of units, we add 
 
 Qg7 the 1 ten to the column of tens, and find the sum to be 
 
 16 tens ; writing the 6 tens under the column tens, wo 
 
 1567 add the 1 hundred to the column of hundreds, and find 
 
 the sum to be 15 hundreds ; as this is the last column, 
 we write down its amount, 15 ; and we have the whole amount, 1567, 
 as before. 
 
 Notes. 1. Units of the same order arc written in the same column ; 
 find when the sum in any column is 10 or more than 10, it produces 
 one or more units of a higher order, which must be added to the next 
 column. This process is sometimes called «* carrying the tens." 
 
 2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming 
 the numbers separately ; thus, instead of saying 7 and 5 are 12, and 
 6 are 17, simply pronounce the results, 7, 12, 17, &c. 
 
 Give explanation. Second explanation. 'What is meant by carry- 
 ing the tens ? 
 
 ^ 
 
 
 4:'3, From the preceding examples and illustrationrf we 
 deduce the following 
 
 Rule. I. Write the numbers to he added so that all the units 
 of the same order shall stand in the same column ; that is, units 
 under units, tens under tens, S^c. 
 
 II. Commencing at units, add each column separately^ and 
 write the sum underneath, if it he less than ten. 
 
 III. If the sum of any column he ten or more than ten, write 
 the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column. 
 
 IV. Write the entire sum of the last column. 
 
 Proof. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column, and 
 add the figures in each column in an opposite direction from 
 that in which they were first added ; if the two results agree, 
 the work is supposed to be right. Or, 
 
 2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori- 
 zontal line ; find the sum of each set separately ; add these 
 sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained, the 
 work is presumed to be correct. 
 
 Note. By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are iinited 
 in new combinations, which render it almost impossible for two pre- 
 cisely similar mistakes to occur. 
 
 The first method is the one commonly used in business,

 MENTAL EXERCISES. 
 
 4:3, 1. A farmer, having 14 cows, sold 6 of them; how 
 many had he left ? 
 
 Analysis. He had as many left as 14 cows less 6 cows, which 
 are 8 cows. Therefore, he had 8 cows left. 
 
 2. Stephen, having 9 marbles, lost 4 of them ; how many 
 had he left? 
 
 3. If a man earn 10 dollars a week, and spend G dollars for 
 provisions, how many dollars has he left ? 
 
 4. A merchant, having 16 barrels of Hour, sells 9 of them ; 
 liow many has he left ? 
 
 5. Charles had 18 cents, and gave 10 of them for a book ; 
 how many had he left ? 
 
 6. James is 17 years old, and his sister Julia, is 5 years 
 younger ; how old is Julia ? 
 
 7. A grocer, having 20 boxes of lemons, sold 11 boxes; 
 how many boxes had he left ? • - 
 
 8. From a cistern containing 25 barrels of water, 15 bar- 
 rels leaked out ; how many barrels remained ? 
 
 9. Paid 16 dollars for a coat, and 7 dollars for a vest; 
 how much more did the coat cost than the vest ? 
 
 10. How many are 18 less 5 ? 17 less 8 ? 12 less 7 ? 
 
 11. IIow many are 20 less 14 ? 18 less 12 ? 19 less 11? 
 
 12. How many are 11 less 3? 16 less 11? 19 less 8f 
 20 less 9 ? 22 less 20 ? 
 
 44. Subtraction is the process of determining the diftcr- 
 cnce, between two numbers of the same unit value. 
 
 4:5. The Minuend is the number to be subtracted from. 
 40. The Subtrahend is the number to be subtracted. 
 
 Define subtraction. Minuend, Subtrahend. 
 
' JSUBTRACTION. 29 
 
 47. The Difference or Eemainder is the result obtained 
 by the process of subtraction. 
 
 Note. The minuend and subtrahend must be like numbers ; thus, 
 5 dollars from 9 dollars leave 4 dollars ; 5 apples from 9 apples leave 4 
 apples ; but it would be absurd to say 5 apples from 9 dollars, or a 
 dollars from 9 apples. 
 
 48. The sign, — , is called minus, which signifies less. 
 When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one 
 after it is to be taken from the one before it. Thus, 8 — 6 = 2 
 is read 8 minus G equals 2, and denotes that 6, the subtrahend, 
 taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the remainder, 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 49. When no figure in the subtrahend is greater 
 than the corresponding figure in the minuend. 
 
 1. From 574 take 323. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We write the less num- 
 
 Minuend, 574 ^^^ under the greater, with units under 
 
 „ . , , , QOQ units, tens under tens, &c., and draw 
 
 Subtrahend, 6z6 ,. , , „,' ,' . . 
 
 a Ime underneath. Ihen, begmnmg at 
 
 Pemainder, 251 the right hand, we subtract separately 
 
 each figure of the subtrahend from the 
 figure above it in the minuend. Thus, 3 from 4 leaves 1, which is the 
 difference of the units ; 2 from 7 leaves 5, the difference of the tens ; 
 3 from 5 leaves 2, the difference of the hundreds. Hence, we have 
 for the whole difference, 2 hundreds 5 tens and 1 unit, or 251.

 CASE II. 
 
 50. When any figure in the subtrahend is greater 
 than the corresponding figure in the minuend. 
 
 > 1. From 846 take 359. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. In this example we 
 
 (7) (13) (If;) cannot take 9 units from 6 units. 
 
 Minuend, 8 4 6 From the 4 tens we take 1 ten, which 
 
 Subtrahend, 3 5 9 equals 10 Units, and add to the 6 
 
 Remainder, 4 8 7 Units, making 16 units ; 9 units from 
 
 16 units leave 7 units, which we 
 
 write in the remainder in units' place. As we have taken 1 ten 
 
 from the 4 tens, 3 tens only are left. We cannot take 5 tens from 
 
 3 tens ; so from the 8 hundreds we take 1 hundred, which equals 10 
 
 tens, and add to the 3 tens, making 13 tens; 5 tens from 13 
 
 tens leave 8 tens, which we write in the remaindei' in tens' place. 
 
 As we have taken 1 hundred from the 8 hundreds, 7 hundreds otily 
 
 are left ; 3 hundreds from 7 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, which we 
 
 write in the remainder in hundreds' place, and we have, the whole 
 
 remainder, 487. 
 
 Note. The numbers written over the minuend are used simply to 
 explain more clearly the method of subtracting ; in practice the pro- 
 cess should be performed mentally, and these numbers omitted. 
 
 The following method is more in accordance with prac- 
 tice. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since we cannot take 9 units from 6 
 •|„-i units, we add 10 units to 6 units, making 16 units; 
 
 ^^ 5 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have 
 
 o'*" added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall 
 
 359 have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we 
 
 An J add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6 
 
 tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens ; so we add 
 10 tens to 4, making 14 tens ; 6 tens from 14 tens 
 leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the 
 minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we 
 add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun- 
 dreds ; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have 
 for the total remainder, 487, the same as before. 
 
 Case 11 is what ? Give explanation. Second explanation. 
 
 
 SIMPLE NUMBERS. 
 
 Note. Tho process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called 
 borrowing 10, and that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend, 
 carrying one. 
 
 •51. From the preceding examples and illustrations we 
 have the following general 
 
 Rule. I. Write the less number under the greater^ placing 
 units of the same order in the same column, 
 
 II. Begin at the right hand^ and take each figure of the sub- 
 trahend from the figure above it, and write the result under- 
 neath, 
 
 III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than the cor- 
 responding figure above it, add 10 to that upper figure be- 
 fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure of 
 the subtrahend. 
 
 Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if their 
 sum be equal to the minuend, the work is supposed to be right.

 54. Multiplication is the process of taking one of two 
 given numbers as many times as there are units in the othen 
 
 55 » The Multiplicand is the number to be taken. 
 
 5G, The Multiplier is the number which shows how 
 many times the multiplicand is to be taken. 
 
 57, The Product is the result obtained by the process of 
 multiplication. 
 
 58, The Factors are the multiplicand and multiplier. 
 
 KoTES. 1. Factors are producers, and the multiplicand and mul- 
 tiplier are called factors because they produce the product. 
 
 2. Multiplication is a short method of performing addition when 
 the numbers to be added are equal. 
 
 59, The sign, X, placed between two numbers, denotes 
 that they are to be multiplied together ; thus 9 X 6 n^ 54, is 
 read 9 times 6 equals 54.

 CASE I.

 1. Multiply 374 by 6. 
 
 Analysis. In this example it i.>» 
 required to take 374 six times. If we 
 take the units of each order 6 times, 
 we shall take the entire number 6 
 times. Therefore, writing the multi- 
 pHer under the unit figure of the mul- 
 tiplicand, we proceed as follows : 6 
 times 4 units are 24 units ; 6 times 7 
 tens are 42 tens ; 6 times 3 hundreds 
 are 18 hundreds ; and adding these 
 partial products, we obtain the entire 
 product, 2244.

 The operation in this example may be performed in another 
 way, which is the one in common use. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Writing the numbers as before, we 
 
 374: begin at the right hand or unit figure, and say: G 
 
 P times 4 units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4 
 
 imits ; write the 4 units in the product in units* 
 
 2244 place, and reserve the 2 tens to add to the next prod- 
 uct ; 6 times 7 tens are 42 tens, and the two tens re- 
 served in the last product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds 
 and 4 tens ; write the 4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve 
 the 4 hundreds to add to the next product ; 6 times 3 hundreds are 
 18 hundreds, and 4 hundreds added are 22 hundreds, which, being 
 written in the product in the places of hundreds and thousands, 
 gives, for the entire product, 2244. 
 
 Gl, The unit value of a number is not changed by re- 
 peating the number. As the multiplier always expresses 
 iimeSj the product must have the same unit value as the mul- 
 tiplicand. But, since the product of any two numbers will be 
 the same, w^hichever factor is taken as a multiplier, either 
 factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand. 
 
 Note. In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in 
 addition, without naming the numbers separately ; thus, in the last 
 example, instead of saying 6 times 4 are 24, G times 7 are 42 and 2 to 
 carry are 44, 6 times 3 are 18 and 4 to carry are 22, pronounce only 
 the results, 24, 44, 22, performing the operations mentally. This will 
 greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

 tiply each figure in the 
 multiplicand by the 
 unit figure of the mul- 
 tiplier, precisely as in 
 Case I. We then multiply by the 2 tens. 2 tens times 6 units, or 6 
 times 2 tens, are 12 tens, equal to 1 hundred, and 2 tens ; we place the 
 2 tens under the tens figure in the product already obtained, and add 
 the 1 hundred to the next hundreds produced. 2 tens times 4 tens 
 are 8 hundreds, and the 1 hundred of the last product added are 9 
 hundreds ; we write the 9 in hundreds' place in the product. 2 tens 
 
 Case II is what ? Give explanation. 
 
 
 times 7 hundreds are 14 thousands, equal to 1 ten thousand and 4

 Then adding the two products, we have the entire product, 17158. 
 
 Notes. 1. "SVhen the multiplier contains two or more figures, the 
 several results obtained by multiplying by each figure are called partial 
 products. 
 
 2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the 
 multiplier, pass over them, and multiply by the significant figoires only. 
 
 63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we 
 deduce the following general 
 
 Rule. I. Write the midtiplier under the multiplicand, placing 
 units of the same order under each other. 
 
 II. Multiply the multiplicand hy each figure of the multi- 
 plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write the 
 first figure of each partial product under the figure of the mul- 
 tiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.

 64:. Proof. 1. Multiply the multiplier by the multipli- 
 cand, and if the product is the same as the first result, the 
 work is correct. Or, 
 
 2. Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier diminished 
 by 1, and to the product add the multiplicand ; if the sum be 
 the same as the product by the whole of the multiplier, the 
 work is correct.

 CONTRACTIONS. 
 CASE I. 
 
 65. When the multiplier is a composite number. 
 
 A Composite Number is one that may be produced by 
 multiplying together two or more numbers ; thus, 18 is a com- 
 posite number, since 6 X 3 z:z 18 ; or, 9 X 2 ^ 18 • or, 3 X 
 3X 2:^:18. 
 
 66. The Component Factors of a number are the sev- 
 eral numbers which, multiphed together, produce the given 
 number ; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2, 
 (10 X 2 = 20 ;) or, 4 and 5, (4 X 5 := 20 ;) or, 2 and 2 and 
 5, (2 X 2 X 5 = 20 ) 
 
 Note. The pupil must not confound the faclots with the parts of a 
 number. Thus, the factors of which 12 is composed, are 4 and 3, 
 (^4X3= 12 ;) while the parts of which 12 is composed are 8 and 4, 
 (8 -f- 4 = 12,) or 10 and 2, (10 -f 2 = 12.) The factors arc multiplied, 
 while the parts are added^ to produce the number.

 rroduot, 5568 cost of 32 horses, f^"^^ 
 
 horses by 8, we obtain 
 
 the cost of 8 times 4 horses, or 32 horses, the number bought 
 OT. Hence we have the following 
 
 Rule. I. Separate the composite number into two or more 
 factors. 
 
 II. Multiply the multiplicand by one of these factors^ and

 been used successively ; the last product will be the product re- 
 quired. 
 
 Note. The product of any number of factors will be the same in 
 "whatever order they are multiplied. Thus, 4 X 3 X 5 = 60, and 
 5X4X3 = 60.

 CASE II. 
 
 68. When the multiplier is 10, 100, 1000, &c. 
 
 If we annex a cipher to the multiplicand, each figure is re- 
 moved one place toward the left, and consequently the value of 
 the whole number is increased tenfold, (3^.) If two ciphers 
 are annexed, each figure is removed two places toward the 
 left, and the value of the number is increased one hundred 
 fold ; and every additional cipher increases the value tenfold. 
 
 69. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. Annex as many ciphers to the multiplicand as there 
 are ciphers in the multiplier j the number so formed will be 
 the product required.

 Product, 72000 several factors be multiplied together 
 
 they will produce the same product as 
 
 the given numbers, (67.) Thus, 12 X 6 = 72, and 72 X 100 = 
 
 7200, and 7200 X 10 = 72000, which is the same result as in the

 73. rivision is the process of finding how many times 
 one number is contained in another. 
 
 73. The Dividend is the number to be divided. 
 
 74. The Divisor is the number to divide by. 
 
 75. The Quotient is the result obtained by the process of 
 division, and shows how many times the divisor is contained 
 in the dividend. 
 
 Notes. 1. "Wlien the dividend does not contain the divisor an exact 
 number of times, the part of the dividend left is called the remainder^ 
 and it must be less than the divisor. 
 
 2. As the remainder is always a part of the dividend, it is always 
 of the same name or kind. 
 
 5. When there is no remainder the division is said to be complete. 
 
 7G. The sign, -^, placed between two numbers, denotes 
 division, and shows that the number on the left is to be divided 
 by the number on the right. Thus, 20 -J- 4 = 5, is read, 20 
 divided by 4 is equal to 5. 
 
 Division is also indicated by writing the dividend ahove^ and 
 
 12 
 the divisor helow a short liorizontal line ; thus, — = 4, shows 
 
 that 12 divided by 3 equals 4. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 77. When the divisor consists of one figure. 
 
 1. How many times is 4 contained in 848 ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. After writing the divisor 
 
 on the left of the dividend, with a line 
 
 A \ oTq' between them, we begin at the left hand 
 
 Divisor, 4 ) 848 , . . ^ • J • o I A A 
 
 ^ and say : 4 is contamed m 8 hundreds, 
 
 Quotient, 212 2 hundreds times, and write 2 in hun- 
 
 dreds' place in the quotient; then 4 is 
 contained in 4 tens 1 ten times, and write the 1 in tens* place in the 
 quotient ; then 4 is contained in 8 units 2 units times ; and writing the 
 2 in units' place in the quotient, we have the entire quotient, 212.

 2. How many times is 4 contained in 2884 ? 
 OPERATiox. Analysis. As we cannot divide 2 thousands by 
 4)2884 ^' ^^ ^^^^ ^^^ ^ thousands and the 8 hundreds to- 
 
 gether, and say, 4 is contained in 28 hundreds 7 hun- 
 
 '^^1 dreds times, which we write in hundreds' place in 
 
 the quotient ; then 4 is contained in 8 tens 2 tens 
 times, which we write in tens' place in the quotient ; and 4 is con- 
 tained in 4 units 1 unit time, which we write in units' place in the 
 quotient, and we have the entire quotient, 721. 
 
 3. How many times is 6 contained in 1824 ? 
 
 OPERATIOX. Analysis. Beginning as in the last example, we 
 
 6) 1824 say, 6 is contained in 18 hundreds 3 hundreds times, 
 
 which we write in hundreds' place in the quotient ; 
 
 ^'^^ then 6 is contained in 2 tens no times, and we write 
 
 a cipher in tens* place in the quotient ; and taking the 2 tens and 4 
 units together, 6 is contained in 24 units 4 units times, which we 
 write in units' place in the quotient, and we have 304 for the entire 
 quotient. 
 
 4. How many times is 4 contained in 943 ? 
 
 OPERATIOX. Analysis. Here 4 is contained in 9 
 
 4x9^3 hundreds 2 hundreds times, and 1 hundred 
 
 over, which, united to the 4 tens, makes 
 
 235 ... 3 Rem. 14 tens ; 4 in 14 tens, 3 tens times and 2 
 tens over, which, united to the 3 units, 
 make 23 units ; 4 in 23 units 5 units times and 3 units over. The 
 3 which is left after performing the division, should be divided by 4 ; 
 but the method of doing it cannot be explained until we reach 
 Fractions ; so we merely indicate the division by placing the divisor 
 under the dividend, thus, |. The entire quotient is written 23o|, 
 which may be read, two hundred thirty-five and three divided by 
 four, or, two hundred thirty-five and a remainder of three. 
 
 From the foregoing examples and illustrations, we deduce 
 the following

 a line between them.

 II. Beginning at the left hand, divide each figure of the 
 dividend hy the divisor, and write the result under the divi- 
 dend, 
 
 III. If there he a remainder after dividing any figure, re- 
 gard it as prefixed to the figure of the next lower order in the 
 dividend, and divide as before. 
 
 IV. Should any figure or part of the dividend he less than 
 the divisor, write a cipher in the quotient, and prefix the num- 
 ber to the figure of the next lower order in the dividend, and 
 divide as before, 
 
 V. Jf there be a remainder after dividing the last figure, 
 place it over the divisor at the right hand of the quotient. 
 
 Proof. Multiply the divisor and quotient together, and to 
 the 2)roduct add the remainder, if any ; if the result be equal 
 to the dividend, the work is correct. 
 
 Notes. 1. This method of proof depends on the fact that division is 
 the reverse of multiplication. The dividend answers to the product^ the 
 divisor to one oi the factors^ and the quotient to the other. 
 
 2. In multiplication the two factors are given, to find the product : 
 in division, the product and one of the factors are given to find the 
 other factor.

 CASE II. 
 
 78. When the divisor consists of two or more figures. 
 
 Note. To illustrate more clearly the method of operation, we will 
 first take an example usually performed by Short Division. 
 
 Case n is what ? 
 
 
 1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528 ? 
 OPERATION. Analysis. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou- 
 
 8 ) 2528 C 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and con- 
 n . sider how many times 8 is contained in this 
 
 partial dividend, 25 hundreds, and find that it 
 
 12 is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder. 
 
 8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor, 
 
 "TT 8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub- 
 
 tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par- 
 ^^ tial dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains 
 
 1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down 
 the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial 
 dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain- 
 der ; 8 multipHed by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from 
 12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units, 
 and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then, 8 is con- 
 tained in 48 units 6 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as 
 before, we find that nothing remains, and we have for the entire 
 quotient, 316. 
 
 2. How many times is 23 contained in 4807 ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We first find how 
 
 Divisor. Divid'd. Quotient. many times 23 is contained in 48, 
 
 23 ) 4807 ( 209 the first partial dividend, and place 
 
 46 the result in the quotient on the 
 
 „_ right of the dividend. We then 
 
 multiply the divisor, 23, by tho 
 ^ ' quotient figure, 2, and subtract the 
 
 product, 46, from the part of tho 
 dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of 
 the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend. 
 Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in the 
 quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a 
 third partial dividend, 207 ; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times ; multi- 
 plying and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and we have for 
 the entire quotient, 209. 
 
 Notes. 1. 'WTicn the process of dividinpj is performed montally, and 
 the results only are written, as in Case I, the operation is temied Short 
 Division. 
 
 2. When the whole process of division is written, the operation is 
 termed LoTig Division. 
 
 Give first explanation. Second. What is long division ? What ia 
 short division ? When is each used ? 
 
 
 3. Short Division is generally used when the divisor is a number 
 that will allow the process of dividing to be performed mentally. 
 
 From the preceding illustrations we derive the following 
 general 
 
 Rule. I. Write the divisor at' the left of the dividend, as 
 in short division. 
 
 II. Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the 
 dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and 
 place the quotient at the right of the dividend, with a line be-' 
 tween them. 
 
 III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract 
 the product from the partial dividend used, and to the remain- 
 der bring down the next figure of the dividend. 
 
 IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend 
 have been brought down and divided. 
 
 Y. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor^ 
 place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure 
 of the dividend, and divide as before. 
 
 VI. If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures of 
 the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the divi- 
 sor underneath. 
 
 Notes. 1. If any remainder be eqtial to, or greater than the divisor, 
 the quotient figure is too stnall, and must be increased. 
 
 2. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater 
 than the partial dividend, the quotient figure is too large^ and must be 
 diminished. 
 
 70. Proof. 1. The same as in short division. Or, 
 
 2. Subtract the remainder, if any, from the dividend, and 
 divide the difference by the quotient ; if the result be the same 
 as the given 'divisor, the work is correct.

 81. When the divisor is a composite number. 
 
 1. If 3270 dollars be divided equally among 30 men, how 
 many dollars will each receive ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. If 3270 dollars be divided 
 
 5)3270 equally among 30 men, each man will receive 
 
 as many dollars as 30 is contained times in 
 
 6)654 3270 dollars. 30 may be resolved into the 
 
 109 Ans, factors 5 and 6 ; and we may suppose the 30 
 men divided into 5 groups of 6 men each ; 
 dividing the 3270 dollars by 5, the number of groups, we have 
 654, the number of dollars to be given to each group ; and dividing 
 the 654 dollars by 6, the number of men in each group, we have 
 109, the number of dollars that each man will receive. Hence, 
 
 Rule. Divide the dividend hy one of the factors, and the 
 quotient thus obtained by another, and so on if there be more 
 than two factors, until every factor has been made a divisor. 
 The last quotient will be the quotient required.

 Analysis. Divid- 
 ing 1143 by 2, we 
 have a quotient of 
 571, and a remainder 
 of 1 undivided, which, 
 being a part of the 
 given dividend, must 
 also be a part of the 
 true remainder. The 
 571 being a quotient arising from dividing by 2, its units are 
 
 2 times as great in value as the units of the ^ven dividend, 1 143. 
 Dividing the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder 
 of 3 undivided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied 
 by 2 to change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a 
 true remainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 7 1 by 
 4, we have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This 
 
 3 is a part of the 71, the units of which are 8 times as great in value 
 as those of the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great 
 in value as those of the given dividend, 1143 ; therefore, to change 
 this last remainder, 3, to units of the same value as the dividend, 
 we multiply it by 8 and 2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising 
 from dividing by 4. Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain 
 55, the true remainder. Hence, 
 
 Rule. I. Multiply each partial remainder, except the first, 
 hy all the preceding divisors. 
 
 II. Add the several products with the first remainder, and 
 the sum will be the true remainder.

 100, if three, we divide by 1000, and so on. Hence the

 two remainders, 16 and 
 5. Multiplying 5, the 
 last remainder, by 100, 
 the preceding divisor, and 
 adding 16, the first remainder, (82,) we have 516 for the true re- 
 mainder. But this remainder consists of the last remainder, 5, pre- 
 fixed to the figures 16, cut off from the dividend. Hence, 
 
 85, When there is a remainder after dividing by the sig- 
 nificant figures, it must be prefixed to the figures cut off from 
 the dividend to give the true remainder ; if there be no other 
 remainder, the figures cut oflf from the dividend will, be the 
 true remainder.

 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION. 
 
 80. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative 
 values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the 
 value of either dividend or divisor must produce a change in 
 the value of the quotient. But some changes may be produced 
 upon both dividend and divisor, at the same time, that 
 will not affect the quotient. The laws which govern these 
 changes are called General Principles of Division, which we 
 will now examine. 
 
 L 54^9 = 6. 
 
 If we multiply the dividend by 3, we have 
 
 54 X 3 -r-9= 162-^-9 = 18, 
 
 and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, 
 Multiplying the dividend hy any number, multiplies the quotient 
 by the same number. 
 
 II. Using the same example, 54 -f- 9 =: 6. 
 If we divide the dividend by 3 we have 
 
 Y-j-9 = 18-^9:z=2, 
 
 and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the 
 dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the same 
 number. 
 
 III. If we multiply the divisor by 3, we have 
 
 54 _^ 9 X 3 = 54 -^ 27 m 2, 
 
 and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying 
 the divisor by any number, diindes the quotient by the same 
 number. 
 
 V. If we divide the divisor by 3, we have 
 
 54 -^ § = 54 ~- 3 = 18, 
 
 Upon what does the vnhie of the quotient depend ? "NMiat is the 
 first general principle of division J {Second ? Third ? Fourth } 
 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION. 65 
 
 and 18 =: the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, Dividing 
 ike divisor by any number^ multiplies the quotient by the same 
 number. 
 
 V. If we multiply both dividend and divisor by 3, we have 
 
 54 X 3 -^ 9 X 3 :=: 162 ^ 27 = 6. 
 
 Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by the same num- 
 ber, does not alter the value of the quotient. 
 
 VI. If we divide both dividend and divisor by 3, we have 
 
 Y-M=:18-^3 = 6. 
 Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num- 
 ber, does not alter the value of the quotient. 
 
 87, These six examples illustrate all the different changes 
 we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divisor 
 in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which these 
 changes are based may be stated as follows : 
 
 Prin. I. Multiplying the dividend multiplies the quotient ; 
 and dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (80. 1 and 11.) 
 
 Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient ; and 
 dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (86. Ill and IV.) . 
 
 Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and j 
 divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86. i 
 V and VI.) 
 
 88. These three principles may be embraced in one 
 
 GENERAL LAW, 
 
 A change in the dividend produces a like change in the I 
 quotient ; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite / 
 change in the quotient. 
 
 Note. If a number be multiplied and the product divided by the 
 same number, the quotient will be equal to the number multiplied. 
 Thus, 15 X 4 = 60, and 60 -5- 4 = 15. 
 
 Fifth ? Sixth ? Into how many general principles can these be con- 
 densed ? What is the first ? Second ? Third ? In what general law 
 are these embraced ? 
 
66 PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS. 
 
 EXACT DIVISORS. 
 
 I89o An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives 
 a whole number for a quotient. 
 
 As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an exact 
 divisor, we wdll present a few directions that will be of assistance, 
 particularly in finding exact divisors of large numbers. 
 
 Note. A number whose unit figure is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is called an 
 Eve7i Number, And a number whose unit figure is 1, 3, 6, 7, or 9, is 
 called an Odd Number, 
 
 . f 2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers. 
 . 4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens 
 /and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268, 
 756, 1284. 
 
 ^ 5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is 
 or 5. Thus, is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840. 
 \ 8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun- 
 dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact 
 divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560. 
 
 ^ 9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of 
 the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the 
 digits 2 + 4+8 + 6 + 7+9 + = 36, and 36-^9 = 4. 
 ' 10 is an exact divisor when occupies units' place. 
 ' 100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens. 
 V 1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun- 
 dreds, &c. 
 
 A composite number is an exact divisor of any number, 
 
 when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number. 
 
 Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of* 12 ; and so also are 4 
 
 (r= 2 X 2) and 6 (= 2 X 3). 
 
 An even number is not an exact divisor of an odd number. 
 
 If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number, 
 
 What is an exact divisor ? WTiat is an even number ? An odd num- 
 ber ? WTicn is 2 an exact divisor ? 4 ? 5 ? 9 ? 10 ? 100 ? 1000 ? 
 When is a composite number an exact divisor ? An even number is 
 not an exact divisor of what ? Att odd niuabej is an eacact divisor of 
 what? 
 
FACTORINO NUMBERS. 
 
 67 
 
 twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even 
 number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42 j^so also is 7 X 2, 
 or 14.

 1. What are the prime factors of 2772 ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We divide the given number by 
 
 2, the least prime factor, and the result by 2 ; 
 this gives an odd number for a quotient, divisible 
 by the prime factor, 3, and the quotient resulting 
 from this division is also divisible by 3. The 
 mxt quotiont, 77, we divide by its least prime 
 factor, 7, and we obtain the quotient 11 ; this be- 
 ing a prime number, the division can not be car- 
 ried further. The divisors and last quotient, 2, 
 2, 3, 3, 7, and 11 are all the prime factors of the 
 given number, 2772. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the given number hy any prime factor ; di^- 
 vide the quotient in the same manner, and so continue the 
 division until the quotient is a prime number. The several 
 divisors and the last quotient will be the prime factors required. 
 
 Proof. The product of all the prime factors will be tha 
 given number.

 CANCELLATION. 
 
 93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal factors 
 from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of dividend 
 and divisor. 
 
 It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the 
 product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence, if 
 the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of which is 
 the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient. 
 1. Divide 63 by 7. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We see in 
 
 DiTisor, ;^);5f X 9 Dividend. this example that 63 is 
 
 composed of the factors 7 
 
 9 Quotient. ^nd 9, and that the factor 
 
 7 is equal to the divisor. 
 Therefore we reject the factor 7, and the remaining factor, 9, is the 
 quotient. 
 
 Give explanation. What is cancellation ? Upon what principle is 
 it based ? Give first explanation. 
 
 
 04:. Whenever the dividend and divisor are each composite 
 numbers, the factors common to both may first be rejected 
 without altering the final result. ( 8^5 Prin. Ill, )

 performed by 
 writing the numbers which constitute the dividend above a line, and 
 those which constitute the divisor below it. Instead of multiplying 
 24 by 56, in the dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and 6, 
 and 56 into the factors 7 and 8 ; and 48 in the divisor into the fac- 
 tors 6 and 8. We next cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are 
 common to the dividend and divisor, and we have left the factor 4 
 in the dividend, which is the quotient. 
 
 Note. "When all the factors or niunbers in the dividend are can- 
 celed, 1 should be retamed. 
 
 05 • If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in 
 the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that factor, 
 
 3. In 54 times 77, how many times 63 ?

 From the preceding examples -and illustrations we derive 
 the following 
 
 Rule. I. Write the numbers composing the dividend above 
 a horizontal line, and the numbers composing the divisor 
 below it. 
 
 II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and 
 divisor, 
 
 III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the div- 
 idend by the product of the remaining factors of the divisor, 
 and the result will be the quotient. 
 
 Notes. 1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number 
 by that factor. 
 
 2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take its 
 place. 
 
 3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the 
 divisor. 
 
 4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the 
 product of the remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient. 
 
 5. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of 
 the dividend on the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor 
 on the left.

 lines, and place the larger number on 
 the right, and the smaller number on 
 the left, one line lower down. We 
 then divide 203, the larger number, by 
 84, the smaller, and write 2, the quo- 
 tient, between the verticals, the prod- 
 uct, 168, opposite, under the greater 
 number, and the remainder, 35, below. 
 We next divide 84 by this remainder, 
 writing the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the product, 70, on the 
 left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70. We again divide the 
 last divisor, 35, by 14, and obtain 2 for a quotient, 28 for a product, 
 and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the same order as in 
 the former steps. Finally, dividing the last divisor, 14, by the last 
 remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last divisor, is the 
 greatest common divisor of the given numbers. 
 
 In order to show that the last divisor in such a process is 
 the greatest common divisor, we will first trace the work in the 
 reverse order, as indicated by the arrow line below.

 7 divides the 14, as proved 
 by the last division ; it will 
 also divide two times 14, or 28, 
 (I.) Now, as 7 divides both 
 itself and 28, it will divide 35, 
 their sum, (XL) It will also 
 divide 2 times 35, or 70, (I ;) 
 and since it is a common 
 divisor of 70 and 14, it must 
 divide their sum, 84, which 
 is one of the given numbers, 
 (II.) It will also divide 2 
 times 84, or 168, (I;) and 
 since it is a common divisor of 168 and 35, it must divide their 
 sum, 203, the larger number, (II.) Hence 7 is a common divisor 
 of the given numbers.

 know that the greatest common divisor, whatever it he, must divide 
 
 w 2 times 84, or 168, (I.) Then 
 
 V 203 since it will divide both 168 
 
 and 203, it must divide their 
 
 diflference, 35, (III.) It will 
 
 also divide 2 times 35, or 70, 
 
 (I ;) and as it will divide both 
 
 35 70 and 84, it must divide their 
 
 difference, 14, (III.) It will 
 
 also divide 2 times 14 or 28, 
 
 (I ;) and as it will divide both 
 
 28 and 35, it must divide their 
 
 difference, 7, (III;) hencey it 
 
 cannot be greater than 7. 
 
 Thus we have shown, 
 
 1st. That 7 is a common divisor of the given numbers. 
 2d. That their greatest common divisor, whatever it be, 
 cannot be greater than 7. Hence it must be 7. 
 
 From this example and analysis, we derive the following 
 
 Rule. I. Draw two verticals, and write the two numbers, 
 one on each side, the greater number one line above the less. 
 
 II. Divide the greater number by the less, writing the quo- 
 tient between the verticals, the 'product under the dividend, and 
 the remainder below, 
 
 III. Divide the less number by the remainder, the last divisor 
 hy the last remainder, and so on, till nothing remains. The 
 last divisor will be the greatest common divisor sought. 
 
 IV. If more than two numbers be given, first find the greatest 
 common divisor of two of them, and then of this divisor and one 
 of the remaining numbers, and so on to the last ; the last common 
 divisor found will be the greatest common divisor of all the 
 given numbers.

 PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS. 
 
 103. From the definition (100) it is evident that the 
 product of two or more numbers, or any number of times their 
 product, must be a common multiple of the numbers. Hence, 
 A common multiple of two or more numbers may be found by 
 multiplying the given numbers together. 
 
 104. To find the least common multiple. 
 
 FIRST METHOD. 
 
 From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow- 
 ing principles : — 
 
 I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all 
 the prime factors of that number. 
 
 II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it 
 will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers. 
 
 III. The least number that will exactly contain all the 
 prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common 
 multiple of those numbers. 
 
 1. Find the least common multiple of 30, 42, Q&, and 78. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. The

 42 = 2 X 3 X 7 ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^' ^^"^^

 We here have all the prime factors of 78, and also all the factors of 
 QQ, except the factor 11. Annexing 11 to the series of factors, 
 
 2X3X 13X 11, 
 
 and we have all the prime factors of 78 and 66, and also all the 
 factors of 42 except the factor 7. Annexing 7 to the series of factors, 
 
 2X3X 13X 11 X7, 
 and we have all the prime factors of 78, 66, and 42, and also all the

 factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors, 
 
 2 X 3 X 13 X 11 X 7 X 5, 
 
 and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers ; and 
 hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of 
 the given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be 
 omitted without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the 
 product of the series is the least common multiple of the given 
 numbers, (III.) 
 
 From this example and analysis we deduce the following 
 
 Rule. I- Resolve the given numbers into their prime factors. 
 
 II. Take all the prime factors of the largest Jiumber, and 
 such prime factors of the other numbers as are not found in the 
 largest number, and their product will be the least cotnmo7i 
 midtiple. 
 
 Note. When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given numbers, 
 it must be used as many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the 
 greatest niunber of times it appears in any of the given numbers.

 lOS, 1. What is the least common multiple of 4, 6, 9, 
 
 and 12 ? 
 
 , OPERATION. Analysis. We first write 
 
 the given numbers in a series, 
 with a vertical line at the left. 
 Since 2 is a factor of some of 
 the given numbers, it must be 
 a factor of the least common 
 multiple sought. Dividing as 
 ^^g^ many of the numbers as are 
 divisible by 2, we >vrite the 
 quotients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. We 
 now perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain 
 the factor 2 ; hence the least common multiple must contain another 
 2, and Ave again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient 
 when it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a Hke reason, and still again 
 by 3. By this process we have transferred all the factors of each 
 of the numbers to the left of the vertical ; and their product, 36, 
 must be the least common multiple sought, (104, III.)

 Analysis. We read- 
 ily see that 2 and 5 are 
 among the factors of the 
 given numbers, and must 
 be factors of the least 
 common multiple ; hence 
 we divide every number 
 
 that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product ; thus, 
 we divide 10 by both 2 and 5 ; 12 by 2 ; 15 by 5 ; and 75 by 5. 
 We next divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3 ; and 
 afterwards the third line by 5. By this i)rocess we collect the 
 factors of the given numbers into groups ; and the product of the 
 factors at the left of the vertical is the least common multiple sought. 
 
 3. What is the least common multiple of 6, 15, 35, 42,

 OPERATION. Analysis. In this oper-

 because they are exactly con- 
 tained in some of the other

 contained in 42, and 35 in 
 70 ; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35. 
 Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the re- 
 maining numbers, 15, 42, and 70. 
 
 From these examples we derive the following 
 
 KuLE. I. Write the niimhers in a line, omitting any of the 
 smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a 
 vertical line at the left, 
 
 II. Divide hy any 'prime factor, or factors, that may he con- 
 tained in one or more of the given numbers, and write the quotients 
 and undivided numbers in a litie underneath, omitting the Vs. 
 
 III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided num- 
 bers, and continue the process till all the factors of the given 
 numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical. Then 
 miiltiply these factors together, and their product will be the least 
 common multiple required.

 10§. III. As Integral and Fractional. 
 
 An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole things. 
 Thus, 281 ; 78 boys; 1000 books. 
 
 A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal parts 
 of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an hour; 
 seven-eighths of a mile. 
 
 109. IV. As Abstract and Concrete. 
 
 no. V. As Simple and Compound. 
 
 A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a 
 concrete number of but one denomination. Thus, 48, 926; 
 48 dollars, 926 miles. 
 
 A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value is 
 expressed in two or more different denominations. Thus, 32 
 dollars 15 cents ; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes ; 7 miles 82 
 rods 9 feet 6 inches. 
 
 111. VI. As Like and Unlike. 
 
 Like Numbers are numbers of the same unit value. 
 
 If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62, 487; 
 or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples, 62 ap- 
 ples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, they must be 
 used to express the same kind of quantity, as time, distance, 
 &c. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6 days 9 
 hours ; 5 miles 40 rods ; 2 miles 100 rods. 
 
 Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values. Thus, 
 75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes, and 5 
 bushels 1 peck.

 DEFINITIONS, NOTATION, AND NUMERATION. 
 
 lis. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the 
 parts is called one half. 
 
 If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts is 
 called one third, two of the parts two thirds. 
 
 If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of the parts is 
 called 07ie fourth, two of the parts two fourths, three of the 
 parts three fourths. 
 
 If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts is 
 called one fifth, two of the parts two ffths, three of the parts 
 three fifths, &:c.

 Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided take 
 their name, and their value, from the 7iumber of equal parts 
 into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide an orange 
 into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves ; if into 3 equal 
 parts, thirds ; if into 4 equal parts, fourths, &c. ; and each 
 third is less in value than each half, and each fourth less than 
 each third; and the greater the number of parts, the less 
 their value. 
 
 When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts, one 
 or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole number, 
 and is called a fraction. Hence 
 
 ll«l. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a 
 unit. 
 
 Define a fraction. 
 
 
 114:, To write a fraction, two integers are required, one 
 to express the number of parts into which the whole number 
 is divided, and the other to express the number of these parts 
 taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal parts, 
 the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts are 
 called three fourths of a dollar. This three fourths may be 
 written 
 
 3 the number of parts taken. 
 
 4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided. 
 
 115. The Denominator is the number below the line. 
 It denominates or names the parts ; and 
 
 It shows how many parts are equal to a unit. 
 
 116. The Numerator is the number above the line. 
 It numerates or numbers the parts ; and 
 
 It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by 
 the fraction. 
 117', The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and de- 
 nominator, taken together. 
 
 118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answering 
 to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor. Hence, 
 
 119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu- 
 merator divided by the denominator. 
 
 ISO. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe 
 its numerator and denominator. Thus, f is analyzed as fol- 
 lows : — 
 
 4 is the denominator, and shows that the unit is divided 
 into 4 equal parts ; it is the divisor. 
 
 3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken ; it is 
 the dividend, or integer divided. 
 
 3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor. 
 
 The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3 -^ 4, or f .

 A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than its 
 denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus, /j* t&> 
 ^175 -hi ^^® proper fractions. 
 
 An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals or 
 exceeds its denominator ; its value is never less than the 
 unit, 1. Thus, ^, §, -\S -3^, ^g, -^j^ are improper fractions. 
 
 122. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in- 
 teger and a fraction; thus, 4^, 17^|, Dj^jy are mixed numbei-s. 
 
 123. Since fractions indicate division, all changes in the 
 terms of a fraction will affect the value of that fraction according 
 to the laws of division ; and we have only to modify the lan-

 nator of the given fraction, to ascertain 
 _2 X 5 __ , 5 ^;25, if it be a multiple of this term, 4. The 
 4 \/ 5 division shows that it is a multiple, and 
 
 that 5 is the factor which must be em- 
 ployed to produce this multiple of 4. We therefore multiply both 
 terms of f by 5, (124,) and obtain -^f , the desired result. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the required denominator hy the denominator

 We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by 
 the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer- 
 ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a 
 fraction. Hence, by invertiiig the terms of the divisor, the two 
 fractions will stand in such relation to each other that we can mul- 
 tiply together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quo- 
 tient, and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in 
 the operation. For division of fractions, we have this general 
 
 Rule. I. Heduce integers and mixed numbers to improper 
 fractions. 
 
 II. Invert the terms of the divisor, and proceed as in multi- 
 plication. 
 
 Notes. 1. The dividend and divisor may be reduced to a common 
 denominator, and the numerator of the dividend be divided by the nu- 
 merator of the divisor ; this will give the same result as the rule.

 DECIMAL FRACTIONS. 
 
 14:3. Decimal Fractions are fractions which have for 
 their denominator 10, 100, 1000, or 1 with any number of 
 ciphers annexed. 
 
 Notes. 1. The word decimal is derived from the Latin decern,. 
 which signifies ten. 
 
 2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals. 
 
 3. Since -^ = y^, j^ =^ T^|t' &c., the denominators of decimal 
 fractions increase and decrease in a, tenfold ratio, the same as simple 
 numbers. 
 
 DECIMAL NOTATIOK AND NUMERATION. 
 
 144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of a 
 unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths, 
 twenty-fourths, &c. 
 
 Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit, thus : 
 A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths ; each of 
 these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts called hun- 
 dredths ; each of these hundredths into ten other equal parts, 
 called thousandths; and so on. Since the denominators of 
 decimal fractions increase and decrease by the scale of 10, the 
 same as simple numbers, in writing decimals the denomina- 
 tors may be omitted. 
 
 In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of 
 notation and numeration ; and so also is it in decimals. We 
 extend the scale of notation to the left of units* place in 
 writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing 
 decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens, 
 and the first place at the right of units is tenths ; the second 
 place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at the 
 right is hundredths ; the third place at the left is thousands, 
 and the third place at the right is thousandths ; and so on.

 NOTATION AND NUMERATION. 117 
 
 77ie Decimal Point is a period ( . ), which must always be 
 placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,

 .54 
 
 .279 
 
 Note. The decimal point is also called the Separairix. This is a 
 correct name for it only when it stands between the integral and deci- 
 mal parts of the same nizmber. 
 
 .5 is 5 tenths, which = J^ of 5 units ; 
 
 .05 is 5 hundredths, " z= j'^ of 5 tenths ; 
 
 .005 is 5 thousandths, " rr y\y of 5 hundredths. 
 
 And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place 
 is.^ the value of the same figure in the next left hand place. 
 
 The relation of decimals and integers to each other is clear- 
 ly shown by the following 
 
 NUMERATION TABLE.

 the value of a figiire in any decimal place ? 
 
 
 dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be 
 expressed by writing the numerator only ; but in this case 
 the numerator or decimal must always contain as many 
 decimal places as are equal to the number of ciphers in the 
 denominator ; and the denominator of a decimal will always 
 be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to 
 the number of figures in the decimal or numerator. 
 The decimal point must never be omitted.

 Note. To read a decimal, we first numerate from left to right, and 
 the name of the right hand figure is the name of the denominator. We 
 then numerate from right to left, as in whole nvmibers, to read the 
 numerator. 
 
 14®. A mixed number is a number consisting of integers 
 
 and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral part, 71, 
 
 and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as 71^^®o, 
 
 71 and 406 thousandths.

 147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations 
 we derive the following important 
 
 PRINCIPLES OF DECIMAL NOTATION AND NUMERATION. 
 
 1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon \\s, jplace 
 from the decimal point : thus .3 is ten times .03. 
 
 2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the 
 same as dividing it by ten ; thus, .03 is -^-^ the value of .3. 
 
 3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value, 
 since it does not change the place of the significant figures of 
 the decimal ; thus, -f^^ or .6, is the same as jV^j or .60. 
 
 4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from 
 left to right, in a tenfold ratio ; and therefore they may be 
 added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole 
 numbers. 
 
 5. The denominator of a decimal, though never expressed, 
 is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there 
 
 ^are figures in the decimal. 
 
 6. To read decimals requires two numerations ; first, /ro?7z 
 units, to find the name of the denominator, and second, towards 
 units, to find the value of the numerator. 
 
 148, Having analyzed all the principles upon which the 
 writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now present 
 these principles in the form of rules.

 KEDUCTION. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 149. To reduce decimals to a common denomina- 
 tor. 
 
 1. Reduce .5, .375, 3.25401, and 46.13 to their least com- 
 mon decimal denominator. 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. The given decimals must contaia 
 
 .50000 ^s many places each, as are equal to the greatest 
 
 S7500 number of decimal figures in any of the given 
 
 q t)KA(\i decimals. "Wo find that tho third number con- 
 
 . * Q/xAA t^^T^s five decimal places, and hence 100000 must 
 
 ^rb.loUOU Yye a common denominator. As annexing ciphers 
 
 to decimals does not alter their value, (144., 3) we give to each number 
 
 five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and thus reduce the given 
 
 decimals to a common denominator. Hence, 
 
 Rule. Give to each number the same number of decimal 
 places, by annexing ciphers. 
 
 Notes. 1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that 
 one of the given numbers having the greatest nimiber of decimal places, 
 they will have their least common decimal denominator. 
 
 2. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing 
 the decimal point after units, and annexing ciphers ; one cipher re- 
 ducing it to tenths, two ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thou- 
 sandths, and so on. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE. 
 
 2. Reduce .17, 24.6, .0003, 84, and 721.8000271 to their

 to both terms of the fraction ; 
 SECOND OPERATION. this does not alter its value. 
 
 A\or\(\ We then divide both resulting 
 
 ^ — '- — terms by 4, the significant fig- 
 
 .75 ure of the denominator, to ob- 
 
 tain the decimal denominator, 
 100. Then the fraction is changed to the decimal form by omitting 
 the denominator. If the intermediate steps be omitted, the true* 
 result may be obtained as in the second operation.

 THIRD OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Dividing as In the former 
 
 16) 1.0000 example, we- obtain a quotient of 3 fig- 
 
 7 ures, 625. But since we annexed 4 
 
 .Ob2o, Ans. ciphers, there must be 4 places In the 
 
 required decimal; hence we prefix 1 cipher. This is made still 
 plainer by the following operation ; thus, 
 
 1 10000 62_5 — 0(\9^ 
 
 From these illustrations we derive the following 
 
 Rule. I. Annex ciphers to the numerator, and divide hj 
 the denominator. 
 
 II. Point off as many decimal places iii the result as are 
 equal to the number of ciphers annexed. 
 
 Note. A common fraction can be reduced to an exact decimal when 
 its lowest denominator contains only the prime factors 2 and 5, and 
 not otherwise.

 hand of the quotient point off as many places for decimals 
 as ike decimal places in the dividend exceed those in the 
 divisor. 
 
 Explain division of decimals. Give rule. 
 
 
 Notes. 1. If the number of figures in the quotient be less than the 
 excess of the decimal places in the dividend over those in the divisor, 
 the deficiency must be supplied by prefixing ciphers. 
 
 2. If there be a remainder after dividing the dividend, annex ciphers, 
 and continue the division: the ciphers annexed are decimals of the 
 dividend. 
 
 3. The dividend must always contain at least as many decimal places 
 as the divisor, before commencing the division. 
 
 4. In most business transactions, the division is considered suffi- 
 ciently exact when the quotient is carried to 1 decimal places, imless 
 great accuracy is required. 
 
 5. To divide by 10, 100, 1000, &c., remove the decimal point as 
 many places to the left as there are ciphers on the right hand of the 
 divisor.

 DECIMAL CURRENCY. 
 
 1^0. Coin is money stamped, and has a given value es- 
 tablished by law. 
 
 \37, Currency is coin, bank bills, treasury notes, &c., in 
 circulation as a medium of trade. 
 
 158 . A Decimal Currency is a currency whose denom- 
 inations increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio. 
 
 Note. The currency of the United States is decimal currency, and 
 is sometimes called Federal Money ; it was adopted by Congress iii 1786. 
 
 NOTATION AND NUMERATION. "^ 
 
 The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver, 
 nickel, and bronze. 
 
 2Vie Gold Corns are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle, 
 qu;irter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces. 
 
 The Silver Coins are the dollar, half-dollar, quarter- 
 dollar, dime, half-dime, and three-cent pieces. 
 
 The Nickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces. 
 
 The Bronze Coins are the two-cent and one-cent pieces.

132 DECIMAL CURRENCY. 
 
 1^9* The dollar is the unit of United States money; 
 dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and are sepa- 
 rated from the dollar by the decimal point ; thus, two dollars 
 one dime two cents five mills, are written $2,125. 
 
 By examining the table, we see that the dime'i^ a tenth part 
 of the unit, or dollar ; the cent a tenth part of the dime or a 
 hundredth part of the dollar ; and the mill a tenth part of the 
 cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth part of the 
 dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal currency increase 
 and decrease the same as decimal fractions, and are expressed 
 according to the same decimal system of notation ; and they 
 may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in the same 
 manner as decimals. 
 
 Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes 
 and cents are appropriated to cents ; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes 
 2 cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents ; hence. 
 
 When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a cipher 
 before it in the place of dimes. 
 
 Note. The half cent is frequently written as 5 mills ; thus, 24^ cents, 
 
 written $.245. 
 
 160. Business men frequently write cents as common 
 fractions of a dollar ; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are 
 written $3y\y3^, and read, three and thirteen hundredths dollars. 
 In business transactions, when the final result of a computation 
 contains 5 mills or more, they are called one cent, and when 
 less than 5, they are rejected.

 REDUCTION. 
 
 161. By examining the table of Decimal Currency, we seir 
 that 10 mills make one cent, and 100 cents, or 1000 mills, 
 make one dollar ; hence. 
 
 To change dollars to cents, multiply ^ 100 ; that is, annex 
 ttvo ciphers.

 17S. To find the cost of articles sold by the 100, 
 1000, &c. ' 
 
 1. What cost 475 feet of limber, at $5.24 per 100 hci ? 
 
 FIRST OPERATION. 
 
 $5 24 Analysis. If the price were $5.24 per 
 
 475 foot, the cost of 475 feet would be 475 X 
 
 $5.24 z= $2489. But since $5.24 is the 
 
 2620 price of 100 feet, $2489 is 100 times the true 
 
 3668 value. Therefore, to obtain the true value, 
 
 2096 ^^ divide $2489 by 100, which we may do 
 
 bv cutting: off two fii^ures from the right, and 
 
 100) $2489.00 the result is $24.89: Or, 
 Ans. $24.89 
 
 Give explanation. Rule. Case V is what ? Give first uxi)lauutioiu 
 
 
 SECOND OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since 1 foot costs y^, or. 01, 
 $5.24 o^ $5.24, 475 feet will cost 4^, or 4.75 times 
 
 4*75 $5.24, which is $24.89. 
 
 2g20 Note. For the same reasons, when the price 
 
 or^po is per thousand, we divide the product by 1000, 
 
 *^""^ or, which is more convenient in practice, we re- 
 
 2096 duce the given quantity to thousands and deci- 
 
 mals of a thousand, by pointing off three figures 
 
 $24.8900 from the right hand. Hence the 
 
 Rule. I. Reduce the given quantity to hundreds and deci* 
 mdls of a hundred^ or to thousands and decimals of a thousand* 
 
 II. MidtipJy the price hy the quantity, and point off in the 
 result as in multiplication of decim,als.

 KEDUCTION. 
 
 1 75. A Compound Number is a concrete number whoso 
 value is expressed in two or more different denominations. 
 
 I'T'O. Reduction is the process of changing a number from 
 pne denomination to another without altering its value. 
 
 Reduction is of two kinds, Descending and Ascending. 
 
 177. Reduction Descending is changing a number of one 
 denomination to another denomination oiless unit value ; thus, 
 $1 = 10 dimes =100 cents = 1000 mills. 
 
 178. Reduction Ascending" is changing a number of one 
 denomination to another denomination of greater unit value ; 
 thus, 1000 mills = 100 cents = 10 dimes = $1. 
 
 170. A Scale is a series of numbers, descending or as- 
 cending, used in operations upon compound numbers.

 AVEIGHTS. 
 
 184:. Weight is a measure of the quantity of matter a 
 body contains, determined according to some fixed standard. 
 Three scales of weight are used in the United States 
 and Great Britain, namely, Troy, Apothecaries', and Avou*- 
 dupois. 
 
 I. Troy Weight.

 STANDARD OP WEIGHT. 
 
 188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a 
 uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of tho 
 custom houses, and the other branches of business connected with 
 the general government. Most of the States which have adopt- 
 ed any standards have taken those of the general government. 
 
 
 189. The United States standard unit of weight is the 
 Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial 
 standard pound of Great Britain, and is determined as fol- 
 lows : A cubic inch of distilled water in a vacuum, weighed 
 by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62° 
 Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of which 
 the standard Troy pound contains 5760. 
 
 190. The U. S. Avoirdupois pound is determined from 
 the standard Troy pound, and contains 7000 Troy grains^ 
 Hence, the Troy pound is ^l^% = ^f ^ of an avoirdupois 
 pound. But the Troy ounce contains ^^J-^ = 480 grains, and 
 the avoirdupois ounce ^^^ =: 437.5 grains ; and an ounce Troy 
 is 480 — 437.5 =. 42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoirdu- 
 pois.^ The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight, 
 are the same as the like denominations in Troy weight, the only 
 difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ouno

 and thickness. 
 
 A Line has only one dimension — length. 
 
 A Surface or Area has two dimensions — length and breadth. 
 
 A Solid or Body has three dimensions — length, breadth, and 
 thickness.

 Notes. 1. For the purpose of measuring cloth and other goods sold 
 by the yard, the yard is divided into halves, fourths, eighths, and six- 
 teenths. The old table of cloth measure is practically obsolete. 
 
 2. The geographic mile is g\ of -j^-g^ or ^ ^q( ^ (^ of the distance round 
 the center of the earth. It is a small fraction more than 1.15 statute 
 miles. 
 
 3. The length of a degree of latitude varies, being 68.72 mOes at the 
 equator, 68.9 to 69.05 miles in middle latitudes, and 69.30 to 69.34 miles 
 in the polar regions. The mean or average length is as stated in the 
 table. A degree of longitude is greatest at the equator, where it is 
 69.16 miles, and it gradually decreases toward the polesj where it is 0.

 IT. Square Measure. 
 10^. A Square is a figure having four equal sides, and 
 four equal angles or corners. 
 
 12 in. =1 ft. 1 square foot is a figure having four 
 
 sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as shown 
 in the diagram. Its contents are 12 
 X 12 = 144 square inches. Hence 
 
 The contents or area of a square, or 
 of any other figure having a uniform 
 length and a uniform breadth, is found 
 by multiplying the length by the breadth. 
 Thus, a square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the con- 
 tents are 12 X 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long 
 and 10 in. wide, is a rectangle, containing 20 X 10 = 200 
 square inches. 
 
 196. Square Measure is used in computing areas or sur- 
 faces ; as of land, boai'ds, painting, plastering, paving, &c.

 By the square of 100 feet : flooring, partitioning, roofing, slating, 
 and tiling. 
 
 Brick-laying is estimated by the thousand bricks j also by the 
 square yard, and the square of 100 feet. 
 
 Notes. 1. In estimating the pauiting of moldings, cornices, &c., the 
 measuring-line is carried into all the moldings and cornices. 
 
 2. In estimating brick- laying by the square yard or the square of 
 100 feet, the work is xmderstood to be l^ bricks, or 12 inches, thick.

 Analysis. Dividing by the numbers in the ascending scale, and 
 arranging the remainders according to their order in a line below, 
 we find the square yards a mixed number, 15|. But f of a sq. yd. 
 = I of 9 sq. ft. z= 6| sq. ft. ; and | of a sq. ft. =: | of 144 sq. in.^= 
 108 sq. in. Therefore | sq. yd. =z 6 sq. ft. 108 sq. in. ; and adding 
 108 sq.in. to 28 sq. in. we have 136 sq. in., and 6 sq. ft. to 7 sq.ft. we 
 have 13 sq. ft. =: 1 sq. yd. 4 sq. ft., and writing the 4 sq. ft. in the 
 result, and adding 1 sq. yd. to 15 sq. yd. we have for the reduced 
 result, 10 A. 1 R. 25 sq. rd. 16 sq. yd. 4 sq. ft. 136 sq. in.

 III. CuBJC Measure. 
 
 198. A Cube is a solid, or body, 
 
 liaving six equal square sides, or 
 
 faces. If each side of a cube be 1 
 
 yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness 
 
 of this cube will contain 3X3X1 
 
 z=z 9 cubic feet,and the whole cube will 
 
 contain 3 X 3 X 3 == 27 cubic feet. 
 
 A solid, or body, may have the 
 
 three dimensions all alike or all different. A body 4 ft. long, 
 
 . 3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick contains 4 X 3 X 2 =; 24 cubic or 
 
 solid feet. Hence we see that 
 
 The cubic or solid contents of a hody are found by mvltif ly- 
 ing the lengthy breadth, and thickness together. 
 
 100. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used 
 in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies ; as timber^vood, 
 tftone, &c.

 5. Joiners, bricklayers, and masons make no allowance for windows, 
 doors, &c. Bricklayers and masons, in estimating their work by 
 cubic measure, make no allowance for the corners of the walls of 
 houses, cellars, &c., but estimate their work by the girt, that is, the 
 entire length of the wall on the outside. 
 
 6. Engineers, in making estimates for excavations and embankments, 
 take the dimensions with a line or measure divided into feet and deci- 
 mals of a foot. The estimates are made in feet and decimals, and the 
 results are reduced to cubic yards.

 STANDARD OP EXTENSION. 
 
 SOS. The U. S, standard unit of measures of extensioriy 
 
 whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or 36 
 
 inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of 
 
 Great Britain. It is determined as follows : The rod of a 
 
 pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude of 
 
 London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided into 
 
 391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36 inches, 
 
 or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod is 39.1393 
 
 inches long, and the standard yard is tf^^ta ^^ the length of 
 
 the pendulum rod. 
 
 S03. The U. S. standard unit of liquid measure is the old 
 
 English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal to 
 
 8.33888 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at its maximum 
 
 density, that is, at the temperature of 39.83° Fahrenheit, the 
 
 , barometer at 30 inches;. 
 
 Repeat the table. What is a quarter ? What is the IT. S. standard 
 unit of measurement of extension ? How is it determined S What is 
 the U. S. standard unit of liquid measure ?

 304: • The U. S. standard unit of dry measure is the Brit- 
 ish Winchester bushel, which is 18^ inches in diameter and 8 
 inches deep, and contains 2150.42 cubic inches, equal to 
 77.6274 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water, at its maximum 
 density. A gallon, drj measure, contains 2G8.8 cubic inches.

 Notes. M. The exact leng^of a solar year is 365 da. 5 h. 48 min. 46 
 sec. ; but for conveni&Jiee it is reckoned 11 min. 14 sec. more than this, 
 or 365 da. 6 h. = 365^ da. This \ day in 4 years makes one day, 
 which, every fourth, bissextile, or leap year, is added to the shortest 
 month, gi\'ing it 29 days. The leap years are exactly divisible by 4, 
 as 1856, 1860, 1864. The number of days in each calendar month 
 may be easily remembered by committing the ifoUo wing lines i-/^ 
 
 " Thirty days hath September, 
 April. June, and November ; 
 All the rest have thirty-one, 
 Save February, which alone 
 Hath twenty-eight; and one day more 
 We add to it one year in four."

 Circular Measure. 
 
 307, Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used prin- 
 cipally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geography, 
 for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining locations of 
 places and vessels, and computing difference of time. 
 
 Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num- 
 ber of equal parts, as quarters, called quadrants, twelfths, 
 called signs, 360ths, called degrees, &c. Consequently the 
 parts of different circles, although having the same names, are 
 of different lengths.

 SUBTRACTION. 
 
 219. 1. If a druggist buy 25 gal. 2 qt. 1 pt. 1 gi. of 
 
 wine, and sell 18 gal. 3qt. 1 pt. 2 gi., how much has he left? 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Writing the subtrahend 
 
 gal. qt. pt. gi. under the minuend, placing units of the 
 25 2 1 1 same denomination under each other, 
 
 18 3 2 we begin at the right hand, or lowest 
 A ~A ^ J\ ^~ denomination ; since we cannot take 
 MS. K> 6 V o 2 gi. from 1 gi., we add 1 pt. or 4 gi. to 
 1 gi., making 5 gi. ; and taking 2 gi. from 5 gi., we write the remain- 
 der, 3 gi., underneath the column of gills. Having added 1 pt. or 
 
 4 gi. to the minuend, we now add 1 pt. to the pt. in the subtra- 
 hend, making 1 pt. ; and 1 pt. from 1 pt. leaves pt., which we write 
 in the remainder. Next, as we cannot take 3 qt from 2 qt., we add 
 1 gal. or 4 qt. to 2 qt., making 6 qt., and taking 3 qt. from 6 qt, we 
 write the remainder, 3 qt., under the denomination of quarts. Add- 
 ing 1 gal. to 18 gal., we subtract 19 gal. from 25 gal., as in simple

 numbers, and write the remainder, 6 gal., under the column of gal- 
 lons. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. I. Write the subtrahend under the minuend, so that 
 units of the same denomination shall stand under each other, 
 
 II. Beginning at the right hand, subtract each denomination 
 separaiely, as in simple numbers. 
 
 III. ]f the number of any denomination in the subtrahend 
 exceed that of the same denomination in the minuend, add to 
 the number in the minuend as many units as make one of the 
 next higher denomination, and then subtract ; in this case add 
 1 to the next higher denomination of the subtrahend before 
 subtracting. Proceed in the same manner with each denomi- 
 nation.

 Both methods will obtain the same result ; the former is generally 
 used. 
 
 Notes. 1. When hours are to be obtained, we reckon from 12 at 
 night, and if minutes and seconds, we write them still at the right of 
 hours. 
 
 2. In finding the time between two dates, or in computing interest, 
 12 months are considered a year, and 30 days a month. 
 
 When the exact number of days is required for any period 
 not exceeding one ordinary year, it may be readily found by 
 the following

 If the days of the different months are not the same, the 
 number of days of difference should be added when the earlier 
 day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and subtracted 
 •when it belongs to the month to which we find the time. If 
 the 29th of February is to be included in the time computed, 
 one day must be added to the result.

 under the lowest denomination of the mul- 
 tiplicand, and proceed thus ; 8 times 27 P« 
 „ are 216 P., equal to 5 R. 16 P.; and we 
 
 ^ write the 16 P. under the number multiplied. 
 
 Then 8 times 2 R. are 16 R., and 5 R added make 21 R., equal to 
 4 A. 1 R. ; and we write the 1 R. under the number multiplied. 
 Again, 8 times 4 A are 32 A., and 4 A. added make 36 A., which Me 
 write under the same denomination in the multipHcand, and the 
 work is done. Hence, 
 
 Rule. I. Write the multiplier under the lowest denomina-

 !3S3. 1. If 4 acres of land produce 102 bu. 3 pk. 2 qt. of 
 
 wheat, how much will 1 acre produce ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. One acre will produce \ 
 
 pt. bu. pk. qt. pts. as much as 4 acres. Writing the divi- 
 
 4)102 3 2 sor on the left of the dividend, we divide 
 
 9 - 2 n 1 1^2 bu. by 4, and we obtain a quotient of 
 
 25 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We 
 
 write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the 
 
 2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added 
 
 makes 11 pk. Di\dding 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk. 
 
 and a remainder of 3 pk. ; writing the 2 pk. under the order of 
 
 peeks, we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the 
 
 dividend, making 26 qt, which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt. 
 
 and a remainder of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of 
 
 quarts, and reducing the remainder, 2 qt, to pints, we have 4 pt, 
 
 which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 1 pt, which we write under 
 
 the order of pints, and the work is done.

 Notes. 1. When the divisor is large and is a compcstie number, 
 we may shorten the work by dividing by the factors. 
 
 2. When the divisor and dividend are both compound numbers, they 
 must both be reduced to the same denomination before dividing, and 
 then the process is the same as in simple numbers.

 Analysis. By subtraction of 
 compound numbers we first find 
 the difference of longitude be- 
 tween the two places, which is 
 16° 27'. Since 1° of longitude 
 makes a difference of 4 minutes 
 
 1 h. 5mm.4Tsec., Ans. ^J^^' '"'^ / "^ '""fc'''"*?^ " 
 ' difference of 4 seconds of time, 
 
 we multiply 16° 27', the difference in longitude, by 4, and we obtain 
 
 the difference of time in minutes and seconds, which, reduced to 
 
 higher denominations, gives 1 h. 5 min. 48 sec, the difierence in 
 
 time. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Multiple/ the difference of longitude in degrees and 
 
 minutes hy 4, and the product will be the difference of time in 
 
 minutes and seconds, which may he reduced to hours. 
 
 Note. If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the 
 difference of longitude is found by adding them, and if the svun be 
 greater than 180°, it must be subtracted from 360°.

 Note. Since the sun appears to move from east to west, when it is 
 exactly 12 o'clock at one place, it will be past 12 o'clock at all places 
 east, anf' befyre 12 at all places west. Hence, knowing the difference 
 of time between two places, and the exact time at one of them, the 
 exact time at the other will bo found by adding their difference to the

 DUODECIMALS. 
 
 22T. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of 
 a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as 1, y^, y^j, 
 ttVs' ^^' ^^ practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas- 
 urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit. 
 
 If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are 
 called inches, or primes ; the inches divided by 12 give sec- 
 onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds di- 
 vided by 12 give fourths; and so on. 
 
 From these divisions of a foot it follows that 
 
 1' (inch or prime) is yV of a foot.

 Note. Duodecimals are really common fractions, and can always 
 be treated as such ; but usually their denom'jiators are not expressed, 
 and they are treated as compound numbers. 
 
 Addition and Subtraction of Duodecimals. 
 SS§. We add and subtract duodecimals the same as other 
 compound numbers.

 surface multiplied by thickness gives solid contents (108). 
 
 1. How many square feet in a board 11 feet 8 inches, long 
 and 2 feet 7 inches wide? 
 
 Analysis. We first multiply by the 7'. 
 
 7 twelfths times 8 twelfths equals 56 one 
 
 hundred forty-fourths, which equals 4 
 
 twelfths and 8 one hundred forty-fourths. 
 
 We WTite the 8 144ths — marked with two 
 
 indices — to the right, and add the 4 12ths 
 
 30 ft. 1' 8" ^° *^^ next product 7' times 11 equals 
 
 77', which added to 4' equals 81', equal to 
 
 6 feet and 9'. We %vrite the 9' under the 
 
 inches, or 12ths, and the 6 under the feet, or units. 2 times 8' 
 
 equals 16', or 1 foot and 4'. We write the 4' under the 9', and 
 
 add the 1 foot to the next product. 2 times 1 1 feet are 22 feet, and 
 
 1 foot added make 23 feet, which we write under the 6 feet. Add-

 ing these partial products, and we have 30 ft. 1' and 8" for the 
 entire product. 
 
 It will be seen from the above that the number of indices to every 
 product of any two factors is equal to the sum of the indices of those 
 factors ; thus 7' X 8' z=: 56" ; 4'^ X ^'" — 20'^'". Hence the 
 
 HuLE. I. Write the several terms of the multiplier under 
 the corresponding terms of the multiplicand.

 Division op Duodecimals. 
 S8©. 1. A flagstone, 3 ft. 9' wide, has a surface of 20 ft 
 ir 3''; what is its length? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We divida 
 
 3 ft. 9' ) 20 ft. 11' 3" ( 5 ft. T, the surface by the width 
 
 to obtain the length. The 
 divisor is something more 
 than 3 ft., and to obtain 
 the first quotient figure, we 
 consider how many times 
 3 ft. and something more is contained in nearly 21ft. (20 ft. 11'); 
 we estimate it to be 5 times, and multiplying the divisor by this 
 quotient figure, we have 18 ft. 9^, which, subtracted from 20 ft. 11', 
 leaves 2 ft. 2', to which we bring do^vn 3", the last term of the divi- 
 dend. "We next seek how many times the divisor is contained in 
 this remainder, and find by trial the quotient 7 ; multiplying the 
 diviaor by this figure, we obtain 2 ft. 2' 3", and there is no remain- 
 der. Hence the 
 
 Rule. I. Write the divisor an the left hand of the dividend, 
 as in simple numbers, 
 
 II. J'ind the first term of the quotient either hy dividing the 
 first term of the dividend hy the frst term of the divisor, or by 
 dividing the frst two terms of the dividend by the frst two

 quotient, subtract the product from the corresponding terms of 
 the dividend, and to the remainder bring down another term of 
 the dividend.

PERCENTAGE. 
 
 205 
 
 PEROExVrAGE. 
 
 231 • Per cent, is a term derived from the Latin words 'per 
 centum^ and signifies hy the hundred, or hundredths, that is, a cer- 
 tain number of parts of each one hundred parts, of whatever de- 
 nomination. Thus, by 5 per cent, is meant 5 cents of every 100 
 cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c. 
 Therefore, 5 per cent, equals 5 hundredths = .05 = y^^ ziz ^V 
 8 per cent, equals 8 hundredths z=i .08 =: yf g- z= ^^, 
 
 2S2, Percentage is such a part of a number as is indi- 
 cated by the per cent. 
 
 233, The Base of percentage is the number on which 
 the percentage is computed. 
 
 334:« Since per cent, is any number of hundredths, it is 
 usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be 
 expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in the 
 following

 equals 1 per cent, of all he had, and 100 times f equals 100 per 
 cent., or all he had. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the percentage ly the rate per cent., ex- 
 pressed decimally, and the quotient will he the base, or number 
 required. Or, 
 
 Take as many times 100 as the percentage is times the rate

 CASE IV.* 
 
 238. To find a number when the number, increased 
 by a certain per cent, of itself, is given. 
 
 1. A man's income this year is $525, which is 5 per cent, 
 more than it was last year ; what was it last year ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since his income 
 
 $525 — 1.05 = $5.00. this year is .05 more than it 
 
 was last year, this year's income must be 1.05 times the income of 
 
 last year ; therefore divide this year's income by 1.05 and it gives the 
 
 income of last year. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the amount hy 1 plus the rate expressed 
 decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number re- 
 quired. Or, 
 
 Take as many times 100 as the amount is times 1 plus the 
 rate per cent.

 CASE V. 
 
 339. To find a number when the number, diminished 
 by a certain per cent, of itself, is given. 
 
 1. A man lost 8 per cent, of his sheep and had 368 left ; 
 how many had he at first ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since the man lost 
 
 368 -i- .92 = 400. 8 per cent, of his sheep, he has 
 
 92 per cent, left ; hence 368 is .92 times his original flock. We 
 
 therefore divide 368 by .92 and obtain the required number of sheep. 
 
 Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the given number by 1 minus the rate ex- 
 pressed decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number 
 required. Or, 
 
 Take as miny times 100 as the given number is times 1 
 minus tne rate.

 1. A commission merchant sells butter and cheese to the 
 amount of $1540 ; what is his commission at 5 per cent. ? 
 
 oPERATiox. Analysis. 
 
 1540 X -05 :i= $77, Ans. Since the com- 
 
 Or, j^,j = ^L , and g-V X 1540 =z $77. mission on $1 is 
 
 5 cents or .05 of 
 a dollar, on $1540 it is $1540 X .05=: $77. Or, since 5 per cent 
 is j^z=z-^^ of the sum received, the commission is -j^ of $1540 
 z=: $77. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Multiply the given sum ly the rate per cent, ex- 
 pressed decimally, and the result will be the com,mission or bro- 
 kerage. Or, 
 
 Take such a part of the given sum as the number expressing

 CASE II. 
 
 344. To find the commission or brokerage, when 
 it is to be deducted from the given sum, and the bal- 
 ance invested. 
 
 1. A merchant sends his agent $1260 with which to buy 
 merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent. ; 
 what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission ? 
 
 OPERATION. 
 $1260 -7- 1.05 = $1200, Invested. 
 $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission. 
 
 O/, m + ihu = U ; ^1260 -^§h = S1200, inveeted; 
 And $1260 $1200 = $60, commission. 
 
 Case 11 is what ? Give explanation. Rule. 
 
 
 Analysis. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must 
 receive $1.05 for every $1 he expends ; he can invest as many 
 dollars as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and 
 tlie difference between the given sum and the sum invested is his 
 commission. 
 
 Or, the money expended is 1^ of itself, the commission is ^^ of 
 this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is if| of 
 the whole sum. Since $1260 is \^ = f ^,$1260 -^ U = ^^200, 
 the sum expended; and $1260 — $1200=: $60 the commission. 
 Hence the 
 
 Rule. T. Divide (he given amount hy 1 increased by the rate 
 jper cent, of commission, and the quotient is the sum invested. 
 
 II. Subtract the investment from the given amount, and the 
 remainder is the commission.

 STOCK INVESTMENTS. 
 
 ^03* The net earnings of a corporation are usually divid- 
 ed among the stockholders, in semi-annual dividends. The 
 income of capital stock is therefore fluctuating, being depend- 
 ent upon the condition of business ; while the income arising 
 from bonds, whether of government or corporations, is fixed, 
 being a certain rate per cent., annually, of the par value, or 
 face of the bonds. 
 
 Case II. is what ? Give explanation. Explain difference between 
 income of capital stock, and of bonds. 
 
 
 ^64. Federal or United States Securities are of two 
 
 kinds ; viz., Bonds and Notes. 
 
 Bonds are of two kinds. 
 
 Firsts Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are 
 known and quoted in conimercial transactions by the rate of 
 interest they bear, thus : U. S. 6's, that is, United States 
 Bonds bearing 6 ^ interest. * 
 
 Second^ Those which are payable at a fixed date, but which 
 may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Government 
 may elect. These are known and quoted in commercial transac- 
 tions by a combination of the two dates, thus : U. S. 5-20's ; 
 or a combination of the rate of interest and the two dates, 
 thus : U. S. 6's 5-20 ; that is, bonds bearing 6 % interest, 
 which are payable in twenty years, but may be paid in five 
 years, if the Government so elect. 
 
 When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish from 
 each other diff'erent issues which bear the same rate of interest, 
 this is done by adding the year in which they become due, 
 thus : U. S. 6's of '71 ; U. S. 5's of '74 ; U. S. 6's 5-20 of 
 '84 ; U. S. 6'8 5-20 of '85. 
 
 Notes are of two kinds. 
 
 Firsty Those payable on demand, without interest, known 
 as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in common language, 
 " Greenbacks." 
 
 Second^ Notes payable at a specified time, with interest, 
 known as Treasury Notes. Of these there are two kinds, — . 
 6 % Compound-interest Notes, and Notos bearing *J-^^ ^ in- 
 terest, the latter known and quoted in commercial transac- 
 tions as 7.30's. 
 
 The nomenclature here explained is that used in com- 
 
 * The character % generally employed ia business transactions signifios per 
 eenU; tlius 6 % signifies 6 per cent. 
 
 What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the 
 different kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on 
 each payable ? 
 
 
 mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of States 
 or Corporations. 
 
 The interest on all bonds is payable in gold. 
 
 Tbe interest on notes is payable in Legal-tender Notes. 
 
 When Bonds or Stocks are sold, a revenue stamp must be 
 used equal in value to one cent on each $100, or fraction of 
 $100, of their currency value. If sold by a broker, this is 
 chai'ged to the person for whom they are sold. 
 
 The following are the principal United States Securities: —

 1. What sura must be invested in Virginia 6 ^ bonds, pur- 
 chasable at 80 ^, to obtain an income of $600 ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. — 
 
 $600 -T- .05 = $12000, stock required. Since $1 of the 
 
 $12000 X .80 = $9600, cost or investment, stock will obtain 
 
 $.05 income, to 
 obtain $G00 will require $G00 ^ .05 = $12000 (Case 1). Multiply-

 GOLD INVESTMENTS. 
 
 369. Currency is a terra used in commercial language, 
 First, To denote the aggregate of Specie and Bills of Ex- 
 change, Bank Bills, Treasury Notes, and other substitutes for 
 money employed in buying, selling, and carrying on exchange 
 of commodities between various nations. Second, To denote 
 •whatever circulating medium is used in any country as a sub- 
 stitute for the government standard. In this latter sense, the 
 paper circulating medium, when below par, is called C urrency , 
 to distinguish it from gold and silver. If, from any cause, the 
 paper medium depreciates in value, as it has done in the 
 United States, gold becomes an object of investment, the same 
 as stocks. In commercial language, gold is represented as 
 rising and falling ; but gold being the standard of value, it 
 can not vary. The variation is in the medium of circulation 
 substituted for gold ; hence, when gold is said" to be at a 
 premium, the currency, or circulating medium, is made the 
 standard, while it is virtually below par. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 270. To change gold into currency. 
 
 1. How much currency can be bought for $150 in gold 
 when gold is at 170 ^? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since a dollar of gol^ 
 
 $1.70 X 150 = $255. is worth $1.70 in currency, there can 
 
 be as many times $1.70 of currency 
 
 bought as there are dollars of gold. Therefore, $1.70 X 150 = $255 
 
 is the amount of currency which can be purchased for $150 in gold. 
 
 Rule. Multiply the value of one dollar of gold in currency 
 
 by the number of dollars of gold. 
 
 2. What is the value in current funds of $250 gold, when 
 gold is 147 %'i Ans. $367.50.

 40 — 32 = 8 ; 8 -r- 32 = ^8_ _ .25, Ans. 
 Or, 40 — 32 = 8 ; 8 ^ 32 =\^^ := i ; -^ X 100 = 25 ^. 
 
 Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 i::r: 8 cents, the 
^ 
 decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were 
 equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent. ; but since 
 the gain is ^^ iz= ^ of the purchase money, it will be J of 100 per 
 cent., equal to 25 per cent. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. Ifake the difference between the purchase and selling 
 prices the numerator^ and the purchase pries the denominator ; 
 reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent. Or, 
 
 Take such a part of 100 as the gain or loss is part of the 
 purchase price,

 1. A merchant sold cloth for $4.80 a yard, and by so doing 
 made 33^ per cent. ; how much did it cost ? 
 
 OPERATION. 
 
 1 + .331 =1.33^; $4.80 -^ 1.33^ r= $3.60, Jns. 
 
 Or, $4.80 = f of the cost ; $4.80 -M- 2= $3.60. 
 
 ^ — . — ^ , -^^ =.^- 
 
 Case IV is what ? X 
 
 
 Analysis. Since the gWi is 33^ per cent, of the cost, $1 of the 
 cost, increased by '3'S^ per cent., will be what $1 of cost sold for : 
 therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33^ is con- 
 tained times in $4.80, or $3.60. Or, since he gained '33^ per cent. 
 =r ^ of the cost, $4.80 is |- of the cost ; $4.80 -^ | = $3.60. 
 
 Note. If the rate per cent, be loss, we subtract it from 1, instead 
 of adyi^g it. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. Divide the selling price hy 1 increased hy the gain 
 or diminished hy the loss per cent., expressed decimally , or in 
 the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the 
 cost.

INSURANCE. 233 
 
 INSURANCE. 
 
 Syy. Insurance on property is security guaranteed by 
 one party to another, for a stipulated sum, against the loss of 
 that property by fire, navigation, or any other casualty. 
 
 278. The Insurer or Underwriter is the party taking the 
 risk. 
 
 279. The Insured is the party protected. 
 
 280. The Policy is the written contract between the 
 parties. 
 
 28 1 1 The Premium is the sum paid by the insured to the 
 insurer, and is estimated at a certain rate per cent, of the 
 amount insured, which rate varies according to the degree of 
 hazard, or class of risk. 
 
 Note. As a security against fraud, most insurance companies take' 
 risks at not more than two thirds the full value of the property 
 insured. 
 
 282. To find the premium when the rate of insur- 
 ance and the amount insured are given. 
 
 1. What must I pay annually for insuring my house to the 
 amount of $3250, at 1;^ per cent, premium ?

 ^ TAXES. 
 
 383. A Tax is a sum of money assessed on the person 
 or property of an individual, for public purposes. 
 
 2 8 4:. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned 
 at a certain per cent, on the estimated value. 
 
 When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally 
 among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called a 
 poll tax. Each person so assessed is called a poll. 
 
 "V\Tiat is a tax ? How is a tax on property apportioned ? On the 
 person, how ? 
 
TAXES. 235 
 
 285. Property is of two kinds — real estate, and personal 
 property. 
 
 380* Real Estate consists of immovable property, such 
 as lands, houses, &c. 
 
 387. Personal Property consists of movable property, 
 such a3 money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, &c. 
 
 28 8» An Inventory is a written list of articles of proper- 
 ty, with their value. 
 
 S89* Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of all 
 the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied must 
 be made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then a complete 
 list of taxable polls must also be made out. 
 
 I. A tax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town; 
 the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the as- 
 sessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be as- 
 sessed 75 cents each ; what will be the tax on a dollar, and 
 how much will be A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750, 
 and who pays for 3 polls? 
 
 OPERATION. 
 
 $.75 X 220 = $165, amount assessed on the polls. 
 
 $3165 — $165 =: $3000, amount to be assessed on the property. 
 
 $3000 -^ $600,000 = .005, tax on $1. 
 
 $3750 X -005 z=i $18.75, A's tax on property. 
 
 $.75 X 3 zz: $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls. 
 
TAXES. 235 
 
 Hence the following 
 
 Rule. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and subtract 
 this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed. 
 
 II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by the whole 
 amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per 
 cent., or the tax on one dollar. 
 
 III. Multiply each marCs taxable property by the per cent., 
 or the tax on %\, and to the product add his poll tax, if any ; 
 the result will be the whole amount of his tax. 
 
 "What is real estate ? Personal property ? An inventory ? Explain 
 the process of levying a state or other tax. Rule. 
 
 
 PERCENTAGE. 
 
 Note. Ha\Hng found the tax on $1, or the per cent., which in the 
 preceding example we find to be 5 mills, or i per cent., the operation 
 of assessing taxes may be greatly facilitated by finding the tax on $2, 
 $3, &c., to $10, and then on $20, $30, &c., to $100, and arranging

 CUSTOM HOUSE BUSINESS. 
 
 390* Duties, or Customs, are taxes levied on imported 
 goods, for the support of government and the protection of home 
 industry.

 of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry. 
 
 294L» Revenue is the income to government from duties 
 and tonnage. 
 
 Duties are of two kinds — ad valorem and specific. 
 
 295 » Ad Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost 
 of goods in the country from which they were imported. 
 
 S90* Specific Duty is a sum computed on the weight or 
 measure of goods, without regard to their cost. 
 
 29T, An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing 
 the quantity and price of each kind. 
 
 298. By the New Tarifi* Act, approved March 2, 1857, 
 all duties taken at the U. S. custom houses, are ad valorem. 
 
 In collecting customs, it is the design of government to tax 
 only so much of the merchandise as will be available to the 
 importer in the market. The goods are weighed, measured, 
 gauged, or imported, in order to ascertain the actual quantity 
 and value received in port; and an allowance is made in every 
 case of waste, loss, or damage. 
 
 299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package 
 or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by 
 actually weighing one or more of the empty boxes, casks, or 
 coverings. In common articles of importation, it is sometimes 
 computed at a certain per cent, previously ascertained by 
 frequent trials. 
 
 300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in 
 casks or barrels. 
 
 301. Breakage is an allowance en liquors imported in 
 bottles. 
 
 Note. Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed 
 or legal rate. 
 
 303. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of 
 the goods before nny allowance has been njade. 
 
 303. Net Weight or Value is the weight or value after 
 all allowances have been deducted.

 CASE I. 
 
 311. To find the interest on any sum, at any rate 
 per cent., for years and months. 
 
 
 In percentage, any per cent, of any given number is so 
 many hundredths of that number ; but in interest, any rate per 
 cent, is confined to 1 year, and the per cent, to be obtained 
 of any given number is greater than the rate per cent, per 
 annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the rate 
 per cent, per annum if the time be less than 1 year. Thus, 
 the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., for 3 years 6 
 months, is 3i times the interest on the same sum for 1 year ; 
 and the interest for 3 months is ^ of the interest for 1 year.

 SIX PER CENT. METHOD. 
 
 313. By referring to 309 it will be seen that the legal 
 rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient 
 reason for introducing the following brief method into this work : 
 Analysis. At G per cent- per annum the interest on $1 
 
 For 12 months is $.0G. 
 
 " 2 months {-^=1- of 12 nro.) '' .01. 
 
 " 1 month, or 30 days(^V of 12 mo.) " .00J=$.005 ( jL of $.06). 
 
 " 6 days (I- of 30 days)' " .001. 
 
 " 1 " (]ofGda.=5Jjof30days) " .000|. 
 Hence we conclude that, 
 
 1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for every 
 2 months ; 
 
 2d. The interest on $1 is $.000^ per day, or $.001 for every 
 C days. 
 
 From these principles we deduce the 
 
 EuLE. I. To find the rate : — Call every year $.0G, every 
 2 months $.01, every G days $.001, and any less number of days 
 &ixlhs of 1 mill, 
 
 II. To find the interest : — Multiply the principal hy the rate, 
 
 IIOTES. — 1. To find the interest nt any other rate per cent, by this 
 method, first find it at G per cent., atid then increase or diminish the 
 result by as many times itself as the given rate is greater or less than G 
 per cent. Thus, for 7 per cent, add i, for 4 per cent, subtract i, &c. 
 
 What contractions are given ? Give analysis of the 6 per cent, method. 
 Rule. Its application to any other rate per cent,

 2.' JFhe interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for 60 days, is $.01. 
 Therefore, if the principal be less than §10 and the time less than 6 
 days, or the principal less than $1 and the titDe less than 60 days, the 
 interest will be less than $.01, and may be disregarded.,; 
 
 3. Since the interest of $1 for 60 days i.s $.01, the interest of $1 fo.r 
 any number of days is as many cents as 00 is contained times in tho 
 number of days. Therefore, if any principal be multiplied by the num- 
 ber of d.iys in any given number of months and d.ays, and the product 
 divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents. That is. Multi- 
 ply the principal by the number of day Sy. divide the product by 60, and point 
 off two decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in the 
 tame denomination as the principal

 SIS, The United States rule for partial payments has 
 been adopted by nearly all the States of the Union ; the only 
 prominent exceptions are Connecticut, Vermont, and New 
 Hampshire. 
 
 Connecticut Rule. 
 
 I. Payments made one year or more from the time the in- 
 terest commenced^ or from another payment, and payments less 
 than the interest due, are treated according to the United States 
 rule. 
 
 (Nearly obsolete. The United States rule is In general upe.) 
 
 Give Connecticut rule for partial payments. 
 
 
 II. Payments exceeding the interest due, and made within 
 one year from the time interest commenced, or from a former 
 payment, shall draw interest for the balance of the year, pro- 
 vided the interval does not extend beyond the settlement^ and the 
 amount must be subtracted from the amount of the principal for 
 one year ; the remainder will be the new principal, 
 
 III. Jf the year extend beyond the settlement, then find the 
 amount of the payment to the day of settlement, and subtract it 
 from the amount of the principal to that day ; the remainder 
 will be the sum due.

 310* A note containing a promise to pay interest an- 
 nually is not considered in law a contract for any thing more 
 than simple interest on the principal. For partial payments 
 on such notes, the following is the 
 
 • Vermont Rule. 
 
 I. Find the amount of the principal from the time interest 
 commenced to the time of settlement, 
 
 II. Fitid the amount of each payment from the time it was 
 made to the time of settlement. 
 
 III. Subtract the sum of the amounts of the payments from 
 the amount of the principal, and the remainder will be the 
 sum due.

 317, In New Hampshire interest is allowed on the an- 
 nual interest if not paid when due, in the nature of damages 
 for its detention ; and if payments are made before one year's 
 interest has occurred, interest must be allowed on such pay- 
 ments for the balance of the year. Hence the following 
 
 New Hampshire Rule. 
 
 I. Find the amount of the principal for one year, and de^ 
 duct from it the amount of each payment of that year, from the 
 time it was made up to the end of the year ; the remainder will 
 he a new principal, with which proceed as before. 
 
 II. Jf the settlement occur less than a year from the last an- 
 nual term of interest, make the last term of interest a part of a 
 year, accordingly.

 Hampshire the following is the 
 
 Court Rule. 
 Compute separately the interest on the principal from the 
 time the note is given to the time of settlement, and the interest 
 on each year's interest from the time it should he paid to the 
 time of settlement. The sum of the interests thus obtainedy 
 added to the principal, will he the sum due.

 Problems in Interest. 
 
 319. In examples of interest there are five parts involved 
 the Principal, the Eate, the Time the Interest, and the 
 Amount. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 330. The time, rate per cent., and interest being 
 given, to find the principal. 
 
 1. What principal in 2 years, at 6 per cent., will gain 
 $31.80 interest ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since $1, in 
 
 $.12, interest of $1 iu 2 years at 6 ^. 2 years, at 6 per Cent., will 
 
 $31.80 — .12 — $265, Ans. gain $.12 interest, the prin- 
 
 cipal that will gain $31.80, 
 at the same rate and time, must be as many dollars as $.12 is con- 
 tained times in $31.80; dividing, we obtain $265, the required 
 principal. Hence, 
 
 Rule. Divide the given interest hy the interest of $1 for 
 the given time and rate, and the quotient will he the principal, 
 
 examples for practice. 
 
 2. What principal, at per cent., will gain $28.12^ in 6 
 years 3 months ? Ans. $75. 
 
 3. What sum, put at interest for 4 months 18 days, at 4 
 per cent., will gain $9.20 ? Ans. $600. 
 
 4. What sum of money, invested at 7 per cent., will pay 
 me an annual income of $1260 ? Ans. $18000. 
 
 5. What sum must be invested in real estate, yielding 10 
 per cent, profit in rents, to produce an income of $3370 ?

 $88,125, at the same rate and time, must be as many dollars as 
 
 $1,175 is contained times in $88,125; dividing, we obtain $75, the 
 
 required principal. Hence the 
 
 Rule. Divide the given amount by the amount of $1 for 
 the given time and rate, and the quotient tvill be the principal 
 required.

 the payment of a debt before it is due. 
 
 3^6. The Present Worth of a debt, payable at a future 
 time without interest, is such a sum as, being put at legal in- 
 terest, will amount to the given debt when it becomes due.

 11. Subtract the present worth from the given sum or debt, 
 and the remainder will be the discount. 
 
 Note. The terms present worthy discount y and debt, are equivalent 
 to principal, interest, and amount. Hence, when the time, rate per 
 cent., and amount are given, the principal may be found by (321) ; 
 and the interest by subtracting the principal from the amount.

BANKING. 263 
 
 338. A Promissory Note is a written or printed engage- 
 ment to pay a certain sum, either on demand or at a specified 
 time. 
 
 339. Bank Notes, or Bank Bills, are the notes made 
 and issued by banks to circulate as money. They are payable 
 in specie at the banks. 
 
 330. The Face of a note is the sum made payable by 
 the note. 
 
 331. Days of Grace are the three days usually allowed 
 by law for the payment of a note after the expiration of the 
 time specified in the note. 
 
 333* The Maturity of a note is the expiration of the 
 days of grace ; a note is due at maturity. 
 
 333. Notes may contain a promise of interest, which will 
 be reckoned from the date of the note, unless some other time 
 be specified. 
 
 The transaction of borrowing money at banks is conducted 
 in accordance with the following custom : the borrower pre- 
 sents a note, either made or indorsed by himself, payable at 
 a specified time, and receives for it a sum equal to the face, 
 less the interest for the time the note has to run. The amount 
 thus withheld by the bank is in consideration of advancing 
 money on the note prior to its maturity. 
 
 334. Bank Discount is an allowance made to a bank for 
 the payment of a note before it becomes due. 
 
 33d« The Proceeds of a note is the sum received for it 
 when discounted, and is equal to the face of the note less the 
 discount.

 EXCHANGE. 
 
 338. Exchange is a method of remitting money from one 
 place to another, or of making payments by written orders. 
 
 339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or order 
 upon one person to pay a certain sura to another person, or to 
 his order, at a specified time. 
 
 34:0. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring payment to 
 be made " at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta- 
 tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time 
 specified is usually a certain number of days " after siglit." 
 
 Tlierc are always three parties, and usually four, to a trans- 
 action in exchange : 
 
 341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs the 
 order or bill. 
 
 Give the rule. Define exchsingc. A bill of exchange. A sight draft.

EXCHANGE. 2G7 
 
 34^* The Drawee is the person to whom the order is 
 addressed. 
 
 •^43. The Payee is the person to whom the money is or- 
 dered to be paid. 
 
 344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who purchases 
 the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill may be 
 drawn in favor of any other person. 
 
 34^. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its 
 back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers 
 the payment to another. The payee may indorse in blank by 
 writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to the 
 hearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note ; or he 
 may accompany his signature by a special order to pay to 
 another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in like 
 manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for the 
 amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make payment. 
 A bill made payable to the hearer is transferable without in- 
 dorsement. 
 
 346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the 
 drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at 
 maturity ; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writing 
 the word " Accepted," with his signature, across the face of 
 the bill. 
 
 Note. Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of 
 a bill of exchange after the time specified has expired. But in Xew 
 York State no grace is allowed on sight drafts. 
 
 From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in mon- 
 etary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes to 
 make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other person 
 residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie, which is 
 attended with expense and risk, or sending bank notes, which 
 are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from the banks that 
 issued them, he remits a bill of exchange, purchased at a bank 
 or elsewhere, and made payable to the proper person in or 
 
 The drawee. The payee. The buyer. An indorsement. An 
 acceptance. What of grace on bills of exchange ? 
 
 
 near the place where he resides. Thus a man bj paying 
 Boston funds in Boston, may put New York funds into tlic 
 hands of his New York agent. 
 
 347. The Course of Exchange is. the variation of the 
 cost of sight hills from their par value, as affected by the rela- 
 tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two places 
 between which exchange is made. It may be either at a pre- 
 mium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent, on the 
 face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight are 
 subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of credit 
 given. Hence their value in the money market is affected by 
 both the course of exchange and the discount for time, 
 
 348. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made be- 
 tween different countries. 
 
 349* Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit- 
 tances made between different places in the same country. 
 
 An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft. 
 In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange,

 Then, multiplying $480 by 1.0245, we obtain $491.76, the Ans. 
 From these examples we derive the following 
 
 EuLE. I. For sight drafts. — Multiply the face of the draft 
 hy 1 plus the rate when exchange is at a premium, and by 
 1 minus the rate when exchange is at a discount.

 EQUATION OF PAYMENTS. 
 
 359. Equation of Payments is the process of finding the 
 mean or equitable time of payment of several sums, due at 
 different times without interest. 
 
 35«S. Tlie Term of Credit is the time to elapse before a 
 debt becomes due. 
 
 Rule. Define equation of payments. Term of credit. 
 
 
 3«54:. The Average Term of Credit is the time to elapse 
 before several debts, due at diiferent times, may all be paid 
 at once, without loss to debtor or creditor. 
 
 3SS» The Equated Time is the date at which the several 
 debts may be canceled by one payment. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 356. When all the terms of credit begin at the 
 same date. 
 
 1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr. Smith 
 8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be paid in 2 
 months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months; at what time 
 may I pay the whole amount ? 
 
 OPERATION. 
 
 $ 8 X 5 = 40 
 10 X 2 =r 20 
 12 X 10 = 120 
 
 SO 180 -^ 30 = 6 mo., average time of credit. 
 
 Jan. 1. -f- 6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment. 
 Analysis. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30 : 
 and we are to find how long it shall be Avithheld, or what term of 
 credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various terms of credit 
 on the different items. Now, the value of credit on any sum is meas- 
 ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit 
 on $8 for 5 mo. =zthe credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 X 5 := 40 
 XI- In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo.= 
 the credit on $20 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for lOmo.izz 
 the credit on $120 for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the 
 several terms of credit on their respective sums equals a credit of 1 
 month on $180; and this equals a credit of 6 months on $30, be- 
 cause 
 
 30 X 6 = 180 X 1. 
 
 Rule. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit^ and 
 divide the sum of the products by the sum of the payments ; the 
 quotient will be the average term of credit.

AVERAGING CREDITS. 273 
 
 II. Add the average term of credit to (he date at which all 
 the credits begin, and the result will he the equated time of 
 •payment. 
 
 Notes. 1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of 
 the same denomination, and the quotient will be of the same denomi- 
 nation as the terms of credit ; if these be months, and there be a re- 
 mainder after the division, continue the division to days by reduction, 
 always taking the nearest unit in the last result. 
 
 2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the 
 principle of bank discount ; for they imply that the discount of a sum 
 jjaid before it is due equals the interest of the samQ amount paid after 
 it is due.

 3^0. The Items of an account may be sums due at the 
 date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time. 
 
 An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the 
 former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have 
 dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop- 
 erty ; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name ; the Dr. 
 side of the account shows what B has received from A ; the 
 Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A. 
 
 360. The Balanca of account is the difference of the two 
 sides, and may be in favor of either party. 
 
 If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from 
 
 the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the 
 
 account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class. 
 
 Note. Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term 
 of credit, and notes after they become due.

 equitable time of payment of the balance.

 Define items. Balance. To average an account. A focal date. 
 
 
 Analysis. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the 
 items are due June 1, Oct. 12, and Aug. 16, as shown in the two 
 operations. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1, 
 as a focal date, and find the difference in days between this date and 
 each of the others, regard being had to the number of days in cal- 
 endar months. From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da. ; from June 1 to 
 Auo-. 16 is 76 da. Hence the first item has no credit from June 1, 
 the second item has 133 days' credit from June 1, and the third 
 item has 76 days' credit from June 1, as appears in the column 
 marked da. After "this we proceed precisely as in Case I, and find 
 the average credit, 71 da., and the equated time, Aug. 11. 
 
 In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 12, is taken for a 
 focal date ; the work is explained thus : Suppose the account to be 
 settled Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days, 
 and must therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on 
 $450 for 133 days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second 
 item draws no interest, because it falls due Oct. 1 2. The third item 
 must draw interest 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days = 
 the interest on $14250 for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products, 
 we find the whole amount of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12, 
 equals the interest on $74100 for 1 day; and this, by division, is 
 found to be equal to the interest on $1200 for 62 days, which time 
 is the average terra of interest. Hence the account would be settled 
 Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on the same for 62 days. This 
 shows that 1200 has been due 62 days ; that is, it falls due Au^. 11, 
 without interest. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. I. Find the time at which each item becomes due^

 II. Assume either the earliest or the latest date for a focal 
 date, and find the difference in days between the focal date and 
 each of the other dates, and write the results in a second column. 
 
 III. Write the items of the account in a third column, and 
 multiply each sum by the corresponding number of days in the 
 preceding column, writing the products in a final column. 
 
 IV. Divide the sum of the products by the sum of the items. 
 The quotient will be the average term of credit when the

 EQUATION OF PAYMENTS. 
 
 Analysis. In tlie above operation we have written the dates, 
 showing when the items become due on either side of the ac- 
 count, adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The 
 latest date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and 
 the two columns marked da. show the difference in days between 
 each date and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the 
 last case, and a balance is struck. between the items charged and the 
 products. These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David 
 Ware, on the day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes. $600 with interest 
 on $35450 for 1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal 
 to the interest on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore, 
 lias been due 59 days. Reckoning back from Oct. 12, we find the 
 
 Hence the following 
 
 data when the balance fell due, Aug. 22. 
 
 Rule. I. Find the time when each item of the account is 
 due ; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the 
 account to ichich they respectively belong. 
 
 II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the 
 focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last 
 case. 
 
 III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of the 
 account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which must. 
 be reckoned from the focal date toward the other dates when 
 both balances are on the same side of the account, but from 
 the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides of the 
 account.

 RATIO. 
 
 304:* Batio is the comparison with each other of two num- 
 bers of the same kind. It is of two kinds — arithmetical and 
 geometrical. 
 
 365. Aritlmietical Ratio is the difference of the two 
 numbers. 
 
 366. Geometrical Ratio is the quotient of one number 
 divided bj the other. 
 
 36T. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo- 
 metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from 
 dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8 
 is 2, of 10 to 5 is ^, &c. 
 
 368. Ratio is indicated in two ways. 
 
 1st. By placing two points between the numbers compared, 
 writing the divisor before and the dividend after the points. 
 Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio of 9 to 
 4 is written 9 : 4. 
 
 2d. In the form of a fraction ; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3 is f ; 
 the ratio of 4 to 6 is |. 
 
 369. The Terms are the two numbers compared. 
 
 370. The Antecedent is the first term. 
 37 li The Consequent is the second term. 
 
 37^. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex- 
 plained but by instituting another comparison ; thus, the com- 
 
 NoTE. It is thought best to omit the questions at the bottom of the pan-es. in the 
 remaining part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such aa may be deemed ap- 
 propriate. "^ *^ 
 
 
 parison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed by 2, 
 nor of 8 to 4 by ^, If the question were asked, what relation 
 4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect to magnitude, the answer 2, 
 or ^, would not be complete nor correct. But if we make 
 iinifi/ the standard of comparison, and use it as one of the 
 terms in illustrating the relation of the two numbers, and 
 gay that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the same as 1 to 2, 
 or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to J-, U7i{ty in both cases 
 being the standard of comparison, then the whole meaning i3 
 conveyed. 
 
 373* A Direct Hatio arises from dividing the consequent 
 by the antecedent. 
 
 374. An Inverse or Eeciprocal Ratio is obtained by di- 
280 RATIO. 
 ratio of 5 to 15 is -^ = 3 ; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15 is 
 
 IF — 3- 
 
 375* A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as 
 3: 12. 
 
 376. A Compoimd Ratio is the product of two or more 
 simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the 
 simple ratios of3:Gand8:2isfXf = 3X8:6X2 = 
 
 377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must 
 be of the same kindj and of the same denomination. 
 
 37 8« The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing 
 the second by the first ; or by reducing them to a common de- 
 nominator, when they are to each other as their numerators. 
 Thus, the ratio of tIt • f is f "T" tV = ^^ — 2, which is the 
 same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator 6 of 
 the equivalent fractions f'^ and -^^. 
 
 Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi- 
 dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by 
 the general principles of division, (87.) We have only to 
 substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for divi' 
 «or, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become 
 
 I 
 
 
 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO. 
 
 Prix. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio; 
 dividing the consequent divides the ratio. 
 
 Prin. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio ; di- 
 viding the antecedent multiplies the ratio. 
 
 Prix. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and con- 
 sequent by the same number does not alter the ratio. 
 
 These three principles may be embraced in one 
 
 GENERAL LAW. 
 
 A change in the consequent produces a like change in the 
 ratio ; but a change in the antecedent produces an opposite 
 change in the ratio. 
 
 379. Since the ratio of two numbers is equal to the con- 
 sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that 
 
 1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by 
 the ratio ; and that, 
 
 2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied by 
 the ratio.

 PROPORTION. 
 380. Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, tlie ratios 
 6 : 4 and 12:8, each being equal to f , form a proportion. 
 381* Proportion is indicated in two ways. 
 1st. By a double colon placed between the two ratios ; thus, 
 
 2 : 5 : : 4 : 10. 
 
 2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios ; 
 thus, 2 : 5 =1 4 : 10. 
 
 38S. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro- 
 portion must consist of at least four terms. 
 
 383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms. 
 
 384. The Means are the second and third terms. 
 38«S* Tiiree numbers may be in proportion when the first 
 
 is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, the num- 
 bers 3, 9, and- 27 are in })roportion since 3 : 9 : : 9 : 27, the 
 ratio of each coui)let being 3. 
 
 In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean 
 proportional between the other two. 
 
 380. In every proportion the product of the extremes is 
 equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion 
 
 3 : 5 : : : 10 we have 3X10=5X6. 
 
SIMPLE PROPORTION. 283 
 
 387. Four numbers that are proportional in the direct 
 order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation, or 
 by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2 : 3 : : 6 : 9, 
 by inversion becomes 3 : 2 : : 9 : 6, and by alternation 2:6:: 
 3 :9. 
 
 388. From the preceding principles and illustrations, it 
 follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given, the 
 fourth may readily be found by the following 
 
 Rule. I. Divide the product of the extremes hi/ one of the 
 means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or, 
 
 II. Divide the product of the means hy one of the extremes, 
 and the quotient will be the other extreme.

 SIMPLE PROPORTION. 
 
 389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simple 
 ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being 
 given, the fourth may readily be found. 
 
 3110. Every question in simple proportion involves the 
 principle of cause and effect. 
 
 391* Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever 
 kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, distance, 
 weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, &c. 
 
 393« Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom- 
 
 
 plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or consumed, 
 money paid, &c. 
 
 3i$3. Causes and effects are of two kinds — simple and 
 compound. 
 
 394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one element ; 
 as goods purchased or sold, and the money paid or received 
 tor them. 
 
 395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product of two 
 or more elements ; as men at work taken in connection with 
 time, and the result produced by them taken in connection 
 with dimensions, length and breadth, &c. 
 
 396* Causes and effects that admit of computation, that 
 is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num- 
 bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the 
 things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso- 
 phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are 
 always in proportion to their causes, we have the following 
 proportions : 
 
 1st Cause : 2d Cause : : 1st Effect : 2d Effect. 
 Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect : : 1st Cause : 2d Cause; 
 
 in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup- 
 let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination. 
 
 Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract num- 
 bers, we may say that 
 
 1st Cause : 1st Effect : : 2d Cause : 2d Effect, 
 which will produce the same numerical result. 
 
 But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers or 
 things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded as 
 the most natural and philosophical. 
 
 397* Simple causes and simple effects give rise to simple 
 ratios; compound causes and compound effects to compound 
 ratios.

 Since the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the 
 means (373), and the product of the means divided by one of the 
 extremes will give the other; (blank) dollars will be equal to the 
 product of 3 X 30 divided by 5, which is $18, Ans. 
 
 2. If 15 barrels of flour cost $90, how many barrels can be 
 
 bought for $30 ? 
 
 Analysis. In this ex- 
 ample a cause is required, 
 and the statement may be 
 read thus: If 15 barrels 
 cost $90, how many or 
 (blank) barrels will cost 
 $30? The product of the 
 extremes, 30 X 15, di- 
 vided by the given mean, 
 90, will give the required 
 
 term, 5, as shown in the operation. Hence we deduce the following 
 
 Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the 
 causes shall compose one couplet^ and the effects the other, put- 
 ting ( ) in the place of the required term. 
 
 II. If the required term he an extreme, divide the product 
 
 of the means hy the given extreme ; if the required term he a 
 
 mean, divide the product of the extremes hj the given mean. 
 
 Notes. 1. If the terms of any couplet be of different denominations, 
 they must be reduced to the same unit value. 
 
 2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its 
 lowest unit. 
 
 3. K the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common 
 to both, they should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion 
 contain mixed numbers, they should first be changed to improper frac- 
 tions, or the fractional part to a decimal. 
 
 4. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term 
 are written on the left, and the terms of the dividend on the right. 
 
 
 390. We will now give another method of solving ques- 
 tions in simple proportion, without making the statement, and 
 which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one already 
 given. We will term it the 
 
 Second Method. 
 
 Every question which properly belongs to simple propor- 
 tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which must 
 be given (S89). Of the three given numbers, one must 
 always be of the same denomination as the required number. 
 The remaining two will be like numbers, and bear the same 
 relation to each other that the third does to the required num- 
 ber ; in other words, the ratio of the third to the required 
 number will be the same as the ratio of the other tv/o nuniT 
 bers. 
 
 Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the sec- 
 ond couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or required 
 term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (S79). 
 
 By comparing the two like numbers, in any given question, 
 with the third, we may readily determine whether the answer, 
 or required term, will be greater or less than the third term ; 
 if greater, then the ratio will be greater than 1, and the two 
 like numbers may be arranged in the form of an improper 
 fraction as a multiplier ; if the answer, or required term, is to 
 be less than tlie third term, then the ratio will be less than 1, 
 and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form of a 
 proper fraction, as a multiplier. 
 
 1. If 4 cords of wood cost $12, what will 20 cords cost? 
 
 orERATioN. Analysis. It will

 ^ and 20 cords are the 
 
 like terms, and that 
 $12 is the third term, and of the Fame denomination as the answer 
 or required term. 
 
 If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords? 
 evidently more : then the answer or required term will be greater 
 
 
 than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4 
 cords to 20 cords is ^-, or 5 ; hence the ratio of $12 to the answer 
 must be 5, and the answer will be ^ or 5 times $12, which is $60. 
 
 2. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what will 4 yards cost ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. In this example we 
 
 48 X T5^^ $16, Ans. see that 12 yards and 4 yards are 
 the like terms and $48 the third 
 term, and of the same denomination as the required answer. 
 
 If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards? 
 less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper 
 fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is ^\ ; hence the ratio of 
 $48 to the answer is ^%, and the answer will he\\ times $48, which 
 is $16. Hence the following 
 
 Rule. I. With the two given mtmbers, which are of the 
 same name or kind, form a ratio greater or less than 1, accord- 
 ing as the answer is to he greater or less than the third given 
 number. 
 
 II. MultijpJy the third nuwher hy this ratio, and the product 
 will be the required number or answer. 
 
 Note. 1. Mixed numbers shouW first be reduced to improper frac- 
 tions, and the ratio of the fractions found according to (378 )• 
 
 2. Reductions and cancellation may be applied as in the Urst method. 
 
 The following examples may be solved by either of the 
 foregoing methods.

 this example the

 the length of the

 second effect. The question, 
 as stated, will read thus : if 7 
 men, in 12 days, dig a ditch 60 
 feet long, 8 feet Mide, and 6 
 feet deep, 21 men, in 2f days, 
 will dig a ditch how many, or 
 (blank) feet long, 3 feet wide, 
 and 8 feet deep ? 
 
 Hence we have the following 
 
 Rule. T. Of the (jiven terms, select those tvhich constitute 
 the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange 
 them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term. 
 
 
 II. Then, if the hlanh term ( ) occur in either of the ex-' 
 tremes, make the product of the means a dividend, and the 
 product of the extremes a divisor ; but if the blank term occur 
 in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend, 
 and the product of the means a divisor. 
 
 Notes. 1. The causes must be exactly alike in the member and kind 
 of their terms ; the same is true of the effects. 
 
 2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed 
 as in simple proportion. 
 
 4:01. We will now solve an example according to the 
 Second Method given in Simple Proportion. 
 
 1. If 18 men can build 42 rods of wall in 16 days, how 
 many men can build 23 rods in 8 days ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. We see in 
 
 ^S^ X^^ this example that all the 
 
 jt^^ X — X =24. men. terms appear in couplets, 
 
 4-'^ P except one, which is 18 
 
 men, and that is of the same kind as the required answer. 
 
 Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple 
 proportions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound 
 ratio, or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the prod- 
 uct will be the required term. 
 
 By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we 
 may readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be 
 greater or less than the third term ; if greater, then the ratio will be 
 greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction ; if less, the 
 ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction. 
 
 First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 42 
 rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require 
 18 men, how many men will 28 rods require ? less men ; hence the 
 ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, || ; next, 
 if 16 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require? 
 more men ; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an 
 improper fraction, '^-^. Regarding the third term as the antecedent 
 of a couplet, the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply 
 this third term by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall 
 have the required term or answer, thus : 18 X |f X \^ ^== 24, as 
 shown in the operation.

 BY CANCELLATION. ANALYSIS. The required term or an- 
 
 1 6 swer is to be in days ; and we see that 
 
 g all the terms appear in pairs or couplets, 
 
 ^ . except the 16 days, which is of the same 
 
 ^ kind as the answer sought. 
 
 40 We will proceed to compare the terms 
 
 ^09 of each couplet with the 16 days. First, 
 
 ^w if 5 compositors require J16 days, how 
 
 . many days will 10 compositors require ? 
 
 ^^ less days ; hence the multiplier is the 
 
 32 days, A71S. proper fraction ^\, and we have 16 X iV 
 Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days, 
 how many days will 7 hours a day require ? more days ; hence the 
 multiplier is the improper fraction ^, and we have 16 X x\ X V* 
 Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets 
 require ? more days ; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction 
 1^^, and we have 16 X yu X V X -f^- Pursuing the same method 
 with the other couplets, we obtain the result as shown in the opera- 
 tion. Hence we have the following 
 
 R.ULE. I. 0/ the terms composing each couplet form, a 
 ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the 
 answer depended on those two and the third or odd term. 
 
 II. Multiply the third or odd term hy these ratios successivehjy 
 and the product will he the answer sought. 
 
 Note. By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kiiid 
 as the answer. 
 
 The following examples may be solved by either of the 
 given methods.

294 PARTNERSHIP. 
 
 • PARTXERSHIP. 
 
 4:0S. PartnersMp is a relation established between two 
 or more persons in trade, bj which they agree to share the 
 profits and losses of business. 
 
 403. The Partners are the individuals thus associated. 
 
 4:04:* Capital, or Stock, is the money or property invested 
 in trade. 
 
 405. A Dividend is the profit to be divided. 
 
 406* An Assessment is a tax to meet losses sustained. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 407. To find each partner's share of the profit or 
 loss, when their capital is employed for equal periods of 
 time. 
 
 1. A and B engage in trade ; A furnishes $300, and B 
 $400 of the capital ; they gain $182 ; what is each one's 
 share of the profit ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since

 $182 X ? = $78, A's share of the gain. ^ t^f —^ f .^^"^ 
 
 ^ ^ . ^ ^ capital. And since 
 
 $182Xf = $104,D-, each man's share of 
 
 the profit or loss will have the same ratio to the whole profit or 
 loss that his share of the stock has to the Avhole stock, A will have 
 4 of the entire profit, and B 4, as shown in the operation. 
 
 We may also regard the whole capital as the Jirst causCy 
 and each man's share of the capital as the second causCy the 
 whole profit or loss as ihafrst effect, and each man's share of the 
 profit or loss as the second effect, and solve by proportion thus :

 4:08. To find each partner's share of the profit or 
 loss when their capital is employed for unequal periods 
 of time. 
 
 It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss will 
 depend upon two conditions, viz. : (he amount of capital in- 
 vested by each, and the time it is employed. 
 
 1. Two persons form a partnership; A puts in $450 for 
 7 months, and B $300 for 9 months ; they lose $156 ; how 
 much is each man's share of the loss ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. The 
 
 $450 X 7 == $3150, A's capital for 1 mo. use of $450 capital 
 
 $300 X 9 = $2700, Kb « « « for '^ months is the

 tire capital for 1 month is equivalent to $3150 -[-$2700= $5850. 
 If the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according^ to 
 Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation. 
 
 
 Examples of this kind may also be solved by proportion as in 
 Case I, the causes being compounded of capital and time ; thus, 
 
 
 $5850 : $3150

 Hence the following 
 
 Rule. Multiply each man's capital hj the time t't is em- 
 ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the 
 entire pro/it or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to 
 each product, and the results will he the respective shares of 
 profit or loss of each partner. Or, 
 
 Multiply each man's capital by the time it is employed in 
 trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum of 
 the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion, as in 
 Case I.

 ANALYSIS. 
 
 4:09, Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving 
 problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations 
 of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps of 
 the operation according to the special conditions of each question. 
 
 4: 1 O* In solving questions by analysis, we generally reason 
 from the ffiven number to unity ^ or 1, and then from unity, or 
 1, to the required number. 
 
 411. United States money is reckoned in dollars, dimes, 
 cents,andmilLs(180),one dollar being uniformly valued in all 
 the States at 100 cents ; but in most of the States money is 
 sometimes still reckoned in pounds, sWllings, and pence. 
 
 Note. At the thne of the adoption of our decimal currency by 
 Cono;ress, m 1786, the colonial cutrmc;/, or bills of credit, issued by the 
 colonies, had depreciated in value, and this depreciation, bcin^ inicqual 
 in the different colonies, gave rise to the different values of the State 
 currencies ; and this variation continues wherever the denominations of 
 shillings and pence are in use.

 31. A man bought 10 bushels of wheat and 25 bushels of 
 corn for $30, and 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn 
 for $20 ; how much a bushel did he give for each ? 
 
 Analysis. We may divide or 
 multiply either of the expressions 
 by such a number as will render 
 one of the commodities purchased, 
 alike in both expressions. In this 
 example we divide the first by 5 
 to make the numbers denoting 
 the corn alike, (the same result 
 would be produced by multiply- 
 ing the second by 5,) and we have 
 the cost of 2 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn, equal to $6. 
 Subtracting this from 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn, which 
 cost $20, we find the cost of 10 bushels of wheat to be $14 ; there- 
 fore the cost of 1 bushel is -^^ of $14, or $1.40. From any one of 
 the expressions containing both wheat and corn, we readily find the 
 cost of 1 bushel of corn to be 64 cents.

ALLIGATION MEDIAL. 307 
 
 ALLIGATION. 
 
 413. Alligation treats of mixing or compounding two or 
 more ingredients of different values. It is of two kinds — Alli- 
 gation Medial and Alligation Alternate. 
 
 4: 1 4:« Aliigation Medial is the process of finding the aver- 
 age price or quality of a compound of several simple ingredi- 
 ents whose prices or qualities are known. 
 
 1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a 
 bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with 
 15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value 
 of a bushel of the mixture ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since 40 bushels 
 
 80 X 40 = $32.00 of rye at 80 cents a bushel is 
 
 70X25:= 17.50 worth $32, and 25 bushels of com 
 
 1 KQ v^ 15 __ 22 50 ^^ "^^ cents a bushel is worth 
 
 — $17.50, and 15 bushels of ^Yheat 
 
 80 ) 72.00 at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.50, 
 
 therefore the entire mixture, con- 
 sistino: of 80 bushels, is worth 
 
 $.90, Ans. 
 
 $72, and one bushel is worth -^^ of $72, or 72 -^ 80 = $.90. 
 Hence the following 
 
 Rule. Divide the entire cost or value of the ingredients 
 hy the sum of the simples. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE. 
 
 2. A wine merchant mixes 12 gallons of wine, at $1 per 
 gallon, with 5 gallons of brandy worth $1.50 per gallon, and 
 3 gallons of water of no value ; what is the worth of one gal- 
 lon of the mixture ? Ans. $.975. 
 
 3. An innkeeper mixed 13 gallons of water with 52 gallons 
 of brandy, which cost him $1.25 per gallon ; what is the value 
 of 1 gallon of the mixture, and what his profit on the sale of 
 the whole at 6|- cents per gill? Ans. $1 a gallon; $65 profit. 
 
 4. A grocer mixed 10 pounds of sugar at 8 cts. with 12 
 pounds at 9 cts. and 10 pounds at 11 cts., and sold the mixture 
 at 10 cents per pound; did he gain or lose by the sale, and   
 how much? Ans. He gained 16 cts. 
 
308 ALLIGATION ALTERNATE. 
 
 6. A grocer bought 7^ dozen of eggs at 12 cents a dozen, 
 8 dozen at 10^ cents a dozen, 9 dozen at 11 cents a dozen, 
 and 10^ dozen at 10 cents a dozen. He sells them so as to 
 make 50 per cent, on the cost ; how much did he receive per 
 dozen? A?is. IG^ cents. 
 
 6. Bought 4 cheeses, each weighing 50 pounds, at 13 cents 
 a pound; 10, weighing 40 pounds each, at 10 cents a pound; 
 and 24, weighing 25 pounds each, at 7 cents a pound ; I sold 
 the whole at an average price of 91 cents a pound ; how much 
 was my whole gain ? A7is. $Q. 
 
 415* Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the 
 proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients, 
 whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a 
 required price or quality. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 410. To find the proportional quantity to be used 
 of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality of 
 the mixture is given. 
 
 1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a 
 bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must be used to 
 form a mixture worth $5 a bushel ? 
 
 OPERATiox. Analysis. Since on every in- 
 
 ("21^12) gredient used whose price or qual- 
 
 j 7 JL 3 j ^ws. jjy jjj i^gg ^Ijj^j^ ^j^jj mean rate there 
 
 will be a ga{?i, and on every in- 
 gredient whose price or quality is g)*ea{er than the mean rate 
 there will be a loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly 
 equal, the relative quantities used of each should be such as repre- 
 sent the unit of t'aliie. By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth 
 $2, for $5, there is a gain of $3 ; and to gain $1 would require ^ of 
 a bushel, which we place opposite the 2. By selling one bushel of 
 clover seed worth $7, for $5, there is a loss of $2 ; and to lose $1 
 would require |f of a bushel, which wo place opposite the 7. 
 
 In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by the 
 gain or loss per bushel or pound, &c. Hence, if, every time we take 
 J^ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take ^ of a bushel of clover seed, 
 the gain and loss will be exactly equal, and wc shall have ^ and -^ 
 for the proportional quantities.

 If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, we 
 may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their 
 numerators, since fractions having a common denominator are to 
 each other as their numerators. ( 37§ ) thus, |- and ^ are equal to 
 I and |, and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy 
 seed to 3 bushels of clover seed. 
 
 2. What proportions of teas worth respectively 3, 4, 7 and 
 10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth 
 6 shillings a pound ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. To preserve the 
 
 equality of gains and losses, we 
 must always compare two prices 
 cr simples, one greater and one 
 less than the mean rate, and 
 treat each pair or couplet as a 
 separate example. In the given 
 example we form two couplets, 
 
 and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10. 
 "We find that ^ of a lb. at 3 s. must be taken to gain 1 shilling, 
 
 and ^ of a lb. at 10 s. to lose 1 shiUing ; also ^ of a lb. at 4 s. to gain 
 
 1 shilhng, and 1 lb. at 7 s. to lose 1 shilHng. These proportional 
 numbers, obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in 
 columns 1 and 2. If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and 
 
 2 to a common denominator, and use their numerators, we obtain 
 the integral numbers in columns 3 and 4, which, being arranged in 
 column 5, give the proportional quantities to be taken of each.* 
 
 It will be seen that in comparing the simples of any couplet, one 
 of which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the pro- 
 portional number finally obtained for either term is the difference 
 between the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3 
 and 10, the proportional number of the former is 4, which is the 
 difference between 10 and the mean rate 6 ; and the proportional 
 number of the latter is 3, which is the difference between 3 and the 
 mean rate. The same is true of every other couplet. Hence, when 
 the simples and the mean rate are integers, the intermediate steps 
 taken to obtain the final proportional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3, 
 and 4, may be omitted, and the same results readily found by taking 
 the difference between each simple and the mean rate, and placing 
 it opposite the one with which it is compared. 
 
 * Prof. A. B. Canfield, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. Y., used this method of 
 Alligation, essentially, in th© instruction of his classes as early as ISIG, and he wag 
 doubtless the author of it. 
 
 
 From the foregoing examples and analyses we derive the following 
 
 Rule. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column, 
 and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left, 
 
 IL Form couplets hy comparing any price or quality lees, 
 with one that is greater than the mean rate, placing the part 
 which must he used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less 
 simple^ and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the 
 greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every couplet. 
 
 111. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may be 
 reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same hori- 
 zontal line, they must be added; the final results will be the pro- 
 portional quantities required. 
 
 Notes. 1. If the numbers in any couplet or colimin have a com- 
 mon factor, it may be rejected. 
 
 2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or colmnn by 
 any multiplier we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains 
 and losses, and thus obtain an indefinite number of results, any one of 
 which being taken will give a correct final result.

 we wish to use 40 bushels of corn, which is 5 times the propor-

 must take 5 times the proportional' quantity of each of the other 
 simples, or 5 X 4 •.= 20 bushels of oats, and 5 X 10 :=: 50 bushels

 6. A merchant mixed 80 pounds of sugar worth 6^ cents 
 per pound with some worth 8^ cents and 10 cents per pound, 
 so that the mixture was worth 7J- cents per pound ; how much 
 of each kind did he use ? 
 
 CASE III. 
 
 418. When the quantity of the whole compound is 
 limited. 
 
 1. A grocer has sugars worth G cents, 7 cents, 12 cents, 
 and 13 cents per pound. He wishes to make a mixture of 
 120 pounds worth 10 cents a pound ; how many pounds of 
 each kind must he use ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. By Case 
 
 I we find the propor- 
 tional quantities of each 
 to be 3 lbs. at 6 cts., 2 
 lbs. at 7 cts., 3 lbs at 12 
 cts., and 4 lbs. at 13 cts. 
 By adding the propor- 
 tional quantities, we find 
 that the mixture would be but 12 lbs. while the required mixture is 
 120, or 10 times 12. If the whole mixture is to be 10 times as much 
 as the sum of the proportional quantities, then the quantity of each 
 simple used must be 10 times as much as its respective proportion- 
 al, which would require 30 lbs. at 6 cts., 20 lbs. at 7 cts., 30 lbs. at 
 12 cts., and 40 lbs. at 13 cts. Hence we deduce the following 
 
 Rule. Find the proportional numbers as in Case I. Z)i-

 INVOLUTION. 
 
 419. A Power is the product arising from multiplying a 
 number by itself, or repeating it several times as a factor; 
 thus, in 2 X 2 X 2 =: 8, the product, 8, is a power of 2. 
 
 4^0. The Exponent of a power is the number denoting 
 how many times the factor is repeated to produce the power, 
 and is written above and a little tc the right of the factor; thus, 
 2 X 2 X 2 is written 2^, in which 3 is the exponent. Exponents 
 likewise give names to the powers, as will be seen in the 
 following illustrations : 
 
 3 r= 3^ =: 3, the first power of 3 ; 
 
 3X3 == 32 =: 9, the ^cond power of 3 
 
 3X3X3 r= 33 = 27, the third power of 3. 
 
 4^1. The Sq[liare of a number is its second power.

 given power.

 4^4. A Perfect Power is a number that can be exactly 
 produced by the involution of some number as a root ; thus, 25 
 and 32 are perfect powers, since 25 = 5 X 5, and 32 i= 2 X 
 2X2X2X2.

 EVOLUTION. 
 
 4^5, A Root is a factor repeated to produce a power ; 
 thus, in the expression 5 X 5 X 5 = 125, 5 is the root from 
 which the power, 125, is produced. 
 
SQUARE ROOT. 315 
 
 4L20, Evolution is the process of extracting the root of a 
 number considered as a power, and is the reverse of Involution. 
 
 437. The Radical Sign is the character, ^J , which, placed 
 before a number, denotes that its root is to be extracted. 
 
 4:S8. The Index of the root is the figure placed above the 
 radical sign, to denote what root is to be taken. When no 
 index is written, the index 2 is always understood. 
 
 4:30. A Surd is the indicated root of an imperfect power. 
 
 430. Roots are named from the corresponding powers, as 
 will be seen in the following illustrations : 
 
 The square root of 9 is 3, written ^^9 z=z 3. 
 The cube root of 27 is 3, written .5/'27 =: 3. 
 The fourth root of 81 is 3, written ^Sl =z 3. 
 
 431* Any number whatever may be considered a power 
 whose root is to be extracted ; but only the perfect powers can 
 have exact roots. 
 
 SQUARE ROOT. 
 
 433. The Square Boot of a number is one of the two 
 
 equal factors that produce the number ; thus the square root 
 of 49 is 7, for 7 X 7 =r 49. 
 
 433. In extracting the square root, the first thing to be 
 determined is the relative number of places in a given number 
 and its square root. The law governing this relation is exhib- 
 ited in the following examples : —

 From these examples we perceive 
 
 1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have 1 or 2 
 places in the square. 
 
 2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root 
 adds 2 places to the square. Hence, 
 
 
 If we 'point off a number into two-figure periods, commen' 
 cing at the right hand, the number of fall periods and the left 
 hand full or partial period will indicate the number of places 
 in the square root ; the highest period answering to the highest 
 figure of the root. 
 
 434. 1. What is the length of one side of a square plat 
 containing an area of 5417 sq. ft. ? 
 
 OPERATION. Analysis. Since the given figure is 
 
 54,17|73.6 a square, its side will be the square root 
 
 49 of its area, which we will proceed to com- 
 
 7~~ ~~ pute. Pointing off the given number, the 
 
 2 periods show that there will be two in- 
 
 l4o 42 J tegral figures, tens and units, in the root. 
 
 146.0 88.00 '^^^ ^^^^ ®^ ^^^ ^<^°* must be extracted 
 
 146 6 87 96 i^am the first or left hand period, 54 hun- 
 
 dreds. The greatest square in 54 hun- 
 
 4 dreds is 49 hundreds, the square of 7 tens ; 
 
 we therefore write 7 tens in the root, at 
 the right of the given number. 
 Since the entire root is to be the side of a square, let us form a 
 Fig I. square (Fig. I), the side of which is 70 feet long. 
 
 The area of this square is 70 X 70 z= 4900 sq. ft., 
 which we subtract from the given number. This 
 is done in the operation by subtracting the 
 square number, 49, from the first period, 54, 
 and to the remainder bringing down the sec- 
 ond period, making the entire remainder 517. 
 If we now enlarge our square (Fig. I) by the addition of 517 
 square feet, in such a manner as to preserve the square form, its 
 size will be that of the required square. To preserve the square 
 form, the addition must be so made as to extend the square equally 
 in two directions ; it will therefore be composed of 2 oblong figures 
 at the sides, and a little square at the corner (Fig. II). Now, the 
 width of this addition will be the additional length to the side of the 
 square, and consequently the next figure in the root. To find width 
 we divide square contents, or area, by length. But the length of 
 one side of the little square cannot be found till the width of the 
 addition be determined, because it is equal to this width. We will 
 therefore add the leni^ths of the 2 oblong figures, and the sum will 
 be sufficiently near the whole length to be used as a trial divisor.

 rial DiviFor = 140 
 
 Complete Divisor = 143 
 
 Each of the oblong figures is equal in length to the side of the 
 square first formed ; and their united length 
 is 70 + 70 =: 140 ft. (Fig. III). This num- 
 ber is obtained in the operation by doubling 
 the 7 and annexing 1 cipher, the result being 
 written at the left of the dividend. Dividing 
 517, the area, by 140, the approximate length, 
 we obtain 3, the probable width of the addi- 
 tion, and second figure of the root. Since 3 is 
 also the side of the little square, we can now 
 find the entire length of the addition, or the complete divisor, which 
 
 is 70 -|- 70 + 3 =1 143 (Fig. III). 
 '^' ^^^* This number is found in the oper- 
 
 ation by adding 3 to the trial di- 
 visor, and writing the result un- 
 derneath. Multiplying the com- 
 plete divisor, 143, by the trial 
 quotient figure, 3, and subtracting 
 ~ the product from the dividend, we 
 obtain another remainder of 88 square feet. -With this remainder, 
 for the same reason as before, we must proceed to make a new 
 enlargement ; and we bring down two decimal ciphers, because the 
 next figure of the root, being tenths, its square will be hundredths. 
 The trial divisor to obtain the width of this new enlargement, 
 or the next figure in the root, will be, for the same reason as 
 before, twice 73, the root already found, with one cipher annexed. 
 But since the 7 has already been doubled in the operation, we have 
 only to double the last figure of the complete divisor, 143, and 
 annex a cipher, to obtain the new trial divisor, 146.0. Dividing, we 
 obtain .6 for the trial figure of the root ; then proceeding as before, 
 we obtain 146.6 for a complete divisor, 87.96 for a product ; and 
 there is still a remainder of .04. Henee, the side of the given 
 square plat is 73.6 feet, nearly. From this example and analysis 
 we deduce the following 
 
 Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of two 
 figures each, counting from unit's place toward the left and 
 right. 
 
 II. Find the greatest square number in the left hand period, 
 and write its root for the first figure in the root ; subtract the 
 square number from the left hand period^ and to the remainder 
 ^ring down the next period for a dividend. 
 
 
 III. At the left of ike dividend write twice the Jirst figure of 
 the root, and annex one cipher, for a trial divisor ; divide the 
 dividend hy the trial divisor, ayid write the quotient for a trial 
 figure in the root. 
 
 IV. Add the trial figure of the root to the trial divisor for a 
 complete divisor ; multiply the complete divisor hy the trial 
 figure in the root, and subtract the product from the dividend, 
 and to the remainder bring down the next period for a new 
 dividend. 
 
 y. To the last complete divisor add the last figure of the 
 root, and to the sum annex one cipher, for a new trial divisor, 
 with which proceed as before. 
 
 Notes. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend, 
 diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work. 
 
 2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex another cipher to the trial 
 divisor, and another period to the dividend, and proceed as before.

 CUBE ROOT. 
 
 443. The Cube Root of a number is one of the three 
 equal factors that produce the number. Thus, the cube root 
 of 27 is 3, since 3 X 3 X 3 = 27. 
 
 443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be 
 determined is the relative number of places in a cube and its 
 root. The law governing this relation is exhibited in the fol- 
 lowing examples : —

 2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root 
 adds three places to the cube. Hence, 
 
 If we 'point ojf a number into three-figure periods, com- 
 mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the 
 left hand full or partial period will indicate the number of 
 places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the

 containing 413494 solid inches ? 
 
 OPERATION — COMMENCED. ANALYSIS. SinCO the block IS a 
 
 413494 I 74 cube, its side will be the cube root of 
 
 343 its solid contents, which we will pro- 
 
 14700 70404 ^^^^ ^° compute. Pointing off the 
 
 14:/ UU /U^y-l given number, the two periods show 
 
 that there will be two figures, tens and 
 units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted from the 
 first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thousands is 
 343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens ; wc therefore write 7 tens in the 
 root at the right of the given number. 
 
 
 323 
 
 Ti-. I. 
 
 Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a 
 
 cubical block (Fig. I), the side 
 of which is 70 inches in length. 
 The contents of this cube are 
 70 X 70 X 70 = 343,000 solid 
 inches, which we subtract from 
 the given number. This is done 
 in the operation by subtracting 
 the cube number, 343, from the 
 first period, 413, and to the re- 
 mainder bringing down the sec- 
 ond period, making the entire 
 remainder 70494. 
 
 If we now enlarge our cubical 
 block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a 
 manner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of 
 the required block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition 
 must be made upon three adjacent sides or faces. The addition 
 will therefore be composed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces, 
 (Fig. II) ; 3 oblong blocks to fill the vacancies at the edges, 
 (Fig. Ill) ; and 1 small cubical block to fill the vacancy at the cor- 
 ner, (Fig. IV). Now, the thickness of this enlargement will be the 
 additional length of the side of the cnhe, and, consequently, the 
 second figure in the root. To find thickness, we may divide soUd 
 I'ig- II- contents by surface, or area. 
 
 But the area of the 3 oblong 
 blocks and little cube cannot 
 be found till the thickness of 
 the addition be determined, be- 
 cause their common breadth is 
 equal to this thickness. "We will 
 therefore find the area of the 
 three flat blocks, which is suffi- 
 ciently near the whole area to be 
 used as a trial divisor. As these 
 are each equal in length and 
 breadth to the side of the cube 
 whose faces they cover, the whole 
 area of the three is 70 X 70 X 
 3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the operation 
 by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7 ; the result 
 being written at the left hand of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

 "4, the probable thickness of the addition, and second figure of the 
 
 root. With this assumed figure, 
 we -will complete our divisor by 
 adding the area of the 4 blocks, 
 before undetermined. The 3 ob- 
 long blocks are each 70 inches 
 long ; and the little cube, being 
 equal in each of its dimensions 
 to the thickness of the addition, 
 must be 4 inches long. Hence, 
 their united length is 70 -j- 70 
 -|- 70 -[- 4 = 214. This number 
 is obtained in the operation by 
 multiplying the 7 by 3, and an- 
 nexing the 4 to the product, the 
 result being written in column 
 I, on the next line below the 
 trial divisor. Multiplying 214, 
 the length, by 4, the common 
 width, we obtain 856, the area of 
 the four blocks, which added to 
 14700, the trial divisor, makes 
 15556, the complete divisor ; and 
 multiplying this by 4, the second 
 figure in the root, and subtract- 
 ing the product from the divi- 
 dend, we obtain a remainder of 
 0270 solid inches. With this re- 
 mainder, for the same reason as 
 before, we must proceed to make 
 a new enlargement. But since 
 we have already two figures in 
 the root, answering to the two 
 periods of the given number, 
 the next figure of the root must 
 be a decimal ; and we therefore 
 annex to the remainder a period 
 of three decimal ciphers, mak- 
 ing 8270.000 for a new dividend. 
 The trial divisor to obtain the 
 thickness of this second enlarge- 
 ment, or the next figure of the root, will be the area of three new flat 
 blocks to cover the three sides of the cube already formed j and this

 surface, (Fig. IV,) is composed of 1 face of each of the flat blocks 
 already used, 2 faces of each of the oblong blocks, and 3 faces of 
 the little cube. But we have in the complete divisor, 15556, 1 
 face of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube ; 
 and in the correction of the trial divisor, 8o6, 1 face of each of 
 the oblong blocks and of the little cube; and in the square of 
 the last root figure, 16, a third face of the little cube. Hence, 16

 tained in the

 adding the 
 square of the 
 last root fig-

 and combin- 
 ing units of 
 like order. 
 
 thus : 16, 6, and 6 are 28, and we write the unit figure in the new 
 trial divisor ; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5 are 12, &c. We annex 
 2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former, and dividing, obtain 
 5, the third figure in the root. To complete the second trial di- 
 visor, after the manner of the first, the correction may be found by 
 annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multiplying this 
 number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7, with 4 
 annexed, or 214, we need only multiply the last figure, 4, by 3, 
 and annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111.25, 
 the correction required. Then we obtain the complete divisor, 
 16539.25, the product, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the 
 manner shown by the former steps. From this example and analysis 
 we deduce the following 
 
 Rule. I. Pohit off the given number into periods of three 
 figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and right. 
 
 II. Find the greatest cube that does not exceed the left hand 
 period, and write its root for the first figure in the required 
 root ; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the 
 remainder bring down the next period for a dividend. 
 
 III. At the left of the dividend write three times the square 
 of the first figure of the root, and annex two ciphers, for a trial 
 divisor ; divide the dividend by the trial divisor, and write the 
 quotient for a trial figure in the root. 
 
326 EVOLUTION. J'vUX Hi^ fl .^ y^^ 
 
 IV. Annex the trial figure to three times the J^ mem fyuio ^ 
 and write the result in a column marked I, one line below the 
 trial divisor ; multiple/ this term by the trial figure, and write 
 the product on the same line in a column marked II ; add this 
 term as a correction to the trial divisor, and the I'esult will be 
 the complete divisor. 
 
 V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and 
 subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder 
 bring down the next period for a new dividend. 
 
 VI. Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last 
 term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and annex 
 two ciphers, for a new trial divisor ; with which obtain an- 
 other trial figure in the root. 
 
 VII. Multiply the unit figure of the last term in column I 
 by 3, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term 
 of column I ; multiply this result by the trial figure of the root 
 for the next term of column II ; add this term to the trial 
 divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before. 
 
 Notes. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend, 
 diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work. 
 
 2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the 
 trial divisor, and another period to the dividend ; then proceed as be- 
 fore with column I, annexing both cipher and trial figure.

 ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION. 
 
 445. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a series 
 of numbers increasing or decreasing by a common difference. 
 Thus, 3, 5, 9, 11, &c., is an arithmetical progression with an 
 ascending series, and 13, 10, 7, 4, «&;c., is an arithmetical pro- 
 gression with a descending series. 
 
 440. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which it 
 is composed. 
 
 447. The Extremes are the first and last terms. 
 
 448. The Means are the intermediate terms. 
 
 44D. The Common Difference is the difference between 
 any two adjacent terms. 
 
 4o0. There are Jiiw parts in an arithmetical series, any 
 three of which being given, the other (wo may be found. 
 Tliey are as follows : the Jirst term^ last term, common differ' 
 ence, number of terms, and sum of all the terms, 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 451. To find the last term when the first term, 
 common diirerencc, and number of terms are given. 
 
 Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the 
 common difference ; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8, 11, 
 14, or analyzed thus : 2, 2 + 3, 2 + 3 + 3, 2-|-3 + 3 + 3, 
 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. 
 
 Here we see that, in an ascending series, we obtain the 
 second term by adding the common difference once to the first 
 term ; the third term, by adding the common difference twice 
 to the first termj and, in general, we obtain any term by 
 
 
 aflding the common difference as many times to the first term 
 as there are terms less one. 
 
 Note. The analysis for a descending series would be similar. 
 Hence, 
 
 Rule. Multiply the common difference hy the number of 
 terms less one, arid add the product to the first term, if the 
 series be ascending, and subtract it if the series be descending, 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. The first term of an ascending series is 4, the common 
 difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last 
 term ? Ans. 58. 
 
 2. "What is the 13th term of a descending series whose first 
 term is 75, and common difference 5 ? Ans. 15, 
 
 3. A boy bought 18 hens, paying 2 cents for the first, 5 
 cents for the second, and 8 cents for the third, in arithmetical

 Ans. lOj. 
 
 5. A man travels 9 days ; the first day he goes 20 miles, 
 the second 25 miles, increasing 5 miles each day; how far 
 does he travel the last day of his journey ? Ans. 60 miles. 
 
 6. What is the amount of $100, at 7 per cent., for 45 
 years ? $100 + $7 X 45 = $415, Ans. 
 
 CASE II. 
 
 459. To find the common difference when the 
 extremes and number of terms are given. 
 
 Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 4.38, 
 we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any 
 term, we have left the common difference taken as many times 
 as there are terms less one ; thus, by taking away 2 in the 
 fifth term, 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times. 
 Hence, 
 
 Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number 
 of terms less one. 
 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. The first term is 2, the last term Is 17, and the number 
 of terms is 6 ; what is the common difference ? Ans. 3. 
 
 2. A man has seven children, whose ages are in arithmetical 
 progression; the youngest is 2 years old, and the eldest 14; 
 what is the common difference of their ages ? Ans. 2 years.

 and the number of terms is 34 ; what is the common difference ? 
 
 4. An invalid commenced to walk for exercise, increasing 
 the distance daily by a common difference ; the first day he 
 walked 3 miles, and the 14th day 9^ miles ; how many miles 
 did he walk each day ? 
 
 Note. When we have found the common difference we may add it 
 once, twice, &c., to the fiist term, and we have the series, and conse- 
 quently the meatis, 
 
 Ans. 3, ^, 4, 4^, 5, 5^, &c. 
 
 CASE III. 
 
 453. To find the number of terms when the ex- 
 tremes and common difference are given. 
 
 Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 438, 
 we also see that after taking away the first term from any 
 term, we have left the common difference taken as many 
 times as the number of terms, less 1. Hence, 
 
 Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common 
 difference J and add 1 to the quotient. 
 
 examples. 
 
 1. The extremes are 7 and 43, and the common difference 
 is 4; what is the number of terms ? Ans. 10. 
 
 2. The first term is 2^, the last term is 40, and the common 
 difference is 74; what is the number of terms ? Ans. 6. 
 
 3. A laborer agreed to build a fence on the following con- 
 ditions : for the first rod he was to have 6 cents, with an 
 increase of 4 cents on each successive rod ; the last rod came 
 to 226 cents ; how many rods did he build ? Ans, bQ rods. 
 
 
 CASE IV. 
 
 454. To find the sum of all the terms when the 
 extremes and number of terms are given. 
 
 To deduce a rule for finding the sum of all the terms, we 
 will take the series 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, writing it under itself in an 
 inverse order, and add each term ; thus, 
 
 2 -)- 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 = 40, once the sum. 
 14-1-11-1-' 8+ 5+ 2=^=40, " « " 
 16 _|_ 16 -|- IG + 16 + 16 = 80, twice the sum. 
 
 Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, multi- 
 plied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice the 
 sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is the 
 sum required. Hence, 
 
 Rule. Multiply the sum of the extremes hy the number of 
 terms, and divide the product hy 2. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. The extremes are 5 and 32, and the number of terms 12 ; 
 what is the sum of all the terras ? Ans. 222. 
 
 2. How many strokes does a common clock make in 12 
 hours ? Ans. 78 strokes.

 ments in arithmetical progression, the first being $24, and the 
 last $1224? Ans. $32448. 
 
 4. Suppose 100 apples were placed in a line 2 yards apart, 
 and a basket 2 yards from the first apple ; how far would a 
 boy travel to gather them up singly, and return with each 
 separately to the basket ? Ans. 20200 yards. 
 
 GE03^IETRICAL PROGRESSION. 
 
 455. A Geometrical Progression is a series of numbers 
 increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier. 
 
 When the multiplier is greater than a unit, the series is 
 
 
 ascending I thus, 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series, in 
 which 3 is the multiplier. 
 
 When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is descend- 
 ing \ thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in which ^ 
 is the multiplier. 
 
 4^0* The Ratio is the constant multiplier. 
 
 4t57 • In every geometrical progression there are five 
 parts to be considered, any three of wiiich being given, the 
 other two may be determined. They are as follows: The^Vs^ 
 term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of all the 
 terms. 
 
 The first and last terms are the extremes, and the interme- 
 diate terms are the means. 
 
 CASE I. 
 
 458. To find any term, the first term, the ratio, 
 and number of terms being given. 
 
 The first term is supposed to exist independently of the 
 ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second 
 term ; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third 
 terra ; using it three times, or its third power ^ we have the 
 fourth term ; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any 
 term is one less than the number of the term. Tlie ascending 
 series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 X 3, 2 X 
 3X3, 2X3X3X3. 
 
 In this illustration we see that 
 
 1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio. 
 
 2d " 6 = 2X3 = the first term into the 1st power of 
 fhe ratio. 
 
 3d term, 18 = 2 X 32 = the first term into the 2d power 
 of the ratio. 
 
 4th term, 54 = 2 X 3 ^ = the first term into the 3d power 
 of the ratio. Hence 
 
 RuLK. Mdtiply the first term hy that power of the ratio 
 denoted hy the number of terms less 1. 
 
 
 EXAMPLES. X 
 
 1. The first term of a geometrical series is 4, the ratio is 3 ; 
 what is the 9th term ? Ans. 4 X 38 =r 26244. 
 
 2. The first term is 1024, the ratio I, and the number of 
 terms 8 ; what is the last term ? Ans. y^^. 
 
 3. A boy bought 9 oranges, agreeing to pay 1 mill for the 
 first orange, 2 mills for the second, and so on ; what did the 
 last orange cost him ? Ans, $.256. 
 
 4. The first term is 7, the ratio ^, and the number of terms 
 7 ; what is the last term ? Ans. T^iuy 
 
 5. What is the amount of $1 at compound interest for 5 
 years, at 7 per cent, per annum ? Ans. $1.40255 -|-. 
 
 Note. In the above example the first term is $1, the ratio is $1.07, 
 and the ntmiber of terms is 6. 
 
 6. A drover bought 7 oxen, agreeing to pay $3 for the first 
 ox, $9 for the second, $27 for the third, and so on ; what did 
 the last ox cost him ? Ans. $2187. 
 
 CASE II. 
 
 459, To find the sum of all the terms, the ex- 
 tremes and ratio being given. 
 
 If we take the series 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, in which the ratio 
 is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms thus 
 multiplied, we shall have 
 
 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048 = 2728 = {,^-- ttTe.^."" 
 But 2 + 8 + 32 -f 128 + 512 = 682 = j t^'Ums!""" ''^ ^" 
 
 Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048 — '2 — 2046 — { ^Z'thTtlrml!''"' 
 Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046 -^ 3 =: 682 = { Se'terms.'"'"' ""^ ""^ 
 The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or 
 series from the upper. All the terms cancel except 2048 and 
 2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum, and di'^ 
 viding by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the sum of all 
 the terms. Hence 
 
 
 Rule. Multiply the greater extreme hy the ratio, subtract 
 
 the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder 
 
 by the ratio less 1. 
 
 Note. Let every decreasing series be inverted, and the first term 
 called the last ; then the ratio will be greater than a unit. K the series 
 be infinite^ the first term is a cipher. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. The first terra is 2, the last term 512, and the ratio 3; 
 what is the sum of all the terms ? Ans. 1^1. 
 
 2. The first term is 4, the last term is 262144, and the 
 ratio is 4; what is the sum of the series ? Ans. 349524. 
 
 3. The first term of a descending series is 162, the last 
 term 2, and the ratio ^ ; what is the sum ? Ans. 242. 
 
 4. What is the value of |, ^^, y^, &c., to infinity ? Ans. \. 
 
 Note. In the following examples we first find the last term by the

 MENSURATION OF LINES AND SUPERFICIES. 
 
 460. In taking the measure of any line, surface, or solid, we are 
 always governed by some denomination, a unit of which is called the 
 Unit of Measure. Thus, if any lineal measure be estimated in feet, 
 the unit of measure is 1 foot ; if in inches, the unit is 1 inch. If any 
 superficial measure be estimated in feet, the unit of measure is 1 
 square foot ; if in yards, the unit is 1 square yard. 
 
 461. If any solid or cubic measure be estimated in feet, the 
 unit of measure is 1 cubic foot ; if in yards, the unit is 1 cubic yard. 
 
 462. The area of a figure is its superficial contents, or the 
 surface included within any given lines, 
 
 without regard to thickness. 
 
 463. An Oblique Angle is an angle 
 greater or less than a right angle ; thus,

 and parallel, and its angles oblique. 
 
 Note. The square, rectangle, rhombus, and fhomboid, havinej their op- 
 posite sides parallel, are called by the general name, parallelogram. 
 
 It is proved in geometry that any ])arallelogram is equal to a rec- 
 tangle of the same length and width ; hence the 
 
 
 Rule. Multiply the length hy the shortest or perpendicular dis- 
 tance between two opposite sides. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

THE METRIC SYSTEM 
 
 OF 
 
 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.* 
 
 INTRODUCTION. 
 
 The metric system of weights and measures — so called, because 
 the metre is the unit from which the other units of the system are 
 derived — had its origin in France during the Revolution, a time when 
 all regard for institutions of the past was repudiated. In the year 
 1790, the French government resolved to introduce a new system ; 
 and, in order that it might he received with general favor, other 
 countries were invited to join with it in the choice of new units. 
 In response to this invitation, a large number of scientific men, com- 
 missioned by various countries, met in Paris, in consultation with the 
 principal men of France. In the year 1791, a commission, nomi- 
 
 p3 nated by the Academy of Sciences, was appointed by the Government 
 
 . to prepare the new system. The first work of the commission was to 
 
 select a standard of lengths from which the system of units adopted 
 
 might at any time be restored if from any cause the original unit 
 
 .'/' should be lost. A quadrant of the earth's meridian was chosen as 
 -, the standard, and the ten-millionth part of it taken as the unit of 
 lengths, which was called a metre. In 1795, this standard and a 
 provisional metre whose length was determined from measurements 
 
 * 3r. Mc Vicar, A.M., rrincipal of the State Normal and Training School at 
 Broekport, Jf .Y., a most thorough and critical scholar as well as teacher, prepared 
 this article, which contains many practical improvements in Notation, Nomencla- 
 ture, and Applications, not before presented to the public. 
 
 Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1867, by D. W. Fisn, A.M., in the Clerk's 
 Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.

 of the earth's meridian, which had already been made, was adopted 
 by the government. 
 
 In the meantime, two eminent astronomers, Mechain and Delambre, 
 were engaged in determining the exact length of the arc of the meri- 
 dian between Dunkirk in the north of France, and Barcelona in 
 Spain. At a later period, Biot and Arago measured the prolonga- 
 tion of the same meridian as far as the island of Formentara. From 
 these measurements, together with one formerly made in Peru, they 
 deduced, as they supposed, the exact distance from the equator to 
 the pole, which differed slightly from the standard assumed in 1795. 
 In 1799, a law was passed changing the length of the metre adopted 
 in 1795 so as to conform with this difference. The metre thus de- 
 termined was marked by two very fine parallel lines drawn on a pla- 
 tinum bar, and deposited for preservation in the national archives. 
 
 While a part of the commission were engaged in establishing the 
 exact length of the metre, other members pursued a course of inves- 
 tigation for the purpose of determining a unit of weights, which would 
 sustain an invariable relation to the unit of lengths. As the result 
 of their investigations, the weight of a cube of pure water whose edge 
 was one-hundredth part of a metre was the unit chosen. The water 
 was weighed in a vacuum, at a temperature of 4° C, or 39.2° F., 
 which was supposed to be the temperature of greatest density. This 
 weight was called a gramme; and a piece of platinum weighing one 
 thousand gi*ammes was deposited as the standard of weights in the 
 national archives. 
 
 Had the work of the commission ended in determining tlieso 
 standards of lengths and weights, their labor would have been futile. 
 For, while the conception of basing their system upon an absolute 
 standard in nature was good, the execution proved a failure. Later 
 investigations have shown that the metre is less than the ten-millionth 
 part of the earth's meridian ; consequently the metric system of 
 weights and measures is referable not to an invariable standard in 
 nature, but to the platinum metro deposited in the national archives 
 of France. The great benefits which result from i\\Q labors of the 
 commission arise from the adoption of the decimal scale of units, and 
 a simple yet general and expressive nomenclature. The amount of 
 
 
 time and money used in carrying on exchanges between different coun* 
 tries, which would be saved by the universal adoption of t^is system, 
 is incalculable. The system was declared obligatory throughout the 
 whole of France after Nov. 2, 1801 ; but, owing to the prejudices 
 of the people in' favor of established customs, and the confusion con- 
 sequent upon the use of the new measures, the Government, in 1812, 
 adopted a compromise, in the systeme usuel, whose principal units 
 were the new ones, while the divisions and names were nearly those 
 formerly in use, ascending commonly in the ratios of two, three, four, 
 eight, or twelve. In 1837, the government abolished this system, 
 and enacted a law attaching a penalty to the use of any other than 
 the metric system after Jan. 1, 1841. Since that time, the system 
 has been adopted by Spain, Belgium, and Portugal, to the exclusion 
 of other weidits and measures. In Holland, other weiojhts are used 
 only in compounding medicines. In 1864, the system was legalized 
 in Grreat Britain ; and its use, either as a whole or in some of its parts, 
 has been authorized in Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Mexico, 
 Guatemala, Venezuela, Ecuador, United States of Columbia, Brazil, 
 Chili, San Salvador, and Argentine Republic. In 1866, Congress 
 authorized the metric system in the United States by passing the fol- 
 lowing bills and resolution : — 
 
 An Act to authorize the use of the Metric System op TVeights 
 AND Measures. 
 
 Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States 
 of America in Congress assembled, That, from ami after the passage of this 
 Act, it shall be lawful throughout the United States of America to employ 
 the Weights and Measures of the Metric System : and no contract or dealinjr, 
 or pleading in any court, shall be deemed invalid, or liable to objection, be- 
 cause the -weights or measures expressed or referred to therein are weights or 
 measures of the Metric System. 
 
 Section 2. And he it further enacted, That the tables in the schedule 
 hereto annexed shall be recognized in the construction of contracts, and in 
 all legal proceedings, as establishing, in terms of the Aveights and measures 
 now in use in the United States, the equivalents of the weights and measures 
 expressed therein in terms of the Metric System ; and said tables may be 
 lawfully used for computing, determining, and expressing in customary 
 weights and measures, the Aveights and measures of the ^.Ictric System.

 Note. — The spelling in the above tables is not the same as in 
 the tables in the schedule annexed to the report of the committee of 
 the House of llepresentatives on weights and measures. The change 
 is not made to indicate any preference for any standard upon this 
 subject ; but to carry out what the author believes to be an essential 
 condition to the utility and success of the system. 
 
 As remarked by a distinguished senator when the tables were 
 adopted by Congress, "77?e names are cosmopolitan ;" and to re- 
 tain this character fully , the spelling must also be cosmopolitan. 
 
 The French introduced the nomenclature and spelling ; and, so 
 long as the names remain unchanged, the spelling should be retained.

 THE METRIC SYSTEM. 
 
 NOMENCLATUKE AND TABLES. 
 
 There are eight kinds of quantities for which tables are usually 
 constructed; viz., Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes or Solids, Capacities, 
 Weights, Values, Times, and Angles or Arcs. The table for Times 
 is the same in the metric as in the ordinary system. The table for 
 Angles is constructed upon a centesimal scale. The tables for the 
 other six kinds of quantities are constructed upon a decimal scale. 
 Ill each of the tables for Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes, Capacities, and 
 Weights, there are eight denominations of units, — one principal and 
 seven derivative. The principal units are the Tnetre, which is the 
 base of the system, and those derived directly from it. The two 
 following tabular views present the facts regarding the principal and 
 derivative units, which should be fixed in the memory.

 V. Gramme, 
 
 1. Principal unit of Lengths. 
 
 2. The base of the metric system, and nearly 
 
 one ten-millionth part of a quadrant of 
 the earth's meridian. 
 ^ 3. Equivalent, 39.3708 inches.

 2. A square whose side is ten metres. 
 
 3. Equivalent, 119.6 square yards.

 2. A cube whose edge is one metre. 
 
 3. Equivalent, 1.308 cubic yards. 
 
 ' 1. Principal unit of capacities. 
 
 2. A vessel whose volume is equal to a cube 
 
 whose edge is one-tenth of a metre. 
 
 3. Equivalent, .908 quart dry measure, or 
 
 1.0567 quarts wine measure.

 kind, are formed by dividing eacb of the principal units 
 into tenths, hundredths, and thousandths. 
 
 2. Four orders of larger units, or multiples of eacb kind, 
 are formed by considering as a unit ten times, one 
 hundred times, one thousand times, and ten thousand 
 times, eacb of the principal units. 
 
 " The names of derivative units are formed by 
 attaching a prefix to the name of the princi- 
 pal unit from which they are derived, which 
 indicates their relation to the principal unit.

 2. Hecaton, one hundred, contracted hecto. 
 Ex., Hectolitre = 100 Utres; 7 hectolitres 
 = 700 litres. 
 
 3. Kilioi, one thousand, contracted kilo. Ex. 
 Kilogramme = 1000 grammes. 
 
 4. Myria, ten thousand. Ex., Myriastere = 
 10,000 stores; 3 myriasteres =30,000 steres. 
 
 5. The a in deca and myra, and the o in hecto 
 and kilo, are dropped when prefixed to are. 
 
 The tables being constructed upon a decimal scale, ten 
 units of a lower order .make one of the next higher, 
 thus : 10 millimetres = 1 centimetre ; 10 centimetres 
 = 1 decimetre; 10 decimetres = 1 metre; 10 me- 
 tres = 1 decametre, &c.

 THE METRIC SYSTEM. 
 
 The facts in the preceding views being mastered, the tables can be 
 constructed by the pupil at sight. For example : The names of the 
 derivative units are formed by attaching the seven prefixes, in their 
 order, to the principal units of the tables. The order of progression 
 being ten, the table of capacities will be written thus : — 
 
 10 Millilitres = 1 Centilitre. 
 10 Centilitres = 1 Decilitre. 
 10 Decilitres = 1 Litre. 
 
 10 Kilolitres 
 
 10 Litres = 1 Decalitre. 
 
 10 Decalitres = 1 Hectolitre. 
 
 10 Hectolitres = 1 Kilolitre. 
 1 Myrialitre. 
 
 All the tables peculiar to the Metric System are presented together 
 
 in a convenient form in the two following tables : —

 ABBREVIATED NOMENCLATURE. 
 
 To secure the fullest advantage to business men by the universal 
 adoption of the new system of weights and measures, it is necessary 
 that the names used should be short and easy to write and pronounce, 
 that they should express clearly the relation of the different denomi- 
 nations of the same table to each other, and that they should be 
 identical in all languages. 
 
 The last two of these requirements would be secured by the uni- 
 versal use of the nomenclature adopted by the French. It is cosmo- 
 politan in its character : it belongs to their language no more than to 
 any other. The former, however, is not secured. It is evident to 
 all, that, for business purposes, the long names of the metric system 
 are inconvenient, and that to shorten them would prove a great

 advantage. Efforts have been macje to introduce short names; 
 but these efforts have invariably sacrificed their universal and expres- 
 sive character, which is of more importance to the business world 
 than their shortness. 
 
 The only true course which seems to be open, is to abbreviate the 
 names already introduced, in such a way as to retain their peculiar 
 characteristics. 
 
 To secure this, the following plan of abbreviation is suggested : — 
 
 First. Let the prefixes be abbreviated thus : Myr, kil, hect, dec, 
 des, cent, mil. 
 
 Second. Let the initial letter of the names of the five principal 
 units be used, instead of the names themselves, thus : For metre, use 
 a capital M ; for are, use a capital A ; for store, a capital S ; for 
 litre, a capital L ; and, for gramme, a capital G. 
 
 Third. For the names of multiples and sub-multiples, attach to 
 these initial capital letters the abbreviated prefixes, thus : Kil M, pro- 
 nounced kill-em' ; Kil S, pronounced kill-ess', &c. 
 
 By this method of abbreviation, the elements of the original terms 
 are retained in such a form that each part is clearly indicated. The 
 capital letter used after the prefix will always point to the base-word 
 of which it is the initial, although the pronunciation is changed.

 NOTATION AND NUMERATION. 
 
 In the practical application of the metric system, it is not always 
 convenient to use the principal units as the unit of number. For 
 example : Should the gramme, the principal unit of weight, be used 
 as the unit of number, in the grocery or any similar business, small 
 quantities would be expressed by inconveniently large numbers. 
 Example : 386 lbs. are expressed by 175,000 grammes. To avoid 
 this inconvenience, the higher denominations are used as the unit of 
 number when large quantities are measured. 
 
 No general system of notation is yet agreed upon. The same 
 quantity is written in various ways by different authors. Example : 
 42 metres, 8 decimetres, and 5 centimetres, are written 
 
 m cm 
 
 42.85 M. 42? 85. 42.85. M 42.85. &c. 
 
 Inasmuch as the principal units of measure arc not always used as 
 the unit of number, it is important that a system of notation be adopt- 
 ed, wliich will apply equally well to both principal and derivative 
 units. 
 
 It is believed that the system given below, while simple and con- 
 venient, expresses clearly the relation of the unit of number to the 
 principal unit of measure ; and, hence, has an advantage over any 
 contractions of the names of the derivative units or arbitrary signs 
 which might be adopted. 
 
the metric system. 357 
 
 General principles of notation. 
 
 I. The scale in the metric system being decimal, the consecutive 
 denominations are expressed by the consecutive orders of units in a 
 number. Thus, 78642.358 metres is an expression for 7 myria- 
 metres, 8 kilometres, 6 hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 3 deci- 
 metres, 5 centimetres, 8 millimetres. 
 
 II. Whichever one of the eight denominations of units of measure 
 is used as the unit of a number, the higher denominations are ex- 
 pressed as tens, hundreds, and so on ; and the lower as tenths, hun- 
 dredths, and so on. Example : 784.56 decametres. Here the unit 
 of the number is a decametre ; consequently the tens and hundreds 
 are, respectively, hectometres and kilometres, and the tenths and 
 hundredths are metres and decimetres. 
 
 From these principles and illustrations, we derive the following rule 
 for notation : — 
 
 KuLE. Write the consecutive denominations in their order, com- 
 mencing with the higher, and placing a cipher wherever a denomi- 
 nation is omitted, and the decimal point after the denomination 
 which is the unit of the number. 
 
 RULES FOR IXDICATOG THE DENOiC^fATION. 
 
 Rule I. When a principal unit of measure is the unit of num- 
 ber, place the initial letter of the unit used before the number, thus : 
 M 342.5. Read, three hundred and forty-two and five-tenths 
 metres ; or, 3 hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 5 decimetres. 
 
 EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

 centimetres. Ans. M 70430.08. 
 
 2. Thirty-four kilometres and forty-three millimetres.

 steres. - Ans. S 53147203. 
 
 KuLE II. When a multiple of a principal unit of measure is the 
 unit of number ; — First, Place before the number (he initial letter 
 of the principal unit from which the multiple is derived. Second, 
 Indicate the order of multiple used h^j a small figure placed to the 
 left and above the letter prefixed to the number, (See symbols in 
 table of multiples.) 
 
 Example. 42.5 kilometres, is written ^M 42.5. 
 
 The M before the number indicates that the metre is the unit of 
 measure from which the unit of the number is derived. The small 
 3 indicates that the third order of multiple, or kilometre, is the unit 
 of number.

 REDUCTION. 
 
 Rule for Reduction Descending. Multiply the given quantity 
 hy the number of the required denomination which makes a unit of 
 the given denomination. 
 
 Since the multiplier is always 10, 100, 1000, &c., the operation 
 is performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the 
 right as there are ciphers in the multiplier, annexing ciphers when 
 necessary.

 2. Reduce *M 5 to decimetres. 
 
 3. Reduce G402 to milligrammes.

 8. Reduce 'G 539 to centisrammes. 
 
 Rule for Reduction Ascending. Divide the given quantity 
 hy the number of its own denomination which makes a unit of the 
 required denomination. 
 
 Since the divisor is always 10, 100, 1000, &c., the operation is 
 performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the left 
 as there are ciphers in the divisor, prefixing ciphers when necessary. 
 
 1. Reduce 2 A 5 to myriares.

 NUMERAL EXPRESSION FOR SURFACE. 
 
 Tlie contents of a plane figure is expressed numerically by giving 
 the number of times Ifc contains some given area, which is assumed as 
 the unit of surface. 
 
 The following illustrations will show how the various denomina- 
 tions of the table are used in numerical expressions of surface : — 
 
 ILLUSTRATION FIRST. 
 
 r 
 
 Length 6 metres. 
 
 It win be seen, by examining this figure, that the lines drawn 
 parallel to the sides, at the supposed distance of a metre from each 
 other, divide the surface into square metres, and that there are as 
 many rows of square metres as there are metres in the breadth, each 
 row containing as many square metres as there are metres in the 
 length. Hence the number of square metres in the area of the figure 
 is equal to the product of the two numbers which indicate the length 
 and breadth ; and A 0.21 is a numerical expression for its contents.

 THE METRIC SYSTEM. 
 
 ILLUSTRATION SECOND.

 C metres. 
 
 In this figure, the lines drawn parallel to the sides divide the 
 figure into 36 milliares, or oblongs, whose length is one metre and 
 breadth one decimetre. It is evident that ten of these oblongs put 
 together will constitute a centiare, or square metre. Hence the ex- 
 pression, 36 milliares, may be written 3.6 centiares; and read, three 
 and six tenths centiares, or three centiares and six milliares. 
 
 By reducing the length to decimetres, the numerioal expression of 
 the contents will be, by Illustration First, 60 x 6, or 360 dccimilliares 
 or square decimetres.

 In the following analysis, each part of the contents is presented 
 separately, as it would be obtained by multiplying the length by the 
 breadth. The learner should carefully note each part, and analyze a 
 sufficient number of examples to fix the principles in the mind.

 find the product of the two dimensions after reduction, and point 
 off as many decimal places in this product as there are decimal 
 places in the two dimensions.

 liare when the unit of length is a decimetre, a centiare when the

 NUMERICAL EXPRESSION FOR YOLUME, OR SOLIDITY. 
 
 The solidity, or contents, of a volame is expressed numerically by 
 giving the number of times it contains some given solid as the unit 
 of volume. 
 
 The following illustrations will show how the various denominations 
 of the table are used in numerical expressions of volume. 
 
 MiUistere, or Cubic Decimetre. 
 
 10 millisteres, placed side by side, make a volume whose length 
 is one metre, and breadth and thickness each one decimetre, thus, — 
 
 10 centistere, placed side by side, make a volume whose length 
 and breadth is each one metre, and thickness one decimetre, thus, — 
 
 Decistre = 10 Centisteres = 100 3Iillisteres. 
 
 10 decisteres, placed face to face, make a cnbe whoso edge is one 
 metre, thus, — 
 
 Stere = 10 Decisteres = 100 Centisteres = 1000 Millisteres, 
 
 From these illustrations, it is evident that the contents of a cubic 
 metre may be expressed numerically, as S 1, iS 10, 2S 100, 3S 1000. 
 
 
 THE METRIC SYSTEM. 
 
 The followlnoj fiojures illustrate the use of 
 the same four denominations in expressing 
 the contents of a cubic volume whose edge 
 is one metre and one decimetre. The sur- 
 face of one face of the volume contains 
 one centiare, two milliares, and one deci- 
 milliare, thus, — 
 
 Centiare. 
 
 Milliaif. 
 
 jr 
 
 Taking a slab of the face one decimetre thick, thus, — 
 and we have one decistere, two 
 centisteres, and one millistere. 
 But the volume is eleven deci- 
 metres thick ; therefore we have iiliilH 
 eleven such slabs, or eleven times one decistere, two centisteres, and 
 one millistere. 
 
 r 11 millisteres = 1 centistere and 1 millistere = S 0.011 
 = K 22 centisteres = 2 decisteres and 2 centisteres = S 0.22 
 ( 11 decisteres = 1 stere and 1 decistere = S 1.1 
 
 Ml.l X Ml.l X Ml.l = S1.331 
 
 From these illustrations, we derive the following rule for finding a 
 numerical expression for a given volume of uniform length, breadth, 
 and thickness : — 
 
 Rule. Reduce the length, breadth, and thickness to the same 
 denomination ; find the product of the three dimensions, after re- 
 duction, and point off as many decimal places in this product as 
 there are decimal places in the three dimensions. 
 
 The unit of the numerical expression thus found will be a millistere 
 when the unit of length is a decimetre, a stere when the unit of length 
 is a metre, a kilostere when the unit of leno:th is a decametre.

 MEASUREMENT OF ANGLES. 
 
 In the ordinary or sexagesimal system, a right-angle, which is used 
 as the measure of all plane angles, is divided into 90 equal parts, 
 called degrees; a degree is divided into 60 equal parts, called 
 minutes ; and a minute into 60 equal parts, called seconds. 
 
 In the centesimal or French system, a right-angle is divided into 
 100 equal parts, called grades; a grade into 100 equal parts, called 
 minutes; and a minute into 100 equal parts, called seconds. 
 
 The former is called the sexagesimal system, on account of the 
 occurrence of the number sixfy in forming the subdivisions of a de- 
 gree ; and the latter centesimal, on account of the occurrence of the 
 number one hundred. 
 
 Grades, minutes, and seconds are usually written thus : 35^ 42^ 
 24^^ ; read, thirty-five grades, forty-two minutes, twenty-four seconds. 
 
 Since the scale is centesimal, minutes may be expressed as hun- 
 dredths, and seconds as ten-thousandths ; hence any number of grades, 
 minutes, and seconds may be expressed decimally thus : 73= 4569 ; 
 read, seventy- three ^ades, forty-five minutes, sixty-nine seconds. 
 
 
 In a right-angle, there are 100 grades, or 90 degrees; benco, for 
 every 10 grades there are 9 degrees. Dividing the 10 gi-ades into 
 9 equal parts or degrees, each part will contain 1^ grades; therefore 
 a degree s equal to 1 1 grades. Ilcncc, in any number of grades 
 there are as many degrees as 1^ is contained times in the given 
 number of grades ; and, conversely, in any number of degrees there 
 are 1^ times as many grades as there arc degrees. Hence the fol- 
 lowing rules : — 
 
 TO CHAJJ^GE THE CENTESIMAL MEASUxlE TO THE SEXAGESIMAL. 
 
 Rule. Express the minutes and seconds as a decimal of a 
 grade ^ divide hy \\'. the quotient will express the number of de- 
 grees and decimals of a degree in the given number of grades, min- 
 utes, and seconds.

 grains make one gramme; hence there are as many grammes in 71750 
 
 grains as 15.432 grains is contained times in 71750 grains. And since 
 
 there are 10000 grammes in a myriagramme, dividing G4G49.43 — by 
 
 10000 will give the myriagrammes in 10 pounds 4 ounces. Therefore, 
 
 10 lbs. 4 oz. is equal to *G 464943 —

DISTILLING WATER. 
 r6194.]— Beixg an amateur photographer In a 
 
 country town, where the chemist has the impudence 
 
 to charge me the same 
 
 price for distilled 
 
 water that I pay for 
 
 my ale, I determined 
 
 to distil for myself. 
 
 The following simple 
 
 apparatus, modified 
 
 from a drawing in 
 
 the Photographic News, 
 
 works admirably, and 
 
 I find it very conve- 
 nient. I can now use 
 
 distilled water for all 
 
 my solutions, and for" 
 
 other purposes. A is 
 
 a common tin sauce- 
 pan, with a small hole 
 in the side, for a tobac- 
 co-pipe; B a " steamer," 
 on top, with a bottom 
 like an inverted cone, an inch of wire being soldered at 
 the apex. A gas jet (Bunsen's, if possible) boils the 
 water in the saucepan ; the ascending steam Is con- 
 densed on the lower surface of the steamer, runs 
 down to the point of the wire, down the pipe into the 
 bottle. A small jet of cold water keeps B cool.
