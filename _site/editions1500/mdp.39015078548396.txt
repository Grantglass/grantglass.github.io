THE
LIFE
AND
ADVENTU RES
O F
Robinson Crusoe,&
 
Was born in the Year 1632, in the
City oillrky of a good Family, tho*
not of that Country, my Father be-
h g a Foreigner of Bremer,, who fettled
firft at Hull 1 He got a good Eftate
by Merchandize, and leaving off his
Trade, lived afterward at Turk, from whence he had
married my Mother, whofe Relations were named
Robinfon, a very good Family in that Country, and
from whom 1 was call'd Robinfon Kreuvxjnaer; but by
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, we arc
now call'd, nay we call our felves, and write oar
NatneCrw/o^andfo my Companions always cail'dme.
Part I. B I had
I hail two elder Brothers, one of which was
Lieutenant Collonel to anE>z£7/$> Regiment of Foot
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Coll.
Lockhart, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk
againft the Spaniards •> What became of my Second
Brother I never knew, any more than my Father or
Mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd very ear-
ly with rambling Thoughts : My Father, who was
very ancient, had given me a competent Share of
Learning^ as far as Houfe-Education, and a
Country free-School generally goes, and' defign'd
me for the Law; butIwould be fatisfied with no-
thing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this
led me fo ftrongly againft the Will, nay the Com-
mands eirfty Father, andag-ainft ail the Entreaties
and FerfwiUibns of my Mother and other Friends,
that there feem'd to be fomething fatal in that Pro-
penfion of Nature tending dire&Iy to the Life of
Mifery which was to befal me.
My Father, a wife and grave Man, gave me
ferious and excellent Counfel againft what he fore-
(aw was my Defign. He called me one Morning in-
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the
Gout, and expoftulatcd very warmly with me upon
this Subject: He ask'd me what Reafons more than
a meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving my
Father's Houfe and my native Country, where I
might- be well introduced, and had aProfpedof
raifing my Fortune by Application and- Ihduftry,
with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure. He told me
it was for Men of defperate Fortunes on one
Hand, or of afpiring,fuperior Fortunes on the other,
who went abroad upon Adventures, to rife by
Enterprise, and make themfelves famous in Un-
dertakings of a Nature out of the commit Road;
: - <•>-'- -• that
[ 3 ]
that thefe things were all cither too far above me,
or too far below me; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
of Low Life, which he had found by long Experience
was the beft State in the World, themoftfuited to
human Happinefs, not expofed o che Miferies and
Hardfliips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me-
chanick Part of Mankind, and not embarafs'd with
the Pride Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the up-
per Part of Mai kind. He told me, I might judge
of the Happinefs of this State, by this one thing,
viz*. That this was the State of Life which all
other People envied -, that Kings have frequently
lamented the miferable Confequences of being born
to great Things, and wifti'd they had been placed
in the Middle of the two Extremes, beween the
Mean and the Great; that the wife Man gave his
Teftimony to this as the juft Standard of true Felici-
ty, when he prayed to have neither Poverty ot
Riches.
He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always find*
that the Calamities of Life were fhar'd among the
upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that the
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was
not exposed to fo many Viciffitudes as the higher at
lower Part of Mankind; nay, they were not fubjV
<5ted to fo many Diftempers and Uneafindfes either
of Body or Mind^ as thole were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravances on one Hand,
or by hard Labour, want of Necettaries, and mean ,
or inefficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di-
ftempers upon themfelves by the natural Confequen-
ces of their Way of Living, "that the middle Sta-
tion of Life was calculated for all Kind of Virtues,
ind all Kind of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plen-
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune j
that Temperance, Moderation, Quietefs, Health,
•B 2 Society,
[4]
Society, all agreeable Diver/ions, and all defireable
Pleafures, were the B:effings attending the middle
Station of Life; that this Way Men went filently
and fmoothly'thro the World, and comfortably out
of it, not embarafs'd with the Labours of the Hands
or of the Head, not fold to the Life of Slavery for
daily Bread, or harrafs'd with perplexed Circum-
fiances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the
Body of Reft; not enrag'd with the Paffion of En-
vy, or fecret burning Lnft of Ambition for great
things; but in eafy Circumftances Aiding gently
thro' the World, and fenfibly tafting the Sweets of
Living, without the bitter, feeling that they are
happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to
know it more fenfibly.
After this, he prefs'd me earneftly, and in the
moft affe&ionate Manner, not to play the young
Man, nor to precipitate my felf intoMifcries which
Nature and the Station of Life I was bom in,
feem'd to have provided againft; that I was under
no Neceffity of feeking my Bread; that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
into the Station of Life which he had been juft re-
commending to me; and that if I was not very ea-
fy and happy in the World, it mull be my meer
Fate or Fault that muft hinder it, and that he
ftiould have nothing to anfwer for, having thus dif-
charg'd his Duty in warning me againft Meafures
which he knew wou'd be to my Hurt-: In a Word^
that as he would do very kind things for me if
I would flay and fettle at Home, as he dire&edy
{o he would not have fo much Hand in my Misfor-
tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go
away : And to clofe all, he told me I had my
elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had ufed
the fame earneft Perfwafions to keep him from go-
.ng into the Low Country Wars, but could not pre-
1 vaii
C 5]
vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was kilfd; and tho" he faid
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifh
Step, God would not blefs me, and I would have
Leifure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected
his Counfel, when there might be none to affift in
my Recovery.
I obferved in this laft Part of his Difcourfe,
which was truly Prophetick, tho' I fuppofe my
Father did not know it to be fo himfelf; I fay, I
obferved the Tears run down his Face very plen-
tifully, efpecially when he fpoke ot my Brother
who was k.'ll'd; and that when he fpoke of my
having Leifure to repent*, and none to affift me, he
was (o mov'd, that he broke off the Difcourfe, and
told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay no
more to me.
I was fincerely affe&ed with this Difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife? and I reiolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my Father's Defire. But
alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in fhort, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I refolvM to run quite away
from him. However, I did not ait fo hafiily neither
as my firft Heat of Refolution prompted, but I took
my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
pleafanter than ordinary, and told her, that my
Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the
World, that I fhotild never fettle to any thing with
Refolution enough to go through with ic, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force
me to go without it : that I was now Eighteen
Years old, which was too late to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney; that 1 was fure,
if I did, I fliOuiid never fcrve out my Time, and I
B 3 flaould
fliould certainly run away from my Matter before
my Time was out, and go to Sea ; and if (he would
fpeak to my Father to Jet me go one Voyage A-
broad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promife by a dou-
ble Diligence to recover that Time I hadloft."
This put my Mother into a great Paffion: She
told me, ftie knew it would be to no Purpofe.to
fpeak to my Father upon any fuch £ubje<a, that,he
knew too well what was my Intereft to give hisCon-
fent to any fuch thing fo much for my Hurt,and that
flie wondered how I could think of any fuch thing
after fuch a Difcourfe as I had had with my Father,
and fuch kind and tender Expreffions as flie knew my
Father had us\i to me; and that in fliort, if I would
ruin my felf there was no Help for me; but I might
depend I fliould never have theirConfent to it:That
for her Part flie would not have fomuchHand in my
Deftru&ion; and I fliould never have it to fay, that
my Mother was willing when my Father was not.
Tho* my Mother refufed to move it to my Fa-
ther, yet as I have heard afterwards, flie reported
ail the Difcourfe to him, and that my Father, after
dewing a great Concern at it, faid to her with a'
Sigh, That Boy might be happy if he would fta'y
at Home, but if he goes Abroad, he will be the
moft miferableft Wretch that was ever born; I can
give no Confent to it.
It was not till almoft aYear after this that I broke
loofe, tho* in the mean time I continued obftinate-
ly deaf to all Propofals of fettling to Bufinefs, and
frequently cxpoftulating with my Father and Mo-
ther, about their being fo pofitfvely determinM
againft what they knew my Inclinations prompted
me to. But being one Day at Hull, where I went
f afually, and without any Purpofe of making an
JEJopcwsnt ;th»t time J but I fay, being there, and
one
one of my Companions being going by Sea to Lon-
don, in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common Allurement of Seafa-
ring Men, viz,. That it fhould coft me nothing for
my Paflage, I confulted neither Father or Mother
anymore,nor fo much as fent them Word of it; but
leaving them to hear of it as they might, without
asking God's Blcffing, or my Father's, without any
Confideration of Circumftances or Confequences,
and in an ill Hcur, God knows, on rhe firft of Sep-
tember 1^5 i, I went on board a Ship bound for Lon-
don: Never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I
believe, began (boner, or continued longer than
mine. The Ship was no fooner gotten out of the
Humbert but the Wind began to blow, and the
Winds to rife in a raoft frightful manner; and as I
had never been at Sea before, I was moil inexprefll-
ble fick in Body, and terrify'd in Mind: I be-
gan now ferioufiy to reflect upon what I had done,
and how juftly I was overtaken by the Judgment of
Heaven for my wicked leaving my Father's Houfe,
and abandoning my Duty; all the good Counfel of
my Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's
Entreaties came now frefii into my Mind, and my
Conference, which was not yet come to the Pitch
of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and my Father.
All this while the StoVm encreas'd, and the Sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very high,
tho' nothing like what I have feen many times
fince\ no, nor like what I faw a few Days after:
But it was enough to affeft me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of
tne Matter. I expe&ed every Wave would have
(wallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow
B 4 of
[83
of the Sea,we fhould never rife more; and in this
Agony of Mind, I made many Vow-s and Refolu-
txons, that if it would pleafe God here to fpare
my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my
Foot upon dry Land again, I would go dire&ly
home to my Father, and never fee it into a Ship a-
gain while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice,
and never run my felf into fuch Miferies as thefe,\
any more. Now 1 faw plainly the Goodnefs of
his Obfervations about the middle Station of Life,
how eafy, how comfortably he had li/d all his
Days, and never had been expos'd to Tempefts
at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I refolv'd that
I would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go Home.
to my Father.
Thefe wife and foberThonghts continued all the
while the Storm continued, and indeed feme time
after; but the next Day the Wind was abated and
the Sea calmer, and 1 began to be a little inur'd
to it: However 1 was very grave for all that Day,
being alfo a little Se^-lick ftill; but towards Night
the Weather cleared up, the Wind was quite over,
and a charming fine Evening followed; the Sun
went down perfeftly clear, and rofe fo the next
Mornings and having little or no Wind, and a
fmooth Sea, the Sun fhining upon -it, the Sight was,
as I thought, the mod delightful that ever I faw*.
I had ilept well in the Night, and was now no
more Sea fick, but very chearful, looking with
Wonder upon the Sea that was fo rough and terri-
ble the Day before, and could be fo calm arid fo
pleafant in fo little time after. • And now left my
good Refolutions fliould continue, my Companion,
who had indeed entie'd me away, comes to m€,

Wind? A Cap full d'you call it? faid-I, 'twas a terri-
ble Storm: A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you
call that a Storm, why it wa<s nothing at all-, give m but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we think nothing of fuch
a Squaul oj'Wmd as that > but you re but a frefo Water
Sailor, Bob; come let us make a Bowl of Punch and
we'11 jo?get all that; d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tis
now? To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the way of all SaiIQrs, the Punch was
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all my Repen-
tance, all my Reflections upon my paft Condud,
and ail my Refolutions for the future. In a word,
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallo W'd up
by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of my
former Defires returned, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promifes that I made in my Diftrefs. I found
indeed fome Intervals of Refle&ion, and the ferious
Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return a-
gain fome time, but 1 fliook them off, and rouz'd
my felt from them as it were from a Diftemper,
and applying my felf to drinking and Company,
foon malter'd the Return of thofe Fits, (for fo I
call'd them) and I had in five or fix Days got as
compleat a Vi&ory over Confcience as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubled with it,
could'deiire: But I was to have another T/rial for
it fhll; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
it does, refolv/d to leave me entirely without Ex-
cufe. For if I would not take this for a Delive-
rance, the next was to be fuch a one as the worft
and'moft hardened Wretch among us would confefs
both the Danger and the Mercy.
The
The fixth Day of our being; at Sea we came irr
to Tarmotah Roads; she Wind having been contra-
ry, and the Weather calm, we had made but little
Way fince the Storm. Here we were obliged to
come to Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz,, at South-weft, for feven or
eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Newcaftle came into the fame Roads, as the
common Harbour vyhere the Ships might wait for
a Wind for the River.
We had.not however rid here folong, but fhould
have Tided it up the River, but that the Wind
blew too frefh; and after we had lain four or five
Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads be-
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage
good, and our Ground-Tackle very firong, our
Men were unconcerned, and not in the leaft appre-
henfive of Danger, but fpent the Time in Reft and
Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, and we
had all Hands at Work to ftrike our Top-Mafts,
and.make every thing fnug and clofe, that the Ship
might ride as eafy as poffible. By Noon the Sea
went very high indeed, and our Ship rid Forecaftle
iny ihipp'd feveral Seas, and we thought once or
twice our Anchor had come Home, upon which
our Mafter ordered out the Sheet Anchor; fo that
we rode with two Anchors a-head, and the Cables
vered out to the better End.
By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed,
and now I began to fee Terror and Amazement in
the Faces even of the Seamen themfelves. The Ma-
iler, tho* vigilant in the Buiinefs of preferving the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabin by
me, I could hear him foftly to himfeif fay feveral
time, Lord be merciful to my we ft all be all loft, we
/hall be all undone; ;>n the like, During thefe firft
Hurries,
Hurries, I was ftupid , lying iiill in my Cabin,
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my
Temper: I could ill refume the firft Penitence
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har-
den'd my felf againft: I thought the Bitternefs of
Death had been paft, and that this would be no-
thing too like the firft. But when the Mafter him-
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we
fliould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted: I got
up out of my Cabin, and look'd out; but fuch a
difmal Sight I never faw: The Sea wentMountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi-
nutes: When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diftrefs round us: Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Malls by the
Board, being deep loaden,* and our Men cry'd out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Hcad of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven
from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to
Sea, at all Adventures, and that not with a Maft
Handing. The light Ships fared the beft, as not
fo much labouring in the Sea ,* but two or three of
them drove, and came clofe by us, running away
with only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore-maft, which he was very unwilling
to: But the Boatfwain protecting to him, that it he
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented;
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the
Main-maft ftood fo ioofe, and (hook the Ship fo
much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo,
and make a clear Deck. * \.
Any one may judge what a Condition I mull be
in at ail this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit-
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Diftance the
Thoughts
Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
ten fold more Horror of Mind uponAccount of my
former Convi&ions, and the having returned from
them to theRefoIutions I had wickedly taken atfirft,
tnan I was at Death it felf; and thefe, added to the
Terror of the Storm, put me in fuch a Condition,
that I can by no Words defcribe it. But the worft
was not come yet, the Storm continued with fuch
Fury, that the Seamen themfelvcs acknowledged
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship,
but flie was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea,
that the Seamen every now and then cried out, Ihe
would founder. It was my Ad vantage in one refpeft,
that 1 did not know what they meant by founder,
till I enquired. However, the Storm was fo vio-
lent, that 1 faw what is not often feen, the Mafter,
the Boat-Swain, and fome others more fenfible than
the reft, at their Prayers, and expefting every Mo-
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottom. In
the Middle of the Night, sf.nd under all the reft of
our DiftrelTes, one of the Men that had been down
on Purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung a Leak;
another faid there was four Foot Water in the
Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, dkd
within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of
my Bed where I fat, into the Cabin. However,
the Men rouzed me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as another,- at which I ftirr'd up, and went
to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this
was doing, the Mafter feeing fome light Colliers,
who not able to ride out the Storm, were oblig'd
to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near
us, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was fo furpri-
zedj that I thought the Ship had broke, or fome
dread-
[*?]
dreadful thing happen'd. In a Word, I was fo fur-
prized, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was
a time when every Body had his own Life to
think of, no Body minded me, or what was become
of me y but another Man ftcpt up to the Pump,and
thrufting me afide with his Foot, let me lye, think-
ing I had been,dead; and it was a great while
before I came to my felf.
We work'd on, but the Water encreafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would found-
er, and tho* the Storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was not poflible flie could fwim till we might
run into a Port, fo the Mafler continued firing Guns
for Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft
a-Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us. It
was with the utmoft Hazard the Boat came near
us, but it was impoffible for us to get on Board,
or for the Boat to lye near the Ship Side, till at laft
the Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
Lives to fave ours, our Men caft them a Rope over
the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vereditout
a great Length, which they after great Labour and
Hazard took hold of, and we lia-ufd them clofe
under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was
to no Purpofe for them or us after we were in the
Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to-
wards Shore as much as we could, and our Matter
promifed them, That if the Boat was Itav'd upon
Shore he would make it good to their Mailer, fo
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went
iaway to the Norward, floaping towards the Shore
almoft as far as Winterton-Nefs.
We were not much more than a Quarter of an
Hour out of our Ship but we faw her fink, and
then I underftood for the firfl time what was meant
by a Ship foundering in the Sea; I muft acknow-
ledge
'edge I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Sea-
men told me fhe was finking; for from chat Mo-
ment they rather put me into the Boat than that I
might be faid to go in, my Heart was as it were
dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with
Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was
yet before me.
While we were in this Condition, the Men yet
labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the
Shore, we could fee, (when our Boat mounting the
Waves, we were able to fee the Shore,) a great
many People running along the Strand to affiit us
wheri wefliould come near, but we made but flow
Way cowards the Shore, nor were we able to reach
the Shore, till being pad the Light-Houfe at Win-
terton, the Shore falls off to the Weftward towards-
Cromer, and fo the Land broke off a little the Vio-
lence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
without much Difficulty, got all fafe on Shore, and
walk'd afterwards on Foot to Tartnouth, where, as
unfortunate Men, we were ufed with great Huma-
nity, as weil by the Magiftrates of the Town, who
affign'd us good Quarters, as by particular Mer-
chants and Owners of Ships, and had Money gi-
ved us fufficient to carry us either to London or back
to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the Senfe to have gone back to
Hulk and have gone Home, I had been happy, and
my Father, an Emblem of our blefled Saviour's Pa-
table, had even kiil'd the fatted Calf for me; for
hearing the Ship I went away in, was caft away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had
any Afliirance that I was not drown'd.
But my ill Fate pufh'd me on now with an Ob-
ilinacy that nothing could refift; and tho* I had fe-
deral times loud Galls from my Reafon and my
mope compofed Judgment to go home, yet I had
no
s
no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruiing Decree
that hurries us on to be the lnftrurpents of our own
Deftru&ion, even tho' it be before us, and that we
pufh upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no-
thing but fome fuch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impoffible for me to
efcape, could have pufh'd me forward againft the
calm Reafonings and Perfwafions of my moft re-
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In-
ftru&ions as I had met with in my firft Attempt.
My Comrade, who had helped to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Matter's Son, was now Iefs
forward than I; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town
to feveral Quarters; I fay, the firft time he faw me,
it appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and fhaking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Tryal, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concerned Tone, Toung Man,
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
to take this for a plain and vifible Token that you are
not to be a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir, faid I, will you
go to Sea no more? That is.another Cafe, faid he,
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage jot a Tryal,. you fee what a Tafte Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect ij you perfift ; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your Ace ount, like Jonah in the
Ship of Tarfhifh. Pray, continues he, what are you?
and on what Account did you go to Sea? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ; at the End of which he
burft out with a ftrange kind of Pafllon, What had
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch fhould
come into my Ship; I would not fet my Foot in
the
I 16 J
the fame Ship with thee again for a Thoufand
Pounds. This indeed was, as I faid, an Excursion
of his Spirits which were yet agitated by the Senfe
of his Lofs, and was farther than he could have
Authority to go. However he afterwards talk'd very
gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my Fa-
ther, and not tempt Providence to my Ruin; told
me I might fee a vifible Hand of Heaven againffc
me, And young Man, faid he, depend upon it, if you
do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with no-
thing but DiJafters and Difappointments, till your Fa-
ther s Words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted foon alter ; tor I made him little
Anfwer, and I faw him no more; which Way he
went, I know not. As for me, having fome Mo-
ney in my Pocket, I travelled to London by Land;
and there, as well as on the Road, had many Strug-
gles with my felf, what Courfe of Life I fhould take,
and whether I ftiould go Home, or go to Sea.
As to going Home, Shame oppofed the beft
Motions that offered to my Thoughts \ and it im-
mediately occur'd to me how I fhould be laugh"d
at among the Neighbours, and fhould be aftam'd
to fee, not my Father and Mother only, but even
every Body el(e; from whence I have fince often
obferv'd how incongruous and irrational the com-
mon Temper of Mankind is, efpecially of Youth,
to that Reafon which ought to guide them in fuch'
Cafes, viz*. That they are not afham'd to fin, and
yet are afham'd to repent; nor afham'd of the Afli- >
on for which they ought juftiy to be efteem'd Fools,
but are afham'd of the returning, which only can
make them be efteem'd wife Men.
In this State of Life however I remained fome
time, uncertain what Meaftires ro take, and what
Courfe of Life to lead. An irrefiftible Relu&ance
continual to going Home; and as I ftay'd a while,
the
r i7:
the Remembrance of the Diftrefs I had been in
Wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I
had in #iy Defires to a Return wore off with it>
till at laft I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it,
&hd look'd out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried me firft away
from my Father's Boufe, that hurried me into the
wild and indigefted Notion of railing my Fortune,-
and that imprefs'd thofe Conceits fo forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to ail good Advice, and
to the Entreaties, and even (the Command of my
Father: I fay the fame Influence, whatever it was,
preferited the moil: unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View; and I went on board a Veffel bound
to the Coaft of Africa; or as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Guiney.
It was my great Misfortune, that in a llthcfe
Adventures I did not ihip my felf as a Sailor;
Whereby, tho' I might indeed have worked a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
* learn'd the Duty and Office of a Fore-maft Man;
and in time might have qualified my felf for a
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Matter. But as
it was always my Fate to chufe for the worfe,
fo I did here;, for having Money in my Pocket,
and good Clothes upon my Back, I would always
go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman; and fo
I neither had any Bufinefs in the'Ship, or learn'd
to do any.
It was my Lot firft of all to fall into pretty good
Company in London, which does not always hap-
pen to fitch loofe and unguided young Fellows as 1
then was; the Devil generally hot omitting to lay
fome Snare for them very early: But k was not fo
with me; I firft fell acquainted with the Mafter of
a Ship who had been on the Coaft of Guiney; and
who having had very good Succefs there, Was re-'
*W I. * C folved
folved to go again ; and who taking a Fancy to my
Converfation, which was not at all difagreeable at
that time, hearing me fay I had a Mind to fee the
World, told me if I wou'd go the Voyage with
him, I fhould be at no Expence; I fhould be his
Mefs-Mate and his Companion, and if I could car-
ry any thing with me, I fhould have all the Ad-
vantage of it that the Trade would admit; and per-
haps I might meet with fome Encouragement. ^ ^
. 1 embrac'd the Offer, and entring into a ftrift
Friendfhip with this Captain, who was an honeft
and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a fmall Adventure with me, which
by the difinterefted Honefty of my Friend the Cap-
tain, I increafed very confiderably; for I carried
about 40 /. in fuch Toys and Trifles as the Cap-
tain direfted me to-buy. This 40 /. I had muftered
together by the Affiftance of fome of my Relations
whom I correfponded with, and who, I believe,
got my Father, or at leaft my Mother, to contri-
bute fo much as that to my firft Adventure.
This was the only Voyage which I may fay was
fuccefsful in all my Adventures, and which 1 owe
to the Integrity and Honefty of my Friend the
Captain, under whom alfo I got a competent
Knowledge of the Mathematicks and the Rules of
Navigation, learn'd how to keep an Account of the
Ship's Courfe, take an Obfervation; and, in fhorr,
to underftand fome things that were needful to be
underftood by a Sailor: For, as he took Delight to
introduce me, I took Pdight to learn; and, in a
Word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: For I brought HomeZ,. 5. 9 Ounces of
Gold Duft for my Adventure, which yielded me
in London at my Return, almoit 300/. and this fil-
led me with thofe afpiring Thoughts which have
fince fo compleated my Ruin.
Yet
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
too; particularly, that I yvas continually fick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive
Heat of the Climate; our principal Trading being
upon the Coaft. from the Latitude of 15 Degrees,
North even to the Line it felf.
I was now fet up for a Guiney Trader; and my
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying foon after
his Arrival, I refolved to go the fame Voyage
again, and I embark'd in the fame Veffel with one
who was his Mate in the former Voyage, and had
now got the Command of the Ship. This was the
unhappieft Voyage that ever Man made; for tho*
I did not carry quite 100 /. o£ my new gain'd
Wealth, fo that I had 200/. left, and which I
lodg'd with my Friend's Widow, who was very
juft to me, yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in
this Voyage; and the firft was this, viz,. Our Ship
making her Courfe towards the Canary Iflands, or
rather between thofe Iflands and the African Shore,
was furprized in the Grey of the Morning, by a
Turkijh Rover of Sattee, who gave Chafe to us with
all the Sail fhe could make. We crowded alfo as
much Canvak as our Yards would fpread, or our
Mafts carry, to have got clear; but finding the Pi-
rate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a few Hours, we prepaid to fight-, our
Ship having 12 Guns, and the Rogue 18. About
three in the Afternoon he came up with us, and
bringing to by Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter,
inftead of athwart our Stern, as he intended, we
brought 8 of our Guns to bear on that Side, and
pour'd in a Broadfide upon him, which made him
ftieer off again, after returning pur Fire, and pour-
ing in alfo his fmall Shot from near 200 Men which
he had on Board. However, we had npt a Man
touched, all our Men keeping ciofe. He prepared
C 2 to
[zo]
to attack us again, and we to defend our fclvesi
but laying us on Board the next time upon our ei-
ther Quarter, he entered do Men upon our Decks,
who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the
Decks and Rigging. We ply'd them with Small-
fliot, Half-Pikes, Powder-Chefby and fuci/like,
and clear'd our Deck of them twice. However,
to cut (hort this melancholy Part of our Story, our
Ship being difabled, and three of our Men kiil'd,
and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and
were carry'd all Prifoners into SaBee, a Port be-
longing to the Mocrs.
The Ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at
firft I apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun-
try to the Emperdr's Court, as the reft of our Men
were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover,
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his Bufinefs. At this
furprizing Change of my Circiimftances, from a
Merchant to a miferable Slave, I was perfe&ly o-
ver whelmed; and now I look'd back upon my
Father's prophetick Difcourfe to me, that I fhould
be miferable, and have none to relieve me, which
I thought was now fo effc&ually brought to pafs,
that I could not be worfe ,• that now the Hand of
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone
without Redemption. But alas? this was but a
Tafte of the Mifery I was to go thro", as will
appear in the Sequel of this Story.
As my new Patron or Mafter had taken me Home
to his Houfe, lb I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to Sea again, believ-
ing that it would fome time or other be his Fate
to be taken by a Sfaniflo or Portugal Man of War;
, and that then I fhould be fet at Liberty. But this
Hope of mine was foon taken away ,• for when he
went to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his
little
little Garden, and do the common Drudgery of
Slaves about his Houfe; and when he came home
again from his Cruife, he ordered me to Jye in the
Cabin to look after the Ship.,
Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape; and
what Method I might take to effect it, but found
no Way that had the leaft Probability in it: No-
thing prefented to make the Supposition of it rati-
onal; for I had no Body to communicate it to,
that would embark with me, no Fellow-Slave, no
Engli(lomany Infoman> or Scotfman there but my felf;
fo that for two Years, tho* I often pleated my (elf
with the Imagination, yet I never had the leaft
encouraging Profpeft of puttingiirjn Pra&ice.
After about two Years,an pdd Q'rcumftance pre-
fented it felf, which put the old Thought of ma-
king fome Attempt for my Liberty, again in my
Head: My Patron lying at Home longer than
ufual, without fitting out his -Snip, which, as I
heard, was for want of Money, he ufed conftantly,
once or twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the
Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace,
and go out into the Road a-fifliing; and as he al-
ways took me and a young Marfco with him to
row the Boat, we made him very, merry, and I
prov'd very dexterous in catching Fifli; infomuch
that Sometimes he would fend me with a Moor,
one of his,Kinfineo, and~the Youth the Marefco as
they call'd him, to catch a Difh of Fifh for him.
It happened one time, that going a-fifliing in a
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rote fo thick, that tho*
we were not half a League from the Shore,we loft
Sight of* it; and rowing we knew not whither or
which way, we laboured all Day,, and all the next
Night, and when the Morn "tig came we found we
had pull'd eff to Sea inflead of pulling in for the
£>hore j and that we were at leaft two Leagues from
C 3 the
t zz ]
the Shore: However we got well in again, tho*
with a great deal of Labour, and fome Danger;
for the Wind began to blow pretty frefh in the
Morning; but particularly we were all very hun-
gry.
But our Patron warn'd by this Difafter, refolved
to take more Care of himfelf for the future; and
having lying by him the long Boat of our Englifb
Ship we had taken, he refolved he would not go a
fifliing any more without a Compafs and fome
Provision; fo he ordered the Carpenter of his
Ship, who alfo was an Englift Slave, to build a
little State-room or Cabin in the middle of the
Long-boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to
ftand behind it to fleer and haul home the Main-
flieet; and Room before for a Hand or two to
ftand and work the Sails? She faii'd with that we
call a Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom
gib'd over the top of the Cabin, which lay very
thug and low, artd: had in it Room for him to lye,
with a Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, with
fome fmall Lockers to put in fome Bottles of fuch
Liquor as he thought fit to drink ,• particularly his
Bread, Rice and Coffee.
We were frequently out with this Boat a-fi{hing,
and as I was moft dextrous to catch Fi(h for him,
he never went without me. It happen'd that he
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleafure or for Fifh, with two or three Moors of
fome Diftin&ion in that Place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinary; and had therefore
fent on Board the Boat over Night, a larger Store
of Provifions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot,
which were on Board his Ship; for that they 4e-
fign'd fome Sport of Fowling as well as Fifliing.
I got all things ready as he had dire&ed, and
waited the next Morning with the Boat waflied
clean,
clean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his Gueits; when by and by
my Patron came on board alone, and told me his
Gucfts had put off going, upon fome Bufinefs that
fell out, and ordered me with the Man and Boy,
as ufual, to go out with the Beat and catch them
fome Fifli, for that his Friends were to fup attiis
Houfe'; and commanded,that *s (oon as I got fome
Fifli I fhould bring it home to his Houfe; all which
I prepared to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Delive-
rance darted into my Thoughts, for now I found I
was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and
my Matter being gone, I prepaid to furnifh my
felf, not for fitting Bufinels, but for a Voyage;
tho" I knew not, neither did I fo much as confider
whither I fhould fleer; for any where to get out
of that Place was my Way.
My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomethirg for our Sub-
fiftence on board; for 1 told him we muft not pre-
fume to eat of'our Patron's Bread; he faid, that,
was true; fo he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket of the.r kind, and three Jarrs with frefli
Water into the Boat; I knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the Make were taken out of (omeEnghfo Prize; and
I convey d them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore,, as if they had been there before, for our
Mailer: I convey *d alfo a great Lump of Bees-
Wax into the Boar , .which weighed above half a
Hundred Weight, wiih a Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards; efpe-
ciaily the Wax to make Candles. Another Trick
I tryV. upon him, which he innocently came into
alfo; his Name wasIfmael, whom they call M/y,
C 4 or
or Moky ; fo I call'd to him, Moley, faid I, our Fa
tron's Guns are on Board the Boat, can you nor
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may
kill feme Akamies (a Foul like our Culiem) for out
felves, for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in
the Ship? Yes, fays he, Til bring fomc, and accor-
dingly he brought a great feather Pouch which
held about a Pound and a half of Powder, or ra-
ther more; and another with Shot, that had five
or fix Pound, with fome Bullets, and put all into,
the Boat: At the fame time I had found fome
Powder of my Matter's in the great Cabin, with
which I fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Cafe,
Which was aim oft empty; pouring wh.at was in it
into another: And thus furniflied with every thing
needful, we fuil'd out of the Port to fifli: The Q-
ftle which is it the Entrance of the Port knew who
we were, an<(i took no Notice of us; and we were
not above a Mile out of the Port before we haul'd
in our Sail, and fet us down to fifli. The Wind
blew from the N, NE. which was contrary to my
Defire ,• for had it blown foutherly,I had been fure
to have made the Coaft of Spam, and at leaft reach-
ed to the Bay of Cadiz,; but my Refolutions were*
blow which way it would, I would be gone from
that horrid Pl^ce where I was, and leave the reft
to Fate.
After we had fifh'd fomc time,and catch'd nothing,
for when I had Fifli on my Hook, I would not pull
them up, that he might not fee them; I faid to the
lyioor, this will not do, our Mafter will not be
thus ferv'd, we mnft ftand farther off: He think-
ing no harm agreed, and being in the Head of the
Boat fet the Sails; and as I had the Helm, I run
the Boat out near a League farther, and then
brought her too as if I would fift, when giving
the Boy the Helm, I ftept forward to where the:
Mdoor was, and making as if J ftoopt for fome-
thing
.thing behind him, I took him by Surprize with my
Arm under h's Twift, and tofs'd him clear over
board into the Sea; he rofe immediately, for he
fwam like a Cork, and calTd to me, begg'd to be
taken in, told me, he would go ail over the World
with me; he fwam fo ftrong after the Eoat,that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being
but little Wind; upon which I ftept ci into the Cab-
bin, and fetching one of the Fowling Pieces, Ipre-
fented it at him, and told him, I had done him no
Hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would do him
none: But (aid I, youfwim wcl enough to reach
the Shore,and the Sea is calm, make the beft of your
Way to Shore, and I will do you no Harm; but if
you come near the,Boat, I'll fhoot you thro' the
Head; for lam r^folv'd to have my Liberty: So
he turn'dhimfelf about and fwam for the Shore,
;and I make no doubt but he reached it with Eafe,
for he was an excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to ha5 taken this Moor
with me, and ha' drown'd the Boy, buf there was no
venturing to truft him : When he was gone,I turn'd
to the Boy, who they calf d Xury, and faid to him,
Xury> if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you
a great Man, but if you will not ftroke your Face
Vo be true to me, that is, /wear by Mahomet and
jois Father's Beard, I mult throw you into the Sea
too; the Boy fmil'd in my Face, and fpokc fo in-
nocently, that I could not miftruft him; and fwore
to be faithful to me, and go all over the World with
me.
While I was in View of the Afwthat was fwim-
ming, I flood out direSly to Sea, with the Boat,
rather ilretching to Windward, that they might
think mc gone towards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any ore that had been in their Wits muft ha'beenfup-
pos'd to do) for who would ha' fuppos'd we were
fail'd
['*« J
fail'd on to the Southward to the truly Barbarian
Coaft, where whole Nations of Negroes were fure
tofurround us with thejr Canoes, and deftroy us;
where we could ne'er once go on Shore, but we
Ihould be devoured by favage Beafts, or more mer-
cilefs Savages of Human Kind.
But as foon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I
chang'd my Courfe, and fteer'd dire&ly South and
by Eaft, bendii g my Courfe a little toward the
Eaft, that I might keep in with the Shore; and ha-
ving a fair frefh Gale of Wind, and a fmooth quiet
Sea, I made fuch Sail, that I believe by the next
Day at Three a-Clock in the Afternoon, when I
firft made the Land, I could not be lefs than iyo
Miles South of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor
of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any other
King thereabouts, for we faw no People.
Yetfuch was the Fright I had ta|en at the Moors,
and the dreadful Apprehenfions I had of falling in-
to their Hands, that I would not flop, or go on
Shore, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continu-
ing fair, till I had fail'd in that Manner five Days:
And then the Wind fluffing to the Southward, I
concluded alfo that if any of our Veffels were in
Chafe of me, they alfo would now give over ,* (o
I ventured to make to the Coaft, and came to an
Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, I knew not
what, or where; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nation, or what River: I neither
faw, or defir'd to fee an v People, the principal thing
I wanted was frefh Water. We came into this
Creek in the Evening, refolving to fwim on Shore
as foon as it was dark, and difcover the Country;
but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch
dreadful Noifes of the Barking, Roaring, and*
Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what
Kinds, that the poor boy was ready to dw with
Fear,
[*7l
Fear, and begg'd of me to go on Shore till
Day; well Xury, faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as thofe Lions; then we maygive them the/hoot Gun,
fays Xury, laughing, make them run wey; fuch Englijh
A»ry fpoke by converging among us Slaves. Howe-
ver, I was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram, (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to chear him up: After all, Xurys Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropp'd our little An-
chor and lay ftill all Night; I fay ftill, for weflept
none; for in two or three Hours we faw vaft great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, came down to the Sea-fhore, and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and wafting themfelves
for the Pleafure of cooling themfelves; and they
made fuch hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was
I too: but we were both more frighted, when we
heard one of the mighty Creatures come fwim-
ming towards our Boat; we could not fee him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
flrous huge and furious Beafl; Xury faid it was a
Lion, and it might be fo for ought I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and
row away; no, fays I, Xury, we can flip our Cable
with a Buoy to it and go to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no fooner faid fo, but I per-
ceived the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomethingfurpriz'd me; how-
ever I immediately ftept to the Cabin-dcor, and
taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which he im-
mediately turn'd about, and fwam towards the
Shore again.
But it was impoffible to defcribe the horrible Noi-
fes, and hideous Cries and Howlings, that were
raifed
r^iifed as well upon the Edge of the Shore, as high-
er within the Country, upon the Noife or Re-
port of a Gun, a thing I have fome Reafon to
believe thofe Creatures had never heard before.
This convinced me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the Night upon that Coaft, and
how-to venture on Shore in the Day, was another
Queftion too; for to have fallen into the Hands
ot any of the Savages,, had been as bad as to
have fallen into.the Hands of Lions and Ty-
gers; at lead we were equally apprehenfive of the
Danger of it, '. , .
Be that as it would, we were obl/g'd to go on
Shore fomewherc or other tor Water, for. we had
not aPint left in theBoat; when or where to get to
ic was the Point: ,Xury faid, if I would let him go
on Shore with one of the Jarrs, he would find if
there was any Water, and bring fome to me. I
ask'dhim why he would go? Why I fliould not go
andheftayin the Boat? The Boy anfwer'd with
fo much AfFeftion, that made me love him ever
after. Says he, It wild Mans come•, they eat me, you
goivey. Well, Xury, faid I, we will both go, and
if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they
fliall eat neither of us; fo I gave Xury a Piece of
Rusk-bread to eat, and a Dram out of our Pa-
tron's Cafe of Bottles which I mentioned before;
and we haul'd the Boat in as near the Shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on Shore ,• car-
rying nothing but our Arms, and two Jarrs for
Water. ,  .
I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat,
fearing the coming of Canoes with Savages
down the River: But the Boy feeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country, rambled to it, and
by and by 1 faw him come running towards me;
I thought he was purfued by fome Savage* or
frighted
[ 19]
frighted with fome wild Beaft, and I run forward
rowards him to help him, but when I came nearer
to him, I faw fomething hanging over his Shoul-
ders, which wasa Creature that he had flior, like a
Hare, but different in Colour, and longer Legs;
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat; but the great Joy that poor Xury
came with, was to tell me he had found good Wa-
ter, and feen no wild Mans. •
But he found afterwards that we need not take
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we were, we found the Water frefli
when the Tide was out, which flows but a little
way up ; fo we filled our Jarrs and feafted on the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, 'having feen no Foot-fteps of any human
Creature in 'that part. of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
knew very well that the.Iilands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd Iilands alfo, lay not far off
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exactly know, or at leaft to re-
member what Latitude they were in j I knew not
where to look for them, or when toftandoff to Sea
towards them; otherwife I might now eafily have
found fome of thefe Iilands. But mv Hope was,
that if I flood along this Coaft till I came to that
Part where the Engtrijh traded, I fhould find fome of
their Veffels upon their ufual Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.
By the beft of my Calculation, that Place where
I now was, muft be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
Negroes, lies waft and uninhabited, except by wild
Beafts; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther South for fear of the Moors ',- and the Moors
not
f 30]
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by Reafon of its
Barrennefs; and indeed both forfaking it becaufe
of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers, Lyons,
Leopards, and other furious Creatures which har-
bour there; fo that the Moors ufe it for their Hun-
ting only, where they go like an Army, two or three
thoufand Men at a time; and indeed for near an
hundred Miles together upon this Coaft, we faw
nothing but a waft uninhabited Country, by Day;
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of
wild Bcafts, by Night.
Once or twice in the Day time, I thought I faw
the Pico of 1'eneriffe, being the high top of the
Mountain Tenerife in the Canaries; and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary Winds, the Sea alfo going too high for my
little Vefifel, fo I refold to purfuemy firft Defign
and keep along the Shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for frefh Wa-
ter, after we had left this Place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the Morning, we came to
an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was
pretty high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we
lay ftill to go farther in; Xury> whofe Eyes were
more about him thank feems mine were, calls foft-
ly to me, and tells me that we had beft go farther
off the Shore; for, fays he, look yonder lies a
dreadful Monftcr on the Side of that Hillock faft
afleep: I looked where he pointed, and faw a
dreadful Monfter indeed, for it was a terrible great
Lion that lay on the Side of the Shore, under the
Shade of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were a
little over him, Xury> fays I, you (hall go on Shore
and kill him; Xury look'd frighted, and faid,
Me kill I he eat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he
meant i however, I faid no more to the Boy, but
bad
C 3i 3
bad him ftill, and I took our biggeft Gun,
which was almoftMusket-boer, and loaded it with
a good Charge of Powder, and with two Slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pie-
ces, I loaded with five fmalier Bullets. I took the
beft Aim I could with the firft Piece to have fhot
him into the Head, but he lay fo with his Leg
rais'd a little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hit
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He
ftarted up growling at firft, but findinghisLeg broke
tell down again, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heard;
I was a little furpnYd that I had not hit him on
the Head; however, I took up the fecondPiece im-
mediately, and tho* he began to move off, fir'd a-
gain, and fhot him into the Head, and'had the
Pleafure to fee him drop,and make but little Noife
but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury took Heart'
and would have me let him go oh Shore: Well eo
faid I: So the Boy jumped into the Water, and ta-
king a little Gun in one Hand, fwam to Shore with
the other Hand, and coming clofe to the Creature
put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and fhot
him into the Head again, which difpatch'd him
quite. IU
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no
Food andl was very forry tolofc three Chaises of
Powder and Shot upon a Creature that waseood
for nothing to us. However, Xury faid hc ^uld
have fome of him; fo he comes on board and ask'd
me to give him the Hatchet; f6r what/Xury faid
I ? Me cut off his Head, faid he. Howev2 Xury
could not cut oft his Head, but he cut off a Foot
and brought it witl? him, and it was a monftrous
great one. UM*
I be-
I bethought my felf however, that perhaps the
Skirl of him might one way or other be of fome
Value to us; and I refolved to take offhis Skin if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him;
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for I
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both
the whole Day, but at laft we got off the Hide of
him* and fpreading it on the top of our Cabin,
the Sun effe&ually dried it in two Days time,, and
it afterwards ferv'd me to lye upon.
After this Stop we made on to the Southward
continually for ten or twelve Days, living very
fparing on our Proviiions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftner in to the1 Shore than
we were oblig'd to for frefh Water. My Defign in
this was to make the River Gambia ox Senegall, that
is to fay, any where about the Cape de Verd, where
I was in hopes to meet with fome European Ship,
and if I did not, I knew not what Courfe I had to
take, but to feek for the I/Jands, or perifh there a-
mong the Negroes. I knew that all the Ships from
Europe, which failed either to the Boaft of Guiney,
or to Brajil, or to the Eafl Indies, made this Cape,
or thofe Iflands; and in a word, I-put the whole
of my Fortune upon this fingle Point, either that I
muft meet with fome Ship, or muft perifh.
When I had purfued this Refolution about ten
Days longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that
the Land was inhabited, and in two or three Places
as we failed by, we faw People ftand upon the
Shore to look at us; we could alfo perceive they
were quite black and ftark naked* I was once
inclined to have gone on Shore to them; but Xury.
was my better Counfellor, and faid to me, no go,
mgo\ however I haul'd in nearer the Shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they run along
the Shore by me a good Way. Lobferv'd they had
no
C3J]
no Weapons in their Hands, except one* who had a
long {lender Stick, which Xury laid was a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
good Aim; (o I kept at a diftance, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could, and particularly
made Signs for fomcthing to eat; they beckon'd to
me to flop my Boat> and they would fetch me
fome Meat; upon this I lowered the Top of my
. Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country* and in lefs than half an Hour came back
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefh,
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their
Country; but we neither knew what the one or the
other was, however we were willing to accept it;
But how to come at it was our next Difpute, for
I was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much afraid of us, but they took a fafe
Way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore
and laid it down, and went and flood a great
way off till we fetched it on Board, and then came
clofe to us again*
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an Opportu-*
nity ofter'd that very Inftant to oblige them won^-
derfuliy; for while we were lying by the Shore*
came two mighty Creatures, one purfuing the othet
(as we took it) with greatFury from the Mountains
towards the Sea ; whether it was theMale purfuing
theFemale,or whether they were inSport or in Rage
we could not tell, any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or ftrange,but I believe it was the
latter; becaufe in the firft Place, thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night* and in
the fecond Place* we found the People terribly
frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that
had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them,
but the reft didi however, as the two Creatures
Part I. D ran
ran dire&ly into the Water, they did not feem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plung'd
themfelves into the Sea, and fwam about as if
they had come for their Diverfion; atlaftoneof
them began to come nearer our Boat than at firft I
expe&ed, but I ;ay ready for him, for I had load-
ed my Gun with all poffible Expedition, and bad
Xury load both the other; as foon as he came fair-
ly within my Reach 1 fir'd, and (hot him dire&ly
into the Head; immediately, he funk down into
the Water, but rofe inftantly and plung'd up and
down as it he was ftruggling for Life5 and fo in-
deed he was 3 he immediately made to the Shore,
but between the Wound, which was his mortal
Hurt, and the ftrangling of the Water, he died juft
before he reach'd the bhore.
It is impoffible to expfefs the Aftonifliment of
thefe poor Creatures at the Noife and the Fire of
my Gun, fome of them were even ready to die for
Fear, and fell down as dead with the very Ter-
ror. But when they faw the Creature dead, and
funk in the Water, and that I made Signs to them
to come to the Shore, they took Heart and came
to the Shore, and began to fearch for the Creature.
I found him by his Blood ftaining the Water, and
by the Help of a Rope, which I flung round him,
and gave the Negroes to haul; they dragg'd him
on Shore, and found that it wasa moft curious
Leopard, fpotted and fine to an admirable Degree,
and the Negroes held up their Hands with Admira-
tion to think tvhat it was I had kill'd him with.
The other Creature, frighted with the Flafli of
Fire and the Noife of the Gun, fwam on Shore,
and ran up direftly to the Mountains, from whence
they come, nor could I at that Diftance know
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the Flefhof this-Creature, fo I was wil-
ling
ling to have them take it as a Favour from me3
Which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankfuJ for. Immediate-
ly they fell ro work with him, and tho' they had
no Knife, yet with a fharpen'd Piece of Wood they
took off his Skin as readily, and much more readily
than we could have done with a Knife; they offered
me fome ot the Flefh, which I declinVi, making as
if I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin*
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho' I did
not underftand, yet I accepted,- then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my
Jars to them, turning it Bottom upward, to fliew
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled; they call'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Veffel made of Earth, and burnt as I fup-
pofe in the Sun ,• this they kt down for me, as be-
fore, and I knvXury on Shore with my Jars, and
filled them all three. The Women were as ftark
naked as the Men.
I was now furnifli'd With Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne-
groes, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I faw
the Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at
about the Diftanee of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
Offing to make this Point; at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward $
then I concluded, as it was mod certain indeed,
that this was the Cape de Verd, and thofe the
Iflandsy called from thence Cape de Verd I/lands.
However, they were at a great Diftanee, and I
could not. well tell what I h^d beft to do; for if I
D t ihould
fhould be taken with a Frcfli of Wind, I might nei-
ther reach one or other.
In this Dilemma, as I was very penfive. I ftept
into the Cabin, and fat me down, Xury having
the Helm, when on a fudden the Boy cry'd out
Mafter Mafier, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolifh
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it muft
needs be fome of his Matter's Ships fent to pur-
ine us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough
out of their Reach. I jump'd out of the Cabin,
and immediately faw not only the Ship, and what
fiie was, {viz,.) that it was a Portugueje Ship, and,
as I thought, was bound to the Coaft of Guiney for
Neg.oes: But when I obferv'd the Courfe the
fteer'd, I was foon convinc'd they were bound
fome other way, and did not defign to come any
Hearer to the Shore ; upon which I ftretch'd out to
Sea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if poflible.
With all the Sail I could make I found I fhould
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
would be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the utmoft,
and began to defpair, they it feems faw me by the.
help of their Perfpedtive-Glailes, and that it was
fome European Boat, which they fuppofed muft
belong to fome Ship that was loft; to they fliortned
Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my Patron's Antient on Board, I
made a Waft of it to them for a Signal of Di-
ftrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw, for
they told me they faw the Smoke, tho* they did
not hear the Gun; upon thefe Signals they.^very
kindly brought to, and lay by for me} and in Zr
bout^hree Hours time I came up with them.
They ask'd me what I was, mPMuguefe, and in
Spam lb, and in French, but I underftood none of
* them;
them; but at laft a Scots Sailor who was on board,
caird to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I
was an Englifh Man, that I had made my Efcape
out of Slavery from the Moors at Sallee\ then they
bad me come on board, and very kindly took me
in, and all my Goods.
It was an inexpreffible Joy to me, that any one
will believe,that I was thusdelivcr'd5asl efteem'd
it, from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs; Con-
dition as I was in, and I immediately offer'd all I
had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Keturn for
my Deliverance; but he generoufly told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had
fhould be deliver'd iafe Co me when I came to the
Brajils; for, fays he, I have fav'd your Life on no o-
ther "Terms than I would be glad to be faved myfelf and
it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the
fame Condition; be/ides, faid he, when I carry you to
the Brafils, fo great a way from your own Country, if I
foould take from you what you have, you will be flawed
there, and then I only take away that Life I have given.
Noj no, Seignior Inglefe, fays he, Mr. Englishman,
1 zvill carry you thither in Charity, and thofe Things will
help you to buy your Subfiflence there, and your Paffage
home again.
As he was charitable in this PropofaJ, fo he was
juft in the Performance to a Tittle, for he ordered
the Seamen, that none fhoiild offer to touch any
Thing I had* then he took every Thing into his
own Poffeflion, and gave me back an exaft Inven-
tory cfathem, that I might have them, even fo
much as my three Earthen Jarrs.
As to my Boat, it was a very good one, and
that he (aw, and told me he would buy ic of me
for the Ship'sUfe^and ask'd me what I would have
for it i 1 told him he had been fo generous to m?
in every Thing, that 1 could not offer to make
P 3 any
ny Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him
upon which he told me he would give me a Note
of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it
at Brajil, and when it came there, if any one of-
fered to give more he would make it up; he offer'd
mealfo 60 Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury,
which I was loath to take, not that I was not wil-
ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to fell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had affi-
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever, when 1 let him know my Reafon, he own'd
it to be juft, ^tnd offered me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free
in 10 Years, if he turn'd Christian •>« upon this5
and Xury faying he was willing to go to hik), I let
the Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brafih^ and
arriv'd in the Bay de cfodos los Santos > or All-Saints-*
Bay, in about 22 Days after. And now I was
once more deliver'd from the moft miferable of
all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with
myfelf, I was now to corihder.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me ,
I can never enough remember \ he would take no-
thing of me for my Paflage, gave me 20 Ducats
fpr the Leopard's Skin, and 40 for the Lion's Skin
which I had in the Boat, and caufed every Thing
I had in the Ship to be pun£tually delivery me,
and what I was willing to fell he bought i fuch as
the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Gum, arid a Piece
of the Lump of Bees-wax, for 1 had made Can-
dles of the reft*, in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my "Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Brafilo?
1 had not been long here, but* being recommen-
ded to the Houfe of a good honeft Man likehjm-
felf, who had ap hgeino as they call it? that is, a
Plantation and aSugar-Houfe, I hv'd with him
fome time, and acquainted myfelf by thar Means
with the Manner of*their Planting and making of
Sugar, and feeing how well the Planters hv'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, Lrefolv'd, if I could
get Licence to fettle there, I would turn Planter a~
mong them, refolving in the mean time to find out
fome Way to get my Money which 1 had left in Lon-
don remitted to me. To thb Purpofe getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalisation^ 1 purchafed as much
Land that was Uncur'd, as myMoney would reach,
and form'daPlan for my Plantation andSettlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitabie to the Stock
which 1 propos'dto myfelf to receiveixomEngland-
1 had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whole Name was Wells^
and in much fuch Circumfhnces as I was. I call
him Neighbour, becaufes his Plantation lay next
to mine, and we went on very fociably together*
My Stock was but low as well as his > and we ra-
ther planted for Food, than any thing eife, for a-
bout two Years, However, we began to increafe,
and our Land began to come into Order-, fo that
the third Year we planted fome Tobacco^ and
made each of us a large Piece of Ground ready for
planting Canes in the Year to come \ but we both
wanted Help \ and now 1 found more-than before?
1 had done wrong in parting with my Boy Xurym
But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great Wonder : 1 had no Remedy but to go
on: I was gotten intoanEmploymentquiteremote
to mv Genius, and dire&ly contrary to the Life I
delighted inland for which 1 foifook my Father^
Houiej and broke thro' all his good Advice ^ nay5
I w;«s coming into the very middleStation, or up-
per Degree of low Life, which my Father advifed
mc to beforei and which, if 1 refolv'd to go on
D + with
with, I might as well ha' ftaid at home, and nevet?
have fatigu'd my felf in the World as I have done;
and I ufed oitqn to fay to my felf, I could ha* done
this as well in England among my Friends, as ha'
gone jooo Miles off to do it among Strangers and
Savages in a Wildernefs, and1 at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the leaft Knowledge of me.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my Condition
with the utmoft Regret. I had no Body to converfe
with, but now and then this Neighbour; no Work
to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands; and
I ufed to fay, I liv'd juft like a Man caft away up-'
en fome defolateIfland,that had no Body there but
himfelf. But how juft has it been, and how fhould
all Men refleft, that, when they compare their pre-
sent Conditions with others that are worfe,Heaven
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be
convinced of their former Felicity, by their Experi-
ence : I fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli-
tary Life I refle&ed on in an Ifland of meer Defo-
lation fhould be my Lot, who had fo often unjnft-
ly compard it with the Life which I then led, in
which had I continued, I had in all Probability
been exceeding profperous and rich.
I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Ship, that took me up at Sea^
went back,' for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage
near three Months, when telling him what little
Stock I had left behind me in London^ he gave me
this friendly and fincere Advice, Seignior Inglefe^fays
he, for fo he always call xi me, if you will give me
Letters, and a Procuration here' in Form to lire,
with Orders to the Perfon who has your Money in
f,ovdott, to fend your Efte&s to JJshon> to fuch Per**
fpn$
un
fons as I fiiall direft, and in fuch Goods as are pro-
per for this Country, I will bring you the Produce
of thqm, God willing, at ray Return; but fince
human Affairs are all fubjetft to Changes and Dif-
fafters, I would have you give Orders but for 100 /.
SterL which you fay is half-your Stock, and let
the Hazard be run for the firft; fo that if it come
fafe, you may order the reft the fame Way; and
if it mifcarry, you may have the other Half to
have Recoutfe to for your Supply.
This was fo wholeforne Advice, and lookM fo
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the beft Courfe I could take; fo I accordingly pre-
pared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I
had left my Money, and a Procuration to the for-
tuguefe Captain, as he defired.
I wrote the Englifh Captain's Widow a full Ac-*
count of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape,
and how I had met with the Portugal Captain at
Sea, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what
Condition I was now in, with all other neceffary
Dire&ions for my Supply -, and when this honeft
Captain came to Lisbon, he found means by fome of
the. Englijlo Merchants there, to fend over not the
Order only, but a full Account of my Story to a
Merchant at London, who reprefented it effectual-
ly to her; whereupon, fhe not only delivered the
Money, but out of her own Pocket fent the Por-
tugal Captain a very handfom Prefent for his Hu-
manity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London veiled this ioo/. in
Englijh Goods, fuch as the Captain had writ for,
fent them dire&ly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them all fafe to me to the Brajils, among which,
without my Direftion (for I was too young in my
Bufinefs to think of them) he had taken Care to
have all forts of Tools, Iron-work, and Uten-
fils
fils neceffary for my Plantation, and which were
of great life to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my For-
tune made, for I was furpriz'd with Joy of it; and
my good Steward the Captain had laid out the 5 /.
which my Friend had fent him for a Prefent for
himfclf, to purchafe. and bring me over a Servant
under Bond fou fix Years Service, and would not
accept of any Confederation., except a little To-
bacco, which I would .have him accept, being of
my own Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all
Englifh Manufactures, fuch asCloath, Stuff, Bays,
and Things particularly valuable and defirable in
the Country, J found means to fell them to a very
great Advantage; fo that 1 may fay, I had- more
than four times the Value of my firft Cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour,!
mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for
the firft Thing I did, I bought me a Negroe Slave,
and an European Servant alfo •, 1 mean another be-
fides that which the Captain brought me from
Lisbon,
But as abus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greatcft Adverfity, (o was it
with me. I went on the next Year with great Suc-
cefs in my Plantation: I raifed 50 great Rolls of
Tobacco on my own Ground, more than I had
difpofed of for NeceflTaries among my Neighbours«,
and thefe 50 Rolls being each of above a joq Wt.
were well cur'd and laid by againft the Return of
the Fleer from Lisbon: And now increasing in Bu-
finefsand in Wealth, mv Head began to be full
of Proje£ts and Undertakings beyond my Reach;
fuch as are indeed often the Ruin of the beft
Heads in Bufineft.
Had
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy T hings to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father fd earneftly recom*
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had
fo fenfibly defcribed the middJe Station of Lite to
be full of* but other Things attended me, and I
was ft ill to be the wilful Agent of all my own
Miferies; and particularly to encreafe my Fault,
and double the Reflections upon myfeif, which in
my future Sorrows 1 fhould have Leifure to make,
all thefe Mifcarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obftinate adhering to my foolifti Inclination of
wandring abroad, and purfuing that Inclination,
in Contradi&ion to the cleareftViews of doing my
felf good in a fair and plain Purfuic of thofe Pro-
fpefts and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to prefent me with,
and to make my Duty,
As I had once done thus in breaking away from
my Parents, fol could not be content now, but I
muftgo and leave the happy View 1 had of being
a rich and a thriving Man in my new Plantation,
only topurfuea rafh and immoderate Defire of
rifing fafter than the Nature of the Thing admit-
ted i and thus 1 caft my fe!f down again into the
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery that ever Man
fell into, or perhaps could be confiftent with Life
and a State of Health in the World.
To come then by juft Degrees, to the Particu-
lars of this Part of my Story •, you may fuppofe,
that having now lived almoft four Years in the
Brafilo, and beginning to thrive and profper very
well upon my Plantation, I had not only Jearn'd
the Language, but had contra6ted Acquaintance
and Friend (hip among my Fellow-Planters, as well
as among the Merchants at St. Salvadore^ which
Was our Port \ apd that in my Difcourfe among
them,
them, I had frequently given them an Account of
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guiney, the man-
ner of Trading with the Negroes there, and how
eafy it was to purchale upon the Coaft, for Tri-
fles; fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciflars, Hat-
chets, Bits of Glafs, and the like*, not only Gold
Duft, Guiney Grains, Elephants Teeth, &c. but
Negroes for the Service of the Brafils, in great
Numbers,
TThey liftened always very attentively to my
Difcourfes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that
Part which related to the buying Negroes, which
was a Trade at that time not only not far entred
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by
the Affiento's, or Permiflion of the Kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Pliblick, fo that
few Negroes were bought, and thofe exceffive
dear.
It happen'd, being in Company with fomeMer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of thofe Things very earneftly, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me
they had been mufing very much upon what I had
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night,and they
came to make a fecret Propofal to me *, and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me that they had
a mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guiney, that
they had all Plantations $s well as I, and were
ftraitned for tfothing (o much as Servants , that as
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be-
caufe they could not ptiblickly fell the Negroes'
when they came home, (o they defired to
majce but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on
Shore privately, and divide them among their
own Plantations? andin a Word, the Qtieftion
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft
of
of Guwey ? And they offered me that I fhould have
my equal Share of the Negroes, without providing
any Pare of the Stock.
This was a fair Propofal, it muft be confefs'd,
had it been made to any one that had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair Way of coming to be very*
considerable, and with a good Stock upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and eflablifh'd, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the
other ioo /.from England, and who in that Time,
and with that little Addition, could fcarce have
failed of being worth 3 or 4000 /. Sterling, and
that encreating too; for me to think of fuch a Voy-
age, was the moft prepofterous Thing that ever
Man in fuch Circumftances could be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Deftroyer,
conld no more relift the Offer than I could reftrain
my firft rambling Defigns, when my Father's good
Counfel was loft upon me. In a Word, I told
them I would go with all my Heart, if they
would undertake to look after my Plantation in
my Abfence, and would difpoie of it to fuch as I
fliould direft if I mifcarned. This they all en-
gaged to do, and entered into Writings or Cove-
nants to do fo; and I made a formal Will, diipo-
fing of my Plantation and Effefis, in Cafe of my
Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had
fav'd my Life, as before, my umverfal Heir, but
obliging him to difpofe of my Etfefts as I had direft-
ed in my Will, one naif of tne Produce being to him-
felt, and the other to be fhipp'd to England,
In fliort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve
my Effe&s, and to keep dip my Plantation; had I u-
fed half as much Prudence to have looked into my
own
own Intereft, and have made a Judgment of what
luoght to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from fo profperous an
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a
thriving Circumftance,and gone upon a Voyage to
Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; to fay
nothing of the Reafons I had to exped particular
Misfortunes to my felf.
But I was hurry'd on, and obey'd blindly the
Didtates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon : And
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Car-
go fumifli'd, and all Things done as by Agreement*
by my Partners in the Voyage, ,1 went on board
in an evil Hour again, the iJt. of Sept. 1659, be-
ing the fame Day eight Years that I went from my
Father and Mother at Hull, in order to aft the
Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own
Intereft.
Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
6 Guns, and 14 Men> beiides theMafter, his Boy,
and my felf > we had on board no large Cargo of
Goods, except of fuch Toys as were fit for our
Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads, Bits of
Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecialiy little
Looking-Glaffes, Knives, Sciffars, Hatchets, and
the like.
The fame Day I went on board We fet Sail,
ftanding away to the Northward upon our own
Coaft, with Defign to ftretch oyer for the African
Coaft. When they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of
Northern Latkude, which it feems was the Man-
ner of their Courfe in thofe Days, we had very
good Weather, only cxceffive hot, all the Way up-
on our own Coaft, till we came to the Height of
Cape St. Auguftino, from whence keeping farther otf
at Sea, we loft Sight of Land, and fteer'd as if we
were bound for the Ifle Fernandde Noronha, holding
our Courfe N. E. by N. and leaving thofe Ifles
on the Eaft; in this Courfe we paft the Line in
about 12 Days Time, and were by our laft Obfer-
vation in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude,
'when a violent Toumado or Hurricane took us quite
out of our Knowledge; it began from the South-
Eaft, came about to the North-Weft, and then
. fettled into the NorthrEaft, from whence it blew
in fuch a terrible manner, that for 12 Days toge-
ther we could do nothing but drive, and fcudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate
and the Fury of the Winds direded; and during
thefe 12 Days, I need not fay, that 1 expefted
every Day to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any
in the Ship expedt to fave their Lives.
In this Diilrefs we had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men died of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wafh'd over-board. A-
bout the 12th Day the Weather abating a little,
the Matter made an Obfervation as well as he
could, apd found that he was in about n Degrees
North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees of
Longitude Difference Weft from Cape St.Augufiino>
fo that he found he was gotten upon the Coaft of
Guiana, or the North Part of Brajil, beyond the
River Ama&ones'j toward that of the River Oroono-
que, commonly called the Great Rivery and began
to confult with me what Courfe he fhouJd take,
for the Ship was leaky, and very much dHabied,
and he was going dire&ly back to the .Coaft of
BraftL
, I was pofitively againft that, and looking oyer
the Charts of the Sea Coaft of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have Recourfe to, till we came within the
Circle of the Cai i;£>ec I/lands> and therefore refolved
to ftand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off
at
at Sea, to avoid the Indraught of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eaiily perform, as we hoped,
in about fifteen Day? Sail, whereas we could not
poffibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Africa
without fome Affiftance both to^our Ship and to
our felves.
With this Defign we chang'd our Gourfe, and
fteer'd away N. W. by W. in order to reach fome
of our Englijh Iflands, where! hoped for Relief:
but our Voyage was otherwife determined, for
being in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a fe-*
cond Storm came upon us, which carry'd us away
with the fame Impetuofity Wefiward, and drove
us fo out of the very Way of all human Com-
merce, that had all our Lives been faved>, as to
the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de-
voured by Savages than ever returning to out
own Country.
In this Diftrefs, the Wind Ml blowing very
hard, one of our Men, early in the Morning, cry'd
out, Land; and we had no fooner run out of the
Cabin to look out, in hopes of feeing where-
abouts in the World we were, but the Ship ftruck
upon a Sand, and in a Moment her Motion being
fo ftopp'd, the Sea broke over her in fuch rman*
ner, that we expe&ed we fhould all have perifh'd
immediately, and we were immediately driven
into our clofe Quarters, to flielter us fromthe very
Foam and Sprye of the Sea. - i _. •
It is not eafy for any one, who has not Jt>een
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive vthg
Confirmation of Men in fuch Circumftances j we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what tIfand
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland or;the
Main* whjether inhabited or not inhabited; and
as the Rage of the Wind was JJill great,. t;hof ra-
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as
hope
h;ope to have the Ship hold many Minutes with-
out .breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a Kind
bf Mirade ftiould turn immediately about. In a
Word, we fat looking one upon another, and ex-
. pefitng Death every Moment, and every Man aft-
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World,
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this; that which was our prefent Comfort, and
all the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to out
Expeftation the Ship did not break yet, and that
the Mafterfaid the Wind began to abate.
Now tho* We thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus ftruck upon the
Sand, and flicking too faft for us to expeft her get-
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of faving our
Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat at our
Stern, juft before the Storm, but (he wasfirfl ftav'd
by dafliing againft the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place ftie broke away, and either funk or
was driven off to Sea, fo there was no Hope from
her; we had another Boat on board, but how to
get her off into the Sea, was a doubtful Thing;
however, there was no Room to debate, for we
fancy'd the Ship would break in Pieces every Mi-
nute, and fome told us flie was a&ually broken al-
ready.
In this Diftrefs, the Mate of our Veflel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the Help of the reft of the
Men, they got her flung over the ShipVfide, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our
felves being Elevejj in Number, to God's Mercy,
and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high upon
the Shore, and might well be callM Den wild Zee,
as the Dutch call tjje Sea in a Storm.
Part I. E And
And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed; fof
weall faw plainly, that the Sea went fo high^that
the Boat could not live, and that we fhould be ine-
vitably drowned. As to making Sail> we had none,
notyf we had,eould we have done any Thing with
it; To we work'd-at the Oar towards the Land*
tt)o' with heavy Hearts3likeMen going to Executi-
on ; for we all knew^that when the Boat came near-
er the Shore, the wquld be dalh'd in a thoufand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, we
committed our Souls to God in the moft earneft
Manfc^ and the Wind driving us towards the
Shore^ yfc haften'd our Deftru&ion with our own
Hand^ pulling as well as wecoold towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
\yhether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only
Hope that couid rationally give us the leaft Shadow
of Expe£tation5 was, if we might happen into fome
Bay or Gulph3or the Mouth offeree River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in5or
got under the Lee qf the Land, and perhaps made
fjrjobth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peared •, but as we made nearer and nearer the
$hore,the Laud look'd more frightful than the Sea.
J After we had row'd, or rathcrrdriven about a
1 eague ^nd a Half,/as We reckon'4 it, a. raging
Wave, Mountaih:like, came rowling a-fterh of
US) and plainly bad usexpeft the Coup-de*Grace. In
a word) iuook us with fuch a Fuijry^ that it over-
fet the Boat at once>land feparating' us as well
from the Boat, as from one another; gave us not
tlpoic hardly to fay3 O God! for we were all fwal-
Towed up in a Moment.
Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought
which I felt when 1 (unk into the Water; for tho* I
fwam verywell^yetl could not deliver pay felffroqi
the Waves fo as to draw Breath, till that W^ve
having
having driven me,or rather carried me a vaft Way
on towards the Shore, and having (pent itfelf, went
back, and left me upon the Land aloioft dry, but
half dead with the Water 1 took in. I had fo much
Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that feeing
myfelf nearer the main Land than I expe&ed, I goc
. upon my feet, #nd endeavoured to make on to-
wards the Land as faft as I could, before another
Wave fhould return, and take me up again. But I
foon found it was impoffible to avoid it; for I faw
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, aqd
as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or
Strength to contend with-, my Bufinefs was to hold
my Breath, and raife myfelf upon the Water, if I
could: And foby fwimming to preferve my Breath-
ing, and Pilot myfelf towards the Shore, ifpoffi-
ble; my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea,
as it would carry me a great Way towards the
Shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it when it gave back towards the Sea.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body; an,d I
could feel myfelf carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a very greac Way; but
1 held my Breath, and aflifted myfelf to fwim ftill
forward with all my Might. I was ready to burft
with holding my Breath, when, as 1 felt myfelf
rifing up, fo to my immediate Relief, I found my
Head a^d Hands (hoot out above the Surface of the
Water •, and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time
that I could keep myfelf fo, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with Water a good while, but not
fo long but I held it out \ and finding the Water
had fpent itifelf, and began to return, 1 ftruck for-
ward apnft the Return of the Waves, and felt
Groundfagain with my Feet. 1 flood ftill a few
]E 2 Moments
Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
uent from mc,and then took to my Heels,and run
with whatStrcrigth I had farther towards theShore.
But neither would thisdeliver me from the Fury pf
the Sea, which came pouring in after me again,
and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves, and
carried forwards as bcforc,the bhore being very flat.
The laft Time of thefetwo had well near been
fatal to me •, for the Sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dafh'd me againft a
Piece of a Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it
left me fen fiefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Breaft, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my
Body ^ and had it returned again immediately, I
nuift have been ilranglcd in the Water; but I re-
covered a little before the Return of the Waves,
and feeing I fliould be cover'd again with the
Water, 1 refolv'd to hold faft by a Piece of the
Rock, and fo ro hold my Breath, if poflible, till
the Wave went back; now as the Waves were not
fo high as at firft, being near Land, 1 held my
Hold tiLthe Wave abated, and then fetch'd ano-
ther Run, which brought me fo near the Shore,
that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did
not lo fwalloW me up as to caLry me away, and
the next Run I took, I got to the main Land,
where, tp my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the
Cliffs of the Shore, and fat me down upon the
Graft, free from Danger, and quite out of the
Rfcach of the Water.
I was now landed, and fafeon Shore, and began
to lookupand thankGod that myLife wasfav'd in
aCafe wherein there was fomeMinutes beforefcarce
any Room to hope. 1 believe it is impoffible to ex-
prefs to theLife what tl^eExtafies andTranfpbrts of
the
[*J3
the Soul are, when it is fo fav'd, as I may fay, out
of thje very Grave; and 1 do not wonder now at
that Cuftom, viz,. That when a Malefaftor, who
has the Halter about his Neck, is tyed up, and juft
going to be turn'doff, and has a Reprieve brought
tp him: I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a
Surgeon withir, to let him Blood that'gvery Mo-
ment they tell him of ir, that the Surprize may not
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over-
whelm him:

I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands,
and my whole Being, asln.ayfay, wrapt up inthe
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
fand Ge'ftujresand Motions which I cannot defcribe,
reflecting upon all my Comrades that were drown'd,
and that there fliould not be one Soul 'fav'd but my
felf j. for, as for them, I never faw them afterwards,
or any Sight of them, except three of their Hats,
pne Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I call my Eyes to theftranded Veife1, when th£
Breach and Froth of the Sea being fo big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered5 Lord!
how wavsit,poffible 1 could get on Shore 1
After I had folac'd m) Mind with the comfortable
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to
fee what kind ot Place 1 was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abate,
and that in a Word I had a dreadful Deliverance:
For I was wet, had no Clothes to fliift me, nor any
thing, eicher to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I ixe any Profpeft before me, but that of pe-
nding with Hunger, or being devoi r'd by wild
Be^fls \. And that which was particularly affl.dting
to me,'was, that [had no Weapon eicher to hunt
E 3 and
and kill any Creature for my Suftenance, or to de-
fend my felf againft any other Creature that might
defire to kill me for theirs: In a Word, I had no-
thing about me but a JChife, a Tobacco-pipe, and
a little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provifi-
on, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of
Mind, that for a while Irun about like a Mad-man.
Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
Heart to confider what would be my Lot if there
were any ravenous Beafts in that Country, feeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
An the Remedy that ofter'd to my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up in^o a thick bufhy Tree
like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I refolv'd to fie all Night, and confider the
next Day what Death I iliould dye, for as yet I
faw no Profped: of Life; I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any frefh Wa-
ter to drink, which 1 did, to my great Joy j and ha-
ving drank> and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth
to prevent hunger, I went to the Tree, and get-
ting up into it, endeavour'd to place my felf fo, as
that if Ifliould fleep I, might not fall i and having
cut me a fhort Sticky like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been
exceffively fatigu'd, I fell faft afleep, and flept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my Condition, and found my felf the moft re-
frefti'd with it, that I think I ever was oh fuch an
Occafion.
When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did
not rage and fwell as before : But that which fur-
pru'd me moft, was, that the Ship was lifted off
in the Night from the Sand where fhe lay, by
the Swelling of the Tide, and was driven tip al-
pioft as for as {he Rock which 1 firft mentioned,
wher$
where I had been fo bruiYd by the dafhing me a-
gain ft it •, this being within about a Mile from the
Shore where 1 was, and the Ship feeming to ftand
upright ftill, I wifti'd myfeifon board, that, at
Jeaft, I might fave fome ncctftary Things for
my Ufe.
When I came down from my Apartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the fir ft Thing
I found was the Boat, which Jay as the Wind and
the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my Right Hand, I walked as far as I
could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a Mile broad, fo I
came back for the prcfent, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship., where I hep'd to ficd fome*
thing for my prefem Subiiftence.
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd fo far our, that I could come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship -, and here
I found afrefti renewing of my Grief, for I faw
evidently, that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, that,is to fav, we had all got fafe
on Shore,' and I had not been fo miferable as to
be left entirely deftitute of all Comfort and Com-
pany, as I now was; this forced Tears from my
Eyes again, but as there was little Relief m that,
I refolv'd, if poffible, to get to the Ship, fo I
pilWd ;off my Clothes, for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water ; but when I came
tOKthe Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater to
knowlhow to get on Board, for as {he lay ^-ground,
and high out <*>f the Water, there was nothing
iwiph:nfc my-R'eadh to lay hold of, I fwam round
her twice, and the fecond Time I efpy'd a friiafl
Vkcp of a Rope, which I wondetr'd I dijd not fee
at fir ft, hang down by the Fore;CltajnV"fbMow,
E 4 as
[ 5<H
as that with great Difficulty I got hold of It, and
by the Help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-
caftle of the Ship. Here I found that the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal Of Water in her Hold,
but that (he lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, 2nd her Head low almoft to
the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was
free, and all that was in that Part was dry;
for you may be fure my firft Work was to fearch
and to fee what was fpoil'd and what was
free; and firft 1 found that all the Ship's Pro-
vifions were dry and untouclVd by the Water,
and being very well difpos'd to eat, I went to
the Bread room and fill'd my Pockets with Bif-
ket, and eat it as I went about other Things,
for I had no time to lofe. I alfo found fome Rum
in the great Cabin, of which 1 took a large
Pram, and which I had indeed need enough of
to fpirit me for what was before me. Now I
wanted nothingbutaBeat to furnifli myfelf with
many things which I forefaw would be very necef-
fary to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wi(h for what was
not to b? had, and this Extremity rotn'd my
Application- We had feveral fpare Yards, and
two or three large Sparrs of Wood, and a fparc
TopTmafl: or twp in the Ship ;I refolv'd to fall to
work with thefe, and flung as many of them
oyer-board as I could manage of their Weight-,
tying cvqry one with a Rope that they might
not drive away, when this was done I went down
the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I ty'd
four of them faft together at both Ends as well
as I (could, in the Form of a Raft, and Javirrg
two or ihrpe fhort Pieces of Plank -upon them

well, but that it was not able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; fo I went to
work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a fpare
Top-Maft into three Lengths, and added them to
my Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains;
but theHopeof furniftiing myfelf with Neceffarics,
encourag'd me to go beyond what I ftiould have
been able to have done upon another Occafion.
My Raft was now (hong enough to bear any
reafonable Weight; my next Care was what to
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
itfromtheSurfoftheSea^butlwasnotlongconfi-
dering this,I firft laid all the Planks or Boards upon
it that I could get,and having confider'd well what
1 mod wanted, I firft got three of the Seamens
Chefts, which I had broken open and empty'd,and
lowered them down upon my Raft \ the firft of
thefe I fiird with Provifions, viz,. Bread, Rice,
three Dutch Cheefes, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's
Flefli, which we liv'd much upon, and a little Re-
mainder of European Corn which had been laid by
for fome Fowfc which we brought to Sea with us,
but the Howls were kili'd ; there had been fome
Barley and Wheat together, bur, to my great Dif-
appointment,i found afterwards that the Rats had
eaten or fpoiTd it all. As for Liquors,I found feve-
ral. Cafes of Bottles belonging tp our Skippfcr, in
which were fome Cordial Waters,and in all about
five !or fix Gallons of Rack; thefe I ftow'd by
theimfelves/there being no Need to put them into
the;Gfaeft,inor no Room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the Tide began to flow, thov
Verv calm, and I had the Mortification to fee my
Goat, Shim-and Waffecoat, which I had left on
Sjiore upon the Sand> fwim away s as for my
Breeches vvhickwereonlyLinnen and open-knee'd,
I fwam on bpardlin them and my Stockirigs: How-
ever,
ever this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, of
which I found enough, but took no more than I
wanted for prefent Ufe, for I bad other Things
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to
work with on Shore* and it was after long fearch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Cheft, which
was indeed a very ufefiil Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time •, I got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, without lofing time to look
into ir5 for I knew in general what it contained.
My next Care was tor fome Ammunition and
Arms; there were two very" good Fowling-Pieces
in the great,Cabin, and two Piftols, thefe I fe-
cur'd firlly with fome Powder-Horns, and a fmall
Bag of Shot, andtwooid rufty Swords: I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'df rhem,
but with much Search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now
I thought myfelf pretty well freighted* and be-
gan to think how I fhould get to Shore with them,
having neither Sail,Oar,or Rudder,and the Jeaft
Cap full of Wind would have overfet all my Na-
vigation.
I had three Encouragements, i. A fmooth
calm Sea. 2. The Tide rifing and fetting into
the Shore. 3. What little Wind there was blew
me towards the Land ; and tbus,having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
befides the Tools which were in the Cheft,I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile or thereabouts, my
R^ft went very well, only that I found ir drive a
Jittle difiant from the Place where I had. landed be-
fore, by which I peiceiVd that there was fome In-
t *•J draught
draught of the Water, afidconfequently I hop'd to
find fome Creek or River there, which I might
jmake ufeof as a Port to get to Land with my
Cargo.
As I imagined, fo it was, there appeared before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a
ftrong Current of the Tide fet into it, fo I gui-
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the Stream: But here I had like to have
fuffer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my Heart, for know-
ing nothing of the Goaft, my Raft run a-ground
at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not being a-
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little
that all my Cargo had flipped off towards that End
that was a-float, andfo falfn into the Water: I
did my utmoft by fetting my Back againft the
Chefts, to^keep them in their Places, but could
notthruft off the Raft with all my Strength, nei-
ther durM ftir'from the Pofture I was in, but hold-
ing up the Chefts with all my Might, flood in that
Manner near half an Hour, in which time therifine
of the Water brought me a little more upon a Le-
vel^ and a little after, the Water full rifmg, my
Raft floated again, and I thruft her off with the
Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving Up
higher, I at length found my felf in the Mouth of a
little River, with Land on both Sides, and a
ftrong Current or Tide funning up, I look'don both
Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was
not willing to be driven too high up the River
hoping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea, and there-
fore refolv'd to place my felf as near the Coaft as
I could.
At; length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right
Shore of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at laft got fo near,
as
as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could
thruft her dire&ly in, but here I had like to have
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; for that Shore
lying pretty fteep, that is to fay, Hoping, there
was no Place to land, but where one End of the
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie fo high, and
the oihcr link lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again: All that I could do, was
to wait till the. Tide was at the higheft, keeping the
Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side
of it fad to the Shore, near a flat Piece, of
Ground, which I expected the Water would flow
over; and fo it did: As foon as I found Water
enough,(formy Raft drew about a Foot of Water)!
thruft l.er upon that flat Piece of Ground, and
there fatten'd or mor'd her, by flicking my two
broken Oars into the Ground ; one on one Side
near one End, and one onthe other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till the Water ebb'd a-
way, and left my Raft and all my Cargo fafeon
Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and
feek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to flow my Goods,, to fecure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not, whe-
ther on. the Continent or on an Ifland, whether in-
habited, or not inhabited, whether in Danger of
wild Beafts or not: There was a Hill not above
a Mile from me, which rofe up very fteep and high,
and which feem'd to over-top fome other Hills
which lay as in a Ridge from it Northward yl took
out one of the Fowling Pieces, and one of the Pi-
ftols, and an Horn of Powder, and thusannd I
travelled for Difcovery up to the Top of that Hill,
where after I had with great Labour and Difficul-
ty got up to the Top, I few my Fate to my great
AiRi&ion, (viz,.) that I was in an IQand environM.
every
every Way with the Sea, no Land to be feen, ex-
cept fome Rocks which lay a great Way off, and
two fmal] Iflands Ids than this, which lay about
three Leagues to the Weft.
I found alfo that the lfland 1 was in was barren,
and, as 1 faw good Reafon to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild Beafts, of whom however I faw
none, yet I faw Abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I ktll'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food, and what not. At my
coming back, I (hot at a great Bird which I faw
fitting upon a Tree on the :>ide of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firft Gun that had been fir'd
there fince the Creation of the World ^ I had no
fooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
crying every one according to his ufual Note •, but
not one of them of any Kind that I knew: As for
that Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a
Hawk, its Colour and Beak refembling it,but had
no Talons or Claws more than common, itsFlefli
was Carrion, and fie for nothing.
Contented with thisDifcovery, I came back to
ray Raft, and fell to work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which took me up the reft of that Day, and
what to do with myfelf at Night I knew not, nor
indeed whereto rclt; for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but fome wild Beaft
might devour me, tho\ as I afterwards found,
there was really no Need for thole Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my-
felf round with theCheftsand Boards that I had
brought on Shore, and made a Kind of a Hutt for
that'NtWs Lodging; as for Food, I yet faw not
Which Way to; fupply mylelf, except that I had
feen
feen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of
the Wood where I (hot the Fowl.
I now began to confider, that I might yet get
a great many Things out of the Ship, which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly fome of the Rig-
ging and Sails, and fuch other Things as might
come to Land, and I refolv'd to make another
Voyage on Board theVeffel, if poffible •, and as I
knew that the firft Storm that blew mult neceffa-
rily break her all in Pieces, I refolv'd to fee all o-
ther Things apart, till I got every Thing out of
the Ship th^t I could get h then I call'd a Council,
that is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I flioiild
take back the Raft, but this appear'd impractica-
ble •, fo 1 refolv'd to go as before, when the Tide
was down, and Ldid fo, only that I ftripp'd be-
fore I went from my Hutt, having nothing on but
a checquer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Lumen Drawers,
and a Pair of Pumps on my Feet.
I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepaid
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the
firft, I neither made this founweildy, nor loaded
it fo hard, but yet I brought away feveral Things
very ufeful to me; as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes,
a great Skrew-Jack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that mod ufeful Thing cali'd a
Grind (tone* all thefe 1 fecur'd together, with fe*
veral Things belonging to the Gunner, particular-
ly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Mufquet-Bullets, (even Mufquets, and anorher
Fowling-Piece, with feme fmall Quantity of Pow*
der more •, a large Bag full of fmall Shor, and a
great Roll of ^hect Lead : But this laft was fo heavy,
I could not hoift it up to get it over the Ship's Side.
Befid<*s thefe Things,! took all the Mens Clothes
that 1 could find, and a fpare Fore-top-fail, Ham-
mock.
ftibck ahd fortie Bedding; and with this I loaded my
fecond Raft, and brought them all fafe on Shore to
my very great Comfort.
I was under fome Apprehenfions during myAb-
fence from the Land, that at leaft my Provifions
might be devoured on Shore; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there fat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chefts,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Diftance, and then flood ftiil; {he fat very com-
posed, and unconcern'd, and lock'd full in my
Face, as if flie had a Mind to be acquainted with
me: I prefentcd my Gun at her, but as flie did
not underftand it, flie was perfeftly unconcerned
at it,^ nor did flie offer to ftir away ,• upon which
I tofs'd her a Bit of Bisket, tho'-by the Way I was
not very free of it, for myStore was not great. How-
ever, . I fpar'd her a Bit, I fay, and flie went to it,
fmeli'd of it, and eat it, and looked ( as pleased) for
more, but I thankM her, and could fpare no more ',
fo flie marchVI off.
Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho' I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and bring
them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being
large Casks, I went to Work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and fome Poles which I cut for
that Purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain,
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefts and Casks
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from
any fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beaft.
When I had done this, I blocked up the Door of
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty
Cheft fet up on End without, and fpreadihg one
b6 the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
ftols juft at my Head, and my Gun at Length by
me, I went to Bed for the firft time, and flept
very
very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
heavy, for the Night before I had flept little, and
had laboured very hard all Day, as well to fetch
all thefe Things from the Ship, as to get them
on Shore.
I had the biggeft Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man *
but I was notfatisfy'd fiill; for while the Ship fat
upright in that Pofture, I thought I ought to get
every Thing out of her that I could; fo every Day
at low Water I went on board, and brought away
fomething or other: But particularly the third
Time I went, I brought away as much of the
Rigging as I could, as alfo all the fmall Ropes and
Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece of fpare Can-
vas, which was to mend the Sails upon Occafion,
and the Barrel of wet Gun-powder : In a Word, 1
brought away all the Sails firft and laft,only that I
was fjiin to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much
at a Time as I could ,* for they were no more ufeful
to be Sails, but as meer Canvas only.
But that which comforted me more ftili, was,
that at laft of all, after 1 had made five or fix fuch
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more
to expeft from the Ship that was worth my med-
ling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great Hog-
fhead of Bread, and three large Runlets of Rum or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower; this was furprizing to me, becaufe I had
given over expe&ing, any more Provifions, except
what was fpoird by the Water : I foon empty'd the
Hogfcead of that Bread, and wrapt it up, Parcel
by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out ,•
and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore alfo.
The next Day I made another Voyage; and
now having plunder'd the Ship of what was porta-
ble
ble, and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables;
andcutting the great Cable into Pieces, fuch as I
cojld move, I got two Cables and a Haulier on
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get; and
having cut down the Spritfail-yard, and the Mi-
fen-yard, and every Thing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded it with all thofe heavy Goods, and
came away : But my good Luck began now to
leave mc; for this Raft was fo unweildy, and fo
overladen, that after I was entered the little Cave,
wrhere I had landed the reft of my Goods; not
being able to guide, it fo handily as I did the o-
thcr, it overfet, aud threw ms and all my Cargo
into the Water: As for my felf it wasnogreatHarm,
•for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargo, it
was great Part of it loft, pefecially the Iron, which
I expe&ed would have been of great Ufe tome:
However, when the Tide was but, I got molt of
the Pieces of Cable afliore, and fome of the Iron,
tho' with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip for
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very-
much; after this, I went every Day on Board*
and brought away what I could get.
I had' been now i 3 Days on Shore* and had been
II Times on Board the Ship; in which Time I
had brought away all that one Pair of Hands could
well, be-tuppos'd capable to bring, tho* I believe
verily,, had the calm Weather held, I Ihould have
brought: aw&y the whole Ship, Piece by Piece:
Butt preparing thei 2th Time to goon Board,Ifound
the Wind bsgan to rife; however, at low Water I
went on Board, and tho' ] thought I had rum*
magwed the Cabin fo effedually, as that nothing
moretfeould be found, yet I difcovered a Locked
with Drawers in it, in one of which I found* two
orhrg;e Razors, and one Pair of large Sciifars,
with Tome ten or a Dozen of good Knives and
Part I. F Forks;
{66 ]
Forks; in another I found about Thirty fix Pounds
Vak e in Money, fome European Coin, feme Brajil,
fome Pieces ot Eight, fbme Gold, fome Silver.
I fmil'd to my felt' at the Sight of this Money.
O Drug! faid I aloud, what art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the Ground; one of thofe Knives is worth all
this Heap \ I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature whofe Life is not worth faving. How-
ever, upon fecond Thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began,
to think of matting another Raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the Sky over-caft, and the
Wind began to rife, and in a Quatter of an Hour
it blew a frefh Gale from the Shore; it prefently
oecurM to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that
it was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to
reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let my felf
down into the Water, and fwam crofs the Channel,
which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and
even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the things I had about me, and partly
the Roughnefs of the Water, for the Wind rofe
very haftily, and before it was quite high Water,
it blew a Storm.
But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where
I lay with all my Wealth about me Very fecure. It
blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning
when Ilook'd out, behold no more Ship was to be
feen. I was a little fiirpriVd, but recovered my
felf with this fatisfa&ory Refle&ion, viz,. That I
had loft no Time, nor abated no Diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be ufeful to me,
a:id that indeed there was little left in her that I
was
was able to bring away, if I had had more Time*
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, or of any thing out of her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but thofe
things were of fmall ufe tome.
My Thoughts were now wholly employed about
fecuring my felf again/1 either Savages, if any
fhould appear, or wild Beafis, if any were in the
Ifland '> and I had many Thoughts of the Method
how to do this, and what kind of Dwelling to
make, whether I fhould make me a Cave in the
Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth: And, in fliort,
I refolv'd upon both, the Manner and Defcription
of which it may not be improper to give an Ac-
count of
I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low
moorifti Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would
not be* wholfome, and more particularly becaufe
there was no frefh Water near it, fo I refolv'd to
find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of
Ground.
Iconfulted feveral Things in my Situation which
1 found would be proper for me, ift. Health, and
frefli Water,'I juit now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter
from the Heat of the Sun. 3 dJy, Security from ra-
venous Creatures, whether Man or Beaft. ^thly^
A View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship in
Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my
Deliverance, for which I was not willing to banifh
all my Expe&ation yet.
In Search of a Place proper for this, I found a
little Plain on the fide of a rifing Hill* whofe
Front towards this little Plain was fteep as a
Ho'ufe-fide, fo that nothing could come down up-
on me from the Top ,• on the Side of this Rock
F 2 there
there was a hollow Place worn a little way in, like
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.
On the Flat of the Green, juft before this hollow
Place, I refolved to pitch my Tent: This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay l.ke a Green before my
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly
every way down into the low Grounds by the Sea-
fide. It was on the NN.Hr. Side of the Hill, (o
that it was flickered from the Heat every Day, till
it came to a TV. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in thofe Countries is near the Setting.
Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and
twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning
and Ending.
In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of ftrong
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they flood
very firm like Piles, the beggeft End being out of
the Ground about five Foot and a half, and fhar-
pen'd on the Top; the two Rows did not ftand
above fix Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows upon one ano-
ther, within .the Circle between thefe two-Rows
of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in
the Infide, leaning againfc them, about two Foot
and a half high, like a Spur to a Port, and this
Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or Beaft
could get into it or over it : Thiscoft mea great
deal of Time and Labour, efpedally to cut the"
Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and
drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be not
by a Door, But by a (horc Ladder, to go over
the
the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I lifted
over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenced in,
and fortify *d, as I thought, from all the World*
and confequently fleptfecure in the Night, which
otherwife I could not have done, tho', as it appear'd
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite Labour,
I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provifions, Am-
munition and Stores, of which you have the Ac-
count above, and I made me a large Tent, which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz,.
one fmaller Tent within, and one larger Tent a-
bove ity and covered the uppermoft with a large
Tarpaulin which I had fav'd among'the Sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent I brought all my Provifions, and
every Thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and fo
pafs'd and repafs'd, as I faid, by a fliort Ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my Way
into the Rock, and bringing all the; Earth and
Stones that I dug down, out thro' my Tent, I
laid them up within my Fence in the Nature of a
Terrace, fo that it raised the Ground within about
a Foot and a Halt; and thus I made me a Cave juft
behind my Tent, which ferv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe.
It coft me much Labour, and many Days., before
all thefe Things were brought to Perfc£ton, and
therefore I muft go back to fome other Things which
jtoofc up fome of my Thoughts. At the fame Time it
F 3 happened
happenM after I had laid my Scheme for the fet-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Storm of Rain failing from a thfick dark Cloud, a
fudden Flafh of Lightning happen'd, and after that
3. great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effect
of it; I was not fo much furpriz'd with the Light-
ning, as I was with a Thought which darted into
my Mind as fwift as the Lightning itfelf: O my
Powder, my very Heart funk within me, when I
thought, that at one Blaft all my Powder might
be deftroy'd; on which, not my Defence only, but
the providing me Food, as I thought, entirely de-
pended; I was nothing near fo anxious about my
own Danger, tho'had the Powder took Fire>I had
never known who had hurt me.
Such Impreffion did this make upon me, that
after the Storm was over, I laid afide all my Works,
my Building and Fortifying, and apply'd my felf
to make Bags and Boxes to feparate the Powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in
Hope, that whatever might come, it xmight not
all take Fire at once, and to keep it fo apart, that
it fiiould not be poffibl.e to make one Part Fire a-
nother. I finifliM this Work in about a Fortnight,
and I think my Powder, which in all was about
140I Weight, was divided in not lefs than a Hun-
dred Parcels. As to the Barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any Danger from that, fo I
placed ip in my new Cave, wh.ch in my Fancy I
called my Kitchin; and the reft I hid up and
down in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no Wet
might corne to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the Interval of Time while this was doing5 I
went out at ieaft orce every Day with my Gun,
as well to divert my felfras to fee if I .could kill any
Thing fie for Food, and as near as I could, to ac-
v quaint
quaint myfelf with what the Ifland produe'd. The
firft Time I went out I prefently difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
Satisfa&ion to me; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz,. That they were fo
fliy, fo fubtle, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was the
difficulteft Thing in the World to come at them:
But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then fhuot one, as it foon hap-
pen'd, for after I had fonnd their Haunrs a little,
I laid wait in this Manner for them : I obferv'd, if
they faw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright; but if they were feeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me, from whence I concluded, that by the
Pofition of their Opticks* their Sight was fo di-
rected downward, that they did not readily fee
Obje6ts that were above them; fo afterward I
took this Method, I always cL'mb'd the Rocks firft
to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The firft Shot I made among thele Crea-
tures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which flie gave Suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when the Old one fell, the Kid
flood Stock ftill by her till 1 "came and took her up;
and not only fo,vbut when 1 carried the O.d one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd me
quite to my Enclofure; upon which I laid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and car-
ried it over my Pale, in Hopes to have bred it up
tame, but it would not eat, fo I was fore'd to
kill it and eat it myfelf; thefe two fupply'd me
with F.elh a great while, for I eat fparingly; and
fav'd my Proyifiotas (my Bread efpecially) as much
as polfibly I could.
F 4 Having
Having now fixM my Habitation, I found it ab-*
folutely neceiTary to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Feuel to burn; and what I did for
that, as alfb how I enlarged my Cave, and what
Coveniencies I made, I fhall give a full Account
of it in itsPiace : But 1 mult firft give fome little
Account of my felf,,and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be fuppofed were not
a few.
I had a difmal Profpeft of my Condition ; for as
I was not caft away upon that lfland without being
driven, as is faid by a violent Storm quite out of
the Courfe of our intended Voyage, and a great
Way, viz,, fome Hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Courfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Reafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this defolate Place, and in this
defolate Manner I fliould end my Life; the Tears
would run plentifully down my Face when I made
thele Refle&ions, and fomeitmes I would expoftu-
late with my fdf, Why Providence fliould thus
compleatly ruin its Creatures, and render them fo
absolutely miferable, fo without Help abandon'd,
fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly be ra^
tional to be thankful for fucha Life.
But fomething always returned fwift upon me to
check thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me ,* and
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my
Hand by the Sea-fide, I was very penfive upon the
Subjeft of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as
it were expoftulating with me to'ther Way, thus:
Well, you are in a defolate Condition, 'tis true, but
pray remember, where are the reft of you ? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat,, where
are-the Ten? Why were not they fav'd, and you
Jolt? Why were you fingled out? Is it better to be
jherc pr there? And then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils
Evils are to be confider'd with the Good that is in ,
them, and with what worfe attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnifli'd for my Subfiftence, and what would have
been my Cafe if it had not happen d, Which was
an Hundred I'houfand to one, that the Ship floated
from the Place where fhe firft firuck, and was dri-
ven fo near to the Shore that I had time to get
all thefe things out of her: What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with-
out Neceffaries of Life, or Neceflaries to fupply
And procure them? Particularly faid I aloud, (thoJ
to my felf) what fhould I ha' done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any thing, or to work with, without
Cloches, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Coverings ,• and that now I had all thefe to a fuffi-
cient Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
my felf in fuch a manner, as to live without my
Gun when my Ammunition was fpent? So that
I had a tolerable View of fubfifting without any
Want as long as I liv'd; for I confider'd from the
Beginning how I would provide for the Accidents
that might happen, and for the time that was to
come, even not only after my Ammunition fhould
be fpent, but evpii after my Health or Strength
fiiould decay.
I confefs 1 had not entertained any Notion of my
Ammunition being deftroyM at one Blaft, I mean
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it fo furprizing to me when
it lightened and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now.
And now being to enter inro a melancholy
Relation of a Scene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as
was never heard of in the World before, 1 fhall
!$ke it from its Beginning, and continue it in its
Order
Order. It was, by my Account, the 30th of Sep.
when, .'n the Manner as abovefaid, 1 firft fet Foot
upon this horrid Illand, when the Sun being, to
us, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almoft juft over
my Head, for I reckon'd my felf, by Obfervation,
to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees 22 Minutes
North of the Line.
After I had been there about Ten or Twelve
Days, it came into myxThoughts, that I fhould
loic my Reckoning of Time for want ot Books,
and Pen and Ink, and fhould even forget the Sab-
bath Days from the working Days: but to prevent
this, 1 cut it with my Knite upon a large Poft, in
Capitals Letters, and making it into a great Crofs,
I fet it up on the Shore where I firft Landed, viz,. I
came on Shore here the 10th oj Sept. 1659. Upon
the Sides of this fquare Poft, I cut every Day a
Notch with my Knife, and every feventh Notch
was as long again as the reft, and every firft Day of
the Month as long again as that long one; and thus
I kept my Kalendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of Time.
In the next Piace we are to obferve, that among
the many things which I brought off the Ship
in the feveral Voyages, which, as abovemention'd,
I made to it, I got feveral things of lefs Value,
butnot at all lefs ufeful to me, which I omitted kt-
ting down before; as in particular, Pens, Ink, and
Paper, feveral Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's,
Gunner's, an J Carpenter's keeping, three or four
Compaffes, (ome Mathematical Inft rumen ts,Diajs,
Perfpedives, Charts, and Books of Navigation,
all which I huddled together, whether I might
want them or no; alfo I found three very good
Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from Eng-
land, and which 1 had pack'd up among my things;
feme Portuguese Books alfo, and among them two
or -
or three Popifh Prayer-Books, and feveral other
Books, all which I carefully fecur'd. And I muft
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and two
Cats, of whofe eminent Hiftory I may have occa-
fion to fay fomething in its Place; for I carry'd
both the Cats with me > and as for the Dog, he
jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf, and fwam on
Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with my
iirft Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to me many
Years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any Company that he could make up to me.
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that
would not do: As I obferv'd before, I found Pen,
Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them to the ut-
moft; and I lhall (hew, that while my Ink lafted,
I kept thingsvery exaft; bur after that was gone,
I could not; for I could not make any Ink, by any
Means that I could devife.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithftanding all that I had amafs'd to-
gether; andofthefe, this of Ink was one, as alfo
Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth; Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for
Litinen, I foon learn'd to want that without much
Difficulty.
This Want of Tools made every Work I did go
on heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I
had entirely finished my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cut-
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home; fo that Ifpent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thofe
Potts, and a third Day in driving it intcrtheGround;
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firft, but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the
Iron Crows, which however, tho' I found it, yet
it
£ I61
it made driving thofe Pofts or Piles very laborious
and tedious Work.
But what need I ha' been concerned at the Te-
dioufoefs of anything I had to do, feeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Em-
ployment if that had been over, at leaft, that I
could forefee, except the ranging the Ifland to feek
for Food, which I did more or lefs every Day.
I now began to confider ferioufly my Condition,
and the Circumftance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fo much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to de-
liver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them,
and tafHi<5h'ng my Mind; and as my Reafon began
now to matter my Defpondency, I began to com-
fort my felf as well as 1 could, and to fet the Good
agajnft the Evil, that I might have fomething to
diftinguifli my Cafe from worfe; and I ft*ted it
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the
Comforts I enjoy*d, againft the Mifcrics I fufler'd,
thus;
Evil. Good.

to the Shorey that I have
gotten out fo many neceffa-
ry ^things 06 will either
fupply my Wantsy or ena*
ble me to fup fly my felfe-
ven m Ion? at 1 live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Tefti-
mony, that there was fcarce any Condition in the
World fo miferable, but thfcre was fomething ne-
gative or fomethingpofitive to be thankful for in it;
and let this fiand as a Direction from the Experi-
ence of the moft miferable of all Conditions in this
World, that we may always find in it fomething
to comfort ourfelves from, and to fet, in the De-
fcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of
the Account.
Having now brought my Mind a little to relifh
my Condition, and given over looking out to Sea,'
to fee if I could fpy a Ship; I fay, giving over
thefe Things, I began to apply my felt to accom-
modate my way of Living, and to make things as
eafy to me as I could.
I have
I have already defcribed my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded
with a ftrong Pale of Pofts and Cables, but I might
now rather call it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of
Wall up againft it of Turfs, about two Foot thick
on the Outfide, and after fome time, I think it
was a Year and half, I rais'd Rafters from it, lean-
ing to the Rock, and thatch'd or covered it with
Boughs of Trees, and fuch things asl could get to
keep out the Rain5 which I found at fome times of
the Year very violent.
I have already obferv'd how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and. into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I muft obferve too,
that at firft this was a confus'd Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, fo they took up
all my Place; 1 had no room to turn my felf: So
I fet my felf to enlarge my Cpe and Works far-
ther into the Earth j for it was a loofe fandy Rock,
which yielded eafily to the Labour I beflowed on
it: And fo when I found I was pretty fafe as to
Beafts of Prey, I work'd fideways to the Right
Hand into the Rock-, and then turning to the
Right again, worked quite out, and made me a
Door to come out, on the Outfide of my Pale or
Fortification.
This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as it
were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfe, but gave me room to flow my Goods.
And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch
neceflary things as I found I moA wanted, particu-
larly a Chair and a Table; for without thefe I was
not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World > I could hot write or eat, or feveral things*
with fo much Pleafure, without a Table.
So I went to work; and here I muft needs ob-
fervej that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi-
nal
nal of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fqua-
ring every thing by Reafon, and by making the
moft rational Judgment of things, every Man may
be in time Mafter of every mechanick Art. I had
never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in time
by Labour, Application and Contrivar.ee, I found
at lafl that I wanted nothing but I could have made
it, efpecially if I had had Tools; however, I
made Abundance of things, even without Tools,
and fome with no mote Tools than an Adze and'
a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that
way before, and that with infinite Labour. For
Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other
Way but to cut down a Tree, fet it on an Ed^e
before me, and hew it flat on either Side with my
Axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a Plank
and then dubb it fmooth with my Adie. It is
true, by this Method I could make but one Board
out of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy
for but Patience, any more than I had for the pro-
digious deal of Time and Labour vvhich it took
me up to make a Plank or Board: But" my Time
or: Labour was little worth, and fo it was as well
employ d one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as
I oMervd above, in the firit Place, and this I diA
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that I brought
on my Raft from the Ship: But when iL
wrought out fome Boards, as above, I aadc hrfQ
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and a Half «
over another, all along one Side of mv Cavr T
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a
Word, to leparate every thing at large in their
Places, that I might come eafily at them- T k™S
Piece, toco che Wall of the R<4 Jgg£%£
and all things that would hang up. y
So
So that had my Cave been to be feen, it look'd
like a general Magazine of all neceffary things,
and I had every thing fo ready at my Hand, that
it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efpecially to find my Stock of
all Neceffaries fo great.
And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, for indeed at firft
I was in too much a Hurry, and not only Hurry
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha' been full of many
dull things. For Example, I muft have faid thus:
Sep. the 30th, After I got to Shore, and had efcap'd
drowning, inftead of being thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little,
I ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands, and
beating my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mi-
fery, and crying out, I was undone, undone, till
tirM and faint, I was forc'd to lye down on the
Ground to repofe, but durft not deep for fear of
being devoured.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain, and looking out to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di
ftance I fpy'da Sail, pleafe my felf with the Hope:
of it, and then after looking fteadily till I was at
moft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my
But havinggotten over thefe things in lome Mea-
fure, and'having fettled my Houfhold-Stuff and Ha-
bitation, made me a Table and a Chair, ,and all
as handfome about me as I could, * began to keep
my
'S
my Journal of which I fliall here give you the Co-
py (tho' in it will be told all thefe Particulars o-
ver #gain) as long as it lafted, for having no more
Ink I was forced to leave it off.
The JOURNAL.
SEptember 30, 1659. I poor miferable Robinfori
Crufoe, being Shipwrecked, during a dreadful
Storm in the Offing, came on Shore on this dif-
mal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd the Ifland of
Defyair, all the reft of the Ship's Company being
drown'd, and my felf almoft dead.
All the reft of the Day I fpent in afRi&ing my
felf at the difmal Circumftances I was brought to,
viz,. I had neither Food, Houfe, Clothes, Wea-
pon; or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Re-
lief, fa tor nothing but-Death before me, either that
I fliould be devoured by wild Beafts, murther'd by
Savages, or ftarv'd to Death for want of Food. Ac
the Approach of Night, I flept in a Tree for fear
of wild Creatures, but flept foundly tho' it rain'd
all Night.
O&ober 1. In the Morning I faw to my great
Surprize the Ship had floated with the high Tidej
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Wand, which as it was fome Comfort on one Hand,
(for feeing her fit upright,and not broken to Pieces,
I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on Board,
and get fome Food and Neceflaries out of her for
my'Relief) fo on the other Hand it renewM my
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, who I ima-
gined if we had all ftaid on Board might have
fav'd the Ship, or at leaft that they would not have
been all drown'd as they were; ami that had the
Men been fav'd, we might perhaps have built us
a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to have car-
Part L G ried
ried us to fome other Part of the World. I (pent
great Part of this Day in perplexing my felt on
thefe Things; but at length feeing the Ship almoft
dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and
then fwam on Board; this Day alfo continued
raining, tho' with no Wind at all.
From the ift of OBober to the 24th. All thefe;
Days entirely (pent in many feveral Voyages to'
get all I could out of the Ship, which 1 brought
on Sh<5re,every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much
Rain alfo in thefe Days, tho' with fome Intervals
of fair Weather: But, it feems, this was the rainy
Seafon,
OB. 20. I overfet my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it, but being in fhoal Water, and
the Things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many
of them when the Tide was out.
OB, 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with
fome Gufts of Wind, during which Time the Ship
broke in Pieces, ,the .Wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water. I
fpent this Day in cohering and fecuring the Goods
which!had fav'd, that the Rain might not .fpoil
them.
OB. 26.1 walk'd about the Shore almoft all Day
to find out a Place to fix my Habitation, greatly
concerned to fecure my felf from any Attack in the
Night, either from wild Beafts or Men. Towards
Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under a Rock<>
and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my Encampment,
vviiich I refolv'd to ftrengthen with a Work, Wall,
or Fortification, made of double Piles, lin'd with-
in with Cable, and without with Turf.
From the 2.5th to the 30th I worked very hard
in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation
tho'
tho'fome Part of the Time it rain'd exceeding
hard.
The 31ft in the Morning I went out into the
Ifland with my Gun to fee for fome Food, and dis-
cover the Country , when I kill'd a She-Goat, and
her Kid followed me Home, which I afterwards
kill'd alfo, becaufe it would not feed.
November 1. I fet up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as
I could with Stakes driving in to fwing my Ham-*
mock upon.
Nov. 2. I fet up all my Chefts and Boards, and
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them formed a Fence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortifica-
tion.
'Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun,and kill'd two
Fowls like Ducks* which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.
Nov* 4. This Morning I began to order my
Times of Work, of going out with my Gun,Time
of Sleep, and Time of Diverfion, viz,. Every
Morning I walk'd out with my Gun for two or
three Hours if it did not rain, then employed my
felf to work till about eleven a Clock, then eat what
I had to live on, and from twelve to two I lay
down to fleep, the Weather being exceffive hot,
and then in the Evening to work again: The
working Part of this Day and the next were whol-
ly employed in making my Table, for I was yet
but a very forry Workman, tho' Time and Necefr
fity made me a compleat natural Mechaniek foon
after, as I believ^it would do any oneelfe*
Nov. 5. This Day went Abroad with my Gutl
md my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat) her vkiri
pretty foft, but her Flefh good for nothing: Every
G 2 Creature
Creature I kill d, I took off the Skins and pfefenrd
them. Coming back by the Sea Shore, I faw ma-
ny Sorts of Sea-Fowls which I did not underftand;
but was furprized, andalmoft frighted with two or
three Seals, which j while I was gazing at, not well
knowing what they were, got into the Sea, and
efcaped me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk, I went to
Work with my Table again, and finifhed ky tho'
not to my Liking; nor was it long before I learn'd
to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, ioth, and Part of the
12th (for the nth was Sunday, according to my ,
Reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,
and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape,
but never to pleafe me; and even in the Making I
puH'd it to Pieces feveral times. Note, I foon ne-
glefted my keeping Sunday; for omitting my Mark
for them on my Poft, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This Day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the Earth, but it was ac-
company'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my Pow-
der: As foon as it was over, I refolved to feparate
my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as
poflible, that it might not be in Danger,
Nov* 14, 15, 16. Thefe three Days I fpent in
making little fqnare Chefts or Boxes, which might
hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at moft, of
Powder * and To putting the Powder in, I flowed
it in Places as fecure and remote from one anothpr
as poflible. On one of thefe three Days I killed a
large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not
what to call it.
Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my
Tent into the Rock, to make room for my farther
Conve*
Conveniency. Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, *//*,. a Pick-axe, a Shovel,
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, fo I defifted from
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools. As for a
Pick-axe, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next
Thing was a Shovel or Spade; this was fo abfo-
lutely neceffary, that indeed I could do-nothing
effe&ually without it ,* but what kind of one to
make I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next Day in fearching the Woods,
I found a Tree of that Wood, or like ir, which
in the Brafils they call the Iron 7ree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs; of this, with great Labour
and almoft fpbiling mV Ax, I cut a Piece, and
brought it Home too with Difficulty enough, for
it was exceeding heavy.
T^he exceffive Hardnefs of the Wood, and having
no other Way, made me a long while upon this
Machine; for I workMit effe&uaily by little and
Little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the
Handle exa&ly fhap'd like ours in England, only
that the broad Part having no Iron fhod upon it
at Bottom, it woul4 not laft me folong; however
it ferv'd well enough for the Ufes which I had
Occafion to put it to; but never was a Shovel,
I believe, made after that Fafliion, or fo long a
making.
I was ftill deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow ; a Basket I could not make by any
means, having nofuch Things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at leaft none yet found
out; and as to the Wheel-barrow, 1 fancy'd I could
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
of/neither did I know how to go about it; befides,
I had no po'flible Way to make Iron Gudgeons
G 3 for
for the Spiadle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, fo
I gave it over; and fo for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing
like a Hoad which the Labourers carry Mortar in
when they ferve the Bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making
the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt, which I made in vain, to make a Wheel-
barrow, took me up no lefs than four Days, I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun*
which I feldom fail'd ; and very feldpm fail'd alfo
of bringing home Something fit to eat.
.Nov. 23. My other Work having now flood
ftill, becaufe of my making thefe Tools; when they
were finilh'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allowed, I fpent eigh-
teen Days entirely in widening and deepning my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
oufly.
Note, During all this Time, I worked to make
this Room or Cave fpacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehoufc or Magazine, a Kitchen,.
a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for a Lodging,
I kept to the Tent> except that fometimes in the
wet Seafon of the Year, it rain'd fo hard that I
could not keep my felf dry, which cause! me after-
wards to cover all my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, leaning againft
the Rock, and'load them with Flags, and larger
Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.
December. 10. I began now to think my Cave
or Vault finiihed, when on a fudden (it feems I
had ma^eit too large) a great Quantity of Earth
fell down from the Top and one Side, fo much,
that in fliort it frighted me, and not without Rea-
(on too, for if I. had been under it, I had never
wanted a Grave-digger; Upon this Difafter I had
; • '" -  '' a great'
a great deal of Work to do over again; for I had
the loofe Earth to carry out, and which was of
more Importance, I had the Ceiling to prop up, fo
that I might be fure no more would come down.
Dec. ii. This Day I went to work'with it accor-
dingly, and got twoShoars or Pofts pitched upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs over
each Poft ; this I fihifti'dthe next Day ; and ferting
more Pods up with Boards, in about a Week more
I had the Roof fecur'd ; and the Pofts Handing in
Rows, ferv'd me for Partitions to Part of my Houfe.
Dec. ij. From this Day to the Twentieth I
plac'd Shelves, and knocked up Nails on the Pofts
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be in fome Order within
Doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began to furnifli my Houfe and fet up
fome Pieces of Boards like a Drefler, to order my
Visuals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
with me; alfo I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day; no
fiirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec. 26. No Rain3 and the Earth much cooler
than before, and pleafanter.
Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano-
ther fo that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a
String; when I had it Home, 1 bound and fplin-
ter'd up its Leg which was broke. N. B. I
tO)kfuch Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg
grew well and as ftrong as ever; but by nurfing
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
Green at my Door, and would not go away:
This was the firft Time that I entertained a
Thouglrr of breeding up fome tame Creatures,
G 4 that
that I might »have Food when my Powder and
Shot was all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; fo
that there was no ftirring abroad, except in the Er
veiling for Food; this Time I fpent in putting all
my Things in Order within Doors.
January 1. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear-?-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle
of the Day; this Evening going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Ifland,
I found there was Plenty of Goats, tho? exceeding
fliye and hard to come at; however I refolv'd to try
if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out
with my Dog, and fet him upon the Goats ,* but l
was miftaken, for they all fac'd about upon the
Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he
would not come near them,
Jan. 3.1 began my Fence or Wall; which, being
ftill jealous of my being attacked by fome Body, I
refolv'd to make very thick and flrong.
N. B. This Wall being defcriVd before, I
purpofely omit what was /aid in the Jour-
nal it is fufficient to cbjerve, that I was
no lefs Timethqnfr0mthe3d0fjd.nua.vy
to the iqthofAptil, working, finijbing and
ferfeEling this vtfaU>> th% it was no more
than about 24 Yards in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another
Place about eight Tards from it, the Doort
<pf the Cave being in the Center behind it*
All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay fometimes Weeks
together:; but I thought I flrould never be perfect-
ly iecure 'till this Wall was finifh'd; and it is
fcarce
fcarce credible what inexpreffible Labour every
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing Piles
out ot the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground > for I made them much bigger than I
needed to have done.
When this Wall was finifh'd, and the Outfide
double fenc'd with a Turf-Wall rais'd up clofe to
it, 1 perfwaded myfelf.that if any People were to
come on Shore there, they would not perceive
any Thing like a Habitation; and it was very-
well 1 did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a
very remarkable Occafion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thcfe
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage •
particularly I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons,who'
built not as Wood-Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe-Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks;
and taking fome young ones, I endeavour'd to
breed them up tame, and did fo; but when they
grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at firft for want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to givethem; however,! frequently found
their Nefts,and got their young ones, which were
very good Meat.
And now in the managing my Houfiiold Affairs
I found myfelf wanting in many Thing', which I
thought at firft it was impoflible for me to make
as indeed as to fome of them k was; for hfiance
1 could never make a Cask to be hoop'd, 1 had a
fmall Runlet or two, as I obfervd before but I
could never arrive to the Capacity of making one
by them, tho' I (pent many Weeks about it  I
could neither put in the Heads, or joint the Staves
fo true to one another, as to make them hold Wa-
tcrr, io 1 gave that alfo over.
In
In the next place, I was at a great Lofs for Can-
dle i fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which
was generally by Seven a-Clock, I was obliged ro
go to Bed: I remember, the Lump of Bees-Wax,
with which I made Candles in my African Adven-
ture, but 1 had none of that now* the only Re-
medy I had, was, that when I had kilPd a Goat,
1 favM the Tallow, and with a little Difli made
of Clay, which 1 bak'd in the Sun, to which 1
added a Wick of fome Oakum, I made me a
Lamp y and this gave me Light, tho' not a clear
fteady Light like a Candle. In the middle of all
rr>y Labours k happen'd, that rummaging my
Things., Hound a iirtlc Bag, which, asl hinted
before, had been fylTd with Corn for the feeding
of Poultry5 not for this Voyage, but before, as I
fuppofe, when the Ship came from Lisbon; what
little Remainder of Corn had been in the Bag,
was all devour'd with the Rats, and I faw nothing
in the Bag but Husks and Duff •, and being willing
to have the Bag for fome other life, 1 think it was
to put Powder in, when I divided it for fear of
the Lightning, or fome fuch life, I (hook the
Musks of Corn out of it on one Side of my Fortifi-
cation under the Rock.
It was a little before the great Rains, juft: now
jnention'd that I threw this Stuff away, taking no
Notice of any Thing, and not fo much as rcmem-
bring that I had thrown any Thing there •, when
about a Month after, or thereabouts, 1 faw fome
few Stalks of fomething green fliooting out of the
Ground, which I fancy'd might be fome Plant I
had not feen •, bur 1 was furpriVd and perfe£Uy
aftonifh'd, when after a little longer Time I (aw:
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were
perfe£fc green Barley of the fame Kind as our<£#-
ropeatiy nay, as our, Englifh Barley.
It
It is impoffible to exprefs the Aftonifhment and
Gonfufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion; I
bad hitherto a&ed upon no religious Foundation at
all; indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in
my Head, nor had entertained any Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God;
without fo much as enquiring into the End of Pro-
vidence in thefe Things, or his Order in govern-
ing Events in the World: But after I faw Barley-
grow there, in a Climate which I knew was not
proper for Corn, and efpecially that I knew not
how it came there, it ftartled me ftrangely, and I
began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly caused
this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed fown,
and that it was fo direfted purely for my Sufte-
nance on that wild miferable Place.
This touched my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature fliould happen
upon my Account ,* and this was the more flrange
to me5 becaufe I faw near it ftill all along by the
Side of the Rock, fome other firaggling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when
I was afbore there.
I not only thought thefe the pure Produ&ions
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the Place, I went all
over that Part of the Ifland, where I had been
before, peering in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to feeAfor more of it, but I could not find
any; at laft it occur'd to my Thoughts, that I had
fliook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafe ,* and Imuft
eonfefs, my religious Thankfulnefs to God's Pro-
vidence began to abate too upon the difcove-
ring
ring that all this was nothing but what was com-
mon ;' tho'T ought to have been as thankful for lo
ftrange and unforefeen Providence, as if it had
been miraculous; for it was really the Work of
Providence as to me, that fhould order or appoint,
that 10 or 12 Grains of .Corn fhould remain un-
fpoil'd (when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft)
as if it had been dropt from Heaven: As alfo that I
ihould throw it out in that particular Place where
it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it fprang up
immediately; whereas if I had thrown ic any
where elfe at,that Time, it had been burnt up and
deftroy'd.
I. carefully fav'd the Ears of this Corn, you may be
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of
June, and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd to fow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Quantity fufficient to fupply me with Bread; but
ft was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my
felf the leaft Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then but fparingly, as I (hall fay afterwards in its
Order; for 1 loft all that I fow'd the firft Seafon,
by not obferving the proper Time, for I fow'd it
jufi before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came
up at all, at leaft, not as it would have done: Of
which in its Place.
: Befides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or
50 Stalks of Rice, which 1 preferv'd with the fame
Care, and whofe Ufe was of the fame Kind, or to
the fame Purpofe, (WiO to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up with-
out baking, tho' I did that alfo afrcr fome Time.
But to-return to my Journal.
I work'd exceffive hard thefe three or four
Months to get my Wall done; and the 14th of
April! clofed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder* chat
there
there might be no Sign in the Outfide of my
Habitation.
April 16A finifti'd the Ladder, fo I went up With
the Ladder to the Top, and then pull'd it up af-
ter me, and let it down on the Infide: This was
a compleat Enclofure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unlefs it could firft mount my Wall.
The very next Day after this V/all was finiflied,
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at
once, andmyfelf kill'd; the Cafe was thus: As I
was bufy in the Infide of it, behind my Tent, juft
in the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly fright-
ed with a moft dreadful furprizmg thing indeed;
for all on a fudden I found the Earth came crum-
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Fofts I had fet up in the Cave, crack'd in a
frightful manner: I was heartily feared, but thought
nothing of what really was the Caufe, only think-
ing that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as fome
of it had done before ^ and for fear I fliould be bu-
ried in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my felf fafe there neither, I got over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
pected might roll- down upon me. I was no fooner
ftept down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly
fawit was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground
I flood on (hook three times, at about eight Mi-
nutes Diftance, with three fuch Shocks as would
have overturned the ftrongeft Building that could
be fuppofed. to have (tood on the Earth; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which flood
about Half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down
with fuch a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all
my Life. I perceived alfo, the very Sea was put
into, a violent Motion by it; and I believe the
Shock
Shocks were ftronger under the Water than on the
Ifland.
I was fo amaz'd with the Thing it felf, having
never felt the like, or difcours'd with any one that
had, that I was like one dead or ftupify'd; and the
Motion of the Earth made my Stomach fick, like
one that was tofs'd at Sea; but the Noife of the
falling of the Rock awak'd me, as it were, and rou-
zing me from the ftupified Condition I was in*
fill'd me with Horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my
Houfliold Goods, and burying all at once ; and
this funk my very Soul within me a fecond Time.
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no
more for fome Time, I began to take Courage, and
yet I had not Heart enough to get over my Wall a-
gain, for fear of being buried alive, but fat ftill
upon the Ground, greatly caft down and difconfo-
late, not knowing what to do : All this while I had
not the leaft ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy upon me; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I fat thus, I found the Air over caft, and
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; fo that in lefs
than half an Hour it blew a moft dreadful Hurri-
cane: The Sea was all on a fudden covered over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and
this held about three Hours, and then began to
abate, and then in two Hours more it was calm, and
began to rain very hard.
Ail this while I fat upon the Ground very much
terrifyM and de;efted, when on a fudden it came
into my Thoughts, that thefeWinds and Rain being
theConfequence of the Earthquake, the Earthquake
it felf
it felf was fpent and over, and I might venture into
my Gave again: With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain helping alio to per-
fwade me, I went in and fat down in my Tent,
but the Rain was fo violent, that my Tent was
ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forc'd
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
eafy for fear it fhould fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, wz*
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a Sink
to let Water go out, which wouldeife have dro*nM
my Cave. After I had been in my Cave fome-
Time, and found ftil] no more Shocks of the Earth-
quake follow, I began to be more composed; and
now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little Store, and took
a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I did then
and always very fparingly, knowing I could have
no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next-Day, fo that I could not iiir a-
broad, but my Mind being more composed, I ben-
gal! to think of what I had beft do, concluding,
that if the Ifland was Subjed to thefe Earthquakes,
there would be no Living for me in a Cave, but I
muft confider of building me fome little Hut in an
open Place, which I might furround with a Wallas
I had done here, ana To make my felf fecure from
wild Beafts or Men: But concluded, if I ftaid where
I was, Ifliould certainly, one Time or other be
be bury'd alive.
With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my
Tent from the Place where it flood, which was
Jtiffc under the hanging Precipice of the Hi,l, and
which, if it fhould befhaken again, would certain-
ly fall upon my Tent: And I fpent the two next
Days
Days being the iptJi and 20th of April, in Con-
triving where and how to remove my Habitations
The Fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me
that I never flept in quiet j and yet the Apprehen-
sion of lying abroad without any Fence, was al-
moft equal to it: But fall when I look'd abouti
and faw how every Thing was put in Order, how
pleafantly concealed I was,. and how fafe from
Danger, it made me very loath to remove-
In the meanTime it occurred to me, that it would
require a vaft Deal of Time for me to do this, and
that I muft be contented to run the Venture where
I was, till I had formed a Camp for my felf, and
had fecur'd it fo as to remove to it: So with this
Refolution 1 composed my felf for & Time, and re-
folv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to
build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, CTc. in a
Circle as before; and fet my Tent up in it when it
was finifh'd, but that I would venture to ftay where
I was'till it wasfinifh'dand fit to remove to. This
was the 21 ft:
April 2 2. The next Morning I be'giti to confider
o^ Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great Lofs about ,my Tools ; I had three
large Axes and Abundance of Hatchets, (for we
carry'd the Hatchets for Traffick with the Indians)
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all full of Notches, and dull;
and tho'Ihad a Grindftone, I could not turn it and
grind my Tools too ; this coft me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have beftow'd upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and
Death of a Man. At length I cbntriv'd a Wheel
with a String to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty. Note, I had
not.feen any fuch Thing in England, or at leaft
not to take Notice how it was done, tho' fince I
hav^
have observed it is very corfimon there; befideS
that, my Grindftone was very large and heavy*
This Machine coft me a full Week's Work to
bring it to Perfe&ion.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took up
in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Grindftone performing very well;
April 30. Having perceived my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of ky and
reduced myfelf to one JBisket-cake a Day, which
made ftiy Heart very heavy.
May 1. In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, I faw fomething lye
ism the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it look'd
like a Cask; when I came to it, I found a fmall
.Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late
Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck it felf*
I thought it feemed to lye higher out of-the Water
th'an it ufed to do; I examined the Barrel which
was driven on Shore, and foon found it was a
Barret of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water, and
the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone :. Howe*
ver, Tfolfdit farther on Shore for the pre'fent,' and
went on upon the Sands, as near as I could to the
Wreck of the Ship, to look for more.
Wheh I came down to the Ship I found it ftrange-
ly remov'd: The Forecaftle, which lay before bu*
ned in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft fix Foot, and
the Stern, which was* broke to Pieces, and parted
from the reft by the Force of the Sea, foon after
I had left rummaging of her, was tofs'd, as it were,
up, and cafton one Side, and the Sand was thrown
to high on that Side next her Stem, that Whereas'
there was a great Place of Water before, fo that I
could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the
Wreck without fwimming, I could now walk
***t I* v H •„<*
v  " quitS
quite up to her when the Tide was out. I was fur-
prized with this at firft, but foon concluded it muft
be done by the Earthquake; and as by this Vio-
lence the Ship was more broken open than former-
ly, fo many things came daily on Shore, which the
Sea had loofen'd, and which the Winds and Water
rolled by Degrees to the Land.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Defign of removing my Habitation ,• and I bufied
myfelf mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching
whether I could make any Way into the Ship, but
I found nothing was to be expefted of that Kind,
for that all the Infide of the Ship was choak'd up
with Sand: However, as I had learnt not to de-
fpair of any thing, I refolved to pull .every thing to
Pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding that
every thing I could get from her would be of fome
Ufe or other to me.
May i. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece of
a Beam thro', which I thought held fome of the
tipper Part, or Quarter-Deck together, and when I
had cut it thro", I cleared away the Sand as well as
I could, from the Side which lay higheft; bur the
Tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
Time.
May 4. I went a fifhing, but caught not one Fifli
that I durft eat of, till I was weary of my Sport,
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young Dol*
phin. I had made me a long Line of fome Rope
Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught
Fifli enough, as much as Icar'd to eat; all which
I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry.
May y. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Declfs, which I tied together, and
made fwim on Shore when the Tide of Flood
came on.
a . May
May 6>. Work'd on the Wreck, got feveral Jton
Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron Work*
work'd very hard, and cameHome very much tir'd,
and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work, but found the Weight of the
Wreck hadbroke itfelf down, the Beams being cut,
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to lye loofe,
and the Infide of the Hold lay fo open, that I
could fee into it, but almoft full of Water and Sand.
May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day,
May p. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt
feveral Ca ks, and loofenM them with the Crow,
but could not break them up; I felt alfo the Roll
of Englifb Lead, and could ftir it, but it was too
heavy to move.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to
the Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim-
ber and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight
of Iron.
May 15. I carry*d two Hatchets to try if I
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water* I could not make aiy Blow to
drive the Hatchet.
May 16. It had blow d hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appearM more broken by the Force of
the Water; but I ftay'd fo long in the Woods to get
Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me
goia g to the Wreck that Day*
H 2 May
May i j. I faw fome Pieces of the Wreck blown
on Shore, at a great Diftance, two Miles off me,
but refolv'4 to fee what they were, and found it
was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on
, the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome
Things fa much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two
of the Seamens Chefts; but the Wind blowingfrom
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but
Pieces of Timber, and a Hogfbead which had fome
Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand
had fpoil'd it.
x I continud this. Work every Day to the 15th of
June, except the Time neceflary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this Part of my
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that 1
might be ready when it was ebb'd opt, and by this
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-
Work enough, to have built a good Boat, if I
had known how; andalfo, I got at feveral Times,
and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-
Lead.
June 16, Going down to the Sea-fide, I found
a large Tortoife or Turtle; this was the firft I had
feen, which itfeems was only my Misfortune, not
any Defed; of the'Place, or Scarcity ; for had I hapr
pen'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland, I
might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as
I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 1 j. I fpent in cooking the Turtle; I
found in her threefcoreEggs; and her Flefli was to
me at that Time the mod favoury and pleafant x
that ever I tafted in my Life, having had no Flefli,
bat
but of Goats and Fowls, flnee I landed in this
horrible Place.
June 18. Rain'd all Day, and I ftay'd within,
I thought at this Time the Rain felt cold, and I
was fomething chilly* which I knew was not iifual
in that Latitude.
June 19. Very ill, andfliivering, as if the Wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No. Reft all Night, violent fains in
my Head, andfeverifli.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almoft to Death
with the Apprehenfions of my fad Condition, tp
be fick, and no Help: Pray'd to GOD for the;
firfl Time fince the Storm of Hullr but fcarce
knew what I faid, or why; my Thoughts being
all confufed.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
Apprehenfions of Sicknefs.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and fhivering,
and then a violent Head-ach.
June 24. Much better. .
June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held
me feven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint
Sweats after it.
June 26. Better; and having no Vi&uals to eat,
took my Gun, but found, my felf very weak;
however I kilf d a She-Goat, and with much Dif-
ficulty got it Home, and broird fome of it, and
eat; I would fain have ftew'd it, and made fome
Broath, but had no Pot.
June 27. The Ague again fo violent, that I
lay a-Bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I
was ready to perilh for Thirft, but fo weak, I had
not Strength to Hand up, or to get my felf any
Water to drink: Pray'd to God again, but was
light-headed, and when I was not, I was fo igno-
rant, that I knew not what to fay; only I lay and
H 3 cry'd,
ery'd, Lord look upon me^ Lord pity mey Lord have
Mercy upon me: I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for two
or three Hours, till the Fir wearing off, I fell afleep,
and did not wake till far in the Night. When I
wak'd, I found myfelf much refrefli'd, but weak,
and exceeding thirfty: However, as I had no Wa-
ter in my whole Habitation, I was forced to lye till
Morning* and went to ileep again: In this fecond
Sleep, I had this terrible Dream.
I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
the Gutfide of my Wall, where I fat when the
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that 1 faw
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground:
He was all over as bright as a Flame,fo that I could
but juft bear to look towards him; his Counte-
nance was moft inexpreffibly dreadful^ iippoffible
for Words to defcribe; when he ftepp'd upon the x
Ground with his Fees, I thought the Earth trem-
bled, juft as it had done before in the Earthquake,
and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehenfion, as if
it had been filTd with Flafhes of Fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but
he moved forward towards me, with along Spear
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he
came to a rifing Ground, at fome Diftance, he
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice fo terrible, that
it is impoffible to exprefs the Terror of it; all that
I can fay, I linderftood, was this, Seeing all thefe
'Things have not brjought thee to Repentance, novo thou
/haltdie: At which Words, I thought he lifted up
the Spear that was in his Hand to kjll me.
No one, that (hall ever read this Account, will
exped that I iliould be able to defcribe the Horrors
of my Soul at this terrible Vifion; I mean, thate-
ven while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of thofe
Jlqrrors; nor is it anymore poffible to defcnbe
the Impreffion that remain'd upon my Mind when
I awak'd and found it was but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had re-
ceived by the goodlnftru&ion of my Fatherwas then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
Seafaring Wickednefs, and a conflant Converfarjon
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the laft Degree: I do not remem-
ber that I had in all that Time one Thought that
fo much as tended either to looking upwards to-
ward God, or inwards towards a ReHe&ion upon
my own Ways: But a certain Stupidity of Soul,
without De(ire of Good, or Conscience of Evil,
had entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that
the moft hardned unthinking, wicked Creature a-
mong our common Sailors, can be fuppofed to be,
not having the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of
God in Danger, or of Thankfulnefs to God in
Deliverances.
In the relating what is already part of my Story,
this will be the more eafily believ'd, when I fhall
add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fo much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that if was a juft Puniihment for my Sin; my re-
bellious Behaviour agaifift my Father, or my pre-
fent Sins which were great; or lb much as a Pu-
nifliment for the general Courfe of my wicked Life.
When I.was on the defperate Expedition on the
defart Shores of Africa, I never had fo much as one
Thought of what would become of me; or one
Wiffo to God to direct me whether I fhould go, or
to keep me from the Danger which apparently
furrounded me, as well from voracious Creatures
as cruel Savages: But I was meerly thoughtlefs of
God, or a Providence; a<fted like a meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Dictates
of common Scnfe only, and indeed hardly that.
H 4 When
When 1 was deliverd and taken up at Sea by the-
Portugal Captain, well usM, and dealt juftty and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the leaft Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts: When
again I was fhipw'reckM, rujn'd, and in Danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far frofri Re-
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only faid
to my feif often, that I was an unfortunate Dag, and
born to be always referable.
It is true, when I got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and my felf
fpar*d, I was furpriz'd with a kind of Extafy, and
fome Tranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace of
God aflifted, might have come up to true Thank-
fulnefs; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, ocas. I may fay, king glad J
wat alive, without the leaft. Refie&ion upon the
diftinguifhing Goodnefs of .the Hand which had
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre-
ferv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd; or an En-
quiry why Providence had .been thus merciful to
me; even juft the fame common Sott of Joy which
Seamen generally have after they have got fafe aftiore
from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next:
Bowl of Punch, and forget almoft as foon as it is
over, and all the reft of my Life.was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due Gonfide-
ration, made fenfibleof my Condition, howl was
caft on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of hu-
man Kind, put of all Hope of Relief, or Profped
of Redemption, as Toon as I faw but a Profpe£tof
living, and that I fiiould not ftarve and perifti for
Hunger, all the Senfe of my AfRi&ion wore oft^
and I begun tp be very eafy, apply'dmy felf to the
Works proper for my Prefervation and Supply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my Con-
dition , as a Judgment from Heaven, or as the
Wan4
Hand of God againft me; thefe were Thoughts
which very feldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my
Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon me,
and began to affeft me with SerioufnefSj as long as
I thought it had fomething miraculous-in it; but
as foon as ever that Part of the Thought was re-
mov'd, all the Impreffion which was rais'd from it,
wore offalfo, as I have noted already.
Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
dire&ing to the invifible Power which alone di-
rects fuch Things, yet no fooner was the firft Fright
over, but the Impreffion it had made went offalfo.
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent AfRi&ion of my Circum-
ftances being from his Hand, than if: I had been in
the raoft prosperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be fick, and a leifure-
ly View of the Miferids of Death came to place it-
felf before me; when myNSpirits began to (ink un-
der the Burden of a ftrong Diftemper, and Nature
was exhaufted with the Violence of the Fever;
Confcience that had flept fo long, began to awake,
and Lbegan to reproach myfelf with my paft Life,
in which I had fo evidently, by uncommon Wicked-
nefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to lay me under
Rncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in fo vin-
dictive a Manner.
Thefe Reflexions opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence,
.as.well of the Fever, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me,
like praying to God, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended;with Defires or with
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
-and Diftrefsj my Thoughts were confused, the
Con-
Convi&ions great upon my Mind, and the Hor-
ror of dying in fuch a mTferable Condition, rais'd
Vapours into my Head with the meer Apprehen-
fionsj and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I knoW
not what my Tongue might exprefs: But it was ra-
ther Exclamation, fuch as, Lord ! what a miferablc
Creature am I? If I fhould be fick^I (hall certain-
ly die for want of Help , and what will become of
me! Then the Tears burft out of my Eyes, and I
could fay no more for a good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
cajme to my Mind, and prefently his Predi&ion
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this Story,
viz. That if I did take thisfoolifh Step, God would not
hlejs me, and I would have Leifure hereafter to rep ft
upon having neglected his Counfel, when there might be
. none to> affifl in my Recovery. Now, faid I aloud,
my dear father's Words are come to pafs: God's
Juftice has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me: I rejeded the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofture or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy
and eafy; but I would neither fee it my felf, or learn
to know the Bleffing of it from my Parents; I left
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left
to mourn under the Confequences of it: 1 refus'd
their Help and Affiftance who wou'd have lifted me
into the World, and would have made every thing
eafy to me, and now I have Difficulties to ftrug-
gle with, too great for even Nature itfelf to fup-
port, and no Affiftance, no Help, no Comfort, no
Advice; then I cry'd oat, Lord bemy Helpy for lam
in great Diflrefs.
This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it fo,
that I had made for many Years: But I return to
my Journal.'
. y.we
June 28. Having been fomewhat refrefli'd with
the Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely
off, I got up; and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague would return again the next
Day, and now was my Time to get fomething to
refrefh and fupport myfelf when I fhould be ill;
and the firft thing I did3 I fill'd'a large fquare
Cafe Bottle with Water, and kt it upon my Table,
in reach of my Bed; and to take off the Chill
or aguifli Difpofition of the Water, I put about
a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mix'd
them ^ together, then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flefli, and broifd it on the Coals, but could
eat very little; I walk'd about, but was very weak,
and withal very fad and heavy-hearted in theSenfe
of my miferable Condition, dreading the Return
of my Diftemper the next Day; at Night I made
my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which
I roafted in the Allies, and eat, as we call it, in
the Shell; and this was the firft Bit of Meat I had
ever ask'd God's Bleffing to, even as I could re-
member , in my whole Life.
After I had eaten , I try'd to walk, but found
my felt fo weak, chat 1 could hardly carry the
Gun, (for I never went out without that) fo I
went but a little Way, and fat down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea3 which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth :, As
I fat here, fome fuch Thoughts as thefe occurred
to me 1
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have feen
fo much, whence is it produe'd, and what am I,
and all the other Creatu^s, wild and tame, human
and brutal, whence &c we?
Sure
Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power, who
formed the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky; and
who is that?
Then it followed moft naturally, it is God that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on ftrang£-'
ly, if God has made ail thefe Things, He guides
and governs them ail, and all Things that concern
them > for the Power that could make all Things,
muft certainly have Power to guide and direft
them.
If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of
his Works, either without his Knowledge or Ap-
pointment.
And if: nothing happens without his Know-
ledge, he knows that I am here, and am in this
dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens with-
out his Appointment, he has appointed ail this to
befal me.
Nothing occurred to my Thought to contradict
any of thefe Conclufions; and therefore it refled
upon me with the greater Force, that it muft needs
be, that God hath appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miferable Circumftance
by his Dire&ion, he having the fole Power, not of
me only, but of every Thing that happened in the
World. Immediately it followed. .
Why has God done this to me? What have I done
to be thus us'd?
? My Conference prefently cheek'd me in that En-
quiry , as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it
fpokc to me like a Voice; WREtCHl daft thou
ask what thou haft done I Look back upon a dreadful
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf what thou haft not
done 'i Ask, Why is it that09k wen not long ago de~
flroy'd? Why wen thou Mt:0)wnd in Yarmouth
Roads? Kill'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by
the Sake Man of War? Devour'd by the wild Beafts
on
on the Coafi of Africa ?.Or, drown'd HERE, when
all the Crew periflfd but thyfelf? Doft thou ask. What
have I done?
I was ft ruck dumb with thefeRefle<3:ions,asone
aftomWd, and had not a Word to fay, no not to
anfwer to myfelf, but rofc up pcnfivc and fad,
walk'd back to my Retreat, and went up over my
Wall, as if 1 had been going to Bed, but my
Thoughts were fadly difturb'd, and I had no In-
clination to deep •, fo I fat down in my Chair,
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark*
Now, as the Apprehenfion of the Return of my
Diftemper terrify'd me very much, it occurred to
my Thought, that the Braftlians take no Phyiick
but their Tobacco, for almoft all Diftempers;
and I had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of
the Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and fome aJfo
that was green, and not quite cur'd.
I went, dire&ed by Heaven no doubt^ for in
this Cheft I found a Cure, both for Soul and Body3
I open'd the Cheft, and found what I look'd for,
viz,, the Tobacco-, and as the few Books, I had
fav'd, lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles
which I mention'd before, and which to this Time I
had not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination
tolook^nto* I fay, I took k out, and brought
both that and the Tobacco with me to the Table*
What life to make of the Tobacco, I knew not,
as to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it
or no •, but I try'd feveral Experiments with it, as
if I was refolv'd it fhould hit one Way or other:
I fir ft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firft almoft Itupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green and ftrong, and
that I had not been much us'd to it; then I took
fome and fteeped it an Hour or two in fome Rum,
and refqiv'd to take a Dofe of it when 1 lay down ^
and
and Iaftly, I burnt fome upon a Pan of Coals, and
held my Nofe clofe over the Smoke of it as long
as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almoit
for Suffocation.
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much difturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading,
at leaft at that Time; only having opened the Book
cafuaily, the firft Words {that occur'd to me were
thefe, Call on me in the Day of Trouble^ and I will deli-
ver, and thou {halt glorify me. 
The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fome Impreffion upon my Thought at the Time of
reading them, tho* not fo much as they did after-
wards; for as for being delivered, the Word W no
Sound, a6I my fay > to me; the Thing was fo remote,
fo impoffible in my Apprehenfion of Things, that
I began to fay as the Children oilfrael did, when
they were pfomis'd Flefti to ear*, Can God fpread a
Table in the Wildernefs? So I began to fay,Can God
himfelf deliver me from this Place? And as it was
not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this
prevailed very often upon my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impreffion upon
me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd
my Head fo much, that I inclined to deep,- fo I
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, left I fhould
want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed;
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if I call'd upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me; af-
ter my broken and imperfeft Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd the Tobac-
co, which was fo ftrong and rank of the Tobacco,
that indeed I could fcarce get it down. Immediately
> upon
upon this I went to Bed, I found pfefently it flew
up in my Head violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more u'Jl by the Sun it muft
neceflarilv be near Three a Clock in the Afternoon
the next Day; nay, to this Hour, Pm partly of the
Opinion, that I ilept all the next Day and Night,
and till almoft Thvtt that Dav after; for other-
wife I knew not how I (hould lofe a Day out of my
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appear'd
fome Years after I had done; for if I had loft it by
creffingand re-crofling the Line, I (hould have loft
rpore than one Day: But certainly I loft a Day in
my Account, and never knew which Way.
Be that however one Way or other, when I
awak'd 1 found myfelf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and chearfu!; when 1 got up, I
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in fliort, I
had no Fit the next Day, but continued much
alter'd for the better; this was the 29th.
The 30th was my Well-Day of Courfe, and I
Went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far, I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two, fome-
thinglikeaBrand-Goofe,and brought them Home,
but was not very forward to eat them ^ fo I eat fome
more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good.
This Evening I renewed the Medicine which I had
fuppos'd did me good the Day before, viz,, the To-
bacco fteep'd in Rum, only f did not take fo much
as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold
my Head over the Smoke-, however, I was not
fo well the next Day, which was the 1ft of July,
as I hop'd I (hou)d have been •, for I had a little
SpiVe of the cold Fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, anddo7'd myfc'Jf with it as at tirfi; and
doubled the Quantity which I drank
3-1
3. I mifs'd the Fict for good and all, tW I did
not recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after j
while I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, I will deliver
thee, and the Impoffibility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind m Bar of my ever expe&ing
it: But as I was difcouraging myfelf with fuch
Thoughts, it occurred to my Mind, that I pored fo
much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re-
ceiv'd •, and I was, as it were, made to ask my-
felf fuch Queftions as thefe, viz,. Have I not been
deliver'd, and wonderfully too? from Sicknefs?
From the moft diftrefs'd Condition that could be,
and that was fo frightful to me, and what notice
had I taken of it: Had I done my Part, God bad
delivered me, but I had not glorify*d him; that iv to
fay, I had not own'd and been thankful for that
as a Deliverance, and how cou'd I exped greater
Deliverance?
This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneePd down and gave God Thanks a-
loud, for my Recovery from my Sicknefs.
July 4. In the Morning I fook the Bible, and be-
ginning at the New Teftament, I began4erioufly
to read it, and imposed upon myfelf to read a
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myfelf £0 the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts fliou'd engage me: It was not long
after J fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and fincerely affefted with
the Wickednefs of my paft Life: The Impref-
fion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, All
thefe things have not brought thee to Repentance^ ran fe-
rioufly in my Thoughts: I was earneitly begging
of God togivemeRepenrance, when it happened
providentially the very Day that reading the Scri-
pture*
ttire, I came to thefe Words, He is exalted d Prince
and a Saviour to give Repentance, and to give Rem?(fi-
on; I threw down the Book, and with my Heart ag
well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a Kind
of Extafy of Joy, I cry'd out aloud, Jefus, thou Son
of David, Jefus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour,
give me Repentance I
This wa. the firft time that I could fay, in the
true Senfe of the Words, that I prayed in all my
Life; for now I prayed with a Senfe of my Condi-
tion, and with a true Scripture View of Hope
founded on the Encouragement of the Word of
God; and from this time, I may lay, I began to
have Hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to conftrue the Words mentioned
above, Call on me, and 1 will deliver you, in a diffe-
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before; for*
then I had no Notion of any thing being called
Deliverance, but my being delivered from the Cap-
tivity I was in; for tho'I was indeed at large in
the Place, yet the Ifland was certainly a Pnfon to
me, and that in the worfl: Senfe in the World; but
now I learn'd to take it in another Senfe. Now I
look'd back upon my paft. Life with fuel* Horror,
and my Sins appeared fo dreadful, that my Soui
fought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the
Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort
As for nfy folitary Life it was nothing a I did not
fo much as pray to be delivered from ity or think
of it j it was all of no Confideratibn in Compari-
fon to this,* and I add this Part here, to hint to
whoever (lull read it, that whenever they corrie to
a true Senfe ot things, they will find Deliverance
from Sin a much greater Bleffing, than Deliverance
from Affliction.
But leaving this Part* I return to my Journal.
I My
. Part t
My Condition began now to be, tho5 not lefs
miferable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my Mind 5 and my Thoughts being directed by
a conftant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature; I had a great
deal of Comfort within, which till iiow I knew
nothing of: Alfo, as my Health and Strength re-
turned, Ibeftirr'd myfelftofurnifhmy felf with eve-
ry thing that I wanted, and make my way of li-
ving as regular as I could.
From the4th of jfuly to the 14th, I was chiefly
employM in walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs : For it is hardly to be imagined, how low
I was, and to what Weaknefs J was reduced. The
Application which I made ufe of was perfectly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
pra&ife, By this Experiment '> and tho' it did car-
ry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken-
ing me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my
Nerves, and Limbs for fome time.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that be-
'ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moft perni-
cious thing to my Health that could be, efpecially
in t-faofe Rains which came attended with Storms
and Hurricanes of Wind ,* for as tfie Rain which
came in a dry Seafon was always moft accompa-
ny'd with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was
much more dangerous than the Rain-which fell in
September--and Qiiober. :>
I had been now in this unhappyIfland above 10
Months, all JPoffibility of Deliverance from thi&
Condition . feem'd to be entirely takeii fiom, me;
and I firmly believed, that no human^Shape had
everfet Foot upon that Place. Having now fecur'd-
N my
fny Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I
had a great Defire to make a more perfeS Difco-*
very of the Ifland, arid to fee what other Produ-
ctions I might find, which yet I knew nothing
of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Ifland it felf: I went
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought
my Rafts on Shore. I found, after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good;
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any
Water in fome Parts of it, at leaft, not enough to
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceiv'd.
On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
£mz Sa<vanas> or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and
cover'd with Grafs; and on the rifing Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflowed, I
found a great deal of Tobacco green, and growing
to a great and very ftrong Stalk: There were divers
other" Plants which I had no Notion of, or Under-
Handing about, and might perhaps have Virtues of
their own which I could not find out.
I fearched for the Caffava Root, which the Indi-
an* in all that Climate make their Bread of, burl
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes,- but
did not then underftand them. I faw feveral Sugar
Canes, but wild, and for Want of Cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented ray felf with thefe DifcoVeries
for this time, and came back mufing with my felf
what Courfe I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodnefs of any of the Fruits or Plants which
I ftiould difcover, but could bring it to no Conclu*
fioni for in fliort, I had made lo little Obferva-
tion white I was in the Brq/ih, that I knew little
I 2 of
of the Plants in the Field, at leaft v^ry little th&t
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di-
flrefs;
The next Day, the itfth, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going fomething farther than
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook and
the Savanas began to ceafe, and the Country be-
came more woody than before. In this Part I found
different Fruits, and particularly 1 found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes
upon the Trees; the Vines had fpread indeed over
the Trees, and the Clufters of Grapes, were juft
now id their Pome, very ripe and rich.* This was
a fur prising Diicovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them; but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
afhore in Barbaryy the eating of Grapes killed feve*
( ral of our EnghOo Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I found
an excellent Ufe.for riiefe Grapes, and that was to
cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep them as
dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholefome,
as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes might be to
be had.
I fpent all that Evening there, • and went not
back ro my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from
Home. In the Night I took my firft Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well,..and
the next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery,
travelling near four Mil^s, as Imight judge by the
Length of the-Valley* keeping .ftill due North*
with a Ridge of Hills on the South and North Side
of me.
At the End of this March I came to an Open-
ing, where the Country feemed to defcend to the
Weft,
Weft, and a little Spring of frefh Water, which
iffued out of the Side of the HilJ by me, run the
other Way, that is, due Eaft; and the Country
appeared fo frefh, fo green, fo flourifh ing, every
thing being in a conflant Verdure or Flourifh of
Spring, that it looked like a planted Garden.
I defcended a little on the Sick of that delicious
Vale, furveying it with a fecret kind of Pleafure,
(tho* mixt with my other affli&ing Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indefeafibly, and had
a Right of Pofleflion; and if I could convey it, I
might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as any
Lord of a Manor in England. I faw here Abun-
dance of Cocoa Trees, Orange and Lemon,
and Citron Trees; but all wild, and few bear-
ing any Fruit, at leaft, not then: However,
the green Limes that I gathered, were not onl^
pleafant to eat, but very wholefome; and J
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholefome, and very cool and re-
fre filing.
I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and
carry Home; and I refolved to lay up a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
my klf for t'hd wet Seafon, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of
Grapes in one Place, and a letter Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in
another Places and taking a few of each with me,
J traveled homeward, and refolved to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what 1 could make, to
carry the reft Home.
Accordingly, having fpent three Days in. this
Journey, I camfe Home (fo I muft now call my
Tent and my Cave) but before I got'thither, the
I 3 Grapes
Grapes were fpoilt, the Richnefs of the Fruits,
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruifed them, they were good for little or no-
thing; as to the Limes, - they were good, but I
could bring but a few.
The next Day, being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two fmall Baggs to bring Home
my Harveft: But I was furprized, when coming to
my Heap of Grapes, which were fo rich and fine,
when I gathered them, I found them all fpread
about, trod to Pieces, and dragged about, fome
here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and de-
voured: By thjs I concluded there were fome wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Peaps, and no carrying them away in
a Sack, but that one Way they would be deftroy'd,
and the other Way they would be crufh'd with
their own Weight, I took another Courfe; for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them upon the Out-Branches of?{he Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun * and as,for the
Limes and Lemons,, I carry5d as many back as I
could well ftand under.
When I came Home from this Journey* I con-
templated, with great Ple^fure the Fruitfulnefs of
that Valley," and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,
and the Wood, and concluded ihat I had pitch'd
upon a ^lac^to fix my Abode, which was by far
the worll Part of the Country. Upon the whole^
J beg^n to confider of removing my Habitation,
anct.to.lo6k out £or,a, Place equally fafe, as where I
now was Situate, if poffibk, in that pleafant fruit-
ful ft$t of the Iiland.,- \*
This
r »9 ] .
This Thought run Jong in my Head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for fome Time, the Pleafanr
nefs of the Place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to*confi$Ier that I was
now by the Sea-fide, where it was at leaft poffible
that fomething might happen to my Advantage,
and by the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place; and tho* it was fcarce probable that
any fuch thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe
myfelf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoffible,• and that therefore I ought not by any
Means to remove.
However, I was fo enamour'd of this Place,
that I fpent mypch of my Time there for the whole
remaining Part of the Month of July, and tho*
upon fecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not to
remove, yet,I built me,a little kind of a Bower,
and furrounded it at a £>iftance with a firong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well ftak'd, and fiiJ'd between with Jfrufh-
"wood] and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two
or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before; fo that I fancy'd now I
had my Country-Houfe, and my Sea-Coaft-Houfe:
And this Work took me up to the Beginning oi
Augufl.
I had but newly Unified my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on* and
made"me ftick clofe to mv firfl: Habitation; for tho*
I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece
of a Sail, and fpread it very well; yet I had nor
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms-, nor a
Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains ,
were extraordinary,
I 4 About
About the Beginning of Augufl, as Ifaid> I had
finifh'd my Bower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third otAuguft, I found the Grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and indeed, were
excellent good Raifins of the Sun j'fo I began to
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did fo; for the Rains which follow-
ed would have fpoil'd them, and I had loft the
beft Part of my Winter Food; for I had above
two hundred large Bunches of them. No fooner
had I taken them all down, and carry'd moft of
them Home to my Cavey but it began to rain ,• and
from hence, which was the fourteenth of Auguflj
it rain d more or lefs every Day, till the midule of
Otlober; and fometimes fo violently, that I could
not ftir out of my Cave for feveral Days.
In this Seafon I was much furpyz'd with the
Increafe of my Family; I had been concerned for
the Lofs of one of my Cats, who run away from
ipe, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifh-
ment fhe.came home about the End of Augufi,
with three Kittens. This was the more ftrange to
me, becaufe tho' I-had kilfd a wild Cat, as I
call'd it, with my Gun > yet I thought it was a
quite differing Kind from our European Cats; yet
the young Cats were the fame kind of Houfe*
breed like the old one; and both my Cats being
Females, I thought it very ftrange: But from thefe
three Cats, I afterwards came to be fo pefter'd
with Cats, that I was fore'd to kill them like Ver-
min, or wild Beafts, and to drive them from my
Boyfeas much .as poffible.
Frcpi the fourteenth oiAugufi to the twenty
fixtb, inceffant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
Confinement I began to be ftraitued for Food, but
venturing
. cI21 ].,
venturing out twice, I one Day killed a Goat, and
the laft Day, which was the twenty-fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to me,
and my Food was regulated thus: I ear a Bunch
of Raiiins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's
Flefh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broii'd;
(for to my great Misfortune, Iliad no Veflel to
boil or ftew any thing) and two or three of the
Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover by the
Rain, I work'd daily two or three Hours at en-
larging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on
towards one Side, till I came to the Otitfide of the
Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came
beyond my Fence or Wall, and fo I came in and
out this Way: But I was not perfeftly eafy at
lyiug fo open , for as I had managed my felf be-
fore, I was in a perfed Enclofure, whereas now I
thought I lay expos'd, and yet Icould not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the big-
geft Creature that I had yet feen upon the Ifland
being a Goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing. Icaft up the
Notches on my Poft, and found I had been ort
Shore three hundred and fixiy live Days. I kept
this Day as afolemn Faft, fetcmg it apart to Re-
ligious Exercife, proftratirig my (elf on the Ground
with the mod ferious Humiliation, confeffing my
Sins to God, acknowledging his righteous judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
cy on me, thro' Jefus Chrift ,• and having not
tafted the leaft Refrefliment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
Bisket-Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to
Bed, finjfliing the Day as I began it. *
I had
I had all this ti'me obferv d no Sabbath-Day;
for as at firft I had no Senfe of Religion upon my
Mind> I had after fome time omitted to diftin-
guifh the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary fo*r the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
know what any of the Days were; but now ha-
ving caft up the Days, as above, I found I had been
there a Year; fo I divided it into Weeks, and fet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath; tho* I
found at the End of my Account I had loft a Day
or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and
fo I contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and
to writedown only the moft remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other things.
The rainy Seafon,and the dry Seafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide
them fo, as to provide for them accordingly. But
I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this I am going to relate, was one of the moft dis-
couraging Experiments that I made at all. I have
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice which I had fo furprizingly found fpring
up, as I thought, of themfelves, and believe there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice,'and about twen-
ty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper time
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its
Southern Pofition going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground, as
well-as I could with my wooden Spade, and di-
viding it into two Parts, 1 fowM my Grain ,• but
as I was fowing,it cafually. occund to my Thoughts,
that! would not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did
not know when was the proper time for it," fo I
fow'dabout two thirds of the Seed, leaving about-,
a Handful of each.
it
It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that
I did fo, for not one Grain of th^t I fow'd this
time came to any thing ,• for the dry Months fol-
lowing, the Earth having had no Rain after the
the Seed was fown, it had no Moifture to affift its
Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet
Seafon had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been but newly fown.
Finding my firfl: Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagined was by the Drought, I fought for
a moifter Piece of Ground to make another Trial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and,fow'd the reft of my Seed in February^
a little before the Vernal[Equinox; and this having
the rainy Months of March and April to water it,
fprung up very pleafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to few all that I had, I had but a fmall
Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind.
But by this Experiment I was made Mafter of
my.Bufinefs, and knew exa&Iy when the proper
Seafon was to fow; and that I might exped two
Seed-times, and two Harvefts every Year.
While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Difcovery which was of life to me afterwards:
As foon as the Rains were over, and the Weather
began fo fettle, which was about the Month of
November, I made a Vifitupthe Country to my
- Bower, where tho* I had not been fome Months,
yet I found all things juft as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire, ,but the Stakes which I had cut
out of fome Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
(hot out, and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-tree ufually (hoots the firffc Year after
lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to
call
call it, that thefe Srakes were cut from, I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the
young Trees grow; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could ,' and
it is fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they
grew into in three Year; fo that tho3 the Hedge
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia-
meter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might now call
them, foon cover'd it; and it was a corn-
pleat Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry
Seafon.'
This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall; I mean that of my firft Dwelling,
which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in
a double Row, at about dght Yards diftance from
my firft Fence, they grew prefently, and were at
firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, arid afterward
fetVd for a Defence alio, as I fhall obferve in its
Order. \
I found now, that the Seafcns of the Year
might generally be divided, not ihto Summer and.
Winter, as in Europe-, but into the rai^iy Seafons,
and the dry Seafoas, which were generally thus:

Half February y ,
The Rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or
Shorter, as the Winds happened to blow; but this
was the general Obfervation I made: After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Confequence of being
abroad in the Rain, I took Care to furnifli myielf
with Provisions before-hand, that I might not be
obliged to go out; and I fat within Doors as much
as poffible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and
very fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great
Occafion of many things which I had no way to
furnifli myfelf with, but by hard Labour and con-
flantApplication; particularly, I tr>'dmany Ways
to make myfelf a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellcntAd-
vantage to me now, that when I was a Boy, I
ufed to take great Delight in (landing at a Basket-
maker's in the Town where ray Father; liv'd , to
fee them make their Wicker-ware; and being, as
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a
great Obferver of the Manner how they work'd
thofe things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials;
when it cape into my Mind,. that the Twigs' of
that Tree from -Whence I cut my Stakes that grew,
might
might poffibly be as tough as the Sallow, an&
Willows, and Ofiers in England, and I refolv'd
to try.
Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
fmailer Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as
much as I could defire; whereupon I came the next
time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a
Quantity, which I foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them: thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave; and here during the
nextSeafon, I employed myfelf in making, as well
as 1 could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had oc~
cafion; and tho' I did not finifh them very hand-
fomly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for
my Purpofe; and thus afterwards I took Care, ne-
ver to be without them; and as my Wicker-ware
xlecay'd, I made more, efpecially I made ftrong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks,
when I fhould come to have any Quantity of it.
Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employed
a world of Time about it, I beftirr'd myfelf to fee
if poffible, how to fupply two Wants. I had no
Veflels to hold any thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almofi full of Rum,
and fome Glafs Bottles, fome of the common Size,
and others which were Cafe-Bottles fquare, "fo?
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c.' Ihad not fo
much as a Pot to boil any thing , except a great
Kettle which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which
was too big for fuch Ufe as I defir'd it, w&. tp
make Broth, and ftew a Bit of Mpat by itfelf.
'the fecond Thing I would fain have had, was a
Tobacco-Pipe; but it was imptfffible to me to
make
make one \ however I found a Contrivance for
that too at laft.
I employed my felf in planting my fecond Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this Wicker working all
the Summer, or dry Seafon, when another Bufi-
nefs took me up more Time than it could be ima-
gin'd I could fpare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great Mind to
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travelled up
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland ,• I now refolved to
travel quite crofs to the Sea-fhore on that Side:
So taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisfcet-Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raifions in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey. When I had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood, as above, I came within View of
the Sea, to the Weft, and it being a very clear Day,
I fairly defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the Weft, to the W. S. W. at a'very
great Diftance; by my Guefs it could not be lefs
than fifteen or twenty Leagues of£
I could not tell what Part of the World this
might be, otherwife than that I know it muft bz
Part of Americas and as I concluded by all my
Obfertrkfcns, muft be near the Spanijh Dominions
and pethaps was all inhabited by Savages, where
if I flionld hare landed, I had been m a worfe
Condition than I was now; and therefore I ac-
qmefeed in the Difpofiriow of Providence, which
1 bfegan now to own, and to believe, ordered eve-
ry «ihg for the beft; I fay, I quieted my Mind
with this, and left afRi&'ng myklf with- fruitlefs
Wifli^oi being there,
Befides
Bcfidcf;, after fome Paufe upon this. Affair I
coniidcr'd, that if this Land was the Sfanijh Coafty
I fhould certainly, one Time or other, fee fome
Veflel pais or re-pafs one Way or other; but if
not, then it was the Savage Coaft between the Spa-
nish Country and Bmfils^ which, were indeed the
worft oi Savages; for they are Cannibals, or Men-
Earers, and fail not to murther and devour all the
human Bodies that fall into their Hands.
With thefe Confederations I waik'd very, lei?
furely forward. I found that Side of thelfland
where I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the
open or Savana Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers
and Grafs, and full of very fine Woods. I faw A-
bundance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if poffible, to have kept it to be tame, and
taught it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome Pains
taking, catch a young Parrot, for 1 knock'd it
down with a Stick, and having recover'd it, I
brought it home; but it was fome Years before I
could make him fpeak: However, at Jaft 1 taught
him to call me by my Name very familiarly: But
the Accident that fo|lpw'd,tho' it be a Trifle, will
be very diverting in"fts Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey.: I
found in the low Grounds Hares,, as 1 thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly
from all the other Kinds! had met with.-, nor could
1 fatisfy myfelf to eat them, tho' 1 kill'd fcveral:
But I had no need to be venturous * for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too; efpccialiy thefe three Sorts, via, Goats, Pid-
ceons,and Turtle or Tortoile-, which,added to my
Grapes, Leaden-Hall Market could not have fur-
nifh'd a Table better than 1, in Proportion to the
Company, and tho' my Cafe was deplorable
enough, yet 1 had great Caufe for Thankfulnefs.
and
'C.!*9 ]
.that 1 was not driven to any Extremities for Food;
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
, I never travell'd in this Journey above rwo
Miles outright in a Day, or thereabouts; but I
took fo many Turns and Returns to fee what Dis-
coveries 1 could make, that 1 came weary enough
to tfie Place where I refolved to fit down for all
Night* and then I either repos'd myfelf in a Tree,
or furrounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes fet up-
right in the Giround, either from one Tree to
Another, or foas no wild Creature could come at
nie, without waking me.
As foon as I came to the Sea-Shore, I was fur-
prized to fee that I had taken up my Lor on the
worft Side of thclfland * for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas
on the other Side I had found but three in a Year
aqd half. Here was alio an infinite Number of
Fowls of many Kinds,fomeofwhichIhad feen,snd
fome of which 1 had not feen of before, and many
of them very good Meat > but fuch as I knew not
the Names of, except thofe call'd Penguins.
I could have Ihot as many as I pleas'd, but was
Very fparing of my Powder and Shot; and there*
fore had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on: And tho* there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
llknd, yet k was with much more Difficulty that
I could come near them, the Country being flat
and even, and they faw me much fooner than
when I was on the HilL
1 confefs this Side of the Country was much
plearanter than mine, but yet I had not the leaft In-
clination to remove; for as I was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation > it became natural to rpe, and I feem'd all
the while I was here, to be as it were upon a Jour-
ney, and from Horfie: However, I traveird along

about twelvfc Miles-, and then fetting up a great

I m^de a Collar to this little Creature, and with
a String which I made of fome Rope-Yarn which
I always carry'd about me, I led him along, tho'
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower,
and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was
very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had
been abfent above a Month.
I cannot exprefs what a Satisfaction it was to
me, to come into my old Hutch, and lie down in
my Hammock-Bed .-Jhis little wandring Journey,
without fettled Place of Abode, had been fo un-
pleafant to me, that my own Houfe, as I call'd it
to^myfelf* was a perfect Settlement to me/eom-
par'd to that; and it render'd every thing about
me fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never
go a great Way from it again, while it ftould be
my Lot to ft ay on the Ifland.
I repos'd myfelf here a Week, to reft and regale
myfelf after my long Journey; during which, moft
of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of
making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a meer Etomeftick, and to be mighty well acquain-
tied with me. Then I began to think of the poor
Kid, which I had pent in within my little Circle,
and refolv'd to go and fetch it Home/or give it
fame Food; accordingly I went,and found it where
I;-left it,- fpf indeed it*could not get out, but
was almoftjftarv'd for want of Food: I went and
cut Boughs of Trees, and Branches of fqch Shrubs
as I cbtTld find) and threw it over, and having fed
it y t fy'dat as I did before, to lead it away; but
kwa$ fo tame with being hungry , that I had'np
nee&toha^e ty'd it; for it follow'd me like a Dogi
and i^I cor^inuatly fed it, the Creature became fp
loviig^fo gentle, .and fo fond, that it becdifle front
that M&e One of njty Domefticks alfo, and. would
never km^ me -#fterwards.
''K 2 The
The rainy Seafon of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
fame folemn manner as before, being the Anniver-
fary of my Landing on the Ifland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Profpeft of being de-
livered than the firft Day I came there, I fpent the
whole Day in bumble and thankful Acknowledge
merits of the many wonderful Mercies which my fo-
litary Condition was attended with , and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleafed to difcover to me, even that it was
pbffiblC'T Jnight be more happy in this folitary
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of
Society, and in all the Pleafures of the World* That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my folitary State, and the want of Human So-
ciety, by his Pr$fence, and the Communications of
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope for his Eternal Prefence hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how
much more happy this Life I now led was, with
allits miferable Circumftances, than the kicked,
curfed, abominable Life I led all the paft Part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my Joys,* my very Defires alter'd, my Afte*
&ions changed their Gufts, and my Delights were
perfeftiy new, from what they were at my firft
cbming, or indeed for the two Years paft.1;'
: Before, as I walk'd about, either on my Hunt-
ing, or fQr viewing the Country, the Anguifih of
my Soul at my Condition would break >out tipon
me pn afudden, and. my very HeaVt frdu'Id die
within me, to think of the Woods, thfe Mountains,
the Defarts I was in; and'how I was a" Prifoner
lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolt* of the
Ocean,
Oceajj, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without
Redemption. In the midft of the greateft Com-
pofures of my Mind, this would break out upon
me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands,
and weep like- a Child: Sometimes it would take
me in the Middle of my Work, and, I would im-
mediately fit down and figh, and look upon the
Ground for an Hour or two together; and this was
ftill worfe to me; for if I could burftout into Tears,
or vent myfelf by Words, it would go off, and the
Grief having exhaufted itfelf, would abate.
But now I began to exercife my Celt with new-
Thoughts ,• I daily read the Word cf God, and
apply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State.
One Morning being very fad, I opened the Bible
upon thefe Words, I will never, never leave thee, nor
forfake thee', immediately it occurred, that thefe
Words were to me, why e]fe fliould they be dire-
cted in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when I
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken
of God and Man? Well then, faid I, if God does
jiot forfake me, of what ill Confequence can it be,
or what matters it, tho' the World fliould all for-
fake me, feeing on the other Hand, if I had all the
World, .and fliould lofe the Favour and Blefling
of God, there would be no Ccmparifon in the
Lofs.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my
Mind, that it was poffible for me to be more hap-
py in this forfaken, folitary Condition, than it was
probable I fliould have ever been in any other par-
ticular State in the World; and with this Thought
I was going to give Thanks to God for bringing
me-to this,Place.
1 know not what it was, but fomething ftiock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fpeak
thc-Words :, How canft thou be fuch a Hypocrite
K 3 (faid
C x?4 3
(faid I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful fet
a Condition, which however thou may'ft endea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldft rather
pray heartily to be delivered from; fo I ftopt
there: But tho'Icould not fay, I thankedGod*for
being there; yet I fincerely gave Thankjs to God
for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicirng Pro-
vidences, to fee the former Condition of my Life,
and to mourn, for my Wickedneis, and repent. I
never open'd the Bible or (but it, but jny very Soul
within me blefs'd God for dire&ing my Friend in
Englandy without any Order of mine, to pack it
up among my Goods; and for affiftmg me after-
wards co fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship,
Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year; and tho'I have not given the Rea-
der the Trouble of fo particular an Account of my
Works this Year as the firft; yet in general it may
be obfei'ved, that Iwas very feidom idle:; but .ha1*
ving regularly divided my Time, according fo the
feveral daily Employments that were before me,
fuch as, Fbft> My Duty to God, and the reading
the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart fome
time for, thrice every Day: . Secondly, The going
Abto&d with my Gun for Food, which generally
took me rap three Hours in every Morning,, when it
did -not-rain, "thirdly The ordering, curing* pr§-
ferving and cooking what I had kill a or eateh'dior
my Supply; thefe took up great Part of the Day:
Alfoitisto be eoniidered> that the Middle of l the
Day when the Sun was in the Zenithy the Violence
of the Heat was too great to ftir oat;>. fo th^t-
about four Hours in the Evening was.aU^the:£ime
I could bs fuppqfed to work in; with this.Excep-
tion, that fometimes I changed:, my,v. Hours;?$f
Hunting and -Working,,.and went to Werk/.^.tfee
.;,, J^Lorning,
Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the After*
noon.
To this flidrt time allov/d for Labour, I defire
may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my
Work, the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill, every thing I
did, took up out of my Time: For Example, I
was full two and forty Days making me a Board
for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave;
whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-
Pit, would have cut fix of them out of the fame
Tree in half a Day.
. My Cafe was this; it was to be a large Tree
which was to be gut down, becaufe my Board was
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days
a cutting down, and two more cutting off the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Tim-
ber. With inexpreffible hacking and hewing I
reduced both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be-
gun to be light enough to move; then If turned it,
and made one fide of it fmooth, and flat, as a
Board from End to End; then turning that fide
4o?wnward, cut the other fide, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a Piece of Work ,• hut Labour
and Patience carry'd me thro' that and many
other things: I only obferve this in particular, to
fhewthe Reafon why fo much of my timq went
away;wkh fo little Work, viz.. that what might
hfc'.a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a
wft'Labour*, and required a prodigious time to do
alGRtey-and by Hand. (
JButaiotwithftanding this, with Patience and La-
bour! went thro .many things, and indeed every
thing that my Circumftances made neceflary to me
&> do, as will appear by what follows.
K 4 I was
I was now in the Months of November arid jQer
cemler^ expe&ing my Crop of Barley and Rice.
1?he Ground I had mantir'd or dug up for theiri
was nor great; for as I obfenrd, my Seed of eacK
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for
I had loft one whole Crop by fowirig in the dry
Seafon; but now my Crop promised very well,
when on a fudden I found 1 was in Danger of
lofing it all !again by Enemies of feveral Sorts,
which it wasfcarce poffible to keep from it; as;
firft, the Goats, and wild Creatures which I cali'd
Hares, who tafting the Sweetnefs of the Blade,
lay in if Night and Day, as foon as it came up,
and eat it fo- clofe, that it could get no time to
flioot up into Stalk. - • ' - - '" -  *
This 1 faw no Remedy for, but by making an
Enclofure about it with a Hedge, which I did
with a great deal of Toil; and the morfe, becaufe
it required Speed. However, as my Arable Land
was but fmall, fuited to my Crop, I got it totally
well fencdd in about three Weeks time; and Ihoot-*-
ingTome of the Creatures in the Day-time, I fet
my Dog to guard it in the Nighty tying him up to
a Stake at the Gate, where he would ftand and
bark aft Night long; fo in a little time the Ene-*
mies forfook the Place, and'the Corn grew very
ffrdhg and well, and began to ripen apace.
'But as the Beafts ruined me before, while my
'Cotfi was in the Blade, fo the Birds were as likely
tb ruin me now, when it was in the Earj for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I faw
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of 1 know
nOt how many Sorts, who flood as it were -watch-
ing till I fliould be : gone. I immediately let fly
among them (for I always had my Gun with me.)
I had no fooner {hot, but there rofe up a little
Cloud
£lond of Fowls,, which I had not feen at all, froo*
ritoorig the Corn it.felf.
} This touclrdme fenfibly, for Iforefaw, that in
a fe\^ Days they, would devour all my Hopes, that
I fhould 'be fUrv'd, and never be able to raife a
Crop at all, and what to do I could not teli: How-
fever, I refblv'd not to lofe my Corn, if poffible,
tho- I flibuld watch it Night and Day. In the
firft PJace, I went among it to fee what Damage
was already done, and found they had fpoii'd a'
good deal of it* 'but that as it was yet top green
for them, the Lofs was not fo great, but that the
Remainder was like to be a good Crop if it could
befav?d/ *..'*'''
*' I ftald by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I
w&s gone away, and the Event proved it to be fo;
for as I walkM off as if I was gone, I was no foon-
er out of their Sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the Com again. I was fo provoked, that I
could not have Patience to flay till more came on,
knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was,
as it might befaid) a Peck-loaf to me in the Confe-
rence; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd a-
gain, and kill'd three of them. This was what I
wifh'd forj fo I took them up, and ferv'd them as
we ferve notorious Thieves in England, (-viz,:)
Harig'd them in Chains for a Terror to others. It
is impoffible to imagine almoft, that this fhould
have fuch an Effect as it had; for the Fowls would
not only not come at the Corn, but in fhort they
forfoofcaM that Part of the Ifland, and I could ne-
ver fee a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-
Crows bung there.
This
This I was very glad of, you may be fure; and
about the latter end of December* which was our
fecond Harveft of the Year, I reap'd my Crop.
\ was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle t&
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as;
well as I could out of one of the.broad Swords or
Cutlaffes, which I fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my firft Crop was but
fmall, I had no great Difficulty to cut it down: In
Ihort, I reap'd it my way, for I cut nothing off but
the Ears, and <carry'd it away in a great Basket
which I had made, and fo rubb'd it out with my
U*mds: And at the End of all iriy Marvefting, I
found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had
near two Bufhels of Rice, and above two Bufliels
and a half of Barley, that is to fay > by my Guefs, for
I had no Meafure at that time."
However, this, was a great Encouragement to
mej and I forefaw that in time, it: would pleafe
Qpd to fupply me with Bread: And yet here I
Was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to
grind or rnake^Meal of my Corn, or indeed how
to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how
to. joake Bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
ktievj/ not how to bake ir. Thefe things being abided
to,my Defiie of having a good Quantity for Store,
aftdito fecure/a<constant,Supply, I-refoiv'd not to
tafleMany..of jtfai$ Crop, but to preserve it all for
Seed iigwft the next Seafon, and .in the mean time
tp-i^m^loy all.my Study,and Hours of working to
jiccomtplifia this grqat Work of providing toyfelf
\tfirii Corn and Bread. •- -
Jtmight be truly faid, that riow I worfc'd for
npiy Stead. 'Tis a little wonderful*; and.what I be-
lieve few People have thought much upm^wz.) the
flrange Multitude of little things necefiary ir* the
'Pro-
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dreffing, Making
and Finishing this one Article of Bread.
I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature,
found this to be my daily Difcouragement,and was
made more and more fenfibleof it every Hour, even
aft^r I had got the firft "Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a Surprize.
Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, thisl-conquer'd,
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before;
but this did my Work but in a wooden manner;
and cho? it.coft me.a great many Days to make it,
yet for want of Iron it not only wore out thefoon-
er, but made my Work the harder, and made it
be performed much worfe.
However, this I bore .with, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the Bad-
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was
fow'd, I.had no Harrow, but was forced to go
over it .my felf, and drag a great heavy Bough of a
Tree over it, to fcratch ity as it may be calTd, ra-
ther thap jRake or Harrow it.
Whenit .was growing and grown, Lhaveob-
ferv'd already how many things I wanted, to
fence, it,: fe&Mre ir, mow or reap ic, cure and
carry it Home, thrafl?, part it from the Chaff,
and fave it. Then I wanted a Mill to grind it,
Sieves to, drefs it, Yeaft and Salt to make: it into
Bread* and an Oven to bake it; and yet all thefe
things I did without, as fliall be obferv'd; and
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort ^nd Ad-
vantage to me too* All this, as I faid* made
every thing laborious, and tedious to me, but that
there,was no Help for\ neither was my time fo
much JLofs to me, becaufe as I had divided it, a
certain Part of it was every Day appointed*to
thefe
['MO']
thefe Works; and as I refolv'd to ufe none of th c
Corn for Bread till1 I had a greater Quantity "by
me, I had the* next fix Mpnths to apply my felf
wholly by Labour and4nv§Btipii; to furnifti my fdf
with Utevnfils proper for the performing all the O-
perations necetfary tor the making the Corn (when
I had it) fit for my Ufe. ,
Butfirft, I was to prepare more Land, foe I
fcad now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of
Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week's Work
at leaftto make me Spade, which when it w$s
done was but a forry one indeed, and very heavy,
and required double Labour to wotk with it;
however I went thro* that, and fow'd tny Seed in
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houfe as I could find thenn to my Mind, and
fenced them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had fet
before, and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knew I fhould have a Quick or Lit
ving Hedge, that would want but little Repair.
This Work- was not fo little as to take me up lefs
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that time
was of the-wet Seafon, when I could not go &
broad. ,-'.'*'.
Within J)oors, that is, when it rained, and I
could not go-out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occasions; always oblervmg, that all the
while I was at Work, I diverted my felf with talk-
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak;
and Iquicklylearned him to know his own Name,
and a,t laft to fpeak it out pretty loud, POLL,
which was the firJft Word I ever heard fpoken in
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. .This
therefore was not my Work, but an Affiftant to.my
Work j for now, as Ifaid, Lhada great Employ-
ment upon my Hands, as follows, {viz,,) I had
Ions
long ftudy'd , by feme Means or other, to make
myiclf fome Earthen Veffels, which indeed I wane-,
ed forely, but knetoftet where to come at them:
However, qonfidering the Heat of the Climate, I
did not doubt but it I could find out any fueh
Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as mighty
being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough, and ftrong
enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing
that was dry, and required to be kept fo > and
as this was neceflary in the preparing Corn,
Meal, &c. which was the Thing I was upon, I
refolved to make forrie as l^rge as I could, and fit
only to ftand like Jars to hold what fhould be put
into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me j to tell how many aukward Ways I
tobk to raife this Pafte, what odd mifcapen ugly
Things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the Clay not being ftiff enough to
bear its own Weight; how many crack'd by the
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too
haftily; and how many fell in Pieces with only re-
iriovtng, as well before as after they .were dry'd.;
and in a word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it, I could not make above two
large Earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jarrs,
in about two Months Labour.
However, as the Sun bak'd thefe two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and let
them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets,
which I had made on purpofe for them, that they
might not break,* and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I fluffd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pots being to ftand always dry , I thought would
hold
L *4» ]
hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal., when
the Corn was bruifed < ,
Tho' 1 mifca&ied fa mmh in my Pefign for
large Pots, yet I made fev$xM(mikt things with
better Succefsj fuch as littLe found Pots, flat Difh-
fcs, Pitchers apd Pipkins, and ^ny, things my Hand
^urn'd to, and the Heat of?the Sun bak'd them
ftrangely hard.
But all this would not anfwer my; End* which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thde could
do. It happened after fome time, making a pretty
large Fise ior cooking my J^eat, when I .went to
put it out after I had done with it, I foufid< a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-watfe Vef&lsiin the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Scone, and ted as^Tile,
I was^agreeably furpnVd to fee it, and faid to my
felf, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken, . *.
This fet me to ftudying how to order my Fire,
fo as to make it burn me fome Pots. I had no
notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters, burn in; or
of glazing them with Lead, tho* I had fome Lead
to <lo it with; but I plac'd three large Pipkins,
and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another,
and placed my Fire-wood all round it with a great
Heap Of Emfcers under them; I ply'd the<Fire
wirhirefli Fuel round the Outfide, and upon the
Top>Ktill I faw the Pots in the Inflde red hot quite
*hro', .and obferv'd that they did not crack at all >
wh<en I faw them clear red, I let them .-Hand. in.
that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one, of:
them, tho'itdidnot crack, did melt or run, for
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted:,
by the Violence of the Heat, and would? haMe mm
iiito Glafs if I had gone on; fo I flacfe'd my Fire'
gradually y till the. Pots began to abate of ^erted
Colour
Colour, and watching them all Nighr, that I
might not let the Fire abate too faft, in the Mor-
ning I had three very good, I will hot fay hatid-
fome Pipkins, ml two other Earthen Pots, as hard
burnt as coultf be defit'd * and one of them per-
fe&iy glaz-d with the Runnfag &f the Sand.
After this Experiment* i need not fay that-1
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my life; but
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one fnay fuppofe,
when I had fro Way of making them^ but as the
Children make Dirt-Pyes, or as a Woman would
make Pyes that never learnt to raife Pafte. - -
No joyat a Thing of fo mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made < ah
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire-, and I had
hardly Patience to ftay till they were cold, before
1 fet one upon the Fire again, with fome Water in
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did adtnirabhr
well; and with a Piece of a Kid I made fome very
good Broth, though 1 wanted Oatmeal, and fm-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it fo go^d
as I would have had it been. . , j ,
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to ftamp or beat fome Corn in; for as to the
Mill, there was no Thought at arriving td that
Perfe&ion of Art, with one Pair of Hands. Tafup-
ply this Want I was at a great Lofs* for of all
Trades in the World I was as perfe&ly unqualified
for aStone-Cutter,as for any whate very neither had
1 any Took to go about it with. 1 (pent maay a
Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut
hollow j and make fit for a Mortar, and could find
none at all, except what was in the folid Rock,
and which J had no Way to dig or cut out; nor in-
deed: were the Rocks in the Iftandof Hardnefe fuf-
fcient* but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,
which
which would neither bear the Weight of a heavy,
Peftle, Or wopld break che Corn Without filling itf
with Sand : So after a great deal of Time loll in
Searching for a Stone, I gave it over, ind tefolvM
fo look out a great Block of hard Wood, which
1 found indeed much eafier; and getting one as
big as I had Strength to Hit, I rounded it, and
form'd it on the Outfide with my Axe andHatchet*
and then with the Help of Fire and infinite Labour;
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brajil
make their Canoes. After this, I made a great hea-
vy Peftle or Beater^ of the Wood-called the Iron-
Wood,, and this I prepared and laid by againft I
had my next Crop of Corn, when I proposed to
my felf to grind, or rather pound, my Corn into
Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve^ or
Searfe, to drefs pay Meal, and to part it from the
Bran and the Husk, without which I, did not fee
it poffible I could have any Bread. This was a
moft difficult thing, fo much as but to think on;
for to be fure I had nothing like the neceflary thing
to make it; I mean fine thin CanvaSi or Stuff to
fearch the Meal through.. And here I was at a full
Scop for many Months; nor did I really know
what to do; LinnenI had npne left, but what was
meer Rags; I had Goats Hair, but neither knew
I how to weave ft, or fpin it; and had I known
how, here was no Tools to work it with,- all the
Remedy that I found for this, was. That atlaftl
did remember I had among the Seamens Clothes
which were fav'd out of the Ship, fome Neckcloths
ofCallicoe orMuflin; and with fome Pieces of
thefel made chree fmall Sieves, but proper enough
for the Work; and thus Imadefliift for fome Years;
how | did afterwards, I (hall (hew in its Place.
Tt
lie
The bating,Part .was the next thing to be ton*
fider'd, and how I fliould make Bread when I came
to have Corn,-for firft I had no Yeaft. As to that
Part, as there was no fupplying tbe Warn:* ib I did.
not coneern.my felf much about it: But for an
Oven, I was indeed in great Pain. At length I
found quit an Experiment for that alfo, whidi was
this; I made fprne Earthen Veflels very broad, but
not deep; that is toAy, about two FoorBiame«r
ter, and notabove nine Inches deep; thefe I burnt
in the Eire, as I had d.op&the pother, and laid them
by; and when I wanted to bake, I made^a great-
Fire; upon: my Hearth'hwhfch I had pay'd with
fome fqu&re /Tiles of. my* own making a$d burning
alio; btit I ftiould not calt them:.%uat£.-
When the Fire-wQQd was bfimt pteffy much into
Ember % or live Coals, I drew* them MtwMd jipon -
this Hearth, fo as to cover it all oven, a&4 there!
let them lye, till the Hearth; wa$ veryhot;. then
fweeping away all the E^ibers^.I fet down toy
Loaf, or Loaves, ajid whelming dpwn thefEarth-
en Pot upon them, -drew the Embesis all x§und the
Outfide of the. Pot, to keep in, and: a^di to the
Heat; and thus, as well as in the;beft P veil in the
Worlds I bak'd my Barley-Loaves, and, became in
little time a meet Paltry-Cook into theJB^rgain;-
for I made myfelf feveral Cakes of the Rice and
Puddings; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I
any Thing to put into them, fuppofing I had,^ ex-
cept the Flefh either of Fowls or Goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all thefe things
took me upmoft Part of the third Year of m>y A-
boad here j for it is to be obferv'd, that in thfc In-
tervals, of thefe; Things, I had my new Harveftand
Husbandry to managej for I reap'd my Corn in its
Seafon, and carry*d it Home as well as I could, and
Uid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, ©ill had.
Pare! h Time
Time to. rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrafh
it on, or |nftrument to thrafh it with.
And now indeed .my Stocky of Corn encreafing, I
really wanted, to build my Barns bigger: I wanted
a Place to )ay it up in; for the Increafe of the Corn
now yielded ,me fo much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Buftels, and of the Rice as much, or
ftiore; infomuch, that now I refolved to begin to
ufe it freely, for my Bread had been quite gone a
great while ,• alfo I refolv'd to fee what Quantity
would be Efficient for me a whole Year, and to
low but once a Year.
Upoa the whole, I found ,that the forty BuSiels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
confume in a Year; fo I refolved to fow juft the
fame Qaanrtty every Year that I fow'd thelaft, in
hopes that fueh a Quantity would fully provide me
with Bread, .#<?.
All the wjjile thefe things were doing, you may
be lure my/Thoughts run many times upon the
ProLpeapf Land which I had feen from the other
bide of the Ifland, and I was not without fecret
Withes thhfr 1" were on Shore there, fancying the
feeing .ihej^iain Land, and an inhabited Country,
I might find feme Way or other to convey my felf
father*/»and perhaps at lait find fome Means of
Jifcape.'
But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Dangers of fuch a Condition, and howl might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have Reafon to think far worfe than- the Li-
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in-
to their Povyer, X fhould run a Hazard more thaf>a
Thoufcnd to one of being kill&Nand perhaps of be-
ing eaten,- for I had heardthatthe People of the Car-
nthauGotQs were Cannibals, or Men-eater? f and
i kne'w by.the Latitude/ that I could not be far oft
*• '"from
from that Shore. That fuppofe they were not Can"
nibals, yen that they might kill me, as many Euro-
pans who had fallen into their Hand& had been {err
ved, even when they had been ten or twenty toge-
ther; much more I that was but one/ and could
make little or no Defence. All thefe things,* I fay,
which I ought to have confider'd well of, and did
caft up in my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up
none of my Apprehenfions at firft; but my Head
run niightily upon the Thought of getting over to
the Shore.
Now I wifh'd for my Boy Xury> and the Long-
Boat with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with which
I faif d aboVe a Thoufand Miles on the Coaft of A-
frick ; but this was in Tain. Then I thought I would
go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have
faid, was blown up upon the Shore a great Way in
the Storm* when we were firft caft away. She lay
altnoft where fhe did at firft, but npt quite,* and
was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the
Winds, almoft Bottom upward, againft a high
Ridge of beachy rough Sand ,• but no Water about
her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launched her into the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brafels with her eafily enough; but
I might have eafily forefeen, that I could no more
tutn her, ajid fet her upright upon her Bottom, than
t could remove the Ifland. However, I went tp the
Woods^ and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, refolv'd to try what I could do;
fugge/ling to my felf, that if I could but turn her
cloven, I might eafily repair the Damage fhe had
receivedt, and fhe would be a very good Boat, ahd
I might go to Sea in'her very eafily. *
I" ipar d no Pains indeed in this Piece of fruitlefs
Itoil, and fpent, I think, three or four Weeks a-
L 2 bout
bout it •, Jit laft finding it impoffible to heave it up
with my little Strength., I fell to diggingaway the
Sand to undermine it, and fo to make it fall
down, fetting Pieces ot Wood to thruft and
guide it right in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir
it up again, or to get under it, much left to move
it forward towards the Water-, fo 1 was fore'd
to give it over-, and yet, tho' I gave over the
Hopes of the Boat, my Dcfire to venture over
for the Jvl^in increafed, rather than decreafed*
as the Me.-tns for it feem'd impoffible.
• This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not poffible to make my felf a Canoe or Peria-
g^,fnch as the Natives of tnofe Climates make,
even vwithout Tools, or, as 1 might fay, without
flares, viz,, of the Trunk of a great Tree. This
I not only thought poffible, buteafy, and pleased
myfelf extreamly with the Thoughts of marking
it,and with my having much more Convenience
for it than any of the Negroes or Indians \ but not
at all coniidering the particular Inconveniences
which I lay under, more than the Indians did, viz,.
WantofHandstomoveit,when it was made, into
the Water; a Difficulty much harder for me to
furmount, than all the Confequences of Want of
Tools could be to them: For what was it to me,
that when I had chofena vaftTree in the Woods,
I might with great Trouble cut it down, ifaftqr I
might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the
Outfide into the proper Shape of a Boat,, and
burn or cut out the In fide to make it hollow, fo
to make a Boat of it. if after all this, I muff fcaye
it juft there where 1 found it, and was not able to
launch it Into the Water.
One would havethought, I could not h#Vc had
the leafi: Rdfledion upon my Mind of my Circum-
ftance,
ftance, while I was making this Boa$, but I fhould
have immediately thought how I fhou d get it into
the Sea; but my Thoughts were' fo intent upon
my Voyage over the^ Sea in it, thla& I never once
confider'd how I fhould get it off of~£he Land;
and it was really in its own Nature more eafy for
me to guideit 6verk forty five Miles of Sea, than
about forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to
fet it a float in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat the moft like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his Senfes
awake. I pleas'd myfelf with the Defign, with-
out determining whether I was ever able to under-
take if, not but that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a
Jtop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anfwer which I gave myfelf, Let't firftmdke it, I'll
warrant fllfindfome PVay or other to get it alongy when
'tis done.
This was a moft prepofterous Method , but the
Eagetnefs of my Fancy prevaifd, and to work I
went. I fellM a Cedar Tree: I queftion much
whether Solomon ever had fuch a one for the Build-
ing of *he Temple &t Jerufalem. Ic was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, ahd four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty two Foot, after which itlef-
(Wd fdr a while, and then parted into Branches:
It'^is hot Without infinite Labour that I fell'd
rl}iis Tree: 1 was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at itWttte+&btttfm. I was fourteen more get-
.ting the Branches and Limbs, and thevaft fpread-
%g'Jift&d of it* cut off, which I hacked and hew'd
through with 'j^xe and Hatchet, and inexpreffible
Eabahr: After this, it coft me a Month to (hape
it,,'and dub it to a Proportion, ahd to Fomethiug
U|e the Bottom of a Boat, that ft might fwim up-
1-5 ~ k right
right as it ought to do. It coft: me near three
Months more to clear the Infidc, and work it out
{cy as to make 'an exaft Boat of it: This I did in-
deed without Fire, by mere Mallet and duffel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it to
be a very handfqm feriagua, and big enough to
have carried fix and twency Men, and confequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat'was really
jnuch bigger than 1 ever faw a Canoe y or ^Periaguay
that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
weary Stroke it had cod, you may be fure; and
there remained nothing but to get it into theWater;
#nd"had I gotten it into the Wate/-, I make no que-
/tioiij but I fhould have began the maddeft Voyage
and the qioft uhlikely to be performed, that ever
was undertaken.
But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'd me, thopgli they coft me infinite Labour too.
It lay aboift pnfe hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more: But the firft Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek : Well,' to take zr
way this Discouragement, I refolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and forruke a Declivi-
ty: Thisllbeguivand it coft me 3 prodigious deal
of Pain$; but" who grudges Pains,, that ha>e their
Deliverance In View? But when this was work'd
througlj, and this Difficulty man£g*<J, it w*s AiU
much at one; for" I could no more fax the Canoe,
than I could the other Boat/"'
Then I meafur'd the Diftance of G round*' and
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canat, to krirjg the* Wa-
ter up, the Canoe,' feeing I could not' brfrig the
Canoe ilowp to the Water: Well, I began this
Work^ arid* when J began to enter into it, atid ca-
^uJaccd h$w dc,ep it was to be dug, how bro,ad,
how
how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, that by
the Number of Hands I had, being none but my
6wn,:.itmuft have been ten or twelve Y^ars; before
I ftioukl have gone, $EOughwithjt 1 for the Shore

with great Relu&ancy, I gave this Attempt over
alio. ?,':, ..7:
This griev'd me heartily, and now I faw, tho*
too late, the Folly of begining a Work before we
count the Coft, and before we judge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this Work, I finifti'd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniversary with
the fame pevotipn, and with as much Comfort as
ever before; for by a conftant Study, and ferious
Application of the Word of God, and by the Af-
fiftance of his Grace, I gain'd a diflerent Know-
edge from what I had before. Ientertain'd diffe-
rent Notions of things. I look'd howaipon the
World as athing remote, which I had nothing- to
dpswithf nQjExpedation from, and indeed no De-
fires abputV In a word, I had nothing indeed to
do with iti nor, was ever like to have j.fol thought
itilook'd as>we may perhaps look upon ir hereafter,
s<vi&! as a ;Place I had lived in, but was comeout of
.Jkf an4; well might I fay, as Father Abraham to
jpiygSj, JBetv$eeft me and thee is a great Gulf }%fixed.
i :Tin the jfirft Place, I was removed from a 1 tfae
Wickedn^fs of the World here: I had neither the
Luft oftheFIefby the Luft of the Eye, or the Pride of
. Life,. I had nothing, to covet * for I had all that I
 ,was now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the
v*Vhole Manor $ or if I pJeas'd I might call my felf
iKing, pr Emperor over the whole Country which
. I had Pofleflion of There were no Rivals: I had
- np .Competitor, npne to dilute Sovereignty or
L 4 Com-
Command with me. I might have raiVd Sh i>
Loadings of Corn; but Lhad no Ufe for it; fo I Jet
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occafion.
I had Tortoife or Turtles enough; but now and
then one was as much as I could put to any Ufe. I
had Timber enough to have built 3 Fleetof Ships.
I had Grapes enough to haye made Wine^ or to
have cur'd into Raifins, to have loaded that Fleet
when they, had been built.
But ail I could make ufe of, was, All that was
valuable. J had enough to eat, and to fupply my
Wants, and, what was all the reft to me? If I
kill'd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog miift eat
it, or the Vermin, If I fcw'd more Corn than I
could eat, it muft be fpoilU The Trees that I
cut down were lying to rot on the Gtound: I
could.make no more Ufe of them than for Fewel,
andthatlhad.no Occafion for, but to drefs my
Food. . , j.
In a-Word, the Nature and Experience of
Things dilated to me upon juft Reflection, that
all the good Things >of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufe; and that
wharever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we ^njoy as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The moit,covetous griping Mifer in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetoufnefs,
if he had been in n\y Cafe; for I poflefled infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for Deiire, except it wa« of things which I had
not, and they were but Trifles, tho* inderd' of
great Ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par-
cel of Money, as welJ Gold as Silver, abqve thirty
fix Pounds Sterling * Alas! there the tufty forry
ukk(s Stuff la>; 1 had no manner of*Bi$nc&
for it; andiofDcn thought with my felf, that I
wojJd hav'e giv<n a Handful of k .for a Grofs of
Tobacco-
TobaccorPipes, or for a Hand-miil to grind my
Corn; nay, I would have given it ail for Sixpenny-
worthof Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or
for a Handful of Peafe and Beam, and a Bottle of
Ink: As it was, I had not the leaft Advantage by
it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Drawer,
and grew mouldy with, the Damp of the Gave, in
the wet Seafonj and if I had had the Drawer full
of Diamonds, it had been the fame Cafe; and
they had been of no manner of Value tome, be-
caufe of no Ufe.
I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in itfelf than it was at firft, and much eafier
to my Minds, as well as to my Body. I frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefs, and ad-
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I learned
to look more upon the bright Side of my Condi-
tion, arid lefs upon the dark Side; and to confider
what I mjofdi rather than what I wanted; and
this gave me fometimes fqch fecret Comforts, that
I cannot exprefs them; and which I take Notice
of here, to put thofe difcontented People in mind
of it, \frho cannot enjoy comfortably #hat God
has given them, becaufe they fee, and covet fome-
thing thit he has not given them. All oiir Dis-
contents about what we want, appeared tome to
fpring from the Want £f Thankfoinefsfor what we
have*' : - ;
Another Rtfledioh was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlt&Would be fo to any one that ihould fall
into ftteh Difitefe as mine was ; and this was to
compare my prefent Condition with what I at firft
expelled it ihould be; nay^ with wfajjt it w^uld
certainly haVe been* if the good Providence of
God had tjot wonderfully ordered^the Ship to be
caft up nearer to the Shore, where I nflt only could
come
come at her, but could bring what I got out of her
to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without
which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons
for Defence, or Gtin-powder and Shot for getting
my Food. ,
I fpent whole Hours* I may fay whole Days, in
repiefenting to myfelf in the moft lively Colours,
how I muft have a&ed, if I had got nothing out
©f the Ship; how I could not have fo much as
got any Food, except Fifh and Turtles; and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I muft
haveperiih'dfirft: That! ftould have liv'd, if I
had not peri&'d, like a meer Savage: That if I
had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
1 had no way to flea or open them* or part the Flefli
from the Skin and the Bowels , or to cpt it up;
but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with
my Claws like a Beaft.
ThefeRefle&ions made me very fenfibleof the
Goodtiefs of Providence to me, and vefcy thankh 1
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardships
and Misfortunes: And this Part alfo I cannot but
recommend t& the Refle&ion-of thofe whot-areaft
in their Mifery to fay,* Is a&y JffltEiionMke mine!
Let them con?fider, how mux^hworfe the Cafes of
fome People ate; and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.
1 had another Refte&ion which affifkd mc alfo
to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and this was
comparing my .prefect Condition with what I had
deferv'd3 Und had therefore Reafbn to expert torn
the Hand :of Prpvidenqe, I had lii/d a dtteadiul

3$<?t<he*S neither had they been wanting to*me m
their e#ly*JEndeavo&rs, to infnfe a religious Awe
pf Gfed into my Mind, a Scnfe of my Duty., and
of
of what the Nature and End of my Being reguir'd
of me. But alas! falling early into the Sea-faring
Life, which of all the Lives is the moil deftitute
of the Fear of God, tho' his Terfors are always
before them; I fay, falling early into the Sea-fa-
ring Life, arid into Sea-faring Company, all that
little Senfe of Religion which I had entertain'd,
was laugh t out of me by my Mefs-Mates, by a
a harden'd defpifing of Dangers, and the Views
of Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfence from all manner of Opportunities to con-
verfe with any thing but what was like my felf, or
to hear any thing that was good, or tended to-
wards it.
Sp void was I of every thing that was good, or
of the leaft Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greateft Deliverances I enjoy'd, fuch
as my Efcape from Saffe, my being taken up by the
Porttiguez,e Matter of the Ship, my being planted
fo well in the Brafih, myreteiving the Cargo from
England; and the like, 1 never once had the Worct
ThaHk God, fo much as on my Mind, or in my

as a Thought to pray to him; or fo much as id fay,

Name of God, * unlefs it wa§ to fwear by, and
blafpheme it.
I had tctVi^le Reflexions upon iriy Mind for ma-
ny Months, as I have already oBferv'd, on the Ac-
cOunt'oPmv wicked and hardened Life paftj and
when Hook d about me, and confider'd wh#t par-
ticular Provtdfences had attended me fince my co-
ming into thft Place, and how God had dealt boun-
tifully* with me; had not only pimifiied me lefs tlian
my Iniquity had deferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro-
vided "for m*e J this gave me great flop^s that my
^Rfepen-
Repentance was accepted, and that G O D,had
yet Mercies in Score for me.
With thefe Regions I work'd my Mind up,
not only to Resignation to the Will of God in the
prefeni: Difpbfitiorj of my Ciraimftances, but even
toafincere Thpkfutnefs for my Condition; and
that t who^ks yet a liVing Man, £ughf not to

My Ink, as I obferv'd, had been gone for fome
Time, all but a very little;, whicfi I eek'd out with
Water a little and a little, tilj it was fo paJe it
fcarceleft any Appearance of Bjack upon the Pa-
per: As long as it Jafted 1 made life of it to mi-
nute down the Days of the Month on which any,

a ftrapge Concurrence of Days ip the various Pro-
videnceswhich befel me, and which, it 1 had been
fu perflation fly inchVd to obferve Days as fatal or
Fortunate, 1 might have had Reafon to have
look'd upon with a great deal of Curiofity.
Firft, I had obferv'd, thatjhe fame Day that I
broke away from my Father and my Friends, and
run away to Hull in order to go to Sea, the fame
Day afterwards 1 was taken by the Salle Man of
War, aVd *aade a Slave.
^ The Jam? Day of the Year that I cfcaped out
of tl^e/jWreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Roadv
that fame Pay-Year afterwards I made my
, Efc^pc froijft Sale in the Boat.
The fame Day of the Year I was born on,(W.)
the 30th of September, the fame Day 1 had my Life
fo miraculoui^y faved 2<5 Years after, when I was
qitt on Sl]dre in this Ifland •> fo that my w/^ked
Life and folitary Life began both on a Day.
The hext Thing to my Ink's being wafted*
wa$ t[ptof,iqy Bread, Ijmean the Bisket which
1 bj-qught qqt of the Ship: This I had husb^pded
to the Uftjptegree5 allowing myfelf but one Cake
of Bread a Day, for above a Year ; and jyet I
was qitite^khont Bread for near a Year i?ef<?re
I^ocany Cprn of my owa; and great R.AjTon I
had to fc^e thankful that I had any at all, tm get-
ting u being, as has been already obfervetfL next
to miraculous.
My
My Clothes began to decay too mightily: As to
Linnen, 1 had had none a good while, except fomc
checqaer'd Shirts which I found in theCheftsofthe
other Seamen, and which I carefully preferv'd, be-
caufe many Times 1 could bear no other Clothes
on but a Shirt; and it was a very great Help to me
that I had among all the Mens Clothes of the Ship
almoft three Dozen of Shirts. There were alfo fe-
VtUl thick Watch-Coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot,to wear *
and tha' it is true, that the Weather was fo violent
Hot, that there was no need of Clothes, yet I could
not go quite naked -, no, tho* I had been inclined
to it, which I was not, nor could not abide the
Thoughts of it, tho'I was all alone'
TheReafbn why I could not go'quite naked,
was, I could not bear the Heat of the Sun io well
when quire naked, as with fome Clothes on * nay,
the very Heat frequently blifter'd my Skin J Where-
as with a Shirt on, the Air itfelf made fbhie Mo-
tion, and whittling under th#t Shirt, was twofold
cooler than without it: No more could I ever bring
myfelf to go out in the Heat of the Suti without a
Cap or a Hat * the Heat of the Sun beating wic h
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, wobld give
me the Head- Ach prefently, by darting f6 dfrfealy
on myHtad, without a Cap or a Hat oti; fafhat
1 could not hear it •, whereas if 1 put on my Hat,
ft would prefently go away, ''
Upon thofe Views I began to confider iWcmt put-
ting the few Rags I had, which I caUWGJotfcsJ
into fome Order: 1 had wcrne out all the Wiflte-
coats I had, and my Bufinefs was iidw*tortry*if I
could not make Jackets out of the gifeat Watch-
Coats vtrhich I had by me3 and wknTuch Siftfcr
Materials as I had-, fo I fetto work't'Tkylbmg*
or rather indeed a Botcfting^ for FmadenWf
piteous
piteous Work of it. However, I made fliift to
make two or three new Waftecoats, which I hoped
would ferve me a great while; as for Breeches or
drawers, I made but a very forry Ihifc indeed, till
afterward.
I have mentioned, that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and I had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which means fome of them were fo
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others
it feems were yery ufeful. The firft thing I made
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Outfide to (hoot off the Rain; and
this I performed fo well, that after this I made me
a Suit of Clothes wholly of thefe Skins, that is to
fay, a Waftecpat and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loofe, for they were* rather wanting to keep
me cool, than to ketpme warm. Imufl not omit
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made;
for if I was a biad Carpenter, I was a yvovfp Taylor.
However, they were fuch as I made very good
fhift with-, adid wHbql was abroad; if ]i happened
to rain, the Hair of the^Waftecoat md Cap bein<*
outejrmoft, I was kepr^€ryMiry. -" &
After this I fpent a great <kal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella. I \as indeed in great
Want of, one, and had a great Mind to make one,
I had feen them made in the Brajilsy where they are
verj pfekl in the great Heats which are there:
And?I ^ItFthe Heats every jot as great here, and
grqater too^ being neareft the Equinox; befides, as
I was much obliged to be abroad, it was a moft
uftfyf thing to tnc, as well for the Rains as the
H#ks. I topk a world of Pains at it, and wa$ 3
gO»t wibflcrbeferc I could make any thing likely to
hol<i>- nay, after I thqught J had hit the Way, I
fpoilt 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mind; but
at
at laftl made one that anfwer'd indifferently well;
the main Difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to fpread, but it did not
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for
me any Way but juft over my Head, which would
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made one
to anfwer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, fo that it caft off the Rain like a Pent-
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effe&ually, that I
could walk out in the hotteft of the Weather, with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
eft, and when I had no Need of it, could clofe it
and carry it under my Arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely compofed by resigning to the Will of
God, and throwing my felf wholly upon the Dif-
pofal of his Providence. .This made my Life bet-
ter than fociable; for when I began to regiet the
want of Converfation, I would ask my felf? whether
thus converfing mutually witii my own Thoughts,
and as I hope I may fay, with even God himfelf by
Ejaculations, was not better than the untmoft En-
joyment of human Society in the World?
I cannot fay, that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary Thing happened to me, but I liv'd on
in the fame Courfe, in the fame Pofture and Place,
as juft before. The chief Thing I was employ'd in,
belides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
ways kept up juft enough to have fuffictent Stock
of one Year s Provifions beforehand> I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me
a Canoe, which at laft 1 fini&ed: So that by dig-
ging a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and .foar'FoQt
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almoft half a
Mile. As for the firft, which ^as*fo vaffcly big,
as
I
&s I rfiade it without considering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how I fliould be able to launch it,* (o
never being able to bring it to the; Water, or bring
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifer next
Time. Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not
;et a Tree proper for it, and was in a Place where
could not get the Water to ky at any lefs Diftance
than as I have faid, near half a Mile,* yet as I faw
it was practicable at lad, I never gave it over; and
though ,1 was near two Years about it, yet I never
grudg'd ihy Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to
go off to Sea at laft.
However, tho' my little Periagua was finifh'd*
yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable to the
Defign which I had in View, when I made the
firft; I mean of venturing over to the Terra FirntUi
where p: was above forty Miles broad; accor-
dingly/ the Smalnefs of my Boat affifted to put an
End to that Defign, and now I thought rio more
of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Defign \vas to
make a Tour round the Ifland; for as I had been
on the other Side* in, one Place, erofiing;, as 1 have
already described it, over the Land; fo the Difco^
veries I made in that little Journe/, made me very
eager to fee other Parts of the Coaft; and now I
had a B$at, I thought of poth/ng but failing round
the Ifland.
Far this Purpofe, that I might do every thing
witb Bifcretion and Conlideration, I fitted up a
little Maft to my Boat, and made a Sail to it out
©6 feme of the JPieees of the Ship's Sail, whieh lay
in Store, and of which I had a great Stock by me*
% Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, t found ftie would fail very well: Then I
foade litck Lockers or Boxes, at either End of my
B&at, to£utP*9¥ifi©ns, fcfeceifafies, and Ammun^-
Part t JSt tion,
tion,»&c. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain,
or the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the Infide of the Boat, where I could
lay my Gun, making a Flag to hang down over it
to keep it dry.
I fix'd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern,
like a Mall, to ftand over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Awning ; and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from
the little Creek; but at laft being eager to view
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I refolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I vifiuall'd my
Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of
my Loaves, (Cakes I fhould rather call them) of
Barley Bread, an Earthern Pot full of parch'd Rice,
a Food I eat a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum,
half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more,
and two large Watch-coats^ of thofe which, as I
mention9d before, I had fav'd out of the Seamens
Chelts; thefe I took, one to lie upon> and the
other to cover me in the Night.
It was the fixth of Nov^mber^ in the fixth ¥ear
of my Reign* or my Captivity* which yoapJeafe,
that I fet outori*this Voyage, <and I found it much
longer Aan I expe&cd; for though the Iftand itfelf
was not very large, yet when I came to- $be Eaft
Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lie^out
above two Leagues into the Se&, fome-abotfe Wa-
ter, fome under it ,* and beyond that, & <Sltoal of
Sand, lying dry half a League*more f fx> that t was
obliged to go a gieat Way oift to Sea to double the
Point' 7 ,
Wfaen fitfft'I difcever'd them, I wasg&i%tfc give
over * nay Kriterpme/ an4 dome baek k^iin3 not
knowirtg iio*w far it mi^itt oblige me to -go <eut to
Sea j and a£>ove*all, dotifettogtho\vl€iould§et*back
again; fol tame to an Anchor, for I had made
me a kfnd of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having fecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
Went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
feem'd to overlook that Point, where I faw the
full Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the Sea frorp that Hill where I
ftood,4 perceiv'd a ftrong, and indeed, a moft fu-
rious Current, which run ro the Eaft, and even
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more No-
tice of it, becaufe I faw there might be fome Dan-
ger, that when 1 came into it, I might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Ifland again ; and indeed, had I not
gotten firft up upon this Hill, I believe it would
have been fo $ for there was the fame Current on
the other Side the Ifland, only that it fee off at
a farther Diftancei and I faw there was a ftrong
Eddy under the Shore; fo I had nothing to do
but to get in out of the firft Current, and I fhould
prefently be in an Eddy.
I lay here* however, two Days * becaufe the
Wind blowing pretty frefh at £. S. E. and that
being juft contrary to the faid Current, made a
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; fo that it
was not fafe for me to keep too clofe to the Shore
for the Breach, nor to go too far off becaufe of
the Stream*
* The third Day in the Morning, the Wind ha-
ving abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I
veiled; buc I am a Warning-Piece again to all
rafh and ignorant Pilots; fornofoonerwas Icotc
to \h& Point, when even I was not my Boat's
Length from the Shore, but I tound myfelf in/a
gre^t Depth of Water,and aCurrent like the Sluice
of a Mill: it carry'd my Boat adrong with ft
M 2 with
with fucli Violence, that ail I could do, could not
keep hec fo much as on the Edge of it; but I found
it hurry'd me farther and farther out from the Ed-
dy; which was on my Left Hand. There was no
Wind ftirririg to help me, and all I could do with
my Paddles fignif/d nothing; and now I began to
give my felf over for loft; for as the Current was
on both Sides the Ifland, I knew in a few Leagues
Diftance they muft join again, and then I was ir-
recoverably gone; nor did I fee any Poffibility of
avoiding it; fo that I had no Profped before me
but of Perifliing; not by the Sea, for that was
calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I had
indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as big al-
moft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat \ and I had a great Jar of frefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; bin; what was all
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean; where, to
be fure, there was no Shore > no main Land, or
Ifland, for :a thoufand Leagues at leaft? w f
And now I faw how eafy it w$s for the Provi-
dence of God to make the moft miferab'e Condi-
tion Manldnd could be my wofe. ) Now I loQk'd
back upon my defolate folitary Ifland, a«.the xpoft
pleafant Place in the World, and aM the Happitiefs
niy Heart could wifh for,.was to be but there
'agaift. I ftretcii'd out my Hands to it with £ager
Withes. O happy Defart, faid I, Ifliall never fee
thee more! O miferable Creature, faid I^Awhi^
ther am I going! Then I reproach's! myfelfwith
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at
my folitary Condition; and now what would;! give
^to be* oh Shore there again? -Thus we he^er>/ee
>the true State of our Condition,: rill it isiilluftrated
-tO'Usbjr its Contraries; nor know ,how:to fodue
what we enjoy, but by the Want of it. It is fcarce
poffible to imagine thfe Confternation I was now in,
''being
being driven from my beloved Ifland (for fo it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide Ocean* al-
moft two Leagues, and in the utmoft Defpair of
ever recovering it again, However, I work'd hard
till indeed my Strength was almoft exhaufted, and;'
kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is>
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as poffibly I could; when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit-
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from
the S. S. E. Thi > chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more it
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time I
was~gatten at a frightful Diftancefrqm the Ifland,
and had theleaft Cloud or hazy, Weather intervened,
I had been yndone another Way too; fori had no
Compafs on; Board, and fhould never have known
how to hav^ fteered towards the Ifland, if I had
but once loft Sight of it; but the Weather con-
tinuing clear, I apply'd jmy felf to -get up my Maft
again, fpread my Sail, (binding away to the North
as much as poffible, to get out of the Current.
Juft as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat:
bsgan to ftretch away, I faw even by the Clear-
nefs of/the Wzt&r, fome Alteration of the Current
was near; for where the Current was fo ftrong, the
Water', was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I
found xh<t Current abate, and prefentlyl found to
the £4/2,. afcabouthalfa Mile, a Breach of the Sea
uportfom^Rofcks; thefe Rocks I found causM the
(2urrfqt t<i part again, and as the main Strefsof it
ran away, more Southerly, leaving the Rocks to the
Nonh-EafL, fo the other returned by the Repulfe of
theiiRticks,. and made a ftrong Eddy, ^which ran
back -again to the North Weft with? a -very $iarp
Streams 1

They who know what it is to have a Reprieve
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcu-
$d from Thieves juft going to murder them, or
who have beeli in fuch like Extremities, may guefs
what my prefent Surprize of Joy was, and how
gladly I put my Poatinto the Scream of this Eddy,
and the Wind alfo frefhening, how gladly I fpread
my Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind,
and with ajftrong Tide or Eddy under Foot.
This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
Wa^back agaip dire&ly towards the Ifland, but
about two leagues more to the Northward than
the Current which carried me away at firft; fo
that when; Xcame pear the Jfland, I found myfelf
open to the^orthern Shore of it, that is to fay,
the other: End of the* Ifland oppofite to that which
I went out from, r
When Ihad^adefomethingmpre thanaLeague
of Way by the~Help of this. Current or Eddy, I
found it w^fpent and ferv'd me no farther. How-
ever, I found that- being between the two great
Current's, (^.) that on the South Side,, which
had^ hurried; me ^way, and that pn the North,
which lay about a League on the other Side: I fay,
between thefe two, in the Wake of the Ifland, T
found the Water at leaft flill and running no Way;
and having, ftill a Breeze of Wind fair for me* I
kppt oniiaering direaiy for the Iiiand, thoV.not,
making fuch frefli Way as I did>efore. -
..About foiir a-rClockin the Evening,rbemg^hefl
within about a League of theJflapd, I foun^lither
Point of. the ;Rocks which occafion'dithis; Diiafter,
Hatching out, as is defcribed before, lo the Sc^tfe

Jy, hadqf courfe made a uother Eddy to tte^ofth,,
and this Ifound very ftrong, but not diredljifetting^
%hf Way my Couffc lay,, which was due' Weft, but
almoft
almoft full North. However, having a frefti
Gale, I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy flanting Norths
Weft, and in about air Hour came within about a
Mile of the Shore, where it being fmooth Water,
I foon got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees, and
gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving
to lay afide all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my
Boat •, and refreshing myfelf with fuoh Things as
I had, I brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a
little Gave that I had fpy'd under fome Trees,and
laid me down to fleep, being quite fpent with the
Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Lofs which Way to get
Homd with my Boat: I had run fo much Hazard*
and knew coo much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out $ and what might be
at the other Side, (I mean the Wefi>Side) I knew
not5 titor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures,
fo I ortly refolved in the Morning to make my Way
Weftwatd along the Shore3 and to fee if there was
noCreek Where I might lay up my Fregate in Safe-
tv3foasitohaVe her again if I warned her. In about
three MileS^or thereabout, coafting theShore^ I
came-toa-V€ry good Inlet,or Bay*about aMileover,
which' naffow'd till it came to a very little Rivulet
orBf o3k,WhereI found a very con venientHarboui:
fot^myBoa[r5 arid where Ihe lay as it (he had been
in a littleDoekm&deon purpofe for hcti. Here I
put ifrra&d having (tow'd my Boat very fafcj ^enr
on Shore to look about me, and fee where 1 was.
I foort fb&fid I had but a little pafs'd by the Place
where I had been before, when I travell'don Foot
to that Shores fo taking nothing out of my Bpat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for m* wasrex-
ceeding%ot, I began my March. The Wav was
comfortableeaough after fueh a!Voyage as I had
M 4 been
been upop, *md I ccach'd my old Bower in tfi$
Evening, where I found every thing {landing as J
left it; for I always kept it in good Qtder, being,
as I jfaid before, tpy Countryhoufe.
I got over the Fence, and laid m$ down in the
Shade to reft my kimbs, for I was very weary, and
fell afteep: But judge ypu, if you can, that read my
Story what a Surprize I ipuft be in, when I was
wak'd Put of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name f<?veral tiinfcs, Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe,
jpoor Robin Crufoe! where are you Robin Crufoe I
Where are you? Where have ypu been?
I was fo dead afleej?> at firft, - being fatiguM with
Rowing, ;or Paddling, as it is jcaU'd, the firft
Part of thel?ay/atid \vith Waging theater Part,
that I did hot wake thrpughly $ but doling b^

that fpjtne b6dy fpoke to me; But as the Voice
f ohtinad to jrepeat, Robin Crufoe, Robin'Crufoe, at
laftl begah to wake' jpore perfe&ly, and was at
jfirft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the tft-
mbft Confirmation; But nP fppnfcr were my Eyes
open, burl fa\v my Pel/fitting ojithe Top of the
Hedge,,and: immediately knew that it was he that

t had ufed td talk' tp him, arid teafcfi him J; and he
hadleamM it fo perfe&ly, that he' woiilfi fits upon

cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where areygUl-W.*b*f$havt
byouhen? 'tfo^ come you here? and faqh things as I
had tatighfr him.
However, even though J knew it was theT£arrot,
^nd'that iirdeed it could be'no body' t\$\ it was
"a goodwhile befdre I could compofe ^my: felf.
Fiili, i' Vis amazed'how' the Creature got'thither,

and holding out my H^nd, a^nd calling him by his
£Jame Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, and
fat upon my Thumbs as he ulcd to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and how
did Icon}* here? And where had I ken? Juft as if
he had been overjoy'd to fee me again •, and fo I
carryM him Home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for
fomc time, ?nd had enough to do for many Days
to fit ftill, and refleft upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my Side of the Ifland; but I
Jtnew not how it was pra&icable to get it about.
As to the E^ft Side of the Ifland, which I had
gone ro.und >, I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way; my very Heart would fhnnk, and
jny very Blood run chill but to think of it: And as
to tfye other Side of the Ifland, I did not know
how it might be there; but fuppofing the Current
ran witfc the fame Force againft the Shore at the
Eaft, as i««,paf$Virby it on the other, I might run
the fame Risk ,of being driven down the Stream,
$nd carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before, of
being carry*d away from it; fo with thefeThoughts
I contented njyfeli to be without any Boat, tho*
it had been the Product of fo many Months La-
bour fp pake it, and of fo many more to get iz
unto < the $ea.
i % fri tjii$ (Government of my Temper I remained
near a Year, lived a very fedate retired Life, as
you m^y well fuppofe; and my Thoughts being
very much icompofed as to my Condition, and
fully,,jcotpiforted in refigning myfelf to the Dif-
pb&ttOQS of providence, I thought I Jiv'd really ve-
^yitappily in all things, except that of Society.
Iim-
I Improv'd myfelf m thisYime in all the me-
chanick Exercifes which my Neceffities put me
upon applying myfelf to, dndl believe could,upon
Occalfion, have made a very good Carpenter, efpe-
cially confidering how few Tools I had.;
Befides this, I arrived at an unexpected Per-
fection in my Earthen Ware, and contrived well
enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found
infinitely eafier and bettdr S becaufe I made Things
round &tid fhapable, which before were filrhy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or in ore
joyful for any Thing I found out, than for my be-
ing able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And thorit was
a very ugly clumfy Thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other Earthen Ware* yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw theSmoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been
always ufed to Smoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the Iflanch and afterwards,
when I fearch'd the Ship again, I could not come
#t any Pipes at all. /r
In myWkkev'Wzrc^lfolhi^pwved muchyand
jmde Abundance pf neceffary baskets, as well as
my Invention (hew'd me, though not very hand-
fame, yet they were fuch as were very handy&nd
convenient for my laying -Things*upm,m fetching
Things home in. For Example, it I killed a( Goal
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree; fleaafy and
drefs it, and cut it in Pieces, and-brtEigaV)iQtn.e(m
a Baskets and the like by a Turtle, I coiiM dutr it
up* take out the Eggs, and a Piece or tworfof itfee
Fteftu which was enough for me, and bilfegjthem
home ins ^Basket* and leave <thenreftf JBBbind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets Were iniy#ece#'
vers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as
loon
foon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
Baskets.
I began no;w to perceive my Powder abated confix
derably, and this was a Want which it was im-
poffible lor me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no
more Powder; that is to fey, how I fliould do to
kill any Goats. I h#d, as is obferv'd in the third
Year o£ my being here, kept a young Kid, and
bred her up tame, I was in hopes of getting a Be-'
Goat, but I could not by any means bring it to
pafs, till my Kid grew an old Goat; and I could
never find in my Heart to kill her, till fhe dy'd at
laft of meer Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dence, and, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet my felf to ftudy fome Art to trap and
fnare the Goats, to fee whether I could nor catch
fome of them alive, and particularly I wanted a
She-Goat great with Young.
To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken
in them; but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devoured.
At length I refolv'd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug
feveral large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I
had obfervi'd the Goats ufed to feed, and over thefe
Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too,
with a gceat Weight upon them; and feveral times
I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without fet-
ting'the Trap, and I could cafily perceive* that the
Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, fori
could fee the Mark of their Feet. At length I fet
three Traps in one Njght, and going the next
Morning I Jbnnd them all ftanding, and >et the
Pait eaten afcd gone. This was very difcouraging;
How-
However, I altered my Traps, and, net to trouble
yon with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my
Traps, I found in one'of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other, three Kids, a Male and
twoFenfates.'
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was fo fierce F durft not go into the Pit
to him ,• that is to fay, to go about to bring him,
away alive, which was what I wanted. I could
have kill'd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor
would it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out,
and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his Wits: But I had forgot then what I had learned
afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lion. If I
had let him ftay there three or four Days without
Food, and then have carry'd him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty
fagacious tradable Creatures where they are well
ufed.
However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
Kids> and taking them one by one, I ty'd them
with Strings together, and with fome Difficulty
brought them all home. ^ * f
It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fweetCorn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: And now I found that
if I expeded to fupply my felf with Goat Flefli,
when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps *
njight have them about my Houfe like a* Flock of
Sheep.
But th6n it prefently occur'd to me, th&thritiuft
keep the Tame from the Wild, ot elfe they Wduld
always run wildwhen they grew Up; and the only^
tWay for this was to have fome cnclofcd Piece ot
Ground,
C »73 1
Ground, well fenced either with Hedge or Pale, to
keep them in fo efle&ually, that thofe within might
not break our, or thofe without break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands; yet as I faw there was an abfolute Necef-
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz,, where there
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from
the Sun.
Thofe who underftand fuch Enclofures will
think 1 had very little Contrivance, when I pitched
upon a Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain
open Piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna, (as our
People call it in the Weftern Colonies,) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it, and
at one End was very woody: I fay they will fmile
at my Forecaft, when I fhall tell them I began my
enclosing of this Piece ofrGround in fuch a Man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale muft have been at leaft
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo
gre^t as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile
$bout I was like to have time enough to do it ip.
$u? I did not consider that my Goats wouJd be as
wild in fo much Compafs, as if they had had the
wshole Iflan^, and I fliould have fo much Rqom
t^o^ chafe ahem in , that 1 fliould never catch
thpflu
My $tedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe,
#bou£fijfjcy ^arcjs, when this Thought occurred to
mie^ {p4 pr^fently ftopt fliort, and for the firft Be-
tgifllfc'Upg I.refplvM to enclofe a Piece of about i$q
Yards in Length, and ioo Yards in Bredth,which as
thWQumi maintain as many as 1 fhould have many
tgelonabk Time,fo as my Flock eng^a^ I could
a,dd $noref Ground to my finck^iire.,,
This
This was a&ing with feme Prudence, arid I
went to work with Courage. I was about three
Months hedging m the fir ft Piece, and till I had
done it I tether'd the three Kids in the beft Part of
ir, and us'd them to feed as near me as poffible to
make them familiar; and very often I would go
and carry them fome £ars of Barley,or a Handful
of Rice, and feed them out of my Hand; fo that
after my Inclofure was finifti'd, and I let them
loofe,they would follow me up and down,bleating
after me for a handful of Corn.
This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and
Half 1 had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids
and all j and in two Years more I had three and
forty* befides feveral that I took and kill'd for my
Food* And after that I inclofed five feveral Pieces
of Ground to feed them in, with little Penns to
drive them into, to take them as 1 wanted, and
Gates out of one Pitce of Ground into ano-
ther.
But this was not all-, for now I not only had
Goats-Flefti to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a Thing which indeed in my Beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, arid had fome-
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature,diftates even naturally h6w to make ufe
of it; fo I that had never milk'd a Gow, much lefs
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheele made, very rea-
dily and handily, tho' after a great«mahy Effays
and Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
arlaft, and never wanted it afterwards*
How mercifully can out great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in thofeConditions in which they
feem'd to be overwhelmed in Deftru&ion! How
can
can he fweeten the bittereft Providences, and give
us Caufe topraife him for Dungeons andPrifons!
What a Table was here fpread for me in a Wilder-
nefs, where I faw nothing at firft but to perifli for
Hunger I
It would have made a Stoick fmile to have feen
me and my little Family fit down to Dinner; there
was my Majefty the Prince and Lord of the whole
Ifland i I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my
abfolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Li-
berty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all
my.Subjefts.
Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all
alone, attended by my Servants; Poll, as if he had
been my; Favourite, was the only Perfon permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy* and had found no Species to
multiply Ms Kind upon, fat always at my Right
Hand; and two Cats, one on one Side the Ta-
ble, and one on the other, expecting now and
then* a/JBit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpecial
Favour.
But thefe were not the two Cats which I brought
on Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead,
and had .been interred near my Habitation by my
own Hand; but one of them having multiply'd by
I know; not what Kind of Creature, thefe were
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the
reft run wild in the Woods, and became indeed
troublefctae to me at laft; for they would often
come into my Houfe, and plunder me too* till at
laft I was -obliged to (hoot them, and did kill a
great,many; at length:they left me with this At-
tendance, a*nd/in this plentiful Manner I-liy'd; nei-
ther coufcil*lraiaid^ thing but Society,
anckofitfoat in form, time after this I was like to
have too much.
I was
1 tvas Something impatient, as I have obferv'd;
to have the Ufe ot my Boat; though very loath to
™n any more Hazards; and therefore fometimes I
f^t contriving Ways to get her about the ftland,
and at other times I fat my felf down contented
enough with hen But I had a ftrange Uneaiinefs in
my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
Where,. as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went
up the Hiil to fee how the Shore lay; and how the
Current kty that I might fee what I had to do,
This Inclination increased upon me every Day, and
at length I refolved to travel thither by Land; fol-
lowing the Edge of the Shore I did fo: But had any
one in England'been to meet fuch a Man as I was, it
muft either have frighted them, or raifed a great
deal of Laughter; and as I frequently flood ftill to
look at my felf, I could not but fmile at the Notion
of my travelling thro' York/hire with fuch an Equi-
page, and in fuch a Drefs. Be pleafed to take a
Sketch of my Figure as follows.
I had a great high ftiapelefs Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the Sjnfrom me, as to fhoot the Rain
off from running into my Neck \* nothing beting fo
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the
Flefti under the Clothes.
I had a fiiort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts
coming down to about the Middle of my Thighs;
and a Pair of open-kneed Breeches of the fame; the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat*
whofe Hair hung down fuch a. Length on -either
Side, that like Pantaloons it reached totheMiddle,
ot my Legs. Stockings and Shoes I had none, but
had made me a Pair of Somethings, I fcarce know
what to eali them, like Buskins, to, flap over my
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dafixes;
""faiUiC
but of a mofl barbarous Shape, as indeed were all
the reft of my Clothes.
I had on a broad Belt of GoatV Skin dry'd,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, inftead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog
on either Side of this V inftead of a Sword and a
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on
one Side, one on the other. I had another Belt not
fo broad, and faften'd in the fame Manner, which
hung over my Shoulder ,* and at the End of it,
under my left Arm hung two* Pouches, both made
of GoatV Skin too; in one of which hung my
Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I car-
ried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over
my Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin Umbreilo,
but which, after all, was the moft neceflary Thing
I had about me, next to my Gun ,• As for my Face,
the Colour of it was really not fo Moletta like as
one might expeft from a Man not at all careful of
icy and living within 5? or xo Degrees of theEqumox.
My Beard I 'had once differVi to grow till it was
about a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both
Sciflars and Razors fufficient, I had cut it pretty
fliort, except what grew on my upper Lip, which
I had trimm'd into a large Pair of Mahomet anWhi(~
kers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome7tfr£j-,whom I
hw ztSaUee, lot the Moors did not wear fuch, tho*
the Turks did; of thefe Muftachioes or Whiskers, I
will not (a^ they $vere long enough to hang my Hat
upon thetti Mafcit £hey were of a Length and Shlpe
monftrous^noiigh* and (lich as in England would
have pall'd for frightful.
But*alMiis<kby the by; for as to-my Figure, I
had fo fe#* m-obfo*ve me, thatit was of no man-
ner of Ctfitfeqtieace $ fo I fay no moreto that Part.
In this fund of? Figure I went my new Journey, and
was out five or fix Days. I traveled firft along the
Part L N Sea-
Sea- Shore, dire&!y to the Place where I firft brought
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks;
and having no Boat now to take care of, I Went o-
ver the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height
that I was upon before; when looking forward to
the Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which
I was obliged to double with my Boat, as I {aid a-
bove, I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and
quiet* no Rippling, no Motion, no Current, any
more there than in other Places.
I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and
refolv'd tofpend fome Time in the obferving it, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occa-
fion'd it; but I was prefently convinc'd how it was,
?viz>. That the Tide of Ebb fetting from the Wefty
and joining with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the Shore, muft be the Occafion of
this Current; and that according as the Wind blew
more forcibly from the ^/?, or from the North, this
Current came near,or went farther from the Shore;
for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to
the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb being
made, I plainly faw the Current again as before,
only, that it, run farther off, being near half a
League from the Shore; whereas in my Cafe, it
fet clofe upon the Shore, and hurried me and my
4 'Canoe along with it, which at another Time it
would not have done.
This Obfervation convjnc'd me, That I had no-
thing to do but to obftfrye the Ebbing and the
Flowing of the Tide, and I might very eaiily, bring
my Boat about the Ifland again: But when I be-
gan to think of putting it in Pra&ice, I h^fueh a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
Danger I had been iri, that I could not; think of it
again with any. Patience ,* but on the contrary, I
took up anQpfeepResolution, which wa&mot^:fafc>
though
though more laborious; and this was, That I
would build, or rather make me another Peviagua,
or Canoe; and fo have one for one Side of the Iiland,
and one, for the other.
You are to underftand, that now I had, as I
may call it, two Plantations in the Ifland; one my
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me,
which by this Time I had enlarg'd into feveral
Apartments or Caves, one within another. One
ofthefe, which was the dryeft, and largeft, and
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification;
that is to fay, beyond where my Wall join'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets,which would hold
five or fix Bufhe's each, where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpecially my Corn, fome in the Ear
cut off fhort from.the Straw,and the other rubbM
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, a* before, with long Stakes
or Pile?, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown fo big, and fpread fo very
much, that there was not the leaft Appearance to
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me
their Harveft in its Seafon; and whenever I had
O&rafioh for more Corn, I had more Land adjo'n-
irlg as fit as chat.
Befides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had
n6#ar tolerable Plantation there alio > for firft, I
had my little Bower, as I call'd ir, which I kept
in Repair,* that is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
circleSit in, conftantly fitted'up toits ufual Height,
N z the
the Ladder (landing always in the Infide; 1 kept
;he Trees which at firft were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
Shade, which they did effe&ually to my Mind: In
the middle of this I had my Tent always Handing,
being a Piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet up for
that Purpofe, and which never wanted any Repair
or Renewing; and under this I had made me a
Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures
I had kill'd, and with other foft Things, and a
Blanket laid on them, fuch as "belonged to our
Sea-Bedding, which I had faved, and a great
Watch-Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I
had Occafion to be abfent frpm my chief Seat, I
took up my Country Habitation.
Adjoyning to this I had my Enclofures for my
Cattle, that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had
taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and
enclofe this'Ground/o I was fo uneafyto fee it kept
entire, left the Goats Ihould break thro*, that I ne-
ver left off till with infinite Labour I had ftuck the
Outfide of the Hedge fo full, of fmall Stakes, and
fo near to one another, that it was rather a Pale
than a Hedge, and there was fcarce Room to put
a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards
when thofe Stakes grew, as they all did in the~next
rainy Seafo-n, made the Enclofurefirong like a Wall,
indeed ftronger than any Wall.
This will teftify for me that I wa$ not idle,
and that I fpared no Pains to bring to pafs what-
ever appeared neceflary for my comfortable Sup-
port* for I confider'd the keeping up a Breed of
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a li-
ving Magazine of Flefh, Milk, Butter and Cheefe,
for
for me as long as I \iv'd in the Place, if it were to be
forty Years, and that keeping them in my Reach,
depended entirely upon my perfe&ing my Enclo-
fures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fure of
keeping them together ,* which by this Method in-
deed I fo effe&ually fecur'd, that when thefe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo
very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up
again.
In this Place alfo I had my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raifins, and which I never fail'd to pre-
ferve very carefully, as the beft and moft agreeable
Dainty of my whole Diet; and indeed they were
not agreeable only, but Phyfical, wholefome, nou-
rifliing and rcfrefliing, to the laft Degree.
As this was alfo about half Way between my o-
ther Habitation and the Place where I had laid up
my Boat, I generally ftay'd and lay here in my
V/ay thither; for I ufed frequently to vifit my
Boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to
her in very good Order; fometimes I went out in
her to divert my felf, but no more hazardous
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo appre-
henfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge a-
gain by the Currents,or Winds, or any other Acci-
dent : But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.
It happen d one Day about Noon going towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was
very plain to be feen in the Sand: I flood like one
Thunder-ftruck, or as if 1 had feen an Apparition;
Iliften'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing,
nor fee any Thing; I went up to anfing Ground to
look farther : I went up the Shore and down the
$h6rc, but it was all one, I could fee no other
N 3 ImpreffioH
Impreffion but that one, I went to it again to fee
if there were any more, and to obferve if it might
not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for
that, for there was exa&ly the very Print of a Foot,
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it
came thither, I know not, nor could in the leaft
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughcs,
like a Man perfectly confus'd and out of myfelf, I
came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify 'd to the laft
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three
Steps, miftaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Diftance to be a Man; nor is
it poffibletodefcribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in;
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable
Whimfies came into my Thoughts by the Way.
When I came to my Caftle, for Co I think I call'd
* it ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued;
whether I went over by the Ladder as firft con-
trived, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
1 call'd a Door, I cannotremember; no, nor could
I remember the next Morning; for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.
I flept none that Night; the farcher I was from
the Qccafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap-
prehenfions were ; which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the
ufual Fra&ice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was
fo embarrafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
Thing, that I form'd nothing but difmal Imagina-
tions to my felf, even tho' I was now a great way
off it. Sometimes I fancy'd it muft be the De-
vil; and Reafon join'd in with me upon this Sup-
ppijtion; For how flipuld any other Thing in hu-
man Shape come into the Place? W here was the
Veffel that brought them? What Marks was there
of any other Footfteps? And how was it poffible
a Man fhould come there? But then to think that
Satan fhould take human Shape upon him in fuch a
Place where there could be no manner of Occasion
for ir5 but to leave the Print ol his Foot behind
hicft,and that even fornoPurpofetoo (for he could
notbefurel fhould fee it) this was an Amuiemenc
the other Way: 1 confidered that the Devil might
have found out Abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me, than this of the iingle Print of a Foot.
That as I hVd quite on the other Side of the Hland,
he would never have been fo fimpleto leavea Mark
in a Place where it wastenThoufand to One whe-
ther 1 fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defae'd entirely : All this fcem'd
inconfiftent \jjith the Thing ltfelf, and with all
the Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty
of the Devil,
Abundance of fuch Things as thefeaflifted to ar-
gue me out of all Apprehenfions of its being the
Devil: And 1 prefently concluded then,that it muft
be fome more dangerous Creature, viz,. That it
muft be fome of the Savages of the main Land
over-againft me, who had wandered out to Sea in
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Ifland ; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea,
being as loath, perhaps, fo have (laid in this cJefo-
latellknd,as 1 would have been rohave had them.
While thefe Reflexions were rolling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful m my Thoughts, that
I was lo happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did nor fee mv Boat, by which
they would have concluded that fome Inhabitants
N 4 had
had been in the Place > and perhaps have fearch'd
farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there were People here; and that i( fo, I
ftiould certainly have them come again in greater
Numbers and devour me; that if it fhould happen
fo that they fhould not find me, yet they would
find my Enclofure, deftroy all my Corn, carry away
ail my Flock of tame Goats, and Lfhould peiifli at
lait tor meer Want.
Thus my Fear banifli*d all my Religious Hope,
ail that former Confidence in God , which was
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I \\^d
had of his Goodnefs, now vanifh'd; as if he that
had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preferve
by his Power the Provifion which he had made for
me by his Goodnefr. I reproach'd myfelf with my
Eafinefs, that would not fow any more Com one
, Year than would juft ferve me till the next Seafon,
as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground;
and this I thought fo juft a Reproof, that I refoiv'd
for the future to have two or three Years Corn be-
fore-hand, fo that whatever might come, I might
nqt perifli for want of Bread,
How ftrange a Chequer-Work of Providence is
the Life of Man! and by what fecret differing
Springs are the Affedhons hurried about, as differ-
ing Circumfiances prefent! To Day we love what
to Morrow we hate; to Day we feek what to Mor-
row we fhun; to Day we defirc what to Morrow
we fear; nay, even tremble at the Appreheniions of.
This was exemplified in me at this time n the
moft lively Manner imaginable; for I, whofe only
Affliction was, that I feem'd banifhVl from human
Society, that I was alone, circumfcribM by the
boundlefs Ocean, cut off" from Mankind, and con-
•  . * demtul
demn'd to what I call filent Life h that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber'd among the Living, or to appear among the
reft of his Creatures •, that to have feen one of my
own Species, would have feem'd to me a Raifing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Bleffing
that Heaven itfelf, next to the fupreme Bleffing of
Salvation3 could beftow * I fay, that I ftiould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man,
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance of a Man's having
fet his Foot on the Ifland.
Such h the uneven State of HumanXife ,• and ic
afforded me a great many curious Speculations af-
terwards, when I had a little recovered my firlt
Surprize $ I considered that this was the Station of
Life, the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determin'd for me, that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdom might be
in all this, iol was not to difpute his Sovereignty,
who^as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofeof me
abfolutely as he thought fit •, and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewifca
judicial Right to condemn me to what Puriifhment
he thought tit •, and that it was my Part to fubmit
to bear his lndignation3 bccaufe I had finn'd a-
gainft him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punifh and afflj6t me, fo he was able to
deliver me •, that if he did not think fit to do it,
'twas my unqueftion'd Duty to refign myfelf abfo-
lutely and entirely to his Will: And on the other
hand, it was my Duty alfo to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend die Dictates and
Dire£tions of his daily Providence.
Thefe
Thefe Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days,
nay,1 may fay, Weeks and Months; and one par-
ticular Effeft of my Cogitations on this Occafion,
I cannot omit, viz,. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Dan-
ger from the Appearance of Savages, 1 found it
difcompos'd me very much; upon which thofe
Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts,
Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver,
and thou floalt glorify me.
Upon this., riling chcarfully out of my Bed, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earneftly to God for De-
liverance: When I had done praying, I took up
my Bible, and opening it to read, the firft Words
that prefented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and
be of good Cheery .and he fhall firengthen thy Heart \
-wait, J fay, on the Lord. It is im'poffible to exprels
the Comfort this gave me. In Anfwer, I thank-
fully laid down the Book, and was no mere fad,
at Ieaft, not on that Occa0on.
In the Middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprejien-
fions,and Rcfle£tions,it came into my Thought one
Day3 that ail this might be ameer Chimera of my
own \. and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat:
This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-
fwade myfeJf it was all a Deluiion \ that it was no-
thing elfe but my own Foot-, and why might not I
come that Way from the Boat, as well as I was go-
ing that Way to the Boat? Again, 1 confider'd alfo
that I could by no Means tell for certain whe;re I
had trod, and where I had not, and that if at laft
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play'd the Part of thofe Fools, who ftrive to make
Stories of Spe&resand Apparitions, and then are
frigh:ed at thesn more than any bo4y.
Now
[ l87 ] , b a
Now I began to take Courage,and to peep abroad
again * fori had not ftirr'd out of myCaftle for three
Days and Nights; fo that I began to ftarvefor
Provifion ; fori had little or nothing within Doors,
but fome Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew
that my Goats wanted to be milk'dtoo, which
ufually was my Evening Diverfion; and the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for
want of it; and indeed, it almoftfpoiTd fome of
them, and almoftdry'd up their Milk.
Heartning my felf therefore with the Belief that
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet, and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe, to milk my Flock; but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
looked behind me, how I was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conference, or that I had been late-
ly moft terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder,* and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I could not per-
fwade my felf fully of this, till I fliould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
meafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or Fitnefs, that 1 might be aflur'd it was
my own Foot: But when I" came to the Place,
firjiy it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not poflibly be on Shore any
where thereabout. Secondly, When I came to mea-
fure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
not fo large by a great deal; both thefe Things fill'd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again to the higheft Degree; lb that I
frook
fhook with Cold, like one in an Ague; and I went
Home again, fill'd with the Belief that fome Man
or Men had been on Shore there; or, in fhort,.that
the Ifland was inhabited, and I might be furpriz'd
before I was aware; and what Courfe to take for
my Security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous Refolutions Men take, when
poffefs'd with Fear 1 it deprives them of the Ufa of
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Relief.
The firft Thing I proposed to my felf, was, to
throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them, and then frequent the Ifland in Pro-
fpeft of the fame , or the like Booty ,• then to the
Ample Thing of Digging up my two Corn-Fields,
that they might not find fuch a Grain there, and
- ftill be prompted to frequent the Ifland; then to de-
molifli my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted to
look further, in order to find out the Perfons in-
habiting.
Thefe were the Subject of the firft Night's Cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the
Apprehenfions which had fo over-run my Mind
were frefti upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
pours, as above. Thus Fear of Danger is ten thou-
(knd times more terrifying than Danger it felf,
when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Bur-
then of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil
which we are anxious about; and, which was worfe
than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Refignation I ufed to prictife* that I
hop'd to have. I look'd^ I thought, like Saul, who
complain'd not only that the Philifl'mes were upon
him, but that God had forfaken him; for I did not
now take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying
to God in my Diftrefey and refting upon his Provi-
''* dencc,
dence, as I had done before, for my Defence and
Deliverance; which if I had done, 1 had, atleaft,
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur-
prize, and perhaps carry'd through it with more
Refolution.
This Confufion of myThoughts kept me waking
all Night; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and
having, by the Amufement of my Mind, been as
it were tired, and my Spirits exhaufted, I flept ve-
ry foundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than
I had ever been before: And now I began to think
fedately; and upon the utmoft Debate with my-
felf, I concluded, That this I Hand, which was fo
exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from the
main Land than as I had feen, was not fo entirely
abandon'd as I might imagine: That altho* there
were no ftated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot;
yet that there might fometimes come Boats off
from the Shore, who either with Defign, or per-
haps never, but when they were driven by crofs
Winds, might come to this Place.
That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had
not met with the leaft Shadow or Figure of any
People yet; and that if at any Time they fhould
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as foon as ever they could, feeing they had
never thought fit to fix there upon any Occafion,
to'this* Time.
That the mofl I cou'd fnggeft any Danger from,
was, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of
(haggling People from the Main, who, as it was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft
their Wills; fo they made no flay here, but went off
again with all poffible Speed, feldom flaying one
Night on Shor^, left they fhould not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to do but to confider
of
of fome fafe Retreat^ in Cafe I fhould fee any Sa-
vages land upon the Spot.
No<v 1 began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave fo large, as to bring a Door through
again, which Door, as I laid, came out beyond
where my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock: Upon
maturely considering this therefore, I refolv'd to
draw me a fecond Fortification, in the fame Man-
ner of a Semicircle, at a Diftance from my Wall,
juft where I had planted a double Row of Trees,
about twelve Years before, of which I made menti-
on: Thefe Trees having been planted fo thick be-
fore, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven be-
tween them, that they fhpuld be thicker, and
ftronger, and my Wall would be foon finifh'd.
So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
ftrong; having in. it feven little Holes, about as
big a$ I might put my Arm out at. In the Infide
of this, I thickned my Wall to about ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
walking upon it; and through the feven Holes, I
contrived to plant the Mufquets, of which I took
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship;
thefe, I fay, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
that fo I could iire all the feven Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finiflung, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it
was done.
When this was done, I ftuck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way5 as
fall with Stakes or Sticks of the OJier-like Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
ftand; infomuch, that I believe I might fet in near
twenty
twenty Thoufand of them, leaving a pretty large
Space between them and my Wall, that I might
have Room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no Shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wall.
Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling, growing fo monftrous thick and
ftrong,that it was indeed perfectly impaffable; and
no Men, of what kind foever, would ever imagine
that there was any Thing beyond it, much lefs a
Habitation. As for the Way which I propofed to
myfelf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders; one to a Pare of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
room to place another Ladder upon that; fowhen
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without mifchieving him-
felf; and if they had come down, they were Hill
on the Outfide of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Meafures human Prudence
could fugged for my own Prefervation ; and it will
be feen at length, that they were not altogether
without juft Reafon ; though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my meer Fear fuggefted to
me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care-
lefs of my other Afrairs; for I had a great Concern
upon me for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only 4 prefent Supply to me upon every Occafi-
on, •and began to be fufficient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot; but alfo without
the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild ones; and I
was loach to lofe the Advantage of them, and to
have them all to nurfe ujp over again*
, To this Purpofe, after long Consideration, I
could think of but two Ways to preferve them;
ones
one was to find another convenient Place to dig a
Cave under Ground, and to drive them into it every
Night; and the other was to enclofe two or three
little Bits of Land 3 remote from one another, and as
much concealed as I could, where I might keep about
half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So that
if any Difafter happened to the Flock in general, I
might be able to raife them again with little Trou-
ble and Time: And this, tho' it would require a
great deal of Time and Labour, I thought was
the moft rational Defign.
Accordingly I fpent fome Time to find out the
moft retired Parts of the Illand; and I pitch'd up-
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wifli for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick Woods,
where, as is obferv'd, I almoft loft myfelf once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from the
Eaftern Part of the Ifland: Here I found a clear
Piece of Land near three Acres, fo furrounded with
Woods, that it was almoft an Enclofure by Nature,
at lead it did not want near fo much Labour to
make it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground I had
worked fo hard at. '. ..
I immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time,,! had
fo fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you pleafe3 who were not fo wild now as at
firft they might be fuppofed to be, were well e~
nough fecur'd in it. So without any farther Delay,
I^remov'd ten She-Goats and two He-Goats to
this Piece ,• and when they were there, I continued
to perfed the Fence till I had made it as fecure'as
the other, which, however, I did at more Leifute,
and it took me up more Time by a great deal.
All
All this Labour I was at the Ex pence of, purely
'from, my Apprehenfions on the Account of the Print
of a" Mans Foot which' I had feen; for as yet I
never faw any human Creature come near the
Ifland, and I had now liv'd two Years under thefe
tJneafineffes, which indeed made my Life much lefs
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagin'dby any who know what it is to live in
the conftant Snare of the Fear of Man and this I
muft obferve with Grief too, that the Difcompo-
fure of my Mind had too great Impreffions alfo up-
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread
and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages
and Canibals lay fo upon my Spirits, that I feldom
found my felf in a due Temper for Application to
my Maker, at leaft not with the fedate Calmnefs
and Refignation of Soul which I was wont to do; I
rather pray'd to God as under great AfRi&ion and
Preflure of Mind furrounded with Danger, and id
Expe&ation every Night of being murder'd arid de-
voured before Morning; and I muft t^ihify from my
Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankfulness,
Love and Affe&ion, is much the more proper Frame
for Prayer than that of Terror and Difcompofure;
and that under the Dread of Mifchief impending*
a Man islhore fit for a comforting Performance
of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Re-
pentance on a Sick-bed: For thefe Difcompofures;
afte<3: the Mind as the others do the Body; and the
Difcompofure of the Mind muft neceffarily be as
gre^t a Difabjlity as that of the Body, and much
greater, praying to God being properly an A& oi
the Mind, not of the Body*
But to go on; After 1 had thus fedur'd one Part
of my little living Stock, I Went about the whole
Ifland, fearching for another private Places to make
Part I. O vfu«h
fuch another Depofite-, when wandring fnore to the
Wefi Point of the Ifland than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Diftance. I had found a Pro-
lpe&ive-Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chefts, Which 1 fav'd out of our Ship *, but I had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it, though 1 look'd at it:
till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer j.- whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not
know} but asldefcended from the Hill, I could
lee no i&ote of it, ib I gave it over 5 only I refolv'd
to go no- more out without a Profpe£Uve~Glafs in
my Pocket.
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Ifland, where indeed I had never been before,
l was prefently convinced, that the feeing the Print
of a.Man's'Foot, was not fuchaftrange Thingiu
the Ifland as I imagin'd :, and but that it was a ipe-
cial Providence that I was caft upon the Side of the
Ifland, where the Savages never'came, Iihouidea-
filythave known^ that nothing was more frequent
than for the Cmoes from the M&in, when they hap-
pened tp be a little too far put tat Sea* to fiiqot over
to that Side of the Ifland for Harbour^ likewdfeas

Hands, Feet, and other Bones of human Bodies;
and particularly I obferv'd a Place where there had
been
been a iFire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth,
like.a.,Cockpit, where it is fuppofed the Savage
Wretches had fat down to their inhuman Feaftings
iipon the Bodies of.'their Fellow^Creatures*
I was fb aftoriiflf d with the Sight of thefe Things,
that I entertained no Notions of any Danger to my
felf from it for & long while; all my Apprehen-
iion§ were buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch
of inhuman, hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of
the Degeneracy of human Nature ^ which tho' I
had heard often, yet I never had lb near a View
of before 5 in ftiort, I turned away my Face from
the horrid Speftacle; mf Stomach grew fick, and
I was juft at the Point of Fainting, when Nature
difcharg'd the Diforder from my Stomachy and
having vomited with an uncommon Violence, I was
a little relieved; but could not beartoftayin the
Place a Moment; fo I got me up the Hill again,
with all the Speed I could, andwalk'd on towards
my own Habitation.
When I came a little out Of that Part of the
Jflarid, 1 flood ftill awhile as amaz'd; and then re-
covering my felf, I look'd up with the utmoft Af-
feftion of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in
my Eyes, gave God Thanks that had <&ft itly fi.rft
Lot in a Part of the World, where Iwas diftin^
giiifiied from fuch dreadful Creatures as thefe^ and
thaftho* I had efteem'd my prefent Condition very
Mfeable, had yet given me fomany Comforts in
it, ^that "-I had ftill more t6 give Thanks for than to
complain of; and this above all, that I had even in
thisriftSerable donditidn bem Comforted with the
;iKn6wledg#of ilimfelf, and the Hope of his Ble£
fing|'#hich Was a Felicity more than fufficiently
^qiiiviferit to all the Mifery which I had fuffeFd^
breoiild iufS^r.
0 A In
In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home to
my Caftle, and began to be much eafier now, as to
the Sifttf.bf my Cflrcurtfftaineei, thatn ever I was
before y for 1 bbftrv'd' that thefe Wretches never
came to this Iflaiid in Search of what they, could
get; perhaps not Peking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting any Thing here; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the covered woody Part of it
without finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew
I had been here now almoft eighteen Years, and ne-
ver faw the leaft Foot-fteps of Human Creature
there before; and' I might be here eighteen more
as entirely conceal'd as#I was now, if I did not
difcover my felt" to them, which I had no manner
of Oc'cafion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to
keep my felf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs
I found abetter fort of Creatures, than Canibals to
make my felf known to.
Yet I entertained fuch an Abhorrence of the fa-
vage Wretches that I have been fpeakfng of, and
of the wretched inhuman Cuftom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I continued pen-
fiVeandfad, and kept; clofe within my own Circle
for almoft two Years after this: Wheal fay my
own Citele3 I mean by it3 my three Plantations,
wte." my-Caftle, my Counery-Seat, which I cali'd
my Bower, and my Enclofure in the Woods; nor
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an
IncloiUre for my Goars \ for the Averfion which
Nature gave me t6 thefe hellifh. Wretches was
fuch, that. I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing
the Devil himiclf; nor did 1 fo much as go to look
after my Boat in all this Time; but began rather
to think of making me another; for 1 could not
think of ever making any more Attempts;^ bring
the other Boat round the libnd to foe, left I
(hould meet with fomc of thefe Creatures at Sea,
<- :.• in
in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would h^ve been my Lot.
Time however, and the Satisfaction. I had, that
I was in nol Panger of being discovered by thefe
People, .began to wear cff my Uneafinefs about
them ; and I began to live juft in the fame coropos'd
Manner as before; only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes morea-
bout me than I did before, left I Ihould happen to
be fcen by any of them; and particularly, I was
more cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them
being on the Ifland , fhould happen to hear of it;
and it was therefore a very good Providence to me,
that I had furniftui my felf with a tame Breed of
Goats, that I,needed not hunt any more about the
Woods, or (hoot at them; and if I did catch any
of them after this, is was by Traps and Snares,
as IJiad done before; fo that for two Years after
this, I believe I never fir'd my. Gun once oif, tho' I
never Avehtou,t without it; and which was mote, as
I ha4 fav'd three Piftols ojt of the Ship, I always
carried them.out with me, or at leaft two of them,
flicking them in my Goat-Skin Belt; alfo I furbifh'd
uponeofthegreatCutlafhes, that I had out of the
Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on alfo; fo that
I was now a mofl formidable Fellow to lopk at,
when I went abroad, if you add to the former De-
fcriptionofmy felf, the Particular of two Piftols,
#nd a great broad Sword hanging at my Side in a
Belt, but without a Scabbard,
-Things going on slms, as I have faid, for fome
Time, I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions, to be
jediic'd to my former calm fedate way of Living,
-allvfhefe, Things tended to (hewing me more and
mp.re how far my Condition was from being mife-
rable, compared to fome others; nay, to many o-
ther P^rccukus of Life, which ,*t might have'pica-
O z fed
fed God to have made my Lot. It put me bpon
refletting, how little -repining there would be
among Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo-
ple would rather compare their Condition with
thofe that are worfe, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with thole which are
better, to aiflft their Murmurings and Complain-
ings.
As in *my prefent Condition there were not really
many Things which I wanted; fo indeed I thought
that the Frights I had been in about rhefe Savage
Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my
own Prefervation, had taken off the Edge of my In*
verition for my own Conveniences •, and I had dropt
a good Deiign, which I had once bent ray Thoughts
too much upon:> and that was to try if 1 Could not
makefbmeof my Barley into IV^alt, and then try
to brew my felf ibme Beer: This was really a whim-
fical Thought, and I reproved my feIf often for the
Simplicity of it •, for I prefently faw there would
be the Want of feveral Things neceffary, to the
making my Beer, that it would, beimpoffible for
metofupply: As Firft, Casks to preferve it in,
Which was a Thing that, as I have obferv'd alrea-
dy, I could never compafi \ no, tho? I fpent not
many Days, jbitt Weeks, nay Months in attempt-
ing it, but to no purpofe. In the next Place,T had
110 Hopes to make it keep, no Y^aft to make it work,
no Copper or Kettle to make.it boil \ and yet all
thele Things notwithstanding, I verily believe, had
not thefe Things intervened, I i^ean the Frights and
Terrors! was in ^bout the Savages, I had under-
taken it, a$d perhaps brought it to pafs; too \ for I
feldom g^ve any Thing over without accomplishing
it, whenl once had it in my Head enough to be-
ginifr
But
But my Invention now run quite another Way -,
fpr Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might deftroy fome of thefe Monfters in their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if pbfhble, fave
the Viftim they fhould bring hither to deftroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to fet down all the Contri-
vances I hatch'd, or. rather brooded upon in my
Thoughts, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at
leaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coming
hither $ny more} but all was abortive, nothing
£ould be poifible to take Effeft, unlets 1 was to be
there to do it.my felf*, and what could one Man
do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which they
could flioot as true to a Mark, as I could with my
GUn?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a Hole under the
Place where they made their Fire, and put in five
or fix Pounds of Gun-powder, which when they
kindled their Fire, would confequently take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it \ but as in the firft
Place I fhould be very loath to waft fo muchPowder
Upon them, my Store being now within the Quan-
tityof one Barrel', fo neither could I be fure of its
going off, at any certain time, when it might fur-
prize them, and at beft, that it would do little more
than juft blow the Fire about their Ears and fright
fheiii, Hut not fufficientto make them fbrfake the
'Place *,fc I laid, it afide, and then proposed, that
I would place my feif in Ambufh, in fbme con-
venient Place, with my three Guns, all double
loaded , and in the middle of their bloodv Cere-
; raring let fly at them, when I fhould be fure to kill
or <voiind perhaps two or three at every fhoot} and
then falling in upon them with my three Piftols,
O 4 and
N and my Sword, I made no doubt but that if there
was twenty I-Jhould kill them all. This Fancy
pleasM my Thoughts for fame Weeks, and I was
fo full of itythat I often dream'd of it; and fome-
times, that 1 was juft going to let fly at chem in
my Sleep,
I went fo far with it in my Imagination, that I
employ'd myfelf (everal Days to find out proper
Places to put myfelf in Ambufcade, as I faid, to
watch for them \ and I went frequently to the Place
itfelf, which was now grown more familiar to
me; and efpecially while my Mind was thus filTd
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody put-
ting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I
may call it* the Horror I had at the Place, and
at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devour-
ing one another, abated my Malice.
Well,at lengthl found aPlacein the Side cf the
Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fecurely wait,
till I faw any of their Boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
Shore,convey myfelf unfeen inro Thickets of Trees,
in one of which there was a Hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and wherel might fit, and
obferve all their bloody Doings, and take my full,
Aim at their Heads, when they were fo clofe toge-
ther, as that it wruld be next toimpoffible that I
fhould mifs my Shoot, or that I could fail wound-
ing three or four of them at the firft Shoot. .
In this Place then I refolved to f\K my Defign,
and accordingly I prepared two Muskets, and my
ordinary Fowling-Piece. The two Muskets I
loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five
fmaller Bullets, about* the Sifce of Piftol-Bullets;
and the Fowling-Piece 1 loaded with near a Hand-
fid of Swan-Shot, of the largeft Size; I alfo loaded
ftiy Piftols wit}} about four Bullets each^ and in this
[2.01]
Pofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe-
cond and third Charge, I prepared my felf for my
Expedition.
After I had thus-laid the Scheme of my Defign,
and in my Imagination put it in Pra&ice, I con-
tinually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Caftle, as
I call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
the Ifland, or ftanding over towards it ,• but! be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two
or three Months conftantly keep my Watch; but
came always back without any Difcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaf! Appea-
rance, not * only on, or near the Shore; but not
on the whole Ocean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafles
could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fuitable Form, for fo outrageous an Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into
a Difcuffion of in my Thoughts, any further than
xay Paffions were at firft fir'd by the Horror I con-,
ceiv'd at the unnatural Cuftonrof that People of the
Country* .Who it feems i*ad been fufter'd by Provi-
dence* in Jus-wife Difpofition of the World, to have
no other iGiiide than that of their own abominable
and-vitiated Paffions; and confequently were left
and perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to aft fuch
hornd Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cu-
ftoms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, indaaed by fome hellilh Degeneracy
could have run them into: But now when, as I
have faid> I began to be weary of the fruitlefs Ex-
curfjon which I had madefo long, and fo far, eve-
ry
f zoi 3
ry Morning in vain, fQ my Opinion of the Aftion
itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts toconfider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in.-, what Authority or Call 1 had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for ib many Ages to fuffer, unpuniftiM, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another: How far thefe People
were Offenders againfi: me, and what Right 1 had
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
ifyed promifcuoufly one upon another, I debated
this very otten with mv felf thus: How do I know
what God him (elf judges in this particular Cafe? It
is certain thefe People do not commit this as a
Qrjme *, it is not againft their own Conferences re-
proving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Offence, and then commit
it in Defiance of divine Juftice, as we do in almoft
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
tQ kill ah Ox} nor to eat human Flefli, than we do
to eat Mutton/
When I had confider'd this a little, it followed ne-
ceffarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in it v
that thefe People were not Murderers in the Senfe
that I had before condemned them in my Thoughts }
any more than thofeChriftians were Murderers,who
often put to Death the Prifpiiers taken in Battle *,
or more frequently, upon many Occafions, put
whole Troops of Men to the Svvord, without gi-
ving Quarter, tho' they threw down their Arms .
and fiibmitted. i
In the next Place it occurr'dAme, that albeit the
XJfage they gave one another was thus f brutifh
and inhuman \ yet it was really' nothing to me:
Thefe People had done me no Injury: That if they
attempted
attempted me, or 1 few it neceflary for my imme-
4iate Prefefvation to fall upon them 5 ibincthing
jnight be faid for it? but that I w-<s ycc out of cheir
tower, and they had really no Knowledge of me,
and confequently no Defign upon me:, and there-
fore it could not be juft for me to fall upon them.
^That this would juftify the Conduct of the Spaniards
in all their Barbarities praftis'd in America, where
.they deftroyed Millions of thefe People, who, how-
ever they were Idolaters and Barbarians, and had le-
veral bloody and barbarous Rites in their Cuftoms,
fuch as facrificing human Bodies to their Idols,
were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent People ^
and that the Rooting them out of the Country, is
fpbken of with the utmoft Abhorrence and Detefta-
tion, by even the Spaniards themielves, at this Time,
and by all other Chriftian Nations of Europe, as a
mere Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of
Cruelty,uajuftifiable either to God or Man-, and
fuch, as for which the very Name of a Spaniard is
reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all People of
Humanity, or of Chriftian Companion: As if the
Kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for
the Produft of a Race of Men, who were without
Principles ofTendernefs, or the common Bowels of
Pity to the Miferable, which is recon'd to be a Mark
of generous Temper in the Mind.
Theie Confutations really put me to a Paufe,
and'to a kind of a full Stop-; andl began by little
arid little to be off of my Defign, and to conclude, I
had taken wrong Meafiires in my Refolutions tdat-
ta!ck the Savages *, that it was not my Bufinefi to
meddle with them, unlets they firft attack'dme, and
this k was my Bufinefs if poflible to prevent#, but
that if I were diicovered, and attacked, then I knew
my puty.
On
On the other hand, I atgu'd with myfelf, That
thfs really was the Way not to deliver myfelf, but
entucly to ruin and deftrpy myfelf-, for nnlefs I
was fure to kill every one that not only fhould be
on Shore at that T ime, but that fhould ever come
on Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, ro
tell their .Country-People what had happen'd,
they would corre over auain by Thousands to re-
venge the Death of their Fellows, and 1 fhould
only bring upon myfelf a certain Dcftru£Hon,
uhichai prcfentl had no manner of Occafion for.
Upon the VV hole I concluded, that neither in
Principles nor in Policy 1 ought one Way or orber
tocpneern nyicif in this affair. That my Bufi-
neis was by all pcffible Means to cenceal myfelf
from them, and not to lfaye the leaft Signal to
them toguefs by?rhat there were any living Crea-
tures upon the liiand •, I mean of human Shape
Religion join'd in with this Prudential, and I
was convine'd now many Ways, that I was per-
fectly our of my Duty, when I was laying all my
bloody Schemes for the Deftru&ion of innocent
Creatures, I mean innocent as to me: As to the
Crimes they were guilty of towards oneanother,!
had nothing £o do with them-, they were Natio-
nal, and 1 ought to leave them to the Juftice of
Gpd,who is the Governor of Nations, and knows
how by National Punifhments to make a ju.ft Re-
tribution for National Offences^ and to bring Pub-
Jick Judgments upon thofe whooffend in a Pubjick
fanner, by fuch Ways as beft pleafe him.
This appeared fo clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfo&ion to me, than that 1 had
not been fnffer'd to do a Thing which I now faw
fo mqch Reafbn tp believe would have been no Ms
a SiUj than that of .wilful Murder, if I Jijtd com-
mitted
mitted it; and I gave moll' humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that huad thus delivered me from
Blood-guiitinefs; befeediing him to grant me the
Protection of hi^Prbvidence, that Tmight not fall
into the Hands oi Barbarians; or that Imight not
lay my Hafcds upon them, unlefs I had a more
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my
own Life.
In this Difpofition I continued for near a Year
after this; and fo far was I from defiring an Oc-
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
whether there were any of them in Sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might prefent
itfelf to fall upon them; only this I did, I went
and removed my Boat/ which I had on the other
Side thelfland, and carried it down to the Eafl- End
of the whole Itland, where I ran it into a little
Cove which I found under fome high Rocks, and
where I knew, by reafon of the" Currents, the
Savages durfi not, at-leaft would not come with
their Boats, upon any Account whatfoever.
With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, tho' not neceflary
for the bare going thither,7 viz,. A Maft and Sail
which I had made for her, and a Thing like an An-
chor, but indeed which could not be call'd either
Anchot or Grapling; however, it was the beftl
could make of its kind: All thefe I removed, that
there might not be the lead Shadow of any Difco-
very, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of any
human Habitation upon the Ifland.
 Befides this, 1 kept myfeU, as I faid, more re-
tired than ever, and fddom went from my Cell, p-
ther
t *xs ]
fcher than upon my conftant Employment, */*&. To
milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock, in
the Wood \ which, as it was quite on the other Part
of the Ifland, was quite out of Danger } for certain
it is, that thefe lavage People, who fometitaes
haunted this Ifland, never came with any Thoughts
of finding any Thing here *, and confequently never
wandred off from the Coaft :, and I doubt not, but
they might have been feveral Times on Shore, after4
my Apprehenfions of them had made me cautious
&s well as before \ and indeed, I look'd back with
fome Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Con-
dition would have been, if I had chopped upon them,
and been difcovered before that, when naked and
tmarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaded of-
ten only with final] Shot, I walk'd every where
peeping, and peeping about the Wand, to fee what
1 could get; what a Surprize ihould I have been in,
if when I dilcover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I
had inftead of that feen fifteen or twenty Savages,
and found them purfuing me, and by the Swiftnefs
of their Running, no Poiiiblity of my efcaping
them?
The Thoughts of this fbmetimes funk my very
Soul within the, and diftrefs'd my Mind fb much,
that 1 could not fbon recover it, to think what I
ihould have done, and how I not only fhould not
have been able to refift theirij but even fhould not
have had Prelence of Mind enough to do what I
might have done, much lefs, what now after fo
much Confideration and Preparation I iriight be
able to do. Indeed, after ferious thinking Of thefe
Things, I would be very Melancholy, atld fbme-
times it Would lafl: a great while m7 but I fefohPd it
at laft all into Thankfulnets to that Providence
which had delivered me from fo many urileen Dan-
gers, and had kept me from thofe Mifchiefs: which
1 could
I could no ivay have been the Agent in delivering
my felf from; bedaufe I had not the leaft Notion
of any luch Thing depending or the leaftSuppo-
fition of it being poffible.
This renew'd a Contemplation, which, often had
come to itiy Thoughts in former Time, when firft
I began to fee the merciful Ditpolkions of Heaven,
in the Dangers we run through in this Life: How
Wonderfully we are delivered, when we know no-
thing of it* How when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hefitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, afecret Hintfhall dire£fc
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way -7
nay, when Senle, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Bufmefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet a ftrange
Impreffion upon the Mind, from we know not what
Springs, and by we know not what Power, lhall
over-rule us to go this Way -. and it ihall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that Way which we Ihould
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to
have gone, we ihould have been ruin'd and loft.
Upon thefe, and many like Reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Preffings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre-
ferred -, or to going this Way, or that Way, I never
fail'd to obey the fecret Diftate •, though I knew no
other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Preffure, or
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give ma-
ny Examples of the Succefs of thisConduft in the
Courfe of my Life; but more efpecially in the lat-
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Iilaixi; be-
iides many Occafions which it is very likely I might
Jkayp taken Notice of, if I had feen with the lame
.Eyes then, that I law with now: But 'tis never too
late to be wife; and 1 cannot but advife allconfi-
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch ex-
traordinary
traordinary Incidents as mine, or ev£n though not
fo extraordinary, not to llight fuch fecret Intimati*
ons of Providence, let them come from what invifi-
ble Intelligence they will, that I Hull not difcufs,
and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits, and the fe-
ctct Communication between thofe embody'd, and
thofe unembodyM; and fuch a Proof as can never
be withftood: Of which I (hall have Occafion to
give fome very remarkable Inftances in the Remain-
der of my folitary Refidence in this difmal Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think
ftrange, if I confefs that thefe Anxieties, thefe
conflant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that
wasnow upon me, put an End to all Invention,
and to all the Contrivances that I had laid for my
•future Accommodations and Conveniences. I had
the Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands,
than that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a.Nail,
©r chop a Stick of Wood now, forfear the Noife I
fliould make fliould be heard; much lefs would I
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon; and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at making any Fire, left the
Smoak, which is vifible at a great Diftance in the
Day, fhould betray me; and for this Reafon I re-
mov'd that Part of my Bufinefs which required
Fire, fuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, &c. into
my new Apartment in the Woods, where after I
had been fome Time, I found, to my unfpeakable
Confolation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth,
which went in a vaft way, and where, I dare fay,
no Savage had been at the Mouth of it, would be
fo hardy as to venture ;n, nor indeed would any
Man elfe, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
fo much as a fafe Retreat,
The
The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom
of a great Rock, where, by meer Accident (I
would fay, if I did not fee abundant Reafon to
afcribe all fuch things now to Providence) ,1. was
cutting down fome thick Branches of Trees, to
make Charcoal; and before I go on, I muft ob-
ferve the Reafon of my making this Charcoal;
which was thus:
I was afraid of making a Smoak about my Ha-
bitation, as I faid before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my
Meat, &c, fo I contrived to burn fome Wood here,
as I had feen done in England under Turf, till' it
became Chark, or dry Coal) and then putting the
Fire out, I preferv'd the Coal to carry home, and
perform the other Services, which Fire; was want-
ing for at home, without clanger of Smoak.
But this by the by. While I was cutting down
fome Wood here,-1 perceived that behind a very
thick Branch of low Brufh-wood, or Under-wood,
there was a kind of hollow Place; I was curious to
look into it, and getting with difficulty into tl^e
mouth.of it, I found it w.as pretty large, < that is
to fay, fufficient for me to ftand upright in it, and
perhaps another with me; but 1 muft confefs to
you, I made more hafte out than I did in, when
looking further into the Place, and which' was per-
fectly dark, I faw two broad dining Eyes of fome
Creature, whether Devil or Man, I knew not,
which twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light
from the Cave's Mouth fhining dire&ly in, and
making the Refle&ion. ..'
However, after fome Paufe, I recovered myfelf,
and began to call myfeif a thoiifand Fools, and
tell myfelf, that he that was afraid to fee the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Iflatid all
alone; and that I durft to believe there was no-
Part I. P thing
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my
felf; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand,, and in I rufliM again, with the
Stick flaming in my Hand: I had not gone three
Steps in, but I was almofi as much frighted as I was
before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in fome Pain, and it was follow'd by a broken
Noife, as if of Words half exprefs'd, and then a
deep Sigh again: I ftep'd back, and was indeed,
ftruck with fuch a Surprize, that it put nie into a
cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat op my Head,
I will not anfwer for it, that my Halt Tnight not
have lifted it off. But ftill plucking up my Spirits
as well as I could, and encouraging myfdf a little,
with considering that the Power and Prefence of
God was every where, and was able to proteft me;
upon this I ftepM forward again, and $y the Light
of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my
Head, I/aw lying on the Ground a moji rtionftrous
frightful* old He-Goat, juft making his Will, as we
fay, and gafping for Life, and dying indeed of
meer old Age.
I ftir'd him a little, \o fee if I could get him out,
and tie effay'd to get up, but was not able to raife
himfelf; and I thought with myfelf, he might e'en
^lie there; for if. he had frighted me fo, he would
certainly fright any pi the Savages, if any ofthem
fliould be fo hardy as to come in there while he
had any Life in him. j
I was now recovered from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very fmall, that is to fay, it might 4be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or Cquare, no Hands having ever been
employed in making it, but thofe of meer Nature:
I obfervM alfo, that there was a Place; at the fur-
ther fide of it that went in further, tut was fo
low,
low, that it required me to creep upon my Hands
and Knees to go into it, and whither I went I knew
not; fo having no Candle, I gave it over for fome
time; but refolved to come again the next Day,
provided with Candles, and a Tinder-box, which
I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets,
with fome Wild-fire in the Pan.
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided
with fix large Candles of my own making; for I
made very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow;
and going into this low Place, I was obliged to
creep upon all Fours, as I have faid, almoft ten
Yards; which, by the way, I thought was a Ven^
ture bold enough, confidering that I knew not how
far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When
I was got thro' the Strait, I found the Roof rofe
higher up, I believe near twenty Foot; but never
was fuch a glorious fight feen in the Jfland, I dara
fay, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof
of this Vault or Cave; the Walls refle&ed a hun*
dred thoufand Lights to me from my two Candles $
what it was in the Rock, whether Diamonds, or
any other precious Stoneis, or Gold, which I rather
fuppofed it to be, I knew not.
^ The Place I was inr was a moft delightful Ca-
vity, or Grotto, 6f its kind, as could be expe&ed,
tho* perfectly dark • the Floor was dry and le-
vel, and had a fcrtof fmall loofe Gravel upon
it; fo that there was no naufeous or venomous?
Creature to be feen, neither was there any Damp
or Wet on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficult
ty in it was the Entrance, which, however, as its
was a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; fo
that I was really rejoiced at the Difcovery, and re-
folved, without any delay, to bring fome of thofe
Swings which I was moft anxious about to this
P a Place?
Place; particularly, I refolded to bring hither mtf
Magazine of Powder, and all my fpare Armsy
viz,. Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I had three in* all)
and three Muskets, (for of them I had eight in all;)
fo I kept at my Caftle only five, which flood rea-
dy mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my out-
moft Fence; and were ready alfo to take out upon
any Expedition.
Upon this Qccafion of removing my Ammuni-
tion, I.took occafion to open the Barrel of Pow-
der which I took up out of the Sea, and which
had been wet; and I found that the Water had pe-
netrated about tlrfee or four Inches into the Pow-
der on eyery fide, which caking and growing hard,
had preferved the infide like a Kernel in a Shell;
fo that I had near fixty pounds of very good Powr
der in the Centre of the Cask; and this was an a-
greeable difcovery to me at that time; fo I car*
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three pounds of Powder with me in my Caftle, for
fear of a Surprize of any kind: I alfo carried thi-
ther all the Lead I had left for Bullets.
I fancied myfelf now like one of the ancient Gi-
ants, which were faid to live in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks,! where none could come at them;
for I perfwaded myfelf, while I was here, if .five
hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne-
ver find me out; or if they did,.they would not
venture to attack me here. ^ ' . * ;.
The old Goat who I found expiring, died in
the mouth of, the Cave, the next Day after I made
this Difcovery; and I found it much eafier to;dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out: ?b I in-
tend him there, to prevent offence to my Nofe.
, I Was
f was now in my twenty-third Year of Refi*-
,-dence in this Ifland, and was fo naturalized to the
Place, and to the Manner of living, that could I
have but enjoyed the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to difturb me, I could
have been content to have capitulated for fpending
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo-
ment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old
Goat in the Cave. I had alfo arrived to Tome little
Diverfions and Amufements, which made the Time
pafsmore pleafantly with me a great deal than
it did before ,• as firft, I had taught my Poll, as I
noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly,
and talk'd fo articulately and plain, that it was
very pleafant to me; and he lived with m^ no lefs
than fix and twenty Years. How long he might
live afterwards, I know not; tho* I know they
have a Notion in the Brafels, that they live a hun-
dred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there
ftill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this Day. I
wifli no Englifhmdn the ill Luck to come there and
hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to mc for no lefs than fix-
teen Years of my Time, and then died of meer
old Age; as for my Cats, they multiplied, as I have
obferv'd, to that degree,that I was obliged to (hoot
feveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had; but at length, when the
two old ones I brought with me were gone, and
after fome time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except ,two or three
Favourites, which I kept tame, and whofe Young,
when they had any, I always drowned; and thefe
were part of my Family. Befides thefe, I always
kept two or three Houfhold Kids about me^ which I
P 3 taught
taught .te feed out of my Hand; and 1 had twd
more Parrots, which talk'd pretty well, and would
all call Robin Crufoe, but none like my firft^ nor in-
deed, did I take the Pains with any of them that I
had done with him* I had alfo feveral tame Sea-
Fowls, whofe Names I know not, who I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings; and the lit-
tle Stakes which I had planted before my Caftle-
Wall, being now grown up to a good thick Grove,
thefe Fowls all lived among thefe low Trees, and
bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fo
that, as I faid above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the Life I led, if it might but have
been fecured from the Dread of the Savages,
But it was otherwife djre&ed; and it may hot
be amifs for all People who fliall meet with my
Story, to make this juft Observation from it, viz*
How frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the
Evil which in itfelf we (eek moft to ftiun* and
which; when we &re fallen intp, is the moft dread-
ful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of
our Deliverance, by which alone we can be raised
again from the<A|fliaion we are fallen into. I could
give mat?y Exajnpies of this in the Courfe of my un-
accountable Life; but in nothing was it more par-
ticularly rejnarkabk than in the Circumftances of
jny laft Year's folitary ftefidence in this liland.
It was now the Month of December* as I faid a-
bove, in mytwenty-thitd Ye^r; and this being the
fouthern Solftice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harveft, and required
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields; when
£oing out pretty early in the Morning, even before
it was thorow Day-light, I was furpriz'd with fee-
ing a Light of iome Fire upon the Shore, at a di-
ftance from me, of about two Miles, towards the
end of the Ifland, where I had obferved fpme Sa-
vages
stages had been, as before, but not on the other
.Side; but to my great Affli&ion, it was on my
Side of the Ifland.
I was indeed terribly furpr^'d at the Sight, and
ftep'd fhort within my Grove, not daring to go
out left I might be furpriz'd ,- and yet 1 had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfions I had,
that if thefe Savages, in rambling over the Ifland,
fhould find my Corn {landing, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude,, that there were People m the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
me out : In this Extremity I went back direftly to
my Caftle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all things without look as wild and natural as I
could.
Then I prepared my felf within, putting my felf
in a Pofture of Defence ,• I loaded all my Cannon,
as I caird them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon my new Fortification, and all
my Piftols, and refolv'd to defend my felf to the
laft Gafp, not for getting ferioufly to commend my
felf to the divine Prote&ion, and earneftly to pray
to God to deliver me^out of the Hands of the Bar-
barians; and in this Pofture I continu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend outl
After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I
fhould do in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fit-
ting in Ignorance any longer; fo fetting up my
Ladder to the fide of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferved before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling out
my Profpe&ive-Glafs, which I had taken on Pur~
pofe, I' laid me flat down on my Belly on the
ground, and began to look for the Place, I pre-
P 4 fently
fently found there was nolefs than nine naked Sa-
vages fitting round a fmall Fire, they had made,
not to warm them, for they had no heed of that,
the Weather being extream hot; but, as Ifuppos'd,
to drefs fome of their barbarous Diet of humane
Flefh, which they had brought with them, whe-
ther alive or dead, I could not know.
They had two Canoes with them, which they had
haled up upon the Shore,- and as it was then Tide
of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the Return
of the Flood, to go away again; it is not eafy to
imagine what Confufion this Sight put me into,
efpecially feeing them come on my fide the Ifland,
and fo near me too; but when I obfervM their
coming muft be always with the Current of the
Ebb, I began afterwards to be more fedate in my
Mind, beingfatisfy'd that I might go abroad with
Safety-all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if they
were not on Shore before: And having made this
Obfervation, I went abroad about my Harveft-
Wbfk with the more Gompofure.
s; As I expe&ed, fo it prov'd; for as foon as the
Tide made to the Weft ward, I faw them all take
Boatj and row ^or paddle, as we call it) all away:
I fhould have obferv'd, that for an Hour and more
"before they went off, they went to dancing, and I
could eafily difcern their Poftures and Geftures by
my Glaffes: I could not perceive, by my niceft
Obfervation, but that they were ftark naked, and
had not the leaft Covering upon them ,• but whe-
ther they were Men or Women, that I could not
"dlftinguilh. .' '.''; • ,
As foon as I faw them fliipM and gone, I took
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piftpls at
my Girdle, and my great Sword by my fide, with-
out a Scabbard, and with all the fpeed I was able
to make, I went aw,ay to the Hill/ where I had dif-
1 cover'd
covered the firft Appearance of all; and as foon as
I gat thither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(jfor I could not go apace, being fo loaden with
Arms as I was) I perceiv'd there had been three
Canoes more of Savages on that Place ; and looking
out further, I faw they were all at Sea together,
making over for the Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially when
going down to the Shore, I could fee the Marks of
Horror which the difmal Work they had been
about had left behind it, viz,. The Blood, the
Bones, and Part of the Flefli of humane Bodies,
eaten and devoured by thofe Wretches, with Mer-
riment and Sport: I was fo fill'd with Indignation
at the Sight, that I began now to premeditate the
Deftru&ion of the next that I faw there, let them
l>e who or how many foever.
It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very frequent;
for it was above fifteen Months before any more of
them came on fliore there again; that is to fay> I
neither faw them, or any Footfteps, or Signals of
them, in all that Time; for as to the rainy Sea-
fons, then they are fure not to come abroad, at
leaft not fo far; yet all this while I liv'd uncom-
fortably, by reafon of the conftant Apprehenfions
I was in of their coming upon me by furprize;
from whence I obferve, that the Expectation of
Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, efpecially if
there is no room to fhake off ^that Expe&ation,
or thofe Apprehenfions.
During all this Time, I was in the murdering
Humour; and took up moft of my Hours, which
fhould have been better employed in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next Time I fhould fee them; efpecially, if they
jfhould be divided, as they were the laft Time, in-
to
to two Parties; nor did I eonfider at all, that if I
killed one Party, fuppofe ten or a dozen, I wasftill
the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill another,
and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I fhould be at
fcngthno lefs a Murderer than they were in being
Man-eaters, and perhaps much more fo.
I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity and
'Anxiety of Mind, expe&^ng that I fhould one Day
or other fall into the Hands of thefe mercilefs Crea-
tures ; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with the great-
eft Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found
to my great Comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for
I durft not upon any account, fire my Gun, efpe-
cially near that fide of the Ifland where they ufu-
ally came, left I fhould alarm the Savages; and
if they had fled from me now, I was fure to have
them come back again, with perhaps two or three
hundred Canoes with them in a few Days, and then
I knew what to exped.
However, I wore out a Year and three Months
more,, before I ever faw any more of the Savages,
and then I found them again, as I fiiall foon obferve.
It is true, they might have been there once or twice;
but either they made no Stay, or at leaft, I did not
hear them ; but in the Month of May, as near as I
could calculate, and in my femr and twentieth Year,
I bad a very ftrange Encounter with them, of which
in its Place.
The Perturbation 'of my Mind, during this fif-
teen or fifteen Months Interval, was*very great;
I flept unqaiet,. dreamt always frightful Dreams,
and often ftarted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
the Day great Troubles overwhelmed my Mitid,
and in t$e Night I dreamt often of killing the
;•-  '•-• S&vagesi,
Savages, and of the Reafons why I might juftify
the doing of it: But to wave all this for a while;
it was in the middle otMay, on thefixteenth Day
I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar
would reckon; for I mark'd all upon thePofl ftill;
I fay, it was on the fixteenth of May, that it blew
a very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great
deal of Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it : I know not what was the
particular occafion of it; but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very ferious Thoughts
about my prefent Condition, I was furpriz'd with
a Noife of a Gun, as I thought, fir'd at Sea,
This was to be fure a Surprize of a quite diffe-
rent Nature from any I had met with before; for
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another kind. I ftarted up in the greateft Hafte
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pulled it after me,
and mounting it the fecond Time, got to the Top
of the Hill, the very Moment that a Flafh of Fire
bid meliflen for a fecond Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, I heard, and by the Sound
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where
I was driven down the Current in my Boat.
I immediately confiderM that thismuft be fome
Ship in Diftrefs, and that they had fome Comrade,
or fome other Ship in company, and fir'd thefe Guns
for Signals of Diftrefs, and to obtain Help : I had
this Prefence of Mind at that minute, as to think
that tho' I could not help them, it may be they
might help me; fo I brought together all the
dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good
handfome Pile, I fet it on Fire upon the Hill; the
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and tho* the
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; that
I was certain, if there was any fuch Thing as a
Ship,
;Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt they did?
for as foon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard ano-
ther Gun, and after that feveral others, all from the
fame Quarter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long, till
Pay broke ;;and when it was broad Day, and the
Air cleared up, I faw fomething at a great Diftance
at Sea, full Eafi of the Ifland, whether- a Sail, or a
Hull, I could not diftinguifti, no not with my Glaf-
fes, the Diftance was fo great, and the Weather ftill
fomething hazy alfo ; at leaft it was fo out at Sea.
I looked frequently at it all that Day, and foon
perceived that it did not move; fo I prefently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be fure, to be fatisfyM, I took my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the South-Eafl
Side of the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had for-
merly been carry?d away with the Current, and
getting up there, the Weather by this Time being
perfectly clear, I could plainly fee, to my great
Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship caft away in the
Night, upon thofe concealed Rocks which I found
when I was out in my Boat; and which Rocks, as
they checked the Violence of the Stream, and made
a kind of Counter-Stream or Eddy, were the Oc-
caflon of my< recovering from the moft defperate
hopelefs Condition that ever I had been in in all
my Life.
Thus, what is one Man's fafety, is another Man's
deftruftion; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they
were, being out of their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at
E.zn&E.N.E. Had they feenthe Ifland, as I muft
neceffarily fuppofe they did not, thejr muft, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have fav'd themfelves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, efpecially when they faw, as I
imagin'd,
Imagined, my Fire, fillM me with many Thoughts:
Firft I imagin'd, that upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves into their Boat, and
have endeavoured to make the Shore; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been caft
away; other times I imagined, that they might
have loft their Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many ways; as particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obli-
ges Men to flave, or take in pieces their Boat; and
fometimes to throw it over Board with their own
Hands: Other times I imagined, they had fome
other Ship or Ships in Company, who, upon the
Signals of Diftrefs they had made, had taken them
up and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fancy'd,
they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat, and
being hurfy'd away by the Current that I had been
formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean
where there was nothing but Mifery and Perifhing;
and that perhaps they might by this Time think of
ftarving, and of being in a Condition to eat one
another.
As all thefe were but Conjectures at beft, fo ift the
Condition I was in, I could do no more than look
on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and pity
them, which had ftill this good Effect on my Side,
that it gave me more and more Caufe to give
Thanks to God, who had fo happily and comfort-
ably provided for me in my defolate Condition • and
that of two Ships Companies who were now caft
iaway upon this Part of the World, not one Life
fliould be fpar'd but mine: I learn'd here again to
obferve, that it is very rare that the Providence of
God cafts us into any Condition of Life fo]ow,or
any Mifery fo great, but we may fee fomethingor
other to be thankful for; and may fee others in
worfe Circumftances than our own*
Such
L 222 ]
Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, of
whom I could not fo much as fee Room to fup-
pofe any of them were fav'd; nothing could make
it rational, fo much as to wifh or exped that they
did not all perifti there, except the Poflibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com-
pany : and this was but mere Poflibility indeed; for
I faw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any
fuch Thing.
I cannot explain,by any poffible Energy of Words,
what a firange Longing or Hankering of Defires I
felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out fome-
times thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, to have
efcap'd to me, that I might but have had one Com-
panion, ope Fellow-Creature to have fpoken to me,
and to have conversed with! In all the Time of my
folitary Life, I never felt fo earneft, fo ftrong a, De-
fire after the Society of my Fellow-Creatures, or fo
deep a Regret at the Want of it.
There are fome fecret moving Springs in the A£-
fe&ions, which when they are fet a-going, by fome
Objeft in View, or be it fome Objefli, though not
in View, yet rendered prefent to* the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuofity to fuch violent eager Em-
bracings of the Objed, that the Abfence of it is
infupportable. '':
Such were thefe earneft Wifliings, That but one
Man had been fav'd! 0 that it had been but One! I
believe I repeated the Words, O that it had been but
One! a thoufad times  and the Defires were fo
mov'd by it, that when I fpoke the Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs
the, Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any foft
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufh'dit invo-*
luntarily; and my Teeth in my Head would ftrike
together.
together, and fet againft one another fo ftrong,
..that for fome time I could not part them again.
Let the Naturalifts explain thcfe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them; all I can fay to
them is, to defcribe the F<,&, which was even fur-
prifing to me when I found it; tho' I knew not from
what it lhould proceed, it was doubtlefs theEfteft
of ardent Wiflies, and of flrong Ideas formed m my
Mind, realizing the Comfort which the Conven-
tion of one of my Fellow-Chriftians would have
been to me.
But it was not to be ; either their Fate, or mine,
or both, forbid it; for till the laft Year of my be-
ing on this Ifland, I never knew whether any were
fav'd out of that Ship or no; and had only the Af-
fliction fome Days after, to fee the Corps of a
drowned Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Ifland, which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
.noQoaths, but a Seaman's Wafkoat, a.Pair of o-
|tt& knee'd Linneh Drawers, and a blew Linnen
Shirt; but nothing to direft me fo much as to guefs
what Nation he was of: He had nothing in his
-Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco-
Pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times more Value
than the firft.
It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck; not doubt-
ing but I might find fomething on Board, that
might be ufeful to me; but that did not altogether
prefs me fo much, as the Poffibility that there
might be yet fome living Creature on board, whofe
Life I might not only fave, but might, by faving
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet, Night nor Day, but I muft
venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck ; and
committing the reft to God's Providence, I thought
the Impreffion was fo ftrohg upon my Mind, that
it could not be refilled, that it mull come from
fome invifib.e Dire&ion, and that Ifhouldbe want-
ing to my felf, if I did not go.
Under the Power of this Impreffion, I haften'd
back to my Caflle, prepared every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot
for frefh Water, a Compafs to fleer by, a Bottle of
Rum; for I had ftill a great deal of that left ; a
Basket full of Raifins: And thus loading my felf
with every Thing neceffary, I went down to my
Boat, got the Water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home
again for more; my fecond Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrella to fetup over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of frefli Water,
and about two Dozen of my fmall Loaves^ or
Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's Milk, and a Cheefe; all which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and
praying to God to direft my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at laft to the utmofl Point of the Ifland,
on that Side, (viz,.) N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture,,or not
to venture. I look'd on the rapid Currents which
ran conftantly on both Sides of the Ifland, at a
Diftance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I
forfaw that if I was driven into either of thofe
Currents, I fliould be carry'd a vaft Way out to
Sea, and perhaps out my Reach, or Sight of
the Ifland again,- and that then, as my Boat was
but fmall, if any little Gale of Wind fliould rife, I
fliould be inevitably loft.
Thefe
Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I
began to give over my Enterprize, and having hal^
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, £
ftept out, and fate me down upon a little riling
bit of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between
Fear and Defire about my Voyage; when, as 1 was
muling, 1 could perceive that the Tide was turn'd
and the Flood came on, upon which my going was
for fo many Hours impracticable. Upon this
prefently it occurred to me, that I fhould go up to
the higheft piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
ferve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might
not expedt to be driven another way home, with
the fame Rapidnefs of the Currents: This
Thought was no fooner in my Head, but I caft my
Eye upon a little Hill, which fufficiently over-
looks the Sea both ways, and from whence 1 had
a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
and which way I was to guide myfelf in my Re-
turn; here 1 found, that as the Current of the Ebb
fet out clofe by the South Point of the Ifland, fo
the Current of the Flood fet in clofe by the fhore
of the North Side, and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the North of the Ifland in my Re-
turn, and I fhould do well enough.
Encourag'd With this Observation, I refolv'd the
next Morning to fet out with the firft of the Tide;
and repofing myfelf for the Night in the Canoe,
under the grfeat Watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out: I made firft a little out to Sea full North, till
I began to feel the Benefit of the Current, which fee
Eaftward, and which carry Jd me at a great Rate,
and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern fide
Current had done before, and fo as to take from
me all Government of the Boat; but having a
Part I. Q^ ftrong
ftrong fteerage with my Paddle, I went at a great
Rate, direftly for the Wreck, and in lefs than two
Hours I came up to it.
It was a difmal fight to look at: The Ship,
which by its Building was Sfanijh, ftuck faft,.
jaum'd in between two Rocks; all the Stern and
Quarter of her was beaten to Pieces with the Sea ,•
and as her Forecaftle, which ftuck in the Rocks,
had run on with great Violence, her Mainmaft and
Foremaft were brought by the Board; that is to
fay, broken fhort off; but her Bpltfprit was found,
and the Head and Bow appeared firm; when I
came dofe to her, a Dog appeared upon her, who
feeing me coming, yelped and cry'd, and as foon
as I call'd him, jumpM into the Sea, to come to
me, and I took him into the Boat, but found him
almoft dead for Hunger and Thirft: I gave him a
Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous
Wolf, that had been ftarving a Fortnight in the
Snow : I then gave the poor Creature fome fr^lh
Water, with which, if I would have let him, he
would have burft himfelf.
After this I went on Board; but the firft fight
I met with, was two Men drown'd in the Cook-
Room, or Forecaftle of the Ship, with their Arms
faft about one another: I concluded, as is indeed
probable, that when the Ship ftruck, it being in a
Storm, the Sea broke fo high, and fo continually
over her, that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were ftrangled with the conftant rufhing in of
the Water, as much as if they had been under Wa-
ter. Befides the Dog, there was nothing left in
the Ship that had Life, nor any Goods that I
could fee, but what were fpoird by the Water.
There were fome Casks of Liquor, whether Wine
or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the
Hold; and which, the Water being ebb'd out, I
could
could fee; but they were too big to meddle with;
I faw feveral Chefts, which I believed belonged t o
jfome of the Seamen, and I got two of them into
the Boat, without examining what was in them.
Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the
Forepart broken off, I am perfuaded I might have
made a good Voyage; for by what I found in thefe
two Chefts, I had room to fuppofe the Ship had
a great deal of Wealth on board; and if I may
guefs by the Courfe (he fteer'd, fhe mud have been
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata,
in the South part of America, beyond the Brajils,
to the Havana, in the Gulph of Mexico, and fo per-
haps to Spain: She had, no doubt, a great Trea-
fure in her, but of no ufe at that time to any bo-
dy; and what became of the reft of her People,
I then knew not.
I found, befides thefe Chefts, a little Cask full of
Liquor, of about twenty Gallons, which I got into
my Boat, with much difficulty: there were feveral
Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with
about four pounds of Powder in it ,• as for the
Muskets, I had no occafion for them, fo I left them,
but took the Powder-horn: I took a Fire-fhovel
and Tongs, which I wanted extremely • as alfo
two little Brafs Kettles, a Copper Pot to make
Chocolate, and a Gridiron; and with this Cargo,
and the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to
make home again; and the fame Evening, about
an Hour within Night, I reached the Ifland again^
Weary and fatigued to the laft degree.
I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morn-
ing t jrefolv'd to harbour what I had gotten in my
new Cave, not ttf carry it home to my Caftle. After
refreshing myfelf, I got all my Cargo on fhore, and
began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of
Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum, but not fuch
Q,2 as
[ 228 J .;
as we had ac the Brajils i and in a word, not at
all good j but when I came to open the Chefts, I
found feveral things of great ufe to me: For Ex-
arhple, I found in one a fine Cafe of Bottles, of an
extraordinary kind, and fill'd with Cordial Waters,
fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
Pints each, and were tip'd with Silver: I found
two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweetmeats,
fo faften'd alfo 6n top, that the fait Water had
not hurt them ,• and two more of the fame, which
the Water had fpoil'd: I found fome very good
Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of Linnen white Handkerchiefs,
and coloured Neckcloths; the former were alfo
very welcome, being exceeding refrefhing to wipe
my Face in a hot Day ,• befides this, when I came
to the Till in the Chefts, I found there three great
Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about eleven
hundred Pieces in all ,• and in one of them, wrapt
up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and fome
fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold; J fuppofe they
might all weigh near a Pound.
The other Cheft I found had fome Cloaths in it,
but of little Value; but by the Circumftances it
muft have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate, tho'
there was no Powder in it, but about two Pounds
of fine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept,
I fuppofe, for charging their Fowling-pieces on 6c-
cafion: Upon the whole, I got very little by this
Voyage, that was of any ufe to me; for as to the
Money, I had no manner of occafion of it; 'twas
to me as the Dirt under my Feet; and I would
have given it all for three or four Pair of Englifh
Shoes and Stockings, which were things I greatly
wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for
many Years: I had, indeed, gotten two Pair of
Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet of. the
. two
two dtown'd Men, who 1 faw in the Wreck ; and
1 found two pair more in one of the Chefts, which
were very welcome to me; but they were not like
our Englijh Shoes, either for eafe or fervice, being
rather what we call Pumps than Shoes: I found
in this Seaman's Chefl: about fifty Pieces of Eight
in Royals, but no Gold ,-. I fuppofe this belonged
to a poorer Man than the other, which feem'd to
belong to fome Officer.
Well, however, I lugged this Money home to
my Cave, and laid it up, as 1 had done that before,
.which I brought from our own Ship; but it was
great Pity, as i faid, that the other part of this
Ship had not come to my Chare, for I am fatisfy'd I
might have loaded my Canoe feveral times over
with Money, which, if I had ever efcap'd to Eng-
land, would have lain here fafe enough till I might
have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my Things on fliore,
and fecurM them, I went back to my Boat, and
row'd 9r paddled her along the fhore to her old
JIarbour, where I laid her up, and madethe beft of
my Way to my old Habitation, where I found
jevery Thing fafe and quiet; fo 1 began to repofe
myfelf, live after my old Faihipn, and take Care of
my Family Affairs; and for a while, I liv'd eafy
enough; only that I was .more vigilant than I us'd
to be, looked out oftner, and did not go abroad fo
much; and if at any time I did ftir with any Free-
dom, it was always to the Eaft Part of the Ifland,
where I was pretty well fatisfy'd the Savages never
came, and where I could go without fo many Pre-
cautions, and fuch a Load of &xm$ and Ammuni-
tion, as I always carry'd with me if 1 yvent the
other way.
I HvM in this Condition near two Years more;
but my unlucky Head, that was always to let me
"QLS know
know it was born to make my Body miferable,
was all the two Years filled with Projects and De«
figns how, if it were poffible, I might get away
from this Hand; for fometimes I was for making
another Voyage to the Wreck, tho' m^ Reafon
told me that there was nothing left there worth the
Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a Ramble
one Way, fometimes another; and I believe verily,
if I had had the Boat that I went from Sallee in,
4I fhould have ventured to Sea, bound any where;
J knew not whither.
; I have been, in all my Circumftances, a Memento
to thofe who are touched with the general Plague
of Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one half
bf their Miferics flow; I mean, that of not being
fatisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Na-
ture hath plac'd them;* for not to look back upon
hiy primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice
of my Father, the Opposition to which was, as 1
inay call it, my O r 1 g i n a l Sin/ my fubfequent
Miftakes of the fame kind had been the means of
piy coming into this miferable Condition•• for had
that Providence, whidi fo happily had feated me
at the Brafihy as a Planter, blefs'd me with con-
fined Defires, and I could have been contented to
have goneon gradually, I might have been by this
Time, / mean in the Time oj 'my being in this Ifland,
one of the mdft confiderable Planters in the Bra-
fits; nay, I am perfwaded, that by the Improve*-
imentsl had made in that little * time Iliv'd there,
andtheEncreafelfhould probably have made, if I
had ftay'd, I might have been Worth an htindre<l
thoufand Moyadores ; and what Bufinefs had I to
leave a fettled Fortune, a^well-ftock'd Plantation,
. improving and increafing, to turn SupraCargoto
Guineay to fetch Negroes, when Patience and
Time would have fo encreas'd our Stock at
Home5
Home, that we could have bought them at our
,own Door, from thofe whofeJJufinefs it was to
fetch them ? and though it had coft us fomething
more, yet the Difference of that Price was by no
means worth faving at fo great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate ofyoungHeads,
fo Reflection upon the Folly of it is as ordinarily
the Exercife of more Years, or of the dear-bought
Experience of Time • and fo it was with me now;
and yet fo deep had the Miftake taken Root in
>ny Temper, that I could not fatisfy my felf in
my Station, but was continually poring upon the
Means and Poffibility of my Efcape from this
Place; and that I may with the greater Pleafure to
the Reader bring on the remaining Part of my Sto-
ry, it may not be improper to give fome Account
of my firft Conceptions on the Subject of this
foolifti Scheme for my Efcape ,• and how, and upon
what Foundation I a£ted.
I am now to be fuppos'd retired into my Caftle,
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate
laid up, and fecund under Water as ufual, and my
Condition reftor'd to what it was before: I had
jnore Wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; for I had no more Ufe for it,
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came there.
It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafon in
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft fet-
ting Foot in this Ifland of Splitarinefs, I was lying
in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, yery well in
Health, had no Pain, no Diftemper, no Uneafinefs
of Body, no, nor any Uneafinefs of Mind, more
than ordinary; but could by no means clofe my
Eyes; that is, fo as to deep ,• no, not a Wink all
NigJit long, otherwife than as follows;
,0.4 ft
It is as impoffible as needlefs, to fet down the
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd
through that great Thorowfair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the
whole Hiflory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
Ifland; and alfo of the Part of my Life fince I
came to this Ifland. In my Refle&ions upon the
State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on this
Ifland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my
Affairs, in the firft Years of my Habitation here,
compared to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I hadliv'd in ever fince I had feen the Print of
a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe the
Savages had frequented the Ifland even all the while^
and might have been feveral Hundreds of them at
Times on Shore there • but I had never known ivy
and was incapable of any Apprehenfions about it;
my Satisfaction was perfeft, tho* my Danger was
the fame; and I was as happy in not knowing ray
Danger, as if I had never really been expos'd to it.
This furniftiM my Thoughts with many very pro-
fitable Refle&ions, and particularly this one, How
infinitely Good that Providence is, which has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind fuch narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things;
and tho'he walks in the midft of fo many thoufand
Dangers, the Sight of which, if difcover'd to him,
would diftraft: his Mind, and fink his Spirits, he is
kept ferene and calm, by having the Events of
Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing
of the Dangers which furround him.
« After thefe Thoughts had forfome Time enter-
tained me, I came to refleft ferioufly upon the real
Danger I Jhad been in for fo many Years in this
very Ifland; and how I had walked about in the
great$ft Security, and with all poffibje Tranquili-
ty j
-ty ; evetl when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a
Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach of
Night, had been between me and the worft Kind
of Definition, viz,. That of falling into the Hands
of Canibals and Savages, who would have feizM
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat" or
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or &
Curlieu. I fliould unjuftly flander my felf, if I
fliould fay I was not fincerely thankful to my great
Preferver, to whofe lingular Protedion I acknow-
ledged, with great Humility, that all thefe un-
known Deliverances were due; and without which
I miift inevitably have fallen into their mercilefs
Hands.
1 When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was
for fome time taken up in confidering the Nature
of thefe wretched Creatures, I mean, the Savages;
and how it came to pafs in the World, that the
wife Governour of all Things fliould give up any
of his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity; nay, to fome-
thing fo much below even Brutality itfelf, as to
devour its own Kind: But as this ended in fome
(•at that Time fruitlefs) Speculations, it occur'd
to me to enquire, what Part of the World thefe
Wretches liv'd in; how far off the Coaft was from
whence they came; what they venturM overfo far
from Home for; what Kind of Boats they had;
and why I might riot order my felf, and my Bufi-
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thi-
ther, ^s they were to come to me.
I never fo much is troubled my felf to confidet
what I fliould do with my felf when I came thi-
ther; what would become of me, if I fell into the
Hands of the Savages ,• or how I fliould efcape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor fo much as
how it was poffible for me to reach the Coaft, and
not
»ot be attempted by fome or other of them, with-
out any Poffibility of delivering my felf • and if I
fhould not fall into their Hands, what I fhould do
for Provifion, or whither I fhou.d bend my Courfe;
none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo much as came
in my way; but my Mind was wholly bent upon
the Notion of my palling over in my Boat to the
main Land: I look cl back upon my prefent Condi-
tion, as the moft miferable that could poffibly be;
that I was not able to throw my felf into any thing
but Death that could be called worfe; that if I
reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coaft along, as I did
on the Shore of Afnckf 'till I came to fome inha-
bited Country, and where I might find fome Re-
lief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with
fome Chriftian Ship that might take me in; and
if the worfe came to the worft, I could but die,
which would put an End to all thefe Miferies at
once. Pray note, All this was the Fruit of a dif-
turbM Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it
were defperate by the long Continuance of my
Troubles, and the Difappointments I h^d met in
the Wreck I had been on board of, and where I
had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earneftly
long'd for, viz,, fome Body to fpeakto, and to learn
fome Knowledge from <pf the Place where I was,
and of the probable Means of my Deliverance;
I fay, I was agitated wholly bv thefe Thoughts:
All my Calm of Mind in my Refignation to Pro-
vidence, and waiting the Iflue of the Difpofitions
of Heaven, feem'd to be fufpended; and I had, as
it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any
Thing, but to the Projeft of a Voyage to the
Main, which came upon me with fuch Force, and
&ch an Impetuoftty of Defire, that it was not to
be refitted.
When
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
Jftours, or more, with fuch Violence, that it fet
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulfe beat
as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it*
Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhaufted
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
found Sleep: One would have thought I fhould
have dreamt of it; but I did not-, nor of any-
thing relating to it; but I dreamt, that as I was
going out in the Morning, asufual, from my Caftle,
I faw upon the fliore two Canoes, and eleven Sava-
ges coming to Land, and that they brought with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat him • when, on a fudden, the Sa-
vage, that they were going to kill, jump'd away,
and ran for his Life,- and I thought in my deep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove,
before my Fortification; to hide himfelf ,• and that
I feeing him alone, and not. perceiving that the
other fought him that way, fhew'd myfelf to him,
iand, fmiling upon him, encouraged him; that he
kneelM down to me, feeming to pray me to affift
iiim; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and earry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
fcame my Servant; and that as foon as I had got-
ten-this Man, I faid to myfelf, now I may certain-
ly Venture to the Main Land ; for this Fellow
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provifions; and whi-
thet not to go for fear of being devoured, what Pla-
ices to venture into, and .what to efcape. I wakM
with this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref-
fible Impreffions of Joy at the Profpeft of my E-
fcape in my Dream, that the Disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myfelf, and finding it
was no more than a Dream, were equally extra-
vagant
C ^ J
iVagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great Deje&ion of Spirit.
: Upon this, however, I made this Conclufion,
-That my only way to go about an Attempt for an
Efcape, was, if poffible, to get a Savage into my
Pofleffion; 2nd if poffible, it (bould be one of their
Prifoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten,
andfliould bring thither to kill; but rhefe Thoughts
ftill were attended with this Difficulty, that it wag
impoffible to effed this, without attacking a whole
.Caravan of them, and killing them all,- and this
was not only a very defperate Attempt, and might
mifcarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
fcrupled the Lawfulnefs of it to me, and my Heart
trembled at the Thoughts of fliedding fo much
\piood, tho' it was for my' Deliverance. I need
not repeat the Arguments which occurd to me
againft this, they being the fame mention'd before;
But tho* I had other Reafons to offer now, (m.)
that thofe Men were Enemies to my Life, and
would devour me, if they could , that it was Self-
prefervatjon in the higheft Degree, to deliver my-
felf from this Death of a Life, and was a.fting in
jmy own Defence,' as much a£ if they were aftually
aflaultingme, and the like: \ fay, thp? jthefe things
argued for it, yet the Thoughts of fliedding hu-
mane Blood for my Deliverance, were very terrible
to me, and fuch as I could by no mean? reconcile
myfelftoa great while.
However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes
with myfelf, and after great Perplexities about
it, (for all thefe Arguments, one way and another;,
flruggled in my Head a long time,) the eager pre-
vailing Defire of Deliverance at length mafter'd
all the reft, and I fefolv'd, if poffible, to get one
of thofe Savages into my Hands, cpft what it
'- ' wou!4-
would. . My next thing then was to contrive how8
to do it; and'this indeed was very difficult to re-
folve on. But as 1 could pitch upon no probable
Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put myfelf upon the
Watch, to fee them when they came on fhore, and
leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Meafures
as the Opportunity fhould prefent, let be what
would be.
With thefe Refolntions in my Thoughts, I fet
myfelf upon the Scout, as often as ppffibie, and
indeed fo often till 1 was heartily tired of it; for
it was above a Year and a half that I waited, and
for great part of that Time went out to the Weft
End, and to the South-Weft Corner of the Ifiand
almoft every Day, to fee for Canoes, but none
appeared. This was very difcouraging, and be-
gan to trouble itie much; tho' J can't fay that it
did in this cafe as it had done fome time before
that, Quiz*.) wear off the Edge of my Defire to the
thing; but the longer it feem'd to be delayed, the
more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at
firft fo careful to fbun the fight of thefe Savages,
and avoid being feen by them, as I was now eager
to be upon them.
Befides, I fancied myfelf able to manage one,
nay, two or three Savages, if I had them, fo as
to make them entirely Saves to me, to do what-
ever I fhould direft them, and to prevent their be-
ing able at any time to do me any Hurt. It was a
great while that I pleased myfelf with this Affair,
but nothing ftill prefented • all my Fancies and
Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came
near me for a great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertained
thefe Notions, and, by long mnfing, had as it were
refolv'd them all into nothing, for want of an oc-
cafion to'put them in Execution, I was furprizM
one
one Morning early, with feeing no lefs than five
Canoes all on fliore together on my fide the Ifland,
and the People who belong'd to them all landed,
and outfof my fight: The Number of them broke
all my meafures; for feeing fo many, and know-
ing that they always came four, or fix, or fometimes
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my meafures, to attack twen-
ty or thirty Men fingle-handed; fo I lay ftill in
my Caftle, perplexed and difcomforted: However
I put myfelf into all the fame Poftures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was juft
ready for A&ibn, if any thing had prefented. Ha-
ving waited a good while, liftening to hear if they
made any Noife, at length being very impatient*
I fet my: Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill by my two
Stages, as ufual, Handing fo, however, that my
Head did not appear above the Hill; fo that they
could not perceive me by any means * Here I ob-
ferv'd, by the help of my Perfpe&ive-Glafs, that
they were no lefs than thirty in Number; that
they had a Fire kindled; that they had had Meat
drefs'd; how they had cook'd it, that 1 knew not,-
or what it was; but they were all dancing in 1
know not how many barbarous Geftures and Fi-
gures, their own way, round the Fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my Perfpe&ive two miferable Wretches drag'd
from the Boats, where, it feems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fell, being
knocked down, I fuppofe with a Club or woodeni
Sword, for that was their way, and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him operi
for their Cookery, while the other Viflim was left
landing by himfelf, till they fliould be ready for
him;
him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee-
ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpired him
\vith Hopes of Life, and he ftaned away from
them,. and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sands dire&ly towards me, 1 mean, towards that
part of the Coaft where my Habitation .was.
1 was dreadfully frighted (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perceived him to run-my way;
and efpecially, when as I thought I faw him pur-
fued by the whole Body; and now 1 expefted
that part of my Dream was coming to pafs, and
that he would certainly take fhelter in my Grove;
but I could not depend by any means upon my
Dream for the reft of it, (viz,.) that the other Sa-
vages would not purfue him thither, and find him
there. However, I kept my ftation, and my Spi-
rits began to recover, when 1 found that there was
not above three Men that followed him; and ftili
more was I encouraged, when I found that he out-
ftript them 'exceedingly in running, and gaind
Ground of them, fo that if he could but hold it
for half an Hour, I faw eafily he would fairly get
away from them all.
There was between them and my Caftle the
Creek which I mentioned often at the firft part of
my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the
Ship; and this, I faw plainly, he muft neceffarily
fwim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there: But when the Savage efcaping came thi-
ther, he made nothing of it, tho' the Tide was
then up, but plunging in, fwam thro* in about
thirty ftrokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding ftrength and fwiftnefs; when the
three Perfons came to the Creek, I found that
two of them could fwim, but the third could not,
and that {landing on the other fide, he lcok'd at
the other, but went no farther ,• and foon after went
foftlv
foftly back again, which, as it happen'd, was very
well for him «i the inaip. .
I obferv'd, that the two who {warn, were yet
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that jfled from them: It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irrefiftibly, that now was my Time td get me a
Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Affiftant $
and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to fave
this poor Creature's Life; i immediately run down
the Ladders with all poffible Expedition, fetch'd
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above; and getting
up again with the fame hafte, to the top of the
Hill, 1 crofs'd toward the Sea; and having a very
fliort cut, and all down Hill, clap'd myfelf in
the way between the Purfuers and the Purfued,
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them; but I beckon'd with my Hand to him
to come back, and in the mean time, I flowly ad^
vanced towards the two that followed; then rufh-
ing at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down
with the Stock of my Piece; I was loth to fire, be-
caufe 1 would not have the reft hear; tho* at that
diftance it would not have been eafily heard;
and being out of fight of the Smoak too, they
would not have eafily known what to make of it *
Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who
purfued him ftopt, as if he had been frighted;
and I advanced apace towards him; but as I came
nearer, 1 perceived prefently, he had a Eow and
Arrow, and was fitting it to {hoot at me; fo I
was then neceflltated to Ihoot at him fit ft, which
I did, and kill'd him at the firft (hoot: the poor
Savage who fled, but had ftop'd, tho' he faw both
his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought,. yet
was
Wis to frighted with the Fire, arid Koife of my
Piece, that he flood ftock ftill, and neither came
Forward or went backward, tho* hfc ksmd rather
inclined to fly ftill, than to come: on; I hollow'd
again to him, and iriade figns to come forward,
which he eafily underftood, arid came a little way*
then ftop'd again, arid then a little farther, arid
ftop'd again; arid I could then perceive that he
ftbod trembling, as if he had been taken PHfoner,
and had juft been to be kill'd, as his two Eneiriies
were i I beckoned him again to come to me, and
gave hirti all the figns of Encouragement that t
could think tff -? and he cime nearer and nearer,
kneeling dowil £Vety ten of twelve fteps, in tokeri
of Acknowledgment for my faVing his Life: I fmil'd
at hitfVarld lodk'd pleafantly, and beckon'd to hini
to come ftill nearer; at length he came cldfe to me+
and then he kneeled down again, kifs'd the Ground*
and laid his Head upon the Ground, arid taking
me by the Foot, fet my Foot, upon his Head:
this, it feems, was in token of Swearing to be niy
Slave for ever. 1 took him iip, and made iiiuch of
him, and ehcburaged him all f could: But there
was riiore W6rk to dp yet, for I perceived the Sa-
vage whom I knocked down, was not kill'd, but
ftun'd with the Bldw, and began to coihe to hirri-
felf; fo I poirited to him, and ftiowing him the Sa-
vage, that he w^s not dead; upori this he fpok£
fome Words to me, and tho* I could not underftand
them, yet I thdught they were pleafant td hear,
for they were the firft found of a Man's Voice that
I had heard, my twn excepted, for above twenty five!
tears. But there was no time for fuchftefle&i-
6ns now; the Savage, who was knocked down^
frecbver'd himfelf fo far, is tb fit up upon th6
Ground, 2nd 1 p£rc6iv d that my Savage began td
be afraid - but when t faW that, I jJrefeftWd toy
ether Piece at the Man, as if I would flioot hint.y
upon this my Savage, for fo 1r call him now, made a
Motion to me to lend him my Sword> which hung
naked in a Belt by my fide; fo I did: He no {bone*
had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one Blow
cut off his Head as cleverly, no Executioner in Ger-
many could have done itTboner or better; which I
thought very ftrange, for one, who I had reafon to
believe, never* faw a Sword in his Life before, ex-
cept their own wooden Swords; however, it feeius^
as I learn'd afterwards^ they make their wooden
Swords fo ffiarp, fo heavy, and the Wood is fo
hard, that they will cut off Heads even with them,
ay and Arms,. and that at one Blow too. When:
he had done this, he comes laughing to me in fign
of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again*
and with abundance of Geftures, which I did not
underftand, laid it down with the Head of the Sa-
vage that he had killed, juft before me.
But that which aftonifh^d him moft was, to know
how I had killed the other Indian fo fat off; fo,
pointing to him, he made figns to me to let him go
to him : fo I bad him go, as well as I could; when
he came to him, he flood like one amazed, looking
at him, turned him firft on erne fide, then on t'other,
looked at the Wound the Bullet had made, which
it feems was juft in his Breaft, where it had made
a Hole, and no great Quantity of Blood had fol-
lowed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead : He took up his Bow and Arrows, and came
back; fo I turn'd to go away, and beckon'd ttf
him to follow me, making figns to him that more
might come after them.
Upon this he fignM to me, that he fhould bury
them with Sand, that they might not be feen by the
reft if they followed; and fo I made figns again to
him to d© ft>; he fell to W€>rk, and in an inftant he
had
had ferap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands, big
enough to bury the firft in* ai>d then drag'd him in-
to it, and covered him, and didfo alfo by the other;
Ibelieveheha^bifryM:thcm:1iJOth.ia a Quarter of
an Hour; then calling him away, I carry ct him, not
to my Gaftle, but quite away to my Gave, on the
farther Part of the Ifland; fo I did not let my Dream
come to pais in that Part, vi&. That he came into
my Grove for Shelter.
HerelgavehimBread^and aBunchof Raifins to
eat, and a Draught of Water, A^hich I found he
was indeed in great Diftrefs for, by his Running;
and haying refreflrd him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and fleep^ pointing to a Place where I
had laid a great Parcel of Rice Strawy and a Blanket
upon it, which I ufed td fleep upon my felf fome-
tjmes <> fo the p6or Creature laid down and went
to fleep.
He was acOmely handfottie fellow-, petfe&ly weli
ftiade, with ftrait long Lirtibs, not too large, tall
and wellfhap'd ; and, as I reckon, about twenty-fix
tears of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
hot a fierce and furly Afpeft, .but feem'd to have
fomething very Manly in his Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too, efpecially when he fmifd. His
Hair wafc long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity
and fparkling Shairpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin Was nOtLcjuite bl-ack, but very tawny, and
yet not of an u|fy yellow naufeous Tawny, a$ the
Brafilidm, and- ViYginidrtt, &nd Other Isfatives of
Amemd ate, but of a bright kind of a dun Olive
Colour, that had:in it fomething very agreeable^
thor not very eafy to defcribe; His Face was rdund
and ptumjS, his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne-
grdesj a Vefy good M<*uth, thin Lip% and his
R i jfine
fine Teeth well fet, and white as Ivory. After he
had ilumber'd, rather than flept, about half an
Hour, he wak'd again* atid^bmes out of the Cave
to me, for I had 'fcte'to? milMng-my Goats, which I
had in the: Ehclbfiiire juft by t When he efpy'd me,
he caine * running t6 • *i^, laying himlelf down
again upon the Grourtd, with all the poffible Signs
of an humble thankful Difpofition, makiiig a many
antick Geflures to {how it: At laft he lays bis
Head flat upon the Ground, clofe to my Foot, and
fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he "had done
before; and after this, made all the Signs Wmc of
Subje&ion, Servitude, and Submiffibh imaginable,
to let me know how he would ferve me as long as
he liv'd. I underftood him in many Things,' and
let him know I was very well pleased with him; in
a little Time I began to fpeak to him, and teach
him to fpeak to me; and firft, I made hitfi know
his Name fhould be Friday,' which was the Day I
fav'd his Life 5' I call'd Him fo for the Memory b£
the Time; I like wife taught him to fayMafler, and
then let him know that was to be my Name; I
likewife taught him to fay Yes and No,and to know
the Meaning of them ; I gave him fome Milk in an
earthen Pot, and let him fee me drink -it before
him, and fop my Bread in it; and I galre him a
Cake of Bread to do the like, which he quickly
comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very
good for him.
I kept there with him all that Night, but as foon
as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to come with
me and let him know/I would t give him fome
Cloaths, at which he feem'd very glad, for he was
ftark-naked: As we went by the Place where he
had bury'd the two Men, he pointed exa&ly to the
Place, and fhewM me the Marks that he had
made to find them again, making Signs to me
that
that we (hould dig them up again, and eat them ,*
at this I appear ci very angry, exprefs'd my Ab-
hprrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to
him to*, come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submiffion. I then led him up to the
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone;
and pulling out my Glafs, I look'd, and faw plain-
ly the Place where they had been, but no Appea-
rance of them, or of their Canoes;, fo that it was
plain that they were gone, and had left their two
Comrades behind them, without any Search after
them.
But I was not content with this Difcovery, but
having now more Courage, and confequently more
Curioiity, I took my Man Friday with me, giving
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufc
very dexteroufly, making him carry one Gun forme,
and I two for myfelf, and away we march'd to the
Place where thefe Creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get fome fuller Intelligence of them:
When, I came to the Place, my very Blood ran
chill in my Veins, and my Heart funk within me
at the Horror of the Spe&ade: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at leaft itfwasfo to me, tho' Friday
made nothing of it: The Place was covered with
humane Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flefli left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorchM; and, in fliort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Vi&ory over their Enemies*
I faw three Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of
three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other
Parts of the Bodies; and Friday, by his Signs, made
me underftand, that they brought over four Prifoners
to feaft upon; that three of them were eaten up,
R 3 and
and that he, pointing tp hiiiifelf, was the fourth \
That there had*been a great JJattel between them
and their next &in& wjipfe fubjefts it feems heha4
been one of rand that they had t^ken a great Nurii-
ber of Prifonefs, ^11 which weire carried to feveral
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fight,
in order to feaft* upon thein, as was done here by
thefe Wretches uppn thpfe they brought hither.
I caus M Friday to gather all th£ Skulls, Bones,
Flefh, and whatever rernain'd, and lay them to-
gether on 3. Heap, and make 3 great Fire upon it,
4nd burn them all to Aflies: I found Friday had ftill
a hankering ftomach after fome of the Flefli^ and
\&ras ftill a Canib^l in his Nature; ^>ut I ciifcpverM
fo much Abhorrence at the; very Thoughts 6f it, and
at the leafl Appearance of it, that he durft riot dis-
cover it ? for I had, by fome means, let; Hint know
that I would kill him if he pffeirM it, f
When we had done this we came back to our
Caftle, and there I fell tp work for my Man Friday;
and firft of all I gave him a Pair of Linen Drawers,
which I h^d but pf the popr GunnerVCheft lmen-
tionM, and which I foun4 in the Wreckj and which,
with a little Alteration, fitted him very well; then
I made him a Jerkin of GoatVskin, as well as my
skill would allow; and I was now grown a tolerable
good Taylor,- and I gave him a Cap, which 1 had
made of a Hare-skin, very convenient arid faction-
able enough; and thus he was cloatrhM, for the
prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleasM
to fee himfelf almoft as well clpath'd as his Matter:
It is true, he went aukwardly in thefe things at firft;
wearing the Drawers was very aukward to him,
#nd the Sleeves of the Waiftcoat gallM his Shoul-
ders, and the infide of his Arms; but a little eafing
theirs where h? co^pl^inV they fiur? him, and
;u#ng himfelf to them, at length he took to them
very well.
The next Day after I jcame Home to my Hutch
with him, I began toconfider where Iihouldlodge
him; and that i might do well for him, and yet be
perfe&ly eafy myfel£ I made a little Tent for himf
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in the Infide of the laft, and in the Outfide of the
jfirft: And -as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I made a formal framed Poor-cafe,
and a Door to it of Boards, and fet it up in the
Paflage, a little within the Entrance; and caufing
the Door to open on the Infide, I bar'd it up in the
Night, taking in my Ladders too; fo that Friday
could no way come at me in the Infide of my inner-
moft Wall, without making fo much Npife in getting
over, that it mu$ needs waken me; for my firft
Wall had now av cpmpleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
fmaller Sticks inftead of Laths, and then thatchM
over a great Thicknefs with the Rice-Straw, which
wasftrong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
placed a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the Out-fide, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife; and as to Weapons, I took them all
in to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution; for
never Man had a more faithful, loving, fincere Ser-
vant than Friday was to me; without Paffions,
Sullennefs, or Defigns, perfeftly oblig'd and en-
gag'd; his very Afte&ions were ty'd to me, like
thofeof a Child to a Father; and I dare fay, he
would have facrificed his Life for thefaving mine,
wpon any Qccafjon whatfoever:the many Teftimo-
R ^ nie$
nies he gave me o£ this, put it out of doubt, and
foon convincUjnSx that I, needed to ufe no Pre^
cautions as to my jfaf^ty on his acftomit.
This frequently gave me? Qccaiion tp obferve,
and that with wonder, that however it had pleafed
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, the beft Ufes
to which their Faculties and the Powers of» their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has beftowM upon
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame
Affedions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and
Obligation, the fame Paflions and Refentments of
Wrongs, the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sincerity,
Fidelity, and all the Capacities of, do&g Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us; and
that when he pleafes to offer them Occafions of
exerting thefe, they a^e as ready, nay, more, ready
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they
were beftpwM, than we are, And this made me
very melancholy fometimes, in refle&ing, as the fe-
veral Occafions prefented, how mean a Ufe we
make of all thefe, even though we have thefe
Powers enlightened by the great Lamp of Inftru-
ftion, the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of
his Word, added to our Underftanding; and why
it has pleas'd God to hide the like faving Know^
ledge from fo m^ny Millions of Souls, who (if I
might judge by this poor Savage) would make a
much better Ufe of it than we did.
Frpm hence I fometimes was led too far to in-
vade the Sovereignty of Providence,- and, as it were,
arraign the Juftice of {o arbitrary a Difpofition of
Things, that fliould hide that Light from fome,
and reveal it to others, and yet expeft a like Duty
from both: But I fhut it up and checked my
thoughts with this Conclufon, fir fa That we di4
not know by what Light and Law thefe fliould be
condemned ; biit that, as God wasneceffarily, and,
by the Nature of his Being* infinitely holy and juft,
fo it couldntftbei but that if thefe Creatures were
all5 fentene'd to abfence from himfelf, it was on ac-
count <tf finning againft that Light!, which, as the
ScriptUre fays, was a Law to themfelves, and by
'fuch Rules as their Confciences would acknowledge
to be juft, tho' the Foundation was not difcover'd
to us :'• And, Secondly, That ftill as we are all the
Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Veflel could
fay to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus?
But to return to my new Companion: I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my Bufi-
nefs to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him ufeful, handy and helpful; but efpecially
to make him fpeak, and underftand me when I
fpake; and he was the apteft Scholar that ever
was, and particularly was fo merry, fo conftantly
diligent, &nd fo pleas'd when he could but under-
ftand me, or make me underftand him, that it was
very pleafant to me to talk to him; and now my
Life began to be fo eafy, that I began to fay to
myfelf, that could I but have been fafe from more
Savages, I cared not if I was never to remove
from the Place while I liv'd.
Aftdr 1 had been two. or three Days returned to
my Caftle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
Relifti of a Canibalas Stomach, I ought to let him
tafte other Flefh ; fo I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods. I went, indeed, intending
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, knd bring it
home and drefs it: But as I was going, I faw
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two
young Kids fitting by her. I catch'd hold of Friday,
hold* fays J, (land ftill; and made figns to him
not
net to ftir, immediately I prefented my Piece, fhot
and killed one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Diftance, indeed, feen me kill the Sa-
vage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenftbly furpriz'd,
trembled and (hook, and looked fo amaz?d, that I
thought he would have funk down. He did not
fee the Kid I had fhot at, or perceive I had kill'd
it, but ripM up his Waftecoat to feel if he was not
wounded ,• and, as I found, prefently thought I was
refolvM to kill hin*; for he carr^e and kneeled dowfr
to me, and embracing my Knees, faid a great
many Things I did not underftand, but I could
eafily fee that the Meaning was to pray me not to
kill him.
I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, ^nd pointing to the Kid which I
had killM, beckoned, to him to run and fetch it,
which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I loaded
my Gun again, and by-and-by I faw a great Fowl
like a Hawk fit upon a Tree within fhot; fo, to
let Friday underftand a little what I would do, I
call'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl,
which was indeed a Parrot, tho* I thought it had
been a Hawk; I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to
my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to
let him fee I would make it fall, I made him un-
derftand that I would fhoot and kill that Bird ,• ac-
cordingly I fir*d, and bad him look, and immediate-
ly he faw the Parrot fall; he flood like one fright-
ed again, notwithftanding all I had faid to him; and
I found he was the more amaz'd, becaufe he did not
fee me put any thing into the Gun; but thought
that there muft be fome wonderful Fund of Death
find Deftruftion in that Thing, able to kill Man,
Peaft,
Peaft, Bir4, op any thing near or far off,- and the
Aftonifliment this created in him was fuch, as
pould not wear off for a long time; arid I believe,
if I would have let him, he would have worfhip'd
jne and my Gun: As for the Gunitfelf, he would
not fo much as touch it for feveral Days after; but
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
fwer'd him, when he*was by himfelf; which, as I
afterwards leajrn'd of him, was to defire it not to
kill him.
Well: After his Aftonifliment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
$ had foot, which he did, but ftay'd fome Time;
for the Parrot not being quite dead, was fluttered
a good way off frpm the Place where fhe fell; how-
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
pie; and, as I had perceived his Ignorance about the
Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the
Gun again, and not let him fee me do it, that I
might be ready for any other Mark that might pre-
sent; but nothing more offered at that Time; fo I
brought home the Kid, and the fame Evening I took
the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and
having a Potior that Purpofe, I boil'd or. ftew'd
fome of the Flefti, and made fome very good Broth;
an^ after I had begun to eat fome, I gave fome to
my Man, who feem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it
very well; but that which was ftrangeft to him, was;
to fee me eat Salt with it; he made a fign to me,
that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little into his own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it,
and wouldfpitandfputteratit, wafliing his Mouth
with frefh Water after it; on the other hand, I took
fome Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre-
tended to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as
fie had clone at the Salt; but it would not do, he
would
would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth; at leafl, not a great while, and then but a
very little.
Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and
Broth, I was refolvM to feaft him the next Day
with roafting a Piece of the Kid; this I did by
hanging it before the Fire in a firing, as I had feen
many People do in England,* ktt'mg two Poles up,
one on each fide the Fire, and one crofs on the top,
and tying the firing to the crofs flick, letting the
Meat turn continually: This Friday admir'd very
much; but when he came to tafle the Flefh, he took
fo many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that
I could not but underflandhim ;and at laft he told
me he would never eat Mair s Flefh any more,
which I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome
Corn out, and fifting it in the manner I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before ; and he foon underflood how
to do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to
make Bread of; for after that I let him fee me make
my Bread, and bake it too; and in a little Time
Friday was able to do all the Work for me, as well
as I could do it myfelf.
I began now to confider,that having two Mouths
to feed inftead of one, I mufl provide more Ground
for my Harvefl, and plant a larger Quantity of
Corn than I ufed to do; fo I mark'd out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked
very willingly and very hard, but did it very
chearfully ; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for
him and myfelf too: He appeared very fehfible of
that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had
much
much more Labour upon me on his Account, than
1 had for myfelf; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Lift I
led in this Place: Friday began to talk pretty well,
and underftand the Names of almoft every thing I
had Qccafion to call for, and of every Place 1 had
to fend him to, and talk a great deal to me; fo
that, in (hort, I began now to have fomeufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little Oc-
cafion for before; that is to fay, about Speech: Be-
fides the Pleafure of talking to him, I had a Angu-
lar Satisfa&ion in the Fellow himfelf; his fimple
unfeign'd Honefty appeared to me more and more
every Day,and I began really to love the Creature;
and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
waspoflible for him ever to love any Thing before.
I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again; and having
learned him Englijb fo -well, that he could anfwet
me almoft any Queftions, I ask'd him whether the
Nation that he belonged to never conquer'd ill
Battle? At which he frtiil'd and faid, Yes, yes, we
always fight the better; that is, he meant always
get the better in Fight; and fo we began the fol-
lowing Difcourfe. You always fight the better, faid
I, How came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday?
Friday. My Nation beat much, for all that.
Mafier. How beat; if your Nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
* Friday. They more many than my Nation in the
Place where me was; they take one, two, three,
and me; my Nation over-beat them in the yonder
Place, were me no was; there my Nation take
one, two, great Thoufand.
Mafter. But why did not your Side recover you
from the Hands of your Enemies then?
< Friday,
Friday. They run one, two, thfde, ahd iiie, and
make go in the Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe
that Time.
Mafter* Well, Friday, and what does your Na-
tion do with the Meri they take? do they carry
them away± and eat them, as thefe ^did. ?.
Friday. Yes, my Najiqn $at Man's? too, eat
&\\ up*' i ,;
Mafter. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other Place where tfaey think.
. Mafter. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
elfe Place.
Mafter. Have you, been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here: [Points, to th? N. W. fid*
of the I/land, whichy itfeems, was their fide,.]
By this I underftood, that my Maa Friday had
formerly been among ths Savages, who ufed to
come on fliore on the farther part of the Ifland, on
the faid Man-eating occafiorts that he was now
brought for; and fome time after, wheal took the
Courage to carry him to that fide, being the fame
I formerly mentioned, he prefently knew the Place^
and told me, he was there once when they eat up
twenty Men, two Women, and One Child: He
could not tell twenty in EngHfh; but he numbered
them by laying fo many Stones in a Row, and
pointing to me to tell them over.
I hav£ told this Paflage, becaufe it,introduces
what follows; that after I had had thisDifcourfei
with him, I ask'd him how far it ifcaS from out?
Ifland to the Shore, and whethet the Canoes werd
not often loft: he told me there was no Danger,
no Canoes ever loft; but that after a littte way out
to the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind al-
ways one way in the Morning* the other in the
Afternoon^
i.' this
This I underftood to be no more than the fets of
the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards underftood, it was occafion'd by the great
Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroonooko *
in the Mouth or the Gulph of which River, as I
thought afterwards, our Ifland lay; and that this
Land, which I perceived to the W. and N. W. was
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the North Point of the
lyfowth of the River. I ask'd Friday a thoufand
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nations were near; he
told me all he knew, with the greateft Opennefs
imaginable. I ask'd him the Names of the feveral
Kations of his fort of People, but could get no
other Name than Caribs; from whence I eafily un-
derftood,. that thefe were the Caribbees, which our
•Maps place on the Part of America, which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana*
aod onwards to St. Martha: He told me that up a
great way be;yond the Moon, that was, beyond
the,fetting of the Moon, which muft be W. from
their Country, there dwelt white-bearded Men*
like me; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which
I TOQntion'd before; and that they had kill'd much
Mans, that was his Word t By all which I under-
ftood he meant the Spaniards, whofe Cruelties it!
America had been fpread over the whole Countries,
and were remembered by all the Nations from Fa-
ther to Son.
I enquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men;
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe; I
could not underftand what he meant, or make him
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at
laft, with great Difficulty, I found he meant it muft
be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes.
This
This Part of Friday's Difcourfe began to relifli
with me very well; and from this time I enfe*-
tain'd fome Hopes, that one time or other I might
find an Opportunity to make my Efcape from this
Place, and that this poor Savage might be a means
to help me to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and
underftand mej I was not wanting to lay a Foun-
dation of religious Knowledge in his Mind5- par-
ticularly, I ask'd him one time, who made him?
The poor Creature did not underftand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who was his Father: But
I took it by another Handle, and ask*d him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walked on, and the
Hills and Woods? He told me, it was one old
Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could de-
fcribe nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was
very old; much older, he faid, than the Sea or the
Land, than the Moon or the Stars, I ask'd hirft
then, if this old Perfon had made all Things, >why
did not all Things worfhip him? He 1-ook'd very
grave, and with a perfeft Look of Innocence, faid,
All Things faid 0 to him. I ask'd him, if the People
who die in his Country, went away arty where >
He faid, Yes, they all went to Benamucket. Theri
I ask'd him, whether thefe they eat up went thi-
ther too? He faid, Yes.
From thefe Things I began to infiruft him in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, that
the great Maker of all Things lived up there*
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs
the World by the fame Power and Providence by
which he had made it: That he was Omnipotent,
could do every thing for us, give every thing to
us, take every thing from us; and thus., by de^-
grees, I opened his Eyes* He lifWd with greats
AttttH
Attention* ahd received with Pleafure the Notfori
of Jefm Chriff being fent to redeem us, and of
the manner of riukingour Prayers to God, and his
being able to hear us,- even into Heaven. He told
me one Day/th&t if oufGdd could hear us up be-
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than
their T$tn&milckie\ who Jived but a little way off,
and Jret could nor hear, till they went up to the
great Mountains where he dwelt, to fpeak to hinW
I ask'd hini, if ever he went thither to fpeak to
him. He faid, No, they never went that were
younf* Men; none went thither but the old Men;
who*he called their Qowokaket, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their Religious, Or Clergy^
and that they went to fay 0, (fo he cali'd faying
Prayers) and then came back, ahd told them what
Benamwkee faid. By this I obferved, that there is
Prieftcraft even amongft the ftibft blinded ignorant
Pagans iti the World, and the Policy of making a
fecretlteligionj in order to prefers the Veneratidri
of the People to the Clergy, is hot only to be found
in the Rotrnin, but perhaps among all Religions ill
the Wotldy even among the nloft brutilh and bar-
barourSavages.
I endeavoured to cleat up this Fraud to ift^
Man Friday/ and' told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains t6 fay O
to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was
much mote fo; that if they met with any Anfwer,
or fpoke with any one there* it muft be with an
evil Spirit: And then I entered into a long t)if
courfe with him about the Devil, the Original of
him* his Rebellion ftgainft God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reafon of it, his fetting himfelf no in
the dark Parts of the World to be worfhip'd iri-
sftead of God, and as God; and the many Silita*

gems he made ufe of, to delude Mankind-to thek
Ruin; how he had a (beret Acceft to our Paffions,
and to our Affections, to adapt his .Snares fo to
our Inclinations, as to caufe us even to,be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftru&idn by our
own Choice.
I found it was not fo eafy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature affifled all my Argu-
ments to evidence to him even the Neceflity of a
great firfl Caufe and overruling governing Power,
a fecret directing Providence, and of, the Equity
and Juftice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. JBut there sippear'd nothing of*all
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his .Ori-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and abave all, .of? his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fo too. And the poor Creature puzzled jne once
in flich a manner, by 3 ,Queftion meerfy riatural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to
him. I,had been talking a great .deal to him of
the Power of God, hi$ Omnipotence, his dreadful
Aver (ion to Sin, his being a con fuming Eire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all,
be could deftroy us and all the World in a Mo-
ment; and he liften'd with great ferioufriefs to me
all the while.
^ewnthis, I had been telling him how the De-
vil wiS God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat (the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
ofChrift in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Fridayy but you fay, God is fo ftrong, fo great, is
he ne>t much ftrong, much might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday* God is ftronger than the
Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we
pray to God to tread him down under our Feet,
add
ahd enable us to refi.fi,his Temptations, and quench
te fiery Darts. - But, fays he again, if God much
firongy much might^m the Devil, ibhy God no kill the De-
mi, fo make hint no-more do wicked? .
I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and
after all* tho' I was now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Do&or; and ill enough qualified tor
a*Ca*fuiftj or a Solver of Difficulties: And, at firft^
J could not tell jwhat to fay ,• fo I pretended not tp
hear him* and ask'd him what he faid: But he
was too earneft for an Anfwer to forget his Quef-
tion; fo that he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this time 1 had recovered
myfelf a. little, andJL faid, God wiB at lafi punijh
him feverely; he is referred for the Judgment, and is
to be caU into the bottomlefs Pit, to dwell with ever-
laftingFire. This did *not fatisfy Friday, but he re-
turns upon me, repeating my Words, Reserve
&>t last,.^ nti underfland; But why not kill the
'Devil haw, mt kill great ago? You may as well ask
me> faid I, why God does not kill you and I,
when we do wicked things here that offend him:
We are preferved to repent and be pardoned. He
hiufes a while at this; Well, weS,: fays he, mighty
affe^idnately, that well; fo you, 1, Devil, all wick-
ed, all preferve, repent, God pardon M. Here I was
run 'down again by him to the laft degree, ;and it
was a Teftimony t8 me, how the meer Notions
Of Nature, tjio' they will guide reafonahle Crea-
tures to.the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-
-fiup or Homage due to the fupreme Being of God,
as the Conference of our Nature; yet nothing but
divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Je-
fmChrift, and of a Redemption purchased jbr us, of a
Mediator of the new Covenant,andof an Interceflbr,
at the Foot-ftool of God's Throne; I fay, nothing
4*ttt a Revelation from.Heaven can form thefe in
S i the
fhe Soul; and that therefore th« Gofpel of our
Lord and Saviour Jefm Cbvi&> I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promis'd for the
Guide and SandUfier of his People, are the abfo-
lutely necefiary Inftru&ors of the Souls of Men
in the faving Knowledge of God, and the means
of Salvation. ,.=< *
I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be-
tween me and my Man, rifing up haftily, as upon
fome fudden Occaiion of going out; then fending
him for fomething a good way off, I fcdoufly pray'd
to God, that he would enable me to inftruft faving-
!y this poor Savage, aflifting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the
Light of the Knowledge of God in Chriff, recon-
ciling him to himfelf, and would guide me to fpeak
fo to him from the Word of God, as his Confid-
ence might be convinced, his Eyes opened, and his
Soul faved. When he came again to me* I enter'd
into along Difcourfe with him upon the Subject
of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the
World, and of the Do&rine of the Gofpel preach'd
from Heaven, viz,, of Repentance towards God,
and Faith in our bleffed Lord Jefm. I then ex-
plained to him, as well as I could., why our bleffed
Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels,
but the Seed of Abraham, and how for that Rea-
fon the fallen Angels had no fliare in the Redemp-
tion; that he came only to the loft iheep of the
Houfe of Ifrael, and the like.
I had, God knows\ more Sincerity than Know-
ledge, in all the Methods I took foi^ this poor
Creature's Inftruftion, and muft acknowledge what
I believe all that ad upon the fame Principle will
find, that in laying Things open to him, I really
informed and inftrti&ed iftyfelf m many things, that
either I did not know, Or had not fully confider'd
before;
before ,• but which occurr'd naturally to my mind,
upon my fearching into them, for the Information
of this poor SaVage; and I had more Affeftion in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occafion, than
ever I felt be-fore; fo that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me or no, I had great
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me:
My Grief fet lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond meafure; and
when I refle&ed that in this folitary Life which I
had been confined to, I had not only been mov'd
myfelf to look up to Heaven, and to feek to the
Hand that had brought me there, but was now
to be made an Inftrument, under Providence, to fave
the Life, and, for ought I know, the Soul of a poor
Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, apd of the Chriftian Doftrine, that he
might know Chrift Jefus, to know whom is Life eter-
nal. I fay, when I reflected upon all thefe things,
a fecret Joy run thro' every Part of my Soul, and
I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to
this Place, which I had fo often thought the moft
dreadful of all Afflictions that could poffibly have
befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continued all the Re-
mainder of my Time, and the Converfation which
employed the Hours between Friday and I, was
fuch, as made the three Years which.we liv'd there
together,perfe&ly and compleatly happy, if any fuch
Thing as compleat Happimfs can be formd in afublu-
nary State. The Savage was nqw a good Chriftian,
a much better than I; tho- I have Reafon t6
hope, and blefs God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted reftored Penitents: We
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit t& inftruft, than if we had been
m England.
S 5 I al-
I always applied myfclf to reading tlie Scrip-:
ture, to let him knpw, as well as 1 could/; the
Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his* fe-
rious Enquiries and QuefUons, made me, as I/aid
fief ore, 2l rriuch better Scholar in the Scripture Know-
ledge, than I fhould ever have been by my own
private meer reading. Another thing 1 cannot re-
frain from observing here alfo from Experience, in
this retired part of .my Life, tc&. How infinite
and inexpreffible a Bleffing it is, that the Know-
ledge of God, and of the po&rine of Salvation by
phriff jjftjft/kyis'fo plainly laid down in the Word
of God, fo eafy to be received and underftood^
that a-s the bare reading the Scripture made me ca-
pable of underftanding enough pf .my Duty to car-
ry me dire&ly on to the great Work of fincere
Repentance formySins, and laying hold of a Sa-
viour for Life and Salvation, to a ftated Reforma-
tion in Practice* and Obedience to all G0d's Com-
mands, and this without any Teacher or Inftru&et
(I mean, humane) fpthe fame plain Inftru&ion 'fuf-
ficiently fervid to the enlightning this favage Crea-
ture, and bringing him to be fuch a Chriftian, as I
have known few equal to him in my Life.
As to all the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife/ and
Contention, which has happened in the World about
Religion, whether Niceties in Dodrines, or Schemes
of Church-Government, they were all perfedly ufer
lefs to us, a?j for ought I can yet fee, they have
been to all the reft in the World: We had the fare
Guide to Heaven, viz,, the Word of God; and we
had, blejfed be God, comfortable Views of the'Spi-
rit of God, teaching and inftrufttngus by his Word,
, leading m into all Truth, and making us both wil-
ling and obedient to the Inftru&ipn of his W6rd;
and I cannot fee the leaft Ufe that the greateft
 •  'Know-
Knowledge of the difputed Points in Religion,
which have made fuch Confufions in the World^
would have been to us, if we could have obtained
jt: But I muft go on with the: Hiftorical Part of
Things, and take every Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac^
quainted, and that he could under/land almoft all
1 faid to him, and fpeak fluently, though in broken
Englijhy to me; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leaft fo much of it as related to my
coming Into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Myftery, for fuch
it was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and
taught him how to fhoot : I gave him a Knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, fuch
as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog,
inftead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in fome Cafes, but
much more ufeful upon other Occafions.
I defcrib'd to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
ljv'd, how we worfhip'd God, how we behavM to
one another; and how we traded in Ships to alt
Parts of the World : I gave him an Account of the
Wreck which I had been on board of, and fiiew'd
him as near as I could the Place where fhe lay;
but fhe was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I fliew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we
loft when we efcapM, and which I could not flir
with my whole ftrength then, but was now fallen
almoft all to Pieces : Upon feeing this Boat, Friday
flood mufing a great while, and faid nothing; I
ask'd him what it was he ftudy'd upon; at laft, fays
he, me fee fuch Boat like come to Place at my Nation.
I did not underftand him a good while; but a£
laft, when I had examined farther into it, I utider-
S 4 ftoo4
flood by him, that a Boat, fuch as that had been
came on fhore upon the Country where he liv'd
chap is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
ftrefs of Weather •:, I prefently imagined, that fome
European Ship muft have been call away upon their
Coaftj and the Bo4t might get loofe, and drive
afliore, but was fo dull, that J never once thought
of Men making efcape from a Wreck thither,
much lef$ whence they might cpme ; fo I only en-
quir'd after 4 Defcription of the Boat.
Friday defcrib'd the Boat to me well enough;
bpt brought me better to underftand himy when he
added with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans
from drown: Then 1 prefently ask'd him,i if there
was any white Man$, as he call'd them, in the
Ejoat? Yes, he faid, the Boat full of white Mans. I
ask'd him how many ? he told upon his Fingers fe-
venteen. I ask'd him then what became of them >
he told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation. -.
This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I
prefently imagined, that thefe might be the Men
belonging tp the Ship that was eaft away in fight
<x( my Ifland, as I now call it; and who, after the
§hip was ftruck on the Rock, and they faw her in-
evitably loft, had fav'd themfelves in their Boat,
apd were landed upon that wild fhore, among the
Savages.
Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically
what was become of them; he aflfur'd me they
liy'd ftill there ,• that they had been there about
four Years ,- that the Savages let them alone, and
gave them Victuals to live. I ask-d him, how it
came tp pafs they did not kill them and eat them >
he faid, No, they make Brother with them; that is9
as I underftood him, a Truce: And then he ad->
<d$d, They no eat Mans but when make the War fight:
Tftat is tp. %, ?h?y pever eat any Men, but
fuch
ftich as come to fight with them, and are taken in
Battel.
It was after this, fome confiderable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft fide
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have faid, 1 had
in a Clear Day difcover'd the Main or Continent
of America; Friday, the Weather being very ferene,
looks very earneftly towards the main Land, and
in a kind of Surprize falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at fome Diftance
from him: I ask'd him what was the Matter; O
Joy ! fays he, 0 Glad! 7%erefee my Country, there my
Nation!
1 obferv'd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafure ap-
peared in his Face, and his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance difcover'd a ftrange Eagernefs, as if
he had a mind to be in his own Country again;
and this Ohfervation of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at firft not fo
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt, but that {(Friday could get
back to his own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me; and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of me, and comeback per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
Feaft upon me, at which he might be as merry as
he ufed to be with thofe of his Enemies, when
they were taken in War.
But I wrong'd the poor honeft Creature very
much, for which I was very forry afterwards.
However, as my Jealoufy increas'd, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfpeft, and
not fo familiar and kind to him as before; in
which * was certainly in the wrong too, the ho-
neft grateful Creature having no Thought about it,
but what confifted with the befl Principles, both
as
[ *6<s 3
as a religious: Chviftian, and as a g.ratefol Friend*
as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction.
While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may be
fure I was every day pumping him to fee if he
would difcover any pf the new Thoughts, which
I fufpe<5fced were in him; but I found every thing
he, faid was fo honeft, and fo innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourifh my Sufpicion; and,
in fpite of all my Uneafinefs he made me at laft.
entirely his own again; nor did he in the leaft per-*
ceive that I was uneafy, and therefore, I could not
fufpeft him of Deceit.
One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being, hazy at Sea, fothat we could not
fee the Continent, I call'd to him, and faid, Fri-
day, do not you wifh yourfeif in your own Coun-
ty y your own Nation? Yes, he faid, 1 be much O
glad to be at my. own Nation. What would you do
there faid I, would you turn wild again, eat Mens
Flefti again, and be a Savage as you were before?
He look'd full of Concern, and fluking his Head>
faid, No, noy Friday tell them to live good', tell them
to pray God, tell them to eat Corn-bread, Cattle-Flejhy
Milk, no eat Man again: Why then, faid I to him,
7ley will kill you. He lookcl grave at that, and
tiien faid, No, they no kill me, they willing love learn;'
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added, they Jearn'd much of the bearded Mans
that came in the Boat. Then I ask'd him if he
would go back to them? He fmiYd at that, and
told: me he could not fwim fo far. I told him I
T^opld make a Canoe for hinpu He told me, he
would go, if I would go with him. I go! fays I,
why, they will eat me if I come there: No, no,
fays he, me make they no eat you, me make they much
love you. He meant, he would tell them how I had
kill'd his Enemies, and favM his Life, and fo he:
would
Wo\x\d make them love me $ then he told me, as
well as he coujid, how kind they were to feventeen
white Men,, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on fliore there in diftrefs.
From this Time, I confefs, 1 had a mind to
venture over, and fee it 1 could poffibly join vwith
thefe bearded Men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Porfuguefe; noc doubting but, if 1 could,
we might , find fome Method to efcape from
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better than I could from an
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without
Help. So, after fome Days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would
give hima Boat to go back to his own Nation;
and accordingly I carryM him to my Frigate,
which lay on the other fide of the Ifland, and ha-
ying cleared it of Water, for I always kept it funk
in the Water, I brought it out, ftiew'd it him, and
yve both went into it.
I found he was a moft dextrous Fellow at ma-
paging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and
faft again as I could ; To when he was in, I faid to
him, Welt,-now, Friday, ftiall we go to your Na-
tion ? He look'd very dull at my faying fo, which,
it feem£, was becaufe he thought the Boat too
(mall to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger;
fo the next ,day I went, to the Place where the
firft Boat lay which I had made, but which I could
not get into Water ; he faid that was big enough;
bat then, a£ I had taken no Care of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had fplit $nd dry'd it, that it was in a manner
rotten. Friday told me, fuch a Boat would do ve-
ry well, and would carry much enough Vittle, Drink,
Bread, that was his way of Talking.
Upon
tfpon the whole, I was by this Tftne fo fix'd
upon my Defign of going over with him to the
Continent, that 1 told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he fhould go home in it.
He anfwer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and fad: I ask'd him what was the Matter with
him; he ask'd me again thus, Why you angry mad
with Friday, what me done? 1 ask*d him what he
meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all
No angry! No angry! fays he, repeating the Words
feveral times, Why fend Friday home away to my
Nation? Why, fays I, Friday, did you not fay you
wifh'd you were there? Yes, yes, fays he, wijh be both
there, no wijh Friday there, no Mafter there. In a
word, he would not think of going there without
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what fhall I do
there? He turn'd very quick upon me at this : Tou
do great deal much Good, fays he, you teach wild Mans
be good fober tame Mans ,\ you tell them know God,
pray God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, fays I,
thou knoweft not what thou fay'ft, I am but an
ignorant Man myfelf. Yes, yes, fays he, you teachee
me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you fhall go without me, leave me here to
five'by my felf, as I did before. Helook'd confusM
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets, which he us'd to wear, he takes it up
haftily, and gives it me; what muft I do with this?
fays I to him: Tou take kill Friday, fays he: What
mull I kill you for? faid I again. He returns ve-
ry quick, What you fend Friday away fori take kiU
Friday, no fend Friday away. This he fpoke fo
earneftly, that I faw Tears ftand in his Eyes. In a
word, I fo plainly difcover'd the utmoft Aflfeftion
in him to me, and aiirm Refolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would ne-
ver fend him away from n\e, if he was willing to
ftay with me. Upon
11691
Upon the Whole, as I found by all his Difcourfe
a fettled Affeftion to me, and that nothing fliould
part him from me, fo I found all the Foundation
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affe&ion to the People, and his Hopes
of my doing them good; a Thing, which as I had
no notion of my felt, fol hadnottheleaft Thought
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But Sill
I found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an
Efcape, as above, founded on the Suppofition ga-
ther'dfrom the Difcourfe, (viz.) That there were
feventeen bearded Men there, and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.
There were Trees enough in the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Canoes,
but even of good large Veffels. But the main Thing
I looked at, was to get one fo near the Water that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the Miftake I committed at firft.
At laft, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what Kind of Wood was
fitteft for it,-nor can I tell, to this Day, what Wood
to call th^Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fuftic, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for
a Boat: But I (hew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools, which after I had fhew'd him how
to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a Month's
hard Labour we finifh'd it, and made it very
handfome, efpecially when with our Axes, which I
fhew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-fide into the true Shape of a Boar,- afcerthis,
however, it coft us near a Fprtnight's Time to get
*her
her along, as it were, Inch by Inch' upon, great
Rowlers into the Water. But when Ihe was in,ihe
would have carry'd twenty Men, with' -great
Eafe. -
When fhe was in the Water, andtho? Use;was fo
big; it amazed me to fee with what dexterity and ,
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; fo I ask'dhim if he
would, and if we might venture over iniher • Tes> he
faid, he venter over in her very well, though great blow
Wind. However, I had a farther Defignthat he
knew nothing of, and that was to make'a Maft and
Sail, and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable:: As
to a Maft, that waseafy enough to get; fo I pitched
upon a ftrait young Cedar-Tree, which Ifoufcdnea^
the Place, and which there was great, Plenty of
in the Ifland; and I fet Friday to Work to cut it
down, and gave him.Directions how-to fhape and
order it. But as to the Sail, that was.my particular
Care; I knew I had old Sails, orxather Pieces of
old Sails enough; but as 1 had had them now 26
Years by me, and hadnot been very careful to pre-
ferve them, not imagining that I fhould ever have
this kind of Ufe for them, I did not doubt biit they,
were all rotten; and indeed mdft of them were fo $
however, I found two Pieces which appear d
pretty good, and with thefe I went to wcirk, and
with a great deal of Pains, and aukward tedious;
Hitching (you may be fure) for Want of Needles,!
at length made a three-corner'd ugly Thing, like
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutt6nSail,
to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little fliort
Sprit at the Top, fuch a$ ufually our Ships'Long-
Boats fail with, and fuch as I beft knew how to0
manage; becaufe it was fuch a one as I had to the
Boat in which I made my Efcape from Barbary;
as related in the firftPartof my Story.
I was
I was near two month's -performing this laft
Work, ^iz,. rigging and fitting my Mail and Sails;
for I finifh'd them very compleat, making a fmall
Iftay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, to aflift, if we
4hould turn to Windward; and which was more
than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her, to
fteer with; and though I was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as 1 knew the Ufefulnefs, and even
Neceffity of fuch a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
(o much Pains to do it, that at lafM brought it tt>
pais, tho' considering the many dull Contrivances
j had for it that failM, I think it coft me almoft
as much Labour as making the Boat.
After all this was done too, I had my ManFri-
day*£o teach as to what belonged to the Navigation
"of my Boat ; for though he knew very well how to
•-paddle the Canoe,'/he knew nothing what beiongM
to a^Sail and a Rudder, and was the moft amaz'd
iWhea he faw me>w6rk the Boat too and again in
theSea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and
filled this Way or that Way, as the Conrfe we fail'd
(changed: I fay, when he faw this, he flood like
»'one aftonifh'd andamaz'd: However, withalittle
;Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him; and
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the
Gompafs, I could tnake him underftand very little
of that. On the other hand, as therenvas very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in
thofe Parts, there was the lefs Occafion for a Com-
pafs, feeing the ftars were always to be feen by
Night, and the fhore by Day, except in the rainy
feafons, afid then no Body cared to flir abroad, ei-
ther by Land or Sea.
I was now entered on the feven and twentieth
>Year of my Captivity in this Place; though the
three teft Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rather to be left out of the Account, my. Ha-1
bitation
0?2 ]
bitati&ft being quite of another kind than in all the
reft of the time. I kept the Anniverfary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God
for his Mercies, as at firft; and if I had fuchCaufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much mdre fo
now, having fuch additional Teftimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being efte&ually and fpeedily deliver d;
for I had an invincible Impreffionupon my Thoughts',
that my Deliverance was at hand, and that I ftiould
not be another Year in this Place: However, I went
on with my Husbandry, digging, planting, fencing,
as ufual ,• I gathered and cur'd my Grapes* and did
every neceflary Thing, as before.
The rainy Seafon was in the mean time i*ptin
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times; fo I had ftowMour new Veflfel asfeeure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I faid in the beginning, I landed my Rafts frorii
the Ship, and haling her up to the fliore, at high
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, j'uft big enough to hold her, and juft deep
enough to give her Water enough to float in; and
then, when the Tide was out, we made a ftrong
Dam crofs the End of it to keep the Water out;
and fo (he lay dry, as to the Tide, frdm the Sea;
and: to keep the Rain off, we kid a great many
Botighs of Trees fo thick, that (he was as well
thatch'd as aHoufe; and thus we waited for the
Month of November and December, in which I de-
fign'd to make my Adventure.
When the fettled feafon began to Uome in, &$
the Thought of pay Defign return'd with the fair
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage;
and the firft Thing I did, was to lay-by'a-certain
quantity of Provifions, being the Stores for our
Voyage; and intended, in a Week or a Fortnight's
Time,
Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat.
I was bufy one Morning upon fomething of- this
kind, when I call'd to Friday, and bid him go to the
Sea-fhore, and fee if* h? could find a Turtle, or
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a
Week, for the fake of the Eggs, as well as the
Flefli: Friday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the
Steps he fet his Feet on; ,and before I had Time to
fpeak to him, he cries out tome, 0 Mafier! 0 Ma-
fier! 0 Sorrow ! 0 bad! What's the matter, Friday,
fays I; 0 yonder, there, fays he, one, two, three Canoe!
one, two, three! By his way of fpeaking I conclu-
ded there were fix ; but on Enquiry I found it was
but three: Well, Friday fays I, do not be frighted;
fo I heartened him up as well as I could: However,
I faw the poor Fellow was moft terribly fcar'd,- for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
him ,• and the poor Fellow trembled fo, that I
fcarce knew what to do with him: I comforted him
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as
him; but, fays I, Friday we muft refohe to fight them;
Can you fight, Friday? Me Jhoot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, faid
I again, our Guns will fright them chat we do not
kill; fo I ask'd him, Whether if I refolv'd to defend
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do
jufl as I bid him ? He faid, Me die, whin you bid die,
Mafier; fo I- went and fetchM a good Dram of
Rum, and gave him; for I had been fo gtfod a Huf-
band of my Rum, that I had a great deal left:
When he had drank it, I made him take the two
Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry'd, and load
t{iem with large Swan-Shot, as>ig as fmall Pifto!
T Bullets;
I *74']
gullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded
them-with two Slugs, and five fmall Bullets each;
and my two Piftpls I loaded with a brace of Bul-
lets each : I hung my great Sword as ufual, naked
by my fide, and gave Friday his Hatchet.
When I had thus prepar'd my felf, I took my Per-
fpe&ive Glafs, and went up to the fide of the Hill,
to fee what I could difcpver; and I found quitkly,
by my Glafs, that there were one and twenty Sa-
vages, three Prifpners, and three Canoes; and that
their whole Bufinefs feemed to be the triumphant
Banquet upon thefe three humane Bodies, (a barba-
rous Feaft indeed) .but nothing more thanas J had
pbferv'd was i^fual with them*
I pbferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where
they had done when Friday made his Efcape, but
riearer to my Creek, where the fhore was low, and
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the
Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Errand thefe Wretches came about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Friday
and-told him, I wasrefolv'd to go down to them,
arid kill them all; and ask'd him if he would ftand
by me? He had now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little raised with the Dram I had
given him, he was very chearful, arid told me, as
before, he would die, when I bid die.\
In this Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the
Arms which I had chargM, is before, between us:
I gave Friday one Piftol to ftick in his.Girdte, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pi-
ftol, and the other three my felf ,• and in this Po~
fture we march'dout: I took a fmall Bottle of Rum
iti my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag with
more Powder and Bullet • and as to Orders, I
charged him to keep clofe behind me, and not to
#ir, orfhoot, or4o any thing, t|U I bid him j and
px the mean, time, not ,to fpeak a Word: In this
Pofture I fetched a Compafs to my Right Hand (?£
near a,Mile, as vtell to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wood; fo that I might come within
fliot of them before I fhould be difcover d, which
I had feen by my Glafs it was eafy to do.
While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, I began to abate^my Refolu-
tjon $ I do not mean, that J entertained any Fear
of, their Number; for as they were naked, unarmM
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fuperior to them; nay,
though I had been alone; but it occurred to my
Thoughts, What Call; What Occafion; much
lefs, What Neceffity, I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither
done pr jqtended me any Wrong? Who, as to me,
were innocent, and whcfe barbarous Cuftoms were
jtheir own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed
x>f God^ having left them, with the other Nations
of that part of the World, to fuch ftupidity, and
to (uch inhumane Courfes; but did not call me tQ
take upon me to be a Judge of their Anions, much
lefs an Executioner of his Juftice ,- that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his
own Hands, and by National Vengeance punifh
them as,a People for National Crimes; but that,
in the mean time, it was none of myBufinefs; that
it was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he wa$
a declar'd Enemy, and in a ft ate of War with thofe
very particular People, and it was lawful for him
to attack them; but I could not fay the fame with
refjteft to me. Thefe Things were fo warmly
pr^(sfd upon my Thoughts all the Way as I went,
that I refolvM I would only go and place myfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous
Fea.ft, and that I would aft then as God fliould
dir?&; but that unlefs fomething offer d that was
lT z more
C -87* 3.
more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
peddle with them, ,!
With this refolution I entered the Wood, and
with all poffible Warymefs; and Silence (Friday fol-
lowing clofe at my Heels) I marcb'd till I came
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to them ,• only that one Corner of the Wood
lay between me and them: Here 1 calTd foftly to
Friday, and fhewing him a great Tree, which was
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing; he did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly view'd there ^ that they were all about
their Fire, eating the Flefli of one of their Prifo-
ners; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which he faid they would kill
next, and which firM all the very Soul within me?
He told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that
came to their Country in the Boat; Iwas'filfd
with Horror at the very naming the white-bearded
Man^ and, going to the Tree, I faw plainly, by my
Glafs, a white Man, who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet. ty*d with
Flags, or Things like Rufhes, and that he was an
European, and had Cloaths on.
. There was another Tree, and a little Thicket
beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than
the Place'where I was, which, by going a little Way
about, I faw I might come at undifcoverM, and
that then I fhould be within half Shot of them; fo
Jwith-heldmy Paffion, though I was indeed en-
rag'd to the higheft Decree, and going back about
twenty Paces, I got behind fome Bufhes, which held
all the Waybill I came to the other Tree $ and then
I came to a little rifipg Ground, which gave me a
m
foil View of them, at the Diftance of about eighty
Yards.
1 had now not a Moment to iofe; for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground,, all
clofe huddled together, and had juft fent the other
two to butcher the poor Cbriftian, and bring him
perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire; and they
were ftoopM down to untie the Bands at his Feet t
I turned to Friday, Now, Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thee; Friday faid he would; then, Friday, fays \%
do exa&ly as you fee me do, fail in nothing; fo I
fet down one of the Muskets and the Fowling^-
Piece upon the Ground, and Friday did the like
by his; and with the other Musket I took my
Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like; then
asking him, IS he was ready? he faid, Yes, then
fire at them, faid I; and the fame Moment I fir'd
alfo.
Friday took his Aim fo much better than I, that
otv the fide that he fliot, he kill'd two of them*
and wounded three more; and on my fide, I kill'd
one, and wounded two; They were, you may be
fore* in a dreadful Coniternation; and all of them*
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feec,
but did not immediately know which Way to run,
or which Way to look; for they knew not from
whence their Beftru&ion came 2 Friday kept his
Eyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might bbferve what I did; fo, as foon as the firft
Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took
-up the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like; he
fee me cock, and prefent, he did the fame again;
Ar£ you ready? Friday, faid I; yes, fays he; let
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that Ifir'd again among theamaz'd Wretches, and
i-fo' did Friday; and as our Pieces -were now loaden
-With what I c&U'd Swan-ftot, or fmall Piftol Bui-
T 3 - lets
lets, we found only two drop; but fb many wefe
wounded, that they ran about yelling and skream-
ing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably
wounded, moft of them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.  ') 
Now, Friday, fays I, laying down the difchargM
Pieces, and taking up the Musket, which was yet
loaden, follow me, fays I; which he did, with a
great deal of Courage; upon which I rufti'd out of
the Wood, and fliew'd myfelf, and Friday clofe at
my Foot: As foon as I perceived they faw me, I
ifliouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do fo
too ; and running as faft as I could, which by the
way was not very faft> being loaden with Arms as I
was, I made dire&ly towards the poor Viftim, who
was, as 1 faid, lying upon the Beach* or Shore,
between the Place where they fat and the Sea;
thp two Butchers, who were juft going to work
with him, had left him, at the Surprize of our firft
Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea-fide,
and had jump'd into a Canoey and three more of the
reft made the fame Way : Iturn'd to Friday, and
bid him ftep forwards, and fire at them ; he under-
ftood me immediately, and running about forty
Yards to be near them, he Ihot at them, and I
thought he had killed them all: for I fee them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat; though' I faw two of
them up again quickly : However, he killed two
of them, and wounded the third ^ fo thet he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead. *
While my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pullM out
my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor
Vi&im; and loofing his Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up, and ask'd him in the Portuguefe Xqngue,
What he was? He anfwer'd in Latin, Chfifiianus;,
but was fo weak and faint, that he could fcarce
ftand,
ftdnd or fpeak; I took my Bottle out of my Pock^tj
and gave it him, making figns that he fhould
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What
Countryman he was? And he faid, EJjpagniok; and
being a little recover^ let me know by all the
figns he could poflibly make, how much he was
in my Debt for his Deliverance: Seignior, faid I,
with as'much Spanljh as I could make up, we will
talk afterwards, but we muft fight now; if you
have any Strength left, take this Piftol and Sword,
and lay about you. He took them very thankfully,
and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces in an inftant,- for the Truth is,
as the whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor
Creatures werefo much frighted with the Noife of
our Pieces, that they fell down for meer Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to at-
tempt their own Efcape, than their Flefh had to
refift our Shot; and that was the Cafe of thofe five
that Friday fliot at in the Boat ,• for as three of
them fell with the Hurt th£y receiv'd, fo the other
two fell with the Fright.
I kept my Piece in my Hand fUll, without firing
being willing to keep my Charge ready, becaufe I
had given the Spaniard my Piftol and Sword; fo I
Callci to Friday, and bad him fun up to the Tree
from whence we firft fir'd, and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftnefs; and then giving him
my Musfcet, I fat down myfelf t'6 load all the reft
again, and bad them come to me when they want-
ed :( While I was loading thefe Pieces, there hap-
pened a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
$nd one of the Savages, who made at him with one of
T 4 their
their great wooden Swords, thqXajiiaWeapOiithat
was to have kBi\I him befo^, if I had not prevent-
ed it: The Spaniard* who wa$<a$ Jbold £r*das brave
as could be imaginM, tho* weak, had fought this
Indian a good while, and had cut hijii two great
Wounds on his Head; but the Savage being a
ftout lufty Fellow, doling in with him, had thrown
him down (being faint) and was wringing my
Sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, tho' un-
dermoft, wifely quitting the Sword, drew the Piflol
from his Girdle, fhot the Savage through th$ Body,
and killed him upon the Spot, before I, who was
running to help him, could come near. him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfuM the
flying* Wretches with no Weapon in hits Hand, but
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatch'd thofe
three, who as I faid, before, were wounded at(firft
and fall'n, and all the reft he could come up with;
and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both; but as he was not able to run, they <both
got from him into the Wood, where Friday purfu'd
them, and kill'd one of 6hem; but the other was
too nimble for him; and tho' he was, wounded,; yet
had plung'd himfelf into the Sea, and fwam with
ail his might oft' to thofe two wjbp were left in
the Canoe, which three in theCi^, with one
/ wounded, who we know not whether he dy'd tor no,
were all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty:
tThe Account of the reft is as follows;
3 Kiird at our firft Shot from the Tree.

if not dead. J
21 In all.
Thofe that were in the Canoe, worked hard to
£et out of Gun-lhot; and tho' Friday made two
or three {hot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them: Friday would fain have had me took
one of their Canoes, and purfued them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape,leaft carry-
ing the News Home to their People, they ihould
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes, and devour us by meer Multitude,- (o
I confented to purfue them by Sea, and running to
one of their Canoes, I jumped in, and bad Friday
follow me; but when I was in the Canoe,, I was
furprifced to find another poor Creature lie there
alive, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was,
fV the Slaughter, and almoft dead withJFear, not
knowing what the matter was; for he had not-been
able to look up over the fide of the Boat, he was
tied fo hard, Neck and Heels, and had been tied fo
long, that he had really little Life in him.
- I immediately cut the twilled Flags, or Ruflies,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not ftand, orfpeak,
but groaned moft piteoufly, believing, it feems, ftill
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd.
When Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to
himy arid tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a
Dram,
Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-
vered, revived him, and he fat up in the Boat;; but
when "Friday came to hear him fpeak, and looked
in his Face, it would have moved any one to Tears
to have feen how JPriday kifs'd him, embraced him*
hugged him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd a-
bout, danced, fung, then cry'd again^ wrung his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
fung, and jumped about again, like a diftrafted
Creature: It was a good while before I could make
him fpeak to me, or tell me what was the matter;
but when he came a little to himfelf, he told me
that it was his Father.
It is not eafy for me to exprefs how it moved
hie to fee what Extafy and filial Affection had
worked in this poor Savage, at the fight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being delivered from Death; nor
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
Affe&ion after this; for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a great many times: When he
went in to him, he would fit down by him, open
his Breaft, and hold his Father's Head clofe to his
Bofom, half an Hour together, to nourifli it; then
he took his Arms and Ankles, which were riumb'd
and ftiff with the binding, and chaffed and rubbed
them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the
Cafe was, gave him fome Rum out of my Bottle,
to nib them with, whi,ch did them: a great deal
of good.
This Aftion put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoq, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten almoft out of fight; and it was happy for
us that we did not; for it blew fo hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a
Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing fo
hard all Night, and that from the North-Weft >
which was againft them, that I could not fuppbfe
their
C 283 ] .
their Boat could live, or that they ever reached to
their own Coaft.
But to return to Friday;, he was fo bufy about
his Father, that 1 could not find in my Heart to
.take him off for fome time: But after 1 thought
. he could leave him a little, I calfd him to me,
and lie came jumping and laughing, and pleasM ro
the higheft Extream; then I ask'd him, If he had
given his Father any Bread? He fliook his Head,
and faid, "None: Ugly Dog eat all up felf; fo I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carried
on purpofe • I alfo gave him a Dram for himfelf,
but he would not tafle it, but carried it to his Fa-
ther :JI had in my Pocket alfo two or three Bunches
of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father. He had no fooner given his Fa-
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched,
he run at fuch a rate,- for he was the fwifteft Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I faw ,• 1 fay, he run at
fuch a rate, that he was out of fight, as it were,
in an inftant; and tho3 I call'd and hollow'd tod
after him, it was all one, awaj^he went, and in a
Quarter of an Hour, I faw him come back again,
tho" not fo faft as he went- and as he came near-
er, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe he had
fomething in his Hand-
 - When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an Earthen Jugg, or Pot, to bring
his Father fome frefh Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread
he gave me, but the Water he carried to his Father:
However, as I was very thirfty too, I took a littte
flip of it. This Water revived his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him1; for
he was juft fainting with Thirft,
When
,, When his,father had! dranky I calfd to him td
Jknow if there was any Water left ,$ he faid, Yes;
and I b$d him give, it to the poor Spanfard,
;who was in as much Want of ita$ his Father;
and I fent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought^
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very: weak^
and was repofipg himfelf upon a green Place, under
the fhade of a Tree, and whofe Limbs were alfo
very ftiff, and very much fwell'd with the rude
Bandage he had been tied with. When I faw that
upon Friday's coming to him with the Water, he
fat up and drank, and took the Bread, and be-
gan to eat, I went to him, and gave him. a Handful
of Raifins; he looked up in my Face with all the
Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulnefs that could
appear in any Countenance • but was fo weak,, not-
withftanding he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,
that he could not ftand up upon hisFfcet; he tried
to do it two or three times, but was really not
able, his Ankles were fo fwell'd and fo painful to
him; fo I bad him fit ftill, and caused Friday to rub
his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as he had
done his Father's.'
I obferv'd the poor affeftionate Creature: every
two Minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he
was here, tum'd his Head about,, to fee if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Place and Pofture as he left
him fitting; and at laft he found he was not to
befeen; at which he ftartedup, and, without
fpeaking a Word, flew with that fwiftnefs tohim,
that one could fcarce perceive his Feet to toudh
the Ground as he went: But when.he came, he
only found he had laid himfelf down to eafefhis
Limbs; fo Friday came back to me prefently, and
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, an#
then he fhould carry hinji to our Dwelling, where
1 would
I would take Care of him: But Friday, a lufty
ftrong Fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon
his (Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat, and
fethim down foftly upon the Side or Gunnel of the
Canoe/with his Feet in the Itifide of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and fet him clofe to his Fa-
therland prefently ftepping out igain, launched
the Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore fafter
than I could walk, tho* the Wind blew pretty-
hard too; fo he brought them both fafe into our
Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away
to fetch the other Canoe. As he pafsM me, I
fpoke to him, and ask'd him, whither he went,
he told me, Go fetch more Boat; fo away he went,
like the Wind; for fure never Man or Horfe run
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek,
almoft as foon as I got to it by Land; fo he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new Guefts
out of the Boat, which he did ,• but they were nei-
ther of them able to walk; fo that poor Friday
knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my Thought,
and catling to Friday to bid them fit down on the
Bank while he came to me, I foon made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
carry M them up both together upon it between us:
But when we got them to the Outfide of'our Wall]
or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lofs than be-
fore; for it was impoffible to get them over; and
Iwasrefolv'd nbt to break it down: So I fet to
Work again; and Friday and I, in about two Hours
Time, made a very handfome Tent, covered with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted : And here we made them two
Jteds of fuch Things as I had (viz,.) of good Rice-
Straw,
Straw, with Blankets laid upon it to lyq on, and
another to cover them on each B$4*
My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought my
felf very rich in Subje&s,; and it was a merry Rer-
fle&ion which I frequently made, Hqw like a King
I lookM. Firfl: of all, the whole Country was;my
own meer Property; fo that IJhadan undoubted.
Right of Dominion. 2dly, My People were perr
fefily fubje&ed: I was abfolute Lord and La(w^
giver; they all owM their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives, if there had been Oc-
cafion of it> for me. It was remarkable too, we had
hutthreeSubje&s,and they were of three different
Religions. My Man Friday was a Pcoteftant, his
Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal, and the Spaniard,
was a Papift: However, I allow'd Liberty of Conr
fcience throughout my Dominions: But this is by
the Way.
As fqon as I had fecur'd my two .weak refcued
Prifoners, an'd given them Shelter, and a Place to
reft them upon, I began to think of making fome
Proyifion for them: And the firft Thing I did, I
ordered Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt $
Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to
bekillM: When I cut off the hinder Quarter, and
chopping it intofmall Pieces, I fet Friday to Work,,
to boiling and ftewing, and made them a very
good Difh, I affure you, of Flefli and Broth, ha*?
ving put fome Barley and Rice alfp into the
Broth; and as I cooked it without Doors, forX<
made no Fire within my inner Wall, folcarry'd
it all into the new Tent; and having fet a Table
there for them, I fat down and eat my own Din-v
ner alfo with them, and, as well as I could, chear*d
them and encourag'd them: Friday being my Inter-
preter, efpecially to his Father, and, indeed,, to the
E 287..]
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard fpoke the Language
of the Savages, pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather flipped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and
fetch our Muskets and other Fire-Arms, which for
want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle;
and the next Day I ordered him to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to
the Sun, and would prefently be offenfive; and I
alfo ordered him to bury the horrid Remains of
their barbarous. Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing my
feif; nay, I could not bear to, fee them, if 1 went
that Way: All which he pun&ually performed, and
defaced the very Appearance of the Savages being
there ; fo that w;hen I went again, I could fcarce
knpw where it w;as, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.
- -I then began to enter into a little Converfatioti
with my two new Subjects; and firfl: I fet Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Efcape qk the Savages in that Canoe, and whether
we might expe$ a Return of them with a Power
too great for us to refill: Hisfirft Opinion was, that
th&Savagenn the-Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went off, but muft of
Neceffity be drown'd or driven South to thofe other
fliores, where they were as fure to be devoured as
they were to be drowned if they were caft away;
but as to what they would do if they'came fafe on
flibre, he faid he knew not; but it was his Opini-
on that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
manner of their being atta^ckM, the Noife and the
Fire, that he believ'd they would tell their People,
they were all kilfd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which ap-
pealed, (viz.) Fr/J^. and me, were two Heavenly,
Spirits
Spirits or Furies come down to deftroy them, and
not Men with Weapons: This he faid he knew,
becaufe he heard them all cry out (o in their Lan-
guage to one another; for it was impoffible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak
Thunder, and kill at aDiftance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the righc; for, as I underftood fince by
other hands, the Savages never attempted to go
over to the IQand afterwards; they were fo terri-
fied with the Accounts given by thofe four Men,
(for it feems they did efcape the Sea) that they be-
lieved whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would
be deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods.
This however I knew not, and therefore was
under continual Apprehenfions for a good while,
and kept always upon my Guard, me and all my
Army; for as we were now four of us, I would
have ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the
open Field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more Canoes ap-
pearing, the Fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Confideration, being likewife
affur'd by Friday's Father, that I might depend up-
on good Ufage from their Nation on his Account,
if I would go.
But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when
I had a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
when I underftood that there were fixteen more
of his Countrymen and Portuguefef who having
been caft away, and made their Efcape to that
fide, liyM there at Peace indeed with the Sa-
vages, but were very fore put to it for Neceflaries,
atad indeed for Life! I ask'd him all the Par-
ticulars of their Voyage, and found they were
3 Sfanifi Ship, bound from -the Rio de la Plata,
to
c *89 i
tb'the .Hkvarid; tteing dire^ed to leave their Load-
ing there, Which'was chiefly Hides and Silver, and
'to bring back 'tirh&i European Goods they could
iffeet With thbff^that they had fivePortupefe Sea-
nfefi: on Board, who they took out of another
Wreck-, that five 6f their own Men were drowned
Wheit firft the Ship was loft,and that thefe efcaped
th^Mnfiriite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd al-
nioft-ftarv'd on the Cannibal Coaft, where they ex-
pected to have been devoured every Moment.
He told me, they had fome Arms with them,'
but they were perfe&ly ufelefs, for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Walhing of the Sea
having fpoil'd all their Powder, but a little, which
theyufed at their firft Landing to provide them-
felves fome Food.
.Task'd him what he thought would become of
them there, and if they had form'd no Defign of
making any Efcape • He faid, They had many
Confultations about it, but that having neither
Ve{Tel,noE Tools to build one, or Provifions of any-
Kind j their Counfels always ended in Tears and
Defpair.
I ask'd him how he thought they would receive
a Propofal from me,which might tend towards an
Efcape:Andwhether,if they wereall here3it might
not be done? 1 told him with Freedom, I fear'd
nioftly their Treachery and UlUlageof me, if I
put my Life in their Hands;, for that Gratitude was
no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man*, nor
riid;Men always fquare their Dealings by the Obli-
gations j;hey had: receiv'd, fo much as they did
by the Advantages they expe&ed. I told him, it
would be very hard,thatlfhould bethelnftrument
of their Deliverance, and that they fhould after-
wards make me their Prifoner in .New Sjw*,where
an EngUfiiman was certain to be made a Sacri-
Part I. U fice,
£ce, what' neceflity, cr what, Accident fo<tver
brought him thither: And that I had rather be de~
liverd lip to the Savages, and be devoured a live^
thaw fall into the mercilefs Claws of thePriefts,and
be carry'd into the hquifitm. I added, That o-
therwife 1 wa.s/perfwaded, if they were-all here^
we might, with lb many Hands, build a Bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brafils
Southward,, or to the Iflands or Spanifi Coaft
Northward: But that if in Requital they fhould,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry
me by Force among their own People, I might be
ill ufed for my Kindnefs to them, and make my
Cafe worfe than it was before.
He anfwer'd with a great deal of Candor and In-
genuity, That their Condition was fo miferable,
and they were fo fenfible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of ufing any Man
unkindly that fhould contribute to their Delive-
rance: and that, if I pleafed, he would go to them
with the old Man, and difcourfe with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Anfwer:
That he would make Conditions with them upon
their Ibtemn Oath, That they tfeould be abfolute-
ly under my Leading,, as their Commander and
Captain-vand that they fhould fwear upon the Holy
Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me, and
to goto fuch Chriftian Country as that I fhoiild
agree to, and no other \ and to be dire&ed wh6lly
and ablblutely by my Orders, 'till thfey"were land-
ed fafely in fuch Country as 1 intended ^ and that
he would bring a Contraft from thtm under .their
Hands for that Purpofe. ;; \-
; ^ Then fhe told me, he would firft fwear'feme
lumfelf* That he would never ftir from me asiolig
•as he liv'd, 'till I gave him Orders *r and: thaX he
would take my Side to the .Ialt -Drop of his Bloody
- . i if
if there fhould happen the leaft: Breach of Faith a-
tnortg his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honeft Men, and they were under the greateft Di-
ftrefs imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
fcretionof the Savages \ out of all Hopes of ever
returning to their own Country \ and that he was
lure, if I would undertake their Relief, they would
live and die by me.
Upon thefe Affurances, I refolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if poflible, and to fend the old Sa-
vage and this Spaniard over to them to treat: But
when we had gotten all Things in a readinefs to
go, the Spaniard himfelf ftarted an Obje&ion,
which had fo much Prudence in it on one hand,
and fo much Sincerity on the other hand, that I
could not but be very well fatisfy'd in it \ and, by
his Advice, put off the Deliverance of his Com-*
rades for at leaft half a Year. The Cafe was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month •, du*
ring which Time I had let him fee in what Man-
ner I had provided, with the AlTiftance of Provi-
dence for my Support-, and he faw evidently
whatStock of Corn and Rice I had laid up *7which,
as it was more than fafficient for my felf, fo it was
not fufficient, at leaft without good Husbandry,
for my Family, now it was encreas'd to Number
four: But much lefs would it be fufficient, if his
Countrymen, who were, as he laid, fourteen ftill
alive* fhould come over } and leaft of all would
it be lufficient to vi&ual our Veflel, if we fhould
build one, for a Voyage to any of the Chriftian
Colonics of America. So he told me, he thought
it would be more advifable, to let him and the
two other dig and cultivate fome more Land, as
much as i could fpare Seed to fow 5 and that we
U 2 fhould
lhould.wait another Harveft, that we might hav£
a Supply of Corn for his Country-men when they
fhouH come y for Wantmight be a Temptation to
thttii to difagree, or not to think themielves deli-
vered, otherwife than out of one Difficulty into
another. You know, fays he, the Children of If-
raely though they rejoyc'd at firft for their being
delivered out of Egypt7 yet rebell'd even againft
God himfelf that delivered them, when they came.
to want Bread in the Wilder neft.
His Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice
lb good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his Propofal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of usy
as well as the wooden Tools we were furnifhed
with permitted*, and in about a Month's Time, by
the End of which it was Seed-time, we had gotten?
as'much Land cur'd and trimm'd up,, as we fbw'd
22BulheIs of Barley on, and \6 Jarrs of Rice^
which, was, in fllort, all the Seed we had to fpare;
nor indeed did we leave ourfelves Barley fufficient
for our own Food, for the Six Months that we had
to expeft our Crop, that is to fay, reckoning from
the Time we fet our Seed afide for lowing *, for it
is riot to be fuppos'd it is iix.Months in the Ground
in the Country. , • . •
, Having now Society enough, and am Number
beingTufficient to put us out of Fear of the Savages,
if'they had come, unlefs their Number had been
very great, we went freely all over the/Mland,
where-ever we found Occafion ^and ashereweihad
bur Efcape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, Jt
'Was impoflible, at leaft: for me, to have the
Means of it out of mine y to thislPuttpofey I
.mafk'd out feveral Trees which I thought fitfor
quX; Work, and 1 fet Friday and his Fa thereto, cut-
: ting.them down , and then I caused the." Spaniard,
.'.' to
to whom 1 imparted my Thought on that Affair,
to overfee and direft their Work. I fhewtt them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large
Tree into fingle Planks, and I caus'd them to do
the like, till they had made about a Dozen large
Planks of good Oak, near 2 Foot broad, 35 Foot
long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick: What
prodigious Labour it took up, any one may ima-
gine.
At the fameTime.I contrivM to increafe my lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could} and
to this Purpole Vmads'Friday and the Spaniard go
out one Day, and my felf, with Friday, the next
Day-, for we took our Turns: And by this Means
we got above 20 young, Kids to breed-up:with the
Tefl:, for \Vhen-ever we (hot the Dam, we fav'd
the-Kidsand added them to our Flock : But;above
all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes coding, on,-
I caus'd fuch a prodigious Quantity,to be:hung up
in the Sun, that I believe, had we been.at -Mutant,
where the Raifins of the Slin are cured^ we could
have filled.60 or 80 Barrels y and thefe, with our
Bread, was a greiat Part of our Food, axjd yery good
Jiving too, I allure yoti *, tor it is an exceeding nou-*-
rifhingFood.
; It" was, how Harveft, and our Crop in gobd.Or-
der; it was not the moft plentiful Enereafe Hiad
feen in the Iflarid, but however it vyas enough to
anfwe^our End } for from our 22 Bufhels of Bar-
ley, we* brought in and threfh'd out above 220
Buftigl^ and the like in Proportion of the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next
•Harveftjthofall the \6 Spaniards had been on Shore
with me 1 or if we had been ready for 3 Voyage,
it would very plentifully have vidualFd our Ship,
to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that
is to fay, of America.
U 3 When
When we had thus hous'd and fecur'd our Ma-
gazine of Corn, we fell to work to make more
Wicker Work, vizi, Great Baskets in which we
kept it} and the Spaniard was very handy and dex^
terous at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did
not make fome Things for Defence, of this kind of
.Work; but I faw no need of it:
And now having a full fupply of Food for all
the Guefts I expe&ed, 1 gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do
with thofe he had left behind him there. I gave
him a ftrid Charge in Writing, not to bring any
Man with him, who would not firft fwe.ar in the
Prefenceof himfelf and: of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attack the
Perfon he lhould find in thelfland, who< was fq
kind to fend for them in order to their Delive-
rance *, but that they would ftand by and defend
him againft all fuch Attempts, and wherever
they went, would be entirely under andTubjeftfcd
to his Commands-, and that this fhouldbe putm
Writing, and fign'd with their Hands: How we
tvere to have this done, when I knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Qiieftion
which we never ask'd.
Under thefe Inftru&ions, the Spaniard^ and the
old Savage (the Father of Friday) went sway in one
of the Canoes, which they might be faid to come
in, or rather were brought in, when thisy qaraeas
Prifbners to bfe devoured by the Savages.,, /
I gave each of them a Musket with a J^rfjack
on it, and about eight Charges of Powder and
Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands,of
both, and not to ufe either of them but uponttr^
gentOccafion.;
This was a chearftil Work, being the firft M,ea-
fures ufed by me in View of my Deliverance for
now
now 27 Years and fome Days. I gave them Provi-
xions of Bread, and of dry Grapes, fufficient for
themfelves for many Days, and fufficient for all
their Country-men for about eightDaystime ; and
wifhing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, a-
greeing with them about a Signal they Ihould hang
out at their Return, by which I fhould know them
again, when they came back, at aDiftance, before
they came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale an the Day
that the Moon was at Full; by my Account in the
Month of OBoher -j -but as for an exa& Reckoning
of Days, after I had once loft it, I could never re-
cover it again •, nor had I kept even the number of
Years fo pun&ua]Ty,as to be fure that I was rights
tho\asitprovy,when Iafterwards examined my Ac-
count, I found 1 had kept a true Reckoning ofYe^rs.
• It was no lefs than eight Days 1 had waited for
them, when a ftrange and unforeleen Accident in-
tcrven'd, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in Hiftory: I was faft afleep in my Hutch >
one Morning, when jpy Man Friday came running
in to me, and called aloud, Mafier} Mafier, they
ah cyme, they are tome* ?.
>I jump'd up, ^nd, regardlefs of Danger, I went
out as foon ai I could get my Cloaths on, thro'
niy little Grove, which (by the Way) was by this
Tjime grown to be a very thick Wood: I lay, re-
jgprdlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms?
which was not my Cuftom to do; but I was fur-
priz% when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
sently faw a Boat at about a League and Half's Di-
ftante, ftanding in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the Wind blowr
fog pretty fair to bring them in: Alio I obferv'd
prefently, that they did not come from that Side
#hichi the Shore lay on, but from the Souther?
V 4 nio|fc
moft End of the Ifland: Upon this I call'd Friday
in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were not the
People we look'd for,andthat we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.
_ In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Per-
fpeftive-Glafs, to fee what 1 could make of them \
and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to
the top of the Hill, as I ufed to do when I was
apprehenfive of any Thing, and to take my View
the plainer without being difcover'd.
I had fcarce fet my Foot on the HilJ, when my
Eye plainly difcover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor,
at about two Leagues and an half's Diftance from
me Sonth-fouth-eaft, but not above a League and
an half from the Shore. By my Obfervation it ap-
pear'd plainly to be an English Ship, and the Boat
appeafd to be an Englijh Long-Boat.
I cannot exprefs the Confuflon I was in, tho' the
Joy of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Reafon to
believe was mann'd by ray own Country-men,and
consequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot de-
fcnbe; but yet I had fome fecret doubts hung a-
bout me, L cannot tell from whence they came
bidding me- keep upon my Guard. In the firfb •
Place, it occurr'd to me to confider what Bufinefs
an £^///feShipcould have in that Part of theWorld
fince itwasnot the Way to,or from any Partof the
World, where the Englijh had any Traffick; and I
knewtherehad been no Storms to drive them in
there, as/in" Diftrefs •, and that if they were Ew^
///fc really, it was molt probable that they werV
hereupon no good Defign , and that I had better'
continue as 1 was, than fall into the Hands of
Thieves and Murderers.
Let :rioMan ddpife the fecretHints and Notices'
oj Danger which fome times are given him
when he may think there js no Poffibility of its be-*
in5
ing real That fuch Hints and Notices are giveii
us, I believe few that have made any Obfervati-
ons of Things can deny •, that they are certain Dis-
coveries of an.invifible World, and a Converfe of
Spirits, we cannot doubt, and if the Tendency
of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, why
jQiould we not fuppofe they are from fome friendly
Agent, (whether fupreme, or inferior and fubor-
dinate, is not the Queftion) and that they are gi-
ven for our Good?
The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms trie'
jn the Juftice of this Reafoning -7 for had I not
been made cautious by this fecret Admonition,*
come it from whence it will, I had been, undone"
inevitably, and in a far worfe Condition, than be-
fore, as you will fee presently.
I had not kept my felf long in this Pofture7 but
I law the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
looked for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing ^ however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
Where I formerly landed my Rafts:, but run their..
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about hklf a*
Mile from me, which was very happy for me ^ for
otherwife they would have landed juft^ as I may:
lay, at my Door, and would foon have beaten me;
. put of my Gutle> and, perhaps, have plundered me"
of all I had. • •
When they were on Shore, I was fully fatisfy'd
they were Englifh Men-, at leaftmoft of them;
one or two I thought were Dutch *, but it did not;
prove fo: There were in all eleven Men, whereof'
three of them I found were unarm'd, and, as I'
thought, bound ^ and when the firft four orfive of:
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three"
outof the Boat asPrifoners: One.ofthe three I
could pcrcciveufing thenjoft paffionate Gefturesof
Entreaty,
Intreaty, Affii&ibn and Defpair, even to a kind of
'Extravagance ; the other two, I con Id perceive,
lifted up their Hands fometimes,and appeared con-
cern'd indeed, but not to fuch a Pegree as the
firft.
. I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not what the Meaning of it fhould be. Fri-
day call'd out to me in Englijh, as well as he could,
0 JMafter! Toufee Englifh Mans eat Frifoner as well
as Savage Mans* Why, fays I, Friday^ do you
think they are a going to eat them then? Tes fays
Friday, They will eat them: £Jo, no, fays I, Friday^
1 am afraid they will mprder them, indeed, but
you may be fure they will not eat them.
. iVll this while I had no Thought of what the
Matter really was •, but flood trembling with, the
Horror of the fight, expecfting every Moment when
the three Prifoners fhould be kill'd} nay,once I iaw
one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cut-
laih, (as the Seamen call it) or Sword, to fhike onq
oftlje poor Men; and I expeded to fee him fall
ewry Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body

This put me in Mind of the firlt Time when I
came on Shore, and began to look about me; how
I gave my felf over for loft, how wildly I look'd
round me, what dreadful Apprehenfions I had, and
how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear of be-
ing devoured by wild Beafts.
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I
was to receive by the providential Driving of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have fince been fo long nourifh'd and fup-
ported } fo theft three poor defolate Men knew
nothing how certain of Deliverance and Supply
they were, how near it was to them, and how ef-
fectually and really they were in a Condition of
Safety, at the fame Time that they thought them-.
felves loft, and their Cafe defperate.
So little do we fee before us in the World, and
fo much Reafon have we to depend chearfully up-
on the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that
in the worft Circumftances they have always fbme-
thing;to be thankful for, and fbmetimes are near-
er their Deliverance than they imagine } nay, are
even brought to their Deliverance by the Means
by which they feem to be brought to their Deftru-
diori.
It was jnfl: at the Top of High-water when thefe
Pbople came on Shore, and while partly they flood
partying with the Prifoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to fee what kind
of a Place they were in, they had carelefly ftaid till
the Tide was fpent, and the Water was ebb'd Con-
iiderably away, leaving their Boat a-ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I
fdtind afterwards, having drank a little too much
Brandy, fell a-Qeep*, however, one of them waking
tboner than the other,and finding the Boat too faffc
; M a-ground
aground for him to ftir it, hollow'd for the reft
who were ftragling about, upon which they all
Jbon came to tine Boat:, but it was pa ft all their
Strength to launch her, the Boat being very heavy,
and the Shore on that fide being a foft qufy Sand,
almoft like a Quick-Sand.
In this Condition, like trueSeamen,who sre,per-
haps,theleaft of all Mankind given toFore-thought,
they gave it over, and away they ftrolfd about the
Country again; and I heard one of them fay aloud
to another, (calling them ofFfrom the Boat) Why*
let her alone, Jack, can t ye, Jhe'll float next Tide ^ by
which I was fully confirmed in the main Enquiry,
Of what Countrymen they were?
 All this while I kept my felf very clofe, not once
daring to ftir' out of myCaftle, any farther than to
my Place of Obfervation, near the Topof the Hill \
and very glad I was, to think how well it was for-
tify'd: I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and by that
Time it would be dark, and I might be at more
Liberty to fee their Motions, and to hear their
Bifconrfe, if they had any.
'In the mean Time I fitted my felf up for a Bat-
tle as before ^ 'tho' with more Caution, knowing
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had
at firft ; I ordef'd Friday alfo, who I had made ten
excellent Markf-man with his Gun, to load .Mm*
felf with Arms: I took my felf two Fowlmg-Pieces,
and I gave hihi three Miiskets. My Figureyinde'ed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-skin
Coat on; with the great Cap 1 have mentioned,' a
jiaked Sword by my Side, t\yo Piftols in my Belt,
2nd a Gun upon each Shoulder.
1 It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to Mve
made any Attempt 'till it was dark: But" about
twoa-Clock/bqng the Heat of the Day^ I found
that
that in fhort they were all goneftraggling into the
Woods, and,as'I thought, were laid down to Sleep..
The three poordiftrefledMen,too anxious for their
Condition to get any Sleep, were, however, fet.
down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about-
a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as I thought,
out of Sight of any of the reft.
Upon this I refolv'd to difcovermyfelf to them,
and learn fomething of their Condition: Immedi-
ately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man
Friday at a good Diftance behind me,as formidable
for his Arms as I, but not making quite ib ftaring
a Spe&re-Uke Figure as I did.
I came as near them undifcover'd as I could, and
then before any of them faw me, I call'd aloud to
them in Spanijh, What are ye Gentlemen?
^ They ftarted up at the Noife, but Were ter*
times more confounded when they law me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. -They made $o
Anfwer at all; but I thought I perceiv'd them juft
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in
English: Gentlemen, faid I, do not be furpriz'd at
me i perhaps you may have a Friend neat you
when you did not expeft it. He muft be fent di-
re&ly from Heaven then, faid one of them very
gravely to me^ and pulling off his Hat at the fame Time
tojim, for our Condition is paft the help of Man.
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, faid J. But can
you, put a Stranger in the Way how to help you,
for you feem to me to be in fome great Diftreis?
IJavryou when you landed, and whenypufeem'd
XP make Application to the Brutes that came with
•you, I faw one of them lift up his Sword to kill
you«
<. The poor Man, with Tears running down his
t;E«s, and trembling, looking like one aftpnifh'd*
lieturn'd, Am I talking to God7 or Man! /; it a real

faid /, if God had fent an Angel to relieve you, he
would have come better cloath'd, and arm'd after

yanr Fears, I am a Man, an Englishman, and dif-
pos'd to affift you, you fee; I have one Servant

freely, Can we ferve you? . What is your
Cafe?
*' Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you*,
while our Murderers are fonear; but, in ftort,
Sir, I was commander of that Ship, my Men
have mutiny'd againft me, they have been hardly.
prevail'd on not to murder me, and at lafl:
have fet me on Shore in this defolate Place, with
thefe two Men with me, one my Mate, the other
a Paflenger, where we expe&ed to perifh, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
Lwhat to think of it.
Where are thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid 15,
Do you know where they are gone? There they lyey
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, my
Heart trembles for fear they have feenu$y and heard
youfpeai; if they have, they wilt certainly murder us
*&•' 
Have they any Bire-Arms, faid I? He anfwer'd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which they
left in the Boat. Well then, faid I, leave the reft
to me} I fee they are all afleep, it is an eafy. thing
to kill them all j but fhall we rather take them
fcrifbners? He told me there were two.defpe*
irate. Villains among them that it was fcarceiiafe
to fhew any Mercy to -0 but if they were fecufd,
he believed all the reft would return -to'theft
Duty. I asked him, which they were? He
told me, he could not at that Diftance defcribe
them j but he Would obey my Orders in any thing
,1 would
I would dired. Well, fays I, let us retreat out of
their View or Hearing, leaft they awake, and we
will refolve farther •, lb they willingly went back
with me, till the Woods cover'd lis from them.
Look you, Sir, faid I? if I venture upon you*
Deliverance, are yon willing to make two Condi-
tions with me \ he anticipated my Propofals, by
telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recovered
fhouki be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing ^ and if the Ship was not recover^
he would live and die with me in what Part of the
World foeverl would fend him} and the twoo^
ther Men faid the fame. >
lVcll) fays 1, my Conditions are but two. I. That
while you ftay on this Ifland with me,you will not
pretend to any Authority here *, and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occafionsgive
them up to me, and do no Prejudice tome or mine,
upon this Iiland, and in the mean time be governed
by my Orders.
2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover5^
you will carry me and my Man to England Pa£
fage-free. . .''
Hegave me all the AfTuraiices that the Invention
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would corft*
ply with thefe molt reafonable Demands, and be-
sides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all Occafions as long as he liv'd. . .  /
Well then, faid I, here are three Muskets for
ybu, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what yoil
t;hink is proper to be done. Hefhewed all the
Teftimony of his Gratitude that he was able;
^but offered to be wholly guided by me, I told him^
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing -7 bufc
^he belt Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay} and if any was mt
:ki^datthe firft Volley, and offered to jfobiiiit*
we
fye mightfave them, and fo put it wholly upon
God's Providence to direft the Shot.
He faid very modeftly, That he was loth to
jkilHhem, if he could help it •, but that thofe two
were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they
efcaped, we fhould be undone ftill- for they would
go, on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com-
pany, . and deftroy us all. Well then^ faid I, Ne-
ceffity legitimates my Advice ^ for it is the only
Way to fave our Lives* However, feeing him ftill
cautious of ftiedding Blood, I told him they fhould
go themfelves, and manage as they found con-
venient.
In the Middle of this Difcourfe we heard fbme
of them awake, and foon after we faw two of
them on their Feet, I ask'd him, if either of them
jvere the Men who he had faid were the Heads
of the Mutiny ? He faid, No: Well then, faid I,
you may let them efcape, and Providence feems to
have waken'd them on Piirpofe to lave themfelves.
Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you, it is your
Fault.
 Animated with this, he took the Mulquet I
had given him in his Hand, and a Piftol in
his Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
each Man a Piece, in his Hand.: The two Men*
who were with him going fir ft, made fome
Noifej at which one -of the Seamen, who w&s
awake* ,turn?d about, and feeing them coming,
cry'd out to the reft, but it was too late then, for
tbe.Moment he cry?d out, they fir'd:, Jmean the two
Men, the Captain wifely referving hjs own Piece:
They had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men. they
knevy, that one of them was kiffd on the Spot,5 and
the othervery much wounded-9 but not being dead,
J^Jtarted^p upon his Feet, and cglL'd-.eagejly for
Help
help to the other*, but theCaptainftepping to him,
told him, 'twas too late to cry for Help, he fhould
call upon God to forgive his Villany, and with that
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his
Musket; fty|yat he never fpoke more: There were
three moraR the Company, and one of them was
alfo flighd|Pounded: By this time.I was come y
and when tfftey faw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to refill:, they begg'd for Mercy: The Cap-
tain told them, he would fpare their Lives, if they
would give him any Aflurance of their Abhorrence
Of the Treachery , they had been guilty of, and
would fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the
Ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Ja-
maica, frotn whence they came: They gave him
all the Proteftations of their Sincerity that could
be defir'd,and he was willing to believe them,and
fpare their Lives, which I was not againft ^ only I
obligUhim to keep them bound Hand arid Foot
^while they were upon the Ifland.
While this was doing, I fent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure
hetymd bring; away the Oars and Sail, which they'
didj and by and by, three ftragling Men that
were (happily forthem) parted from the reft,came
back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and feeing their
Captain, who before was their Prifonet, now their
Conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound alio, and
fo our Vi&ory was compleat
It now rcmain'd, that the Captain and I fhould
enquire into one another's Circumftances: I began
firft, and told him my whole Riftory, which he
heard with an Attention even to Amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful Manner of my being
fitfnifh'd with Provifions and Ammunition , and,
indeed, as my Story is a whole Colleftion of Won-
ders, it afteded him deeply -, but when herefle&ed
p*rt 1- X from
from thence, upon- himfelf, and how I feem'd to
have been pr<:fctVd there on purpofe to,faye his
tlfe, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
npf fpeak a Word more.
"After this Communication was at ag E,nd, 1 car-
fy'd him and his two Men into mj|pftartment.
Teaming them in julfc where I came oym^iz,. at the
Top of theHoufe, where I rcfrefli^hem with
fiifli Provifion$ as I had, and Jhew'd them all the
Contrivances T had made, during my long, long,
ihhahitin^ that Place.
r^Vll-I fhew'd them, all I faid to th'em, was per-
tm\y amazing \ but above all,:the Captain admif'd
lijy^ortificatioii^ud howperfc&ly I had conceal'd
my:Retreat vyith a Grove of Trees,, which having
Ij$$n new plan ted hear twenty Years,and the Trees
{pawing muclvfoftcr than in England^ was become
g Uttle Wood, and & thick, that it wa,s unpaflable
ill any Part p! it,, but at that one £ide, where I
Jad refeiVd my Httle winding Paffage into it: I
t$$ Mm,. thiswas, my Caftle? and my Refidence;
|ut that I had a Seat in the Country, as.moft Prin-
ts have, whither I, could reti;eat upon Occafion,
ajri^l, would ffieiv him that fcoo ^another Time >,
liu.tat prefent QiirBtifinefs was toconfider how.m.
recover theSbip: He agreed with me as to that $
but told me, he;,Was pcrfedly kt aXofs what Mea-
sures to take i for that there wereiUll fix and twen-
ty Hands on Board, who having enter'd into 3
cuffed Conspiracy, by which they had al! forfeited
ifykve Lives to the Law, wou^d,be hardened in it
now by t)efper,ation; and would carry it on,know->
ing that if they were reduced, they fhould be
brought to the Gallows as foon as they came to
( %tigUnd, or to any of the Epglip Colonies; and
', that therefore there would be no attacking them
with fo fmall 3 dumber as we Were.
ImuFed
I mufed far fome time upon what he had laid,
and found it was a very rational Conclufion; and
that therefore fomething was to be refolved on ve-
ry fpeedily,as well to draw the Men on Board in-
to fome Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and deftroying us•, upon this it
prciently occur'd to me, that in a little while, the
Ship's grew wondering what was becopieof their
Comrades'and of the Bdatj- would certainly come
on Shore in their Other Boat, to lee for them, and
that then perhaps they might come aritfd, and be
too ftrong for us: This he allow'd was ratiorial.
Upon this 1 told him, the firft Thing we had to
do, was toftave the Boat^ which lay upon the
Beach, lb that they might not carry her off; and
taking'every thing out of her, leave her fo far ufe*
lers as not to be fit to fwim ^accordingly we went
on Board,took the Arms which were left orr Board^
out of .her, and whatever- elie we found therey
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum* a few Bisket-Gakes, a Horn of Powder, and
3 great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas •, thd
Sugar wasf five or fix Pounds; all which was
very welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy and
§ugar of which I hady had none left for many
Years. '.,
When we had carry'd all thefeThings onShorei
(the Qars^ Malt, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat,
was carrf&vaway before, asabove) we knocked a
great Hole in the Bottom, that if they had come
it rongcenough to matter us, yet they could not
carry off she ftoat. • ?'
Indeed it was not much in my Thoughts, that
we1 could be able to recover the Ship^ but my View
was,thatdf they wentaway without the Boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward IJlands^ and call upoQ our
X 2 Friends
'>"-
Friends the SpanUrd^iaray Way, fori had them
ftill in my Thoughts. ; , . . :\
While we were thus preparing our Deiigns, and
badfirft, by main Strength, heaved the Boat np
upon the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not,
fleet her off at High-Watier-Matk-7 and;, be fides
had broke a Hole In her Bottom, too big to H
quickly llopp'd, and were iati down -muling what
we fhould do, we heard ^he'Ship fire a Gun, and^
faw her make a Waft with her Antient, as a Sig-
nal for the Boat to come on Board ^ but no Boat
ftirr'd -7, and they fir'd ieveral times,taking other
Sighals for the Boat;
At lafc when all their Signals and Firings prov'd
fruitlefs, and they found the Boat did not ftir, we
few them* by the Help Jof my GlafFes, hoiff ano-
ther. Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and
we found as they approached, that there was no
-lefs than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire*
Arms, with them.
As the Ship layalmofttwb Leagues from th&
Shore, we had a full View of them as they came,
and a plain Sight of the Men, even of thrir Faces*
becaufetheTide having let them a little to the
Eaji-ofitfae other Boat,they rowed up under Shore,
to come to the lame Place, where the other had
landed, and where the'Btiat lay.
I By this Means, I fa^we had a full view of th^m,
and the Captain knew their Perfons and Gfa'ara-
£ters of all the Men m the Boafcj <tf whom he laid,

would be too powerful for us.
Ifmil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our
Circumftaaces were paft the Operations of Fear:
Yharfeeing almoft every Condition that .could be
was better than thatwhich wewere fuppos'd to be
in, we ought to expeft that the Confequence, whe-
ther Death or Life, would be fure to be a Delive-

Sir, faidl* is your Belief of my being preferv'd here

a little tfhile ago ? Fot my Part, faid I, there feems

thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear,and

he was in Hopes y?t fhould have r'ecover'd :, but he

However,- we hkd no Remedy but to Wait and
fep what the IfTue of Things might prefent: The

at length 1 told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night,and then if they
did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might fin*
a Way to get between them and the Shore, and lb
might nfe fome Stratagem with them in the Boat,*
to get them on Shore. -" '/
We waited a great while, tho' very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneafy} when*'
after long Confiiltations,we law them ltart all tip,
and march down towafd the Sea: It feems they
had fhch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them/of
the Danger of the Place* that they refold to go
on Board the Ship again, give their Companions
over for loft, and fo go* on with their intended
Voyage with the Ship.
As foonasl^ercei^d them g& towards the Shore^
I imagined ft to be as it really was, That they ha&
givenm&their Search,4 and were for going back
again; and the Captain^ as foon as I told him my
Thoughtsrwas ready to fink at the Apprehenfions
of it V but I prefently thought of a Stratagem to;
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'dmj
End to a Tittle. ":-
I orders J$*<%, and the Captain^Mate, to go
over the little Creek WeftWard, towards the Flafe6
where the Savages came on Shore,whenFri^ was
refcuM \ and ^s foon as they same to a littte rifing
Gronnd^t about half a Mile Diftance, 1'Bad them
hatbw/^S'IqM as they could, and wait till £W$
foifnd the Seamen heard them, that as ibonasfi^e!t
they hfeard the&eamen anfwer them, tlleyilKoutcl
return it again,and then keeping out of Sight, t&k
a Round,al way s anfwering when the other holldw'd^
to draw them as far into the lfland^ind among the
^Voodsi
Wopdsi aspoffible, and then wheel about again to
m% Jiyfiich WaysasJ dire&ed them.
, T^y were jtfft going into the Boat, when Fri-
dtyffl^L fcheMate h0llow'd,and they presently heard
tk$m*Mt\$ anfwering, run along the Shore Weft-
urcai$>-towards the Voice they heard, when they
werefprefetntly ftopp'd by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they could not get over, and
c^l'dlpr ,the Boat to come up, and fet them over,
a$;|^ed I e?cpe£i:f d.
'Wfbefl they had fet tbemfelves over, I obftrv'd,.
t$Kat)tfee Boat being gone up a good Way into the
Creek, and* as it were, in a Harbour within the
^ai\% ^hey took one of the three Men rout of her
togo&lo^gwith thejn, and left only two in the
^W,i^ving fa#en'd her to the ftuiiip of a little
Tree on the Shore.
* TThis was what I wifti'4 for, and immediately
paying Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bu-
fin#j J; took the reft with me, and;croffing the
<2r^k put of their. Sight, we furpriz'd the two
Mm Wfore they iwere aware, one of them lying

#ft$?wards to join very fincerely with us.
\ :Jn ^roeanTim.^^^; arad the,Gaptain'sMate

they drew'them;, by Hollowing and Anffaerfng
from one Hill to another, and from dne Wood €0
another, 'till they not only heartily tirtl them, but
left them where1 they were very fure they couil
not reach: back to the Boat before it was dark $
and indeed they were heartily tirti themfelvesal*
fo by the Time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for
them in the Dark^ and.to fall upon them, fo as f<*
make fure Work with them.
It was feveral Hours after Friday >came back to
me, before they came back to their Boat, and We
^could hear the foremofl: of them long before they
came quite up, calling to thole behind to comit
along, and could al& hear them anfftretyand com-
plain how lam^'and tyrM they Were, and notabfe
to come any falter, which was vety Welcome
News to us.
y At length they came up to the Boat v but *ti*
impoflible to exprefs1 their Confufion, when they
fiiind the Boat fait a-ground in the Creek, the
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone: We
oukLhear them call to one another in a moft la*
mentable Manner, telling one anotherthey were
gotten into an i^hanted Ifland •, that either there
were Inhabitants in it, and they Ihould all be mur*
der'd; or elfe there<wefe DeviteorSpirits in it,and
they Ihould be all carry'd away and devoured.
They hollow'd again, and call'd their twa
Comerades by their Names a great many Times,
butnoAnfwer. After fome Time, we could fee
them, by the little Light there was, run about
wringing their Hands, like Men in Defpair^ and.
that fometimes they would go and lit down in th$
Boat to reft fchemfelves, then come a-lhore again,
and walk about again, and fo the fame Thine <*
ver again. x
My
; (My Men would fain have me give them Leave*
to fall upon them at once in the park •, but I was
willing to take them at fom£v&d vantage, fo to
fpare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
arid especially-I was unwilling to hazard the kil-
ling any of our ownMen, khowing the other were
very well armed. I refolv'd to wait to fee if they
did not feparate v and therefore to make fure of
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and ordered
Friday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as they could,
that they might not be difcovered, and get as neai?
them as they could poffibly, before tliey offered to
fire.. • ;;(;,;... • • '*

However, the Captain told him he imift lay down-

Sljore in 3 barren uninhabited Ifland, but it had
pteas'd Gpd fo to diredfr thenv that the lQand
was inhabited, and that the Governour was an
JungUfamw? that he might hang them all there, if
h£ pjeas'd} but as he had given them all Quarter,
he fuppos'd he would fend them to England, to be
dealt witfe thtre, as Juftice required, except At-
tmsy who wats commanded by the Governour to
a4vjfe to prepare for Death; for that he would -be
lapfe'd in the Morning.
\ Though this was all a Fi&ion of his owtk, yet

It now occurred to bin*, that the Tiipe of #wt
Deliverance was come, and that it would bs a jnplfe
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in, to fee foeaytjp
in getting Poffeffion of the Ship ;fo I retired in tte>
Dark from them, that they might not ijfe i$iha#
Kind of a Government they had,and call'd t/heGap-j
tain to me} wljen I call'd, as at a good Difenee,*
one of the Men was ordered to fpeak agai%and fe$[
to the Captain, Captai^ the Commander cafe/for
you j and prefentiy the Captain repty'd, Tilt Ust
Excellency', lamjuft a coming: This more perie&iy
#mus'd themi and they all beiiev'd that the Com-r
inlander, was juft by with his fifty Men. ,f
Upon the Captain's cotnipg to me, I told himt
my Projedforfeizing the Ship,, which helikUt>$
wonderfully well, and refold to put it in Etecu-r
tion the next Morning.
But in-order- to execute itwith more Att> ^nd
fecure of Succefs, I told him, we muft divide thc>
Prifoners, and that he fhould go and take At&m
and twomoj-e of theworft of .them, and fend them;
pinion'd to the Cave whcrcthe others Jay : TMs;
was committed to Friday and the two Men wiboc
came on Shore with the Captain.  * ,
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a, Pti«
fon; and it was, indeed, a difmal Place, efpecialltf'
to Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower, as J call'd it^
of which I have given a full Defcription \ audits
it was fenc'd in, and they pinion'd •, the Place wast
fecure enough, confidering they were upou thbir
Behaviour.
To theft in theMorning I fent theCaptain,rthii>
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Wordf
to try them, and tell me, Whether he thought they
Wight
ftight-tie truftecl or no; to go omBoard and fur-
prize the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury
dflfieWm} ot the Condition they were brought to-,
andthatftWighj the Covernour had given them
Quarter for their Lives, as to their1 prefent'Afti-
ori, yet that if they were fent to England, they
would all be toang'd in jChains; to bfe ftire \ Wit that
if, they Would join jit'lb juft art Attempt, as to re-
cover the Ship* he would have theGovernour's
Engagement for their Pardon.
Any one may guefs how readily fitcb a Propofal
wduld ^be accepted by Men hi their Condition \
tbey fell down on their Knee$ to the Capfain, and
promifed with the deepeft Imprecations, 1flia-t tTiey
would be faithful to him1 to the laflrDrop, and
thrift thdy fhould owfeiheir Lives to hifti,1 and
would go with him all over the World 5 tharthey
would own him for a Father to thefn ^rlorig as
theyliv'd.
* Welt,'fays the'Captain, I muft^go^ahd^ell the
GoVernour what yoft iay,< and fee what lfcan1 do
to bring him to cotifefttto it: So \k brought me
an Account of the Temper he fbtind1 them in \
and-that he verily tl^liev'd they would be faith*
fui. .. l
t However, that we might be very lecure,' I told
Mm he ihould go back again, and cphufe out thole
five, and tell them, they might fee Ihfathfc'did ndt
want Men} that he would take out thbffcfiVeto be
tiis Affiftants, and that the GoveWorfr^ will keep
the other two, and the three that vWSre fent Prifo-
ners to the Caftle {my Cave) as Hoftage^, for the
Fidelity of thofe five $ and that if t;heV prov'd'un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Hoftagefc Ihould
be'h^ng'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.
This
This look'd fevere, and convinced them that the
Governour was in Earneft; however, they had no
Way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perfwadc the other five to do their
Duty.
Our Strength was now thus order'd for the Ex-
pedition: i. The Captain, hisMate, andPafTenger.
2. Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang, to
whom, having, their Charafters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trufted them with
Arms. 3. The other two, who I had kept 'till now
in my Bower, pinion'd, but, upon the Captain's
Motion, hacl now releas'd. 4. Thefe five releas'd
at laft v lb that they were twelve in all, belides
five we kept Prifoners in the Cave for Hoftages.
I.ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to ven-
ture with thefe Hands on board the Ship; for,
as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think
it was proper for us to ftir, having {even Men
left behind j and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them afunder, and fupply them with
Viduals.
As to the five in the Cave, I refblv'd to keep
them fail -^ but Friday went in twice a Day to them,
to fupply them with NeceflTaries \ and I made the
other two carry Provifions to a certain Diftance,
where Friday was to take it.
When I fhew'd my felf to the two Hoftages, it
was with the Captain, 'who told them, I was the
Periqn the Governour had order'd to look after
them, andthatitwastheGovernour's Pleafurethey
fhould not ftir any where but by my Dire&ion -,
that if they did, theyihould be fetch'd into the
Caftle, and be laid in Irons*, fo that as we ne-,
ver fufTered them to fee me as Governour, fo.l
now appeared as. another Perlbn, and fpoke of the
Part. I. Y Gover-
* f 3$2 3
Govcrnotrr, the Garrifon, the Caftle, and the like*
upon all Occa lions.
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him,
but to fitmifh his two Boats, flop the Breach of
one, and Man them. He made his Paflenger
Captain of one, with four other Men 5 and-him-
felr, and his Mate, and five more went in 'the 0-
ther: And they contfiv'd their Bufinefs vtty well;
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight. As
foon as they came within Call of the Ship,ta made
Rcbinfon hale them, and ttO them he had brought
of the Men and the Boat, but that it frastflong
Time before they had found them, -and tlie like y
holding them in a Chat 'till they came to tHe Ship's
Side; when the Captain and the Mate, entering
firft with their Arms, immediately knocR'd ddton
the Second Mate and Carpenter with'the Biit~end
of their Muskets, being very faithfully fecondfed
by their Men \ they fecur'd all the reft thai wfere
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to
faftfen th$ Hatches to 'keep them down 'who were
below, when the other Boat arid their MeH enter-
ing at the Fore-Chains, fecur'd the Fojd-Oaftie of
the Ship, and the Scuttle which went' ftowrr in
•the Cook-Room, making three Men th^y fotond
there Prifoners. "i(!
When this was done,and all lafe upon fcteck/the
Captain ordei'd theMate with threeMbri ttfbteak
into the Round-Houfe, where the newRebri Cap-
tain lay; and, having taken the Atarn1,vtfasgbtten
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Bh;e-
Arms in their Hands ^ and when the Matt with a
< Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain arid
bis Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Musket-Ball, which broke his Aim,
atnd wounded two more of the Men, but kilFd no
Bxxly.
The
The Mate calling for Help, rufhM however in*
to the Round-Houle, wounded as he was, and with
bis Piftol (hot the new Captain through the Head,
the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came oufi
again behind one of His Ears-,*fo that he never
fpoke a Word •, upon which the reft yielded, and
the Ship was taken effe&ually, without any more
Lives loft. 
As foQii as the Ship was thus fecur'd, the Cap*
tamo^der'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
q£ his Succefs,, which you may be fure I was very
glad to; hearjhaying fate watching upon the Shore,
for it, till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
: paving.thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
down ^ andjfch#vipg been a Day of great Fatigue
tChme,I fllept very found, till I was fomething fur^
prfc^ with the Noife of a Gun •, and prefently
itarting up,, I heard a Man call me by the Name
QfG9yernQi}r,GQvernour,and prefently Iknew the
Captain's Vsice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hilljtbere he ftood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrac'd pe in his Arms, My dear Friend and
J)dfomr> &y$h$fhere,$ your Ship, for jhe is all yours,
andfo an we mdalhhat belong to her. 1 caft my Eyes
to the Ship, and there {he rode within little more
than hstlf a Mile of tbeShore-, for they had weighed
her Anchpras foon as they were Mailers of her £
aad this Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor juftag^inft the Mouth of the little Creek;
and the pCide,being up, the Captain had brought
tfr$ Pinnace in near the Place where I firft landed
my Rafts, and fo landed juft at my Door.
, 1 was at firft ready to fink down with the Sur-
prize: For 1 faw my Deliverance indeed vifibly
put into my Hands, all Things eafy, and a large
Ship juft ready to carry me away whither I ptea-
Y z fed
fed to go. At firft, for fbme Time, I was not able
to anfwer him one Word *, but as he had taken
me in his Arms, I held fall by him, or I fhou'l'd
have fallen to the Ground.
He perceived tire Surprife, and immediately
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pofe for me •, after I had drank it,1 fat down up-
on the Ground ; and though it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could fpeakr
a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great art
ILxtafy as I, only not under anySurprize,as 1 was;
and he laid a thousand kind tender Things to me,
to compofe and bring me to my felf, butfuch
was the Flood of Joy in my Breaft, that it put all
my Spirits into Confulion} at laft it broke out
into Tears, and in a little while after I recovered
my Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as
my Deliverer -, and we rejoyc'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a Man fent from Hea-
ven to deliver me,and that the whole Tranfaftion
feem'd to be a Chain of Wonders-, that fuch Things
as thefe were the Teftimonies we had of a fecret
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
fearch into the remotelt Corner of the World,and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever he pleafed.
1 forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
nefs to Heaven; and what Heart could forbear to
blefs him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in fuch a Wildernefs, and
in fuch a deiblate Condition, but from whom
every Deliverance mull always be acknowledged
to proceed!
~ When
When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told
rne, he had brought me fotne little Refrefhment,
fiichas the Ship afforded, and fuch as the Wretches
that had been fo long his Matters had not plun-
det'd! him of: Upon this hecall'd aloud to the
Boat, aridhid his Men bring the Things a-lhore
that were for the Governour; and indeed k was
a Prefent, as if I had been one not that was to be
carry'd amy along with- them, but as if 1 had been
to dwell upon the Ifland ftill^ and they were to go
without me.
Firlt" he had brought me a ,Cafe of Bottles fuij
of excellent Cordial Waters*- fix large Bottles pjf
Madera Wine} the Bottles held two Quarts a-
jpieee*, two Pound of excellent good Tobacco^
twelve good pieces of the Ship's 8ee£- and fix Pie-
ces of Pork, with a Bag of Peafe, a#4 about a hun-
dred Weight of Bisket. {
Re brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flovver, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of
Lime-juice, and abundance of other Things: But
befide's! thefe, and what was a thoufand times mors
nfeful to me, he brought me fix clean ne>y Shirts,
fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves,
one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stockr
ing;s, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his own,
vvhich had been worn but very little: In a Word,
hecioathed me from Head to Foot.
It was a very kind and agrepable Prefent, as any
biiv rmay imagine, to one in my Circumftances:
But never Was any thing in the World of that Kind
fo utipkTafant, awkard, and uneafy as it was to
me to weai" fuch Cloaths at their firft putting on.
After theie Ceremonies paft, and after all his
good Things were brought into my littlp Apart*
Went, we began to confult what was to be don?
with the Prifoners we had; for it was worth con-
Y 3 fideriijg
fidering, whether we might venture' to take'them
away with us or no, efpecially two of them, who
w,e knew to be incorrigible and refra&ory to the*
lad degree-, and the Captain laid, "he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it muft be
in Irons, as Malefaftors to be delivered over to Ju-
ftice at the firfl Englijh Colony he could come at j
fend I found that the Captain himlelf was very an-
&iou$ about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if hedefired it, I
,dfcrft undertake to bring the two Men he fpoke of,
to make it their own Requeft that he fhould leave
them upon the lfland: I Jhould be very glad of that,
iays the Captain, with all my Heart.
^Well, lays F,*I will fend for them up, and talk
^wkh them for you; fo I caus'd Friday and the two
Hoftages, for they were now difcharg'd, their
Gonirades having performed their Promife •, I fay, I
caufed them to go to the Cave, and bring up the
live Men pinioned, as they were, to the;Bower and
kfeep them there 'till I came.
« ;After lome Time, I came thither drefs'd in my
mW Habit, and flow I was call'd Governour again;
being-all met, and the Captain with me, I caus'd
theMen to be brought before me, and I told them,
I^had had a full Account of their villanious Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had ran away
With the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence-had en-
foar'd them in their.own Ways, and that they
were falPn into the Pit which they \r<:& dlgg'd for
others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship
bad been feiz'd, that fhe lay now in the Road, and
'they might fee by and by, that their new Captain
had
had received the Reward of his Villany •, for that
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, why I fhould not execute them as Pi-
rates taken in the Fad, as by my Com million they
could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the reft,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken the Captain promised them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy : But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to fhew them %
for, as for myfelf, I had refolved to quit the
Ifland with all my Men, and had taken Paflage
with the Captain to go for EngUnd: And as for
the Captain, he could not carry them to England,
other then as Prifoners in Irons to be tryed for
Mutiny £nd running away with the Ship*, the
Confeqnence of which they mull needs know
wou^d be the Gallows •, fo that I could not tell
which was belt for them, unlefs they bad a Mind
totalte their Fate in the iflan(d % if they defir'd that,
I did riot care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had
ibme Inclination to givethem their Lives, if they
thought they could Ihift on Shore.
They feeni'd very thankful for it, faid they
would; much rather venture to ftay there, than to
be farry'd to England to be hanged •, fo 1 left it on
thafl(fluer
However, the Captain {eeirTd to make Ibme
Difficulty of it, as if he dfirft not leave them
there: Upon this I itemed a little angry with the
Captain, $ind told him, That they were my Prifor
ners, not his \ ^nd that feeing I hadoffer'd them
fo much Favour, 1 would be as good as my Word;
and that if he did not think fit to confent to it, I
would fet them at Liberty as I found them; and
'" Y4" " .if
if he did not like it, he might take them again if
he could catch them, n
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly fat them at. Liberty, and bad them re-
tire into the Woods, to the Place whence they
came, and I would leave them fome Fire Arms,
fome Ammunition, and fome Dire&iqns how they
fhould live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this,. I prepared to go on Board the Ship,
buttold the Captain, that 1 would flay that Night
to prepare my Things,, and deiir'd him to go on
Board in the mean Time, and keep all right in
the Ship,; and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day
For rne, ordering him, in the mean time, to caufe
the new Captain who was kill'd, to be hang'd at
the Yard-Arm, that thefe Men might fee him.
Wfteii the Captain was gone, I .fent for the Men
up "to; me to my Apartment* and enter'd ferioufly
iiito;DifLOLirfe with them of their Circum'ftances ^
I t'Mdv them, I thought they had made a right
Ghoiee- that if the Captain carry'd them away,
.they would certainly bef; hang'd. I, (hewed them
the new Captain hanging at the YardrArm of the
Shi.p^n4 told them they had nothing kfs to expeft.
AVHen they had all declar'd their willirigriefs to
ftay,I. then told them, I. would let them'Into the
Story of lmy living there, and put them into the
Way of making it eafy .to them. Accordingly I
gave-them the whqk'Hiftory of the Place, and of
hlycpffiingtbif, ffiety'd them my Fortifications,
the way X made my Bread, planted my Com, cu-
red my QrapSs *, and in a Word, all that was ne-
celTarytomake them e^fy : I told them the' Stoiy
alfoof Hit fixteen Spaniards t+iat were tQ be expect-
ed; for whom I Jfcft a Letter, and. made thetil
pitmiiie to treat, them in common with them-
felves.
I left
I left them my Fire-Arms, <uii> Five Muskets^
three Fow ling-Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left-, for after
the frrft Year or two, 1 nfed but little, and wafted
none. 1 gave them a- Defcription of the Way I
managed the Goats, and Directions to milk and
fatten them,and to make both Butter and Cheefe.
In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own
Story v and 1 told them, 1 would prevail with the
Captain to leave them twoBarrels of Gun-Powder
more, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them
1 would have been very glad of ^ alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had broi^ht
me to eat, and bad them be fureto low and en-
creafe them.
Having done all this, T left them the next Day,
and went on Board the Ship: We prepar'd imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The .'neat Morning early, two of the five Men
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
molt lementable Complaint of the other three,
beggd to be taken into the Ship, for God's Sake,
for they fhcmld be murdered, and begged the Cap-
tain to take them on Boards tho' he hang'd them
immediately.^''
Upon this, the Captain pretended to have no
Power without mc* •, but after fome Difficulty, and
after their folemti Promifes of Amendment, they
Were taken on Board, and were Ibme time after
found ly whipped.and pickled \ after which, they
proved very honeft and quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was ordered on.
Shore> the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
sed to thk Men, to which the Captain,atmy Inter-
cefiion, caiis'd their Chefts and Cloaths to be ad-
ded, which they took, and were very thankful for?
1 alfo encouraged them, by telling them, that if
it
it lay in my Way to fend any Veflel to take tfiem
iba I would not forget them." ,
,', When I.took Leave of this Ifland, I carry'd on
Board for Reliques the great Goat's Skin Cap I had
made, my Umbrella, and one of my Parrots ^
alio 1 foraot not to take the Money I formerly
ihention'd, which had lain by me fo long ufelefs,
t^liat it was grown rufty, or tarnifhed, and could
liardly pafs for Silver, till it had been a little
subbed and handled \ as alfo the Money I found
I?* the'Wreck of the Spamjh Ship.
And thus t left the Ifland, the Nineteenth of
JOecembery as I,found by the Ship's Account, in the
Year id8tf, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty Years, two Months, and nineteen Days \
being deliv^r'dfrom this fecond Captivity the fame

I went
I went down afterwards into Torkjhire \ but my
Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Fa-
mily extinft, except that I found two Sifters, arid
two of the Children of one of my Brothers •, and as
I had been long ago given over for dead, there had
been noProvifion made for me-, fo that,in a Word^,
I found nothing to relieve or affift me-, and that
little Money I had, would not do much for me^ as
to fettling in the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expeft} and this was, That the Matter
of the Ship, who I had fo happily, delivered, and
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, hal-
ving given a very handfome Account of the Own*-
ersof the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives of
the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fome other Merchants concerned, and
all together made me a very handfome Complement
upon the Subject, and a Prefent of almoft two
hundred Pounds Sterling.; r
But after making feveral Reflections upon the
Circumftances of my Life, and how little Way this
would go towards fettling me in the World, I fe-
folv'd to go to Lisbon, and fee it I might not corns
by fome Information of the State of my Plantatioa
in the Wafis, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who 1 had Reafon to fuppofe had fome Years
now giveii me over for dead.
With this View 1 took Shipping for Lisbo^
where I arrived in April following^ my Man Fri*
day accompanying me very honeftly in all thefe
Rambliilgs, and proving a molt faithful Servant
upon all Occafions.
When' I came to Lisbon, I found out, by Enqui-
ry, and to my particular Satisfaftion, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who firft took me up at
Sea, off of the Shore of Africk; He was now
grown
£,332 ]
grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put
•his^Son, who was far from a young Man, into his
Ship-, and who ftill ufed the BrafU Trade. The
bid Man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly
ktit^him^but I foon brought'ftim to my Re-
membrance, and as foon brought my felf to his
Remembrance, when I told him who t wafe.
« After ibme paffionate Expreflions of the old Ac-
Juaintance, I enquired, you may be fare, after my
lantation and my Partner: The old Man told me
he had not been in the Brafds for about nine Years-,
but that he could allure me, that when he came
away, my Partner was Iivitig, but the Truftees,
who 1 had joinM with him to take Cognizance of
ipy Part, were both dead •, that however, he be-
li£v'd that I would have a very good Account of
^Improvement of the Plantation} for that upon
the general Belief of my being caft away and
drown'd, my Truftees had given "in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Prbcurator Fifcal j who had appropriated it, in
<Safe I >never came tb claim it, one Third to the
Kirig, knd two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. Au-
gufiiae, to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor,
and for the Converfion of the Indians to the Ca-
tholick Faith; but that if I appeared, or any ons
for me, to claim the Inheritance, it lhould be re-
ilor'd} only that the Improvement, or annual
Frtidri&ion, being diftributed to charitable Ufes,
could not be reftortl*, but he allured me, that the
* Steward of the King's Revenue (from Lands) and
t&e.Provedidore, or Steward or the Monaftery,
had taken great Care all along, that the Incum-
bent, that is to lay, my Partner, gave every Year
a faithful Account of the Produce, of which they
recpivM duly my Moiety,
I ask'd
I ask'd him if he knew to what Height of Im«
provement he had brought the Plantation? And,
whether he thought it might be worth looking a£
ter } or whether, on my going thither, I fhotild
meet with no Obftru&ion to my poileffing my juft
Right in the Moiety?
He told me, he could not tell exa&ly to what
Degree the Plantation was improved; but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding ricK
upon the enjoying but one Half of it} and that, to
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Part, which was, it feems,
granted away to fbme other Monaftery, or Reli-
gious Houfe, amounted to above two hundred
Moidores a Year ; that as to my being reftofd tqa
quiet Pofleffion of it, there was no Queftion to be
made of that, my Partner being alive to witnefl
my Title, and my Name being alio enrolled in the
Regifler of the Country} alfo he told me, that
the Survivors of my two Truftees, were very fair
honeft People, and very Wealthy \ and he believ'd
1 would not only have their Affiftance for putting
me in Pofleffion, but would find a very confider-
able Sura of Money in their Hands, for my Ac-
count \ being the Produce of the Farm, while their
Fathers held the Truft,and before it wasgivea up
as above, which, as he remembefd, was for about!
twelve Years.
I fhew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy
at this Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain
how it came to pafs, that the Truftees fliould thus
difpofe of my EfFe&s, when he knew that I had
made my Will, and had made him, the Pmupufi
Captain, my univerial Heir, &c. *
He told me, that was true * but that as there
was no Proof of my being dead, he could not a<£
as Executor, until force certain Account fliould
come
Ctottte of rtty Death -7 and that befides, he was not
Willing to intermeddle with a Thing fo remote:
That it was true, he had Regifter'd my Will,
gnd put in his Claims and could he have given
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
have a&ed by Procuration, and taken Pofleffion of
the fagmio (fo they calPd the Sugar-houfe) and
had given his Son, who was now at the Brafils,
Qrd^r to do it.
But, fays the old Man, I have one Piece of
$Jews to tell you, tvjiich, perhaps, may not be fo
acceptable to you as the reft, and that is, That
believing yen were loft, and all the World bdiev*
mg fo alfo, yoyr Partner and Truftees did offer
toaosopipttomeinyourName,, for fix or eight
of the firft Years of Profits, which I received 3
but tfcare being at that Time, fays be, .great Di£
burfeaisnts for increafing the Works, building an
JfogwVy and baying Slaves, it did not amount to
near fo much as afterwards itprodue'd r However^
ijays tteo^id Mao, 1 ihall give you a true Account:
of wiiftt I have received in all* and how 1 have
diffps'd of it, .'
After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the
fix firft Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by
Hiy Partner, and the Merchant's Truftees, being
always delivefd in Goods, viz* Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Moloflus, &c.
which is, t?he Confequjence of a SugaivWirck j and
% fouiad, by .this Arcconnt, that every Xear the In-
foiaae cwfttaably iftcreas'd: But, as, above, the
piStburfeipeM being-large, the Su$< at firft was
frtlaH: However, the old Mm let mae fee, that he
wa&Pebtor to me 470 .Moidores of Gold,<befidcs
tfoGb^fts of Sug#r»'Md 15 doflbie Roils of To-
kcGQ* which* were loft injus Ship ? he having been
ihii-
fhip-wrecked coming Home to Lisbon, about if
Years after my leaving the Place.
The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortunes,, and how he had beenobhg'd to make
"UfeofmyMoney to recover his Lofles, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship : However* my old
Friend* fays he, you (hall not want a Supply in
yoiirlsSeceflity v and as foon as my Son return^
you (hall be fully fatisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out art old Pouch, and gives
me 160 Portugal Moidores inGoldyand giving
me the Wrighting of his Title to the Ship, which
his Son was gone to the Br of Is in, of which ha
was a: Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another*
he puts them both into my Hands for Security of
the reft.
I was two much mov'd with theHonefty and
Rindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear this j
and remembring what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generoufly he
had ufed me on all Occa (Ions, and, particularly*
how* fincer^ a Friend he was now to me, 1 could
hafdly refrain weeping at what he faid to me i
Therefore, firft I-ask'd him, if his Circuraftances
admitted him to fpare fb much Money at that
Tirfte, and if it vvould not ftraiten him? He told
iney he could not lay but it might ftraiten him A
little; but however, it was my Money, and 1
raight want it more than he. \
Every thing the good Man faid was full of A&
fe&ion, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while he fpofce: In iliort, 1 took 100 of the Moi-
dores^ and calFd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for themy then I returned him thereft,and
told hnii^if ever 1 had Pofleflion of the Plantation^
I would return the other to him al£b, as Indeed; I
afterwards did j and that as to the Bill of Sale of
his
c 33<n
bis Part in bis Son's Ship, I would not take it by;
any Means} but that if I wanted the Money,-1
fotind he" Was honeft enough to pay me *, and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me'Rea-
lon to expeft, I would never have a Penny more
from him.
When this'waspafs'd, the old Man began to ask
me, if he (hould put me in a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation? 1 told him, I thought to
go Over to it my felf: He faid, 1 might do fb if I
pleas'd i but that if I did not, there were Ways e-
notigh to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to my Ufe ^ and as there were
Ships in the River of Lisbon,]uR, ready to go away
to Brafil9 he made me enter my Name in apublick
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I Was alive, and that 1 was the fame Perfon
who took up the Land for the Planting the. faid
Plantation at firft.
This being regularly attefted by a Notary, and
a Procuration affix'd,he dire&ed' me to fend it with
a Letter of his Writings to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then proposed my
ftaying with him.'till an Account came of the Re-
turn.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this Procurationj for in lefs than
^eveh Months 1 received a, large Packet from the
•Survivors of my Truftees, theMerchan ts, for whofe
Account I wenttoSea^ in which were the foliow-
injg particular Letters and Papers ,encios'd.
. Firft, There was the Account Current of the
Porduce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year
when their Fat|ers had balanced with my old Porr
tugd Captain, being for fix Years, the Balance
appeared to be 1174 Moidores in my Favour,,
Secondly* •
Secondly, There was the Account of four years
more, while they kept the Effects in their Hands,
before the Government claim'd the Adminiftra-
tion,.as being trre EfFefts of a Perlbn not to be
found, which they call Civil Death; and theBal-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation encrea-
iing,amounted to "Cruifadoes, which made
32,41 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Auguftinh
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above
fourteen Years-, but not being to account for what
was difpos'd to the HofpitaLvery honeftlydeclar'd
he had 872 Moidores not diltributed, which he
acknowledge to my Account; as to the King'-s
Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratula-
ting me very affectionately upon my beihg alive,
giving me an Account how the Eftate was im-
prov'd, and what it produc'd a Year, with a Par-
ticular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it
contain'dj how planted, how many Slaves there
were upon it \ and making two and twenty Crofles
for Bleffings, told me he had faid fo many AveMit-
rta'sto thank the BlefTed Virgin that rwaga live;'
inviting me very paffionately to come over anil
take Poffeffion of my own, and in the mean time
to give him Orders to whom he fhould deliver mV
Effeds, if I did not come my felf-, concluding
wjthahearty Tender of his Friendfhip,*and that
of his. family, and Tent me, as a Prefe'nt, feven'
fine Leopards Skins, which he had, itfeerns;recei-
ved frdm Africk, byTome other Ship which he ha\l
tentthither, and who, it feems, had made a better
Voyage than I: HeTent me alfo five Chefts of ex-
cellent Sweetmeats, and an Hundred Pieces of
Ciold uncoin'd, riot quite fo large as Moidores.
Part I. z
By
f By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant-Truffees
flupp'd me nooChefts ofSugar,8x>RoolsofTo-
bacco,and the reft of the whole Accompt in Gold.
I might well fay now, indeed, That the latter
£rid of Job was better than the Beginning. It is
impoflible to exprefs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I looked over thefe Letters, and efpe-
daily when I found all my Wealth about me j for
as the Brafil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame
-Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods} and the EfFe&s were fafe in the River be-
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word,
I turn'd pale, and grew fick -, and had not the old
Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, 1 believe the
fudden Surprize of Joy ,had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot.
.. Nay, after that I continued ^rery ill, and was ib
iome Hours, /till a Phyfician being fent for, and
ibmething of the real Caufe of my lllnefs being
known,, he ordefd me to be let Blood •, after
which I had Relief, and grew well: But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
in that Manner to the Spirits. I fhould have
dy'd.
I was now Maftef, all oil a fudden, of above
50001. Sterling in Motley, and had an Eftate, as
I might well call it7 in the BrafiU, of above a
ihouland Pounds a Year, as fure as an- Eftate of
Lands in England, And, in a Word, I was in a
Condition \Vhich I fcarCe knew how to underftand,
or how to compofe my felf for the Enjbyment
of it.
The firft Thing] did, was to recommence my
original Benefa&or, my good old Captain, who
fed been firft Charitable to me in itiy Difti*efs,
Kind to me in the Beginning, and Honeft to me at
the End: I fliew'd hifti all that was fent me } I
tol4
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven,
Which difpofes all Thing?, it was owing to him •,
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold: So I firlt returned to
him the hundred Moidores I had received of him,
then I lent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw
up a General Releafe or Difctorge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledged heow'd me,
in the fulleft and firmed manner poffible •, after
which, I caus'd a Procuration to be drawn, im-
poweringhim to be my Receiver of the Annual Pro-
fits of my Plantation, and appointing my Partner
to Accompt to hirfi, and make the Returns by the
nfual Fleets to him in my Name: And a Claufe in
the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, during his Life, out'of the Effe&s,, and 50
Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for his Life:
And thus I requited my old Man.
I was now to confider which Way to fteer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands •, and, in-
deed, I had more Care upon my Head now,^ than,
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
, where 1 wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted: Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fecure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnifh'd before any Body would meddle with it:
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
who to trull with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only
Refuge I had.
In the next'Place, my Intereft in the Brafils
feem'd to fummon me thither 5 but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither, 'till i had
2 z fettled
fettled my Affairs, and left my Effects in fome lafe
Hands behind me. At firft I thought of my'old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honeft, and
would be juft to me •, but then fhe was in Years,
and but poor, and, for ought I knew, might be in
Debt •, fo that, in a Word, I had no Way but to
go back to England my felf, and take my Effects
>vith me.
It was fome Months however before 1 rcfblved
upon this:, and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had
been my former Benefaftor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whofe Husband had been my
firft Benefactor, and fhe,while it was in her Power,
my faithful Steward and Inftru&or. So the firft
Thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to
his Correfpondent in London, not only to pay a
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her Ln her Poverty, by telling
her, fhe fliould, if t liv'd, have a further Supply:
At the fame time I fent my two Sifters in the
Country, each of them an hundred Pounds, they
being, though not in Want, yet not in very good
Circumftances •, one having been mafry'd, arid left
a Widow, and the other having a Husband hot fo
kind to her ashe fhould be.
But among all my Relations or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I'.durft
commit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brafds, and leave Things fife behind
me *, and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the £raftl$y
and have fettled my felf there j for Iwa$, as it
were, naturalized to the Place •, but 1 had f6me lit-
tle Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which in-
fallibly drew me tyck, bf which 1 fhall fay more
prefently,
prefently. However, it was not Religion that
kept me from going there for the prefer}t, and as
I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Re-
ligion of the Country, all the while I was among
them, fo neither did I yet •, only that now and
then having of late thought more of it, (than for-
merly) when I began to think of living and dying
among them, I began to regret my having profefs'd
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the
belt Religion to die with.
But, as I have laid, this was not the main Thing
that kept me from going to the Brafrts; but that
really 1 did not know with whom to leave my Ef-
fects behind me:, fo I refolv'd at laft to go to Eng-
land with it, whereof I arrived, I concluded I fhould
make fome Acquaintance, orfindfome Relations
that would be faithful to me *, and accordingly I
prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare Things for my going Home,I
firft (the Brafil Fleet being juft going away) refblv'd
to give Anfwers fuitabletothe juft and faithful Ac-
count of Things 1 had from thence-, and firft to the
Priorof St. AuguftinA wrote a Letter full of Thanks
for their, juft Dealings, and the Offer of the 872
Moidores, which waslndifpos'd of, which I defir'd
might be given, 500 to the Monaftery, and 372 to
the Poor, as the Prior fhould direct, defiring the
good Padres Prayers for oie, and the like*
I wrote next, a Letter of Thanks to my two
Truftees, with all the Acknowledgment that fo
much Juftice and Plonefty called forj as for fend-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Occafio.11 of it.
.Lafilyy I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging
his Iriduftry in the Improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity inencreaiing the Stock of the Works,
giving him Inftru&jons for hh future Govern-
Z 3 jnent
ment of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he fhould
hear from me more particularly} alluring him, that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my
Life: To this I added a very handfome Prefent of
fome Italian Silks for his Wife and two Daughters,
for fuch the Captain's Son informed me he had •,
with two Pieces of fine £^; Broad-Cloath, the
beft I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and fome. Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus fettled my AfFairs,fold myCargoe,
andtunfd all my Eftefts into good Bills of Ex-
change, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go
to England: I had been accuftom'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going to
England by Sea at that Time •, and though I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreas'd
upon me fo much, that though I had once fhipp'd
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I altered my Mind,
and that not once, but two or three .times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons: But let
no Man flight the ftrong Impulfes of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fiich Moment: Two of the
Ships which I had fingled out /to go in, I mean,
more particularly fingled out thanWy other, that
is to lay, fo as in one of them to put my Things on
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the
Captain/, I fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, viz..
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was ca.fi: away on the Start near Today, and all the
People drown'd except three •, fo that in either of
thofe Veflels I had been made miserable, and in
which molt, it was hard to fay.
Having
Having been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts, my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
prefs'd me'earneftly not to go by Sea; but either
to go by Land to the Groyne, and crofs over the
Bay of Bifcay to Rochell, from whence it was but
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris, and Jo
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and
fo all the Way by Land through France-
In a Word,I was foprepofTefs'dagainft my going
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
I refolv'd to travel all the Way by Land 9 which,
as I was not in Hafte, and did not value the
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Way; and to
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an Fng-
HJl) Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to Travel with me: After which,
we pick'd up two more Englijh Merchants alio, and
two young Fortuguefe Gentlemen, the laft going to
Paris only •, fo that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants \ the two Merchants, and the two
Portuguese contenting themfelves with one Servant
between two, to fave the Charge •, and as for me,
I got an Englljh Sailor to travel with me as a Ser-
vant, befides my Man Friday, who was too much
a Stranger, to be capable of fupplying the Place
of .9 Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I fetout from Lisbon •, and our
Company being all very well mounted and arm'd,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe I was
the oldeft Man, as becaufe I had two Servants,
and, indeed, was the Original of the whole
Journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my Sea
Journals, fol fhall' trouble you now with none of
my Land Journal: But fome Adventures that hap-
Z 4 pen'd
pen'd torn in this tedious and difficult Jotirney, I
muft not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
Strangers to Sp;w,were willing to flay fome Time
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
worth obferving -, but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we haften'd away, and fet out from
Madrid about the Middleof Ottober: But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alaram'd at
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged
to comeback to Pampeluna, after having attempted,
at an extreme Hazard, to pafs on.
When we came to Pampeluna it felf, we found it
fo indeed •, and to me that had been always ufed
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was
infufferable -? nor, indeed,was it more painful than
it was furprizing, to come but ten Days before out
of the Old CaftilcjWhcte the Weather was not only
warm, but very hot \ and immediately to feel a
Wind from the Pyrepean Mountains, fo very keen,
fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable,' and to en-
danger benumbing and periihing. of our Fingers
and Toes-
Vqot.Friday was really frighted when he faw the
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had , never feen or felt before
in his Life. •,
,. To mend.the. Matter, when we came to Pam-
'peluna, it continued Snowing with io much Vio-
lence, and fo long, that the People, ft id, Winter
w^cqme.-befare.its Time, and the Road v&hich
.. vyere.difficult before, were nowq^iteimpaflable *,
for, in aA^prdj: the - Snow lay in ibme Places too
. , thick for us to Travel $ and being not hard frozen,
as
as iq the Cafe in Northern Countries; there was no
going without being in Danger of being bury'd
alive every Step. We ftaid no lefs than twenty
Days at Pampeluna , when (Teeing the Winter com-
ing on, and no likely hood of its being better, for
it was the fevereft Winter all over Europe that had
been known in the Memory of Man) I propofed
that we fhould all go away to Fonterabia, and there
take Shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very
little Voyage.
But while we were confidering this, there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been Hop-
ped on the French fide of the Paftes, as we were on
the Spamjhy had found out a Guide, who traverfing
the Country near the Head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the Mountains by fuch Ways,
that they-were not much incommoded with the
Snow} and where they met with Snow in any
Quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their Horfes.
We Tent for this Guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the fame Way, with no Ha-
zard from the Snow, provided we were arm'd fuf-
ficiently to protect us from wild Beafts -7 for, he
faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent for
fome Wolves to (how themfelves at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for want of
Food, the* Ground being covered with Snow : We
told him we were well enough prepared for fuch
Creatures as they were,if he would enfureu^ from
a Kind of two legged Wolves, which we were told
we were in molt Danger from, efpecially on the
French Side of the Mountains.
He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that Kind
in the way th^t we were to go: So we readily a-
greed to follow him, as did alfo twelve other Gen-
tlemen,
tlemen, with their Servants, fome French, fome
Spamjh, who, as I faid, had attempted to go, gnd
were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly weal] fetout for Pampelun^, with
bur Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, 1 was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for-
ward, he came dire&ly back with us, on the fame
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles *, when, being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found our felve$ in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-
fant, and no Snow to be feen; but on a fudden,
turning to the Left, he approached the Mountains
another Way •, and though it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many
Tours, fuch Meanders, and led us by fuch wind-
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without ffeing much
incumbered with the Snow; and all on a fudden
he fhew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan-
guedoc and Gafcoign, all green and flourilhing^ tho'
indeed it was at a great Diftance, and we had fome
rough Way topafs yet.
We?were alittleuneafy however,when we found
it fnow'd one whole Day, and at Night, fo faft,
that we could not travel-, but he bid us be eafy,
we ihould foon be paft it all: We found, indeed',
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before; and fo depending upon
our Quids, we went on
It was about two Hours before Night, when
our .Guide being fomething before us, and not juft
in Sight, out ruflfd three monftrous Wolves, aqd
after fh$m a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adj&yn-
ing to a thick Wood j two of the Wolves flew bp-
4 on the Guide, and had he been half 3 Mile before
us, he Jiad l^en devftur'd'indeed, before we could
have
have help'd him: One of them faften'd upon his
Horfe, and the other attacked the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Prefence
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollowed
and cryM out to us mod luftily; my Man Friday
being next to me, 1 bid him ride up, and fee what
was the Matter: As foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma-
fier! 0 Mafier! But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
reftly up to the poor Man, and with his Piftol
{hot the Wolf that attacked him into the Head.
It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday, for he having been ufed to that kind
of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him; but went clofe up to him, and fhot him, as
above -, whereas any of us would have fir'd at a
farther Pittance, and have perhaps either mifs'd
the Wolf, or endangered (hooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I,and indeed it alanrfd all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Friday's Piftol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Eccho of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them ; and perhaps
indeed, there was not fuch a few, as that we had
no Caufe of Apprehenfions.
However, as Friday had killed this Wolf, the o-
ther, that hadfaften'd upon the Horfe,]eft him im-
mediately, and fled, having happily faften'd upon
his Head, where the BofTes of the Bridle had ftuck
'in his Teeth, fo that he had not done him much
Hurt • The Man, indeed, was molt hurt} for the
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Armf, and the other Time a little above his Knee-
and he was juft as it were tumbling £own by the
Difbrder
DHbrder of his Horfe, when Friday came up and
fhot the Wolf. :/ l
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri-
day's Piftol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as
fait as the Way (which was very difficult) would
give us Leave, to fee what was the Matter •, as foon
as we came clear of the Trees, which bliuded us
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe,
and how Friday had difengaged the poor Guide -,
though we did not prefently difcern what Kind of
Creature it was he had killed.
But never was a Fight manag'd fb hardily, and
in fuch a furprizing Manner,as that which followed
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at firft we were furpriz'd and afraid for
him) the greatefl; Diverfion imaginable. As the
Bear is a heavy, clumfey Creature, and does not
gallop as the Wolf does, who is fwift and light;
ib he has two particular Qualities, which generally
are the Rule of his Anions \ Firfi, As to Men, who
are not his proper Prey, I fay, not his proper Prey,
becaufe,tho' I can't fay what exceflive hunger might
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being
all covered with Snow:, but as to Men, he does not
ufually atte.mpAthem,unlefs they firfl; attack him:
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if
you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with
you; but then you mult take care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road, for he is a very
nice Gentleman, he won't go a ftep out of his Way
for a Prince*, nay, if you are really afraid, your
beft way is to look another Way, and keep going
on; for fometimes, if you flop, andftand ftill, and
look ftedfaftly at him,he takes it for an Affront-, b&t
if you throw or tofs any thing at him, and it hits
Mm, though it were but 3. Bit of a Stick as big as
• your Finger, he takes it for an Affront., and fets all
his
his other Bufinefs afide to purfue his Revenge,
for he will have Satisfa&ion in Point of Honour,
that is his firft Quality :^ The next is, That if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you, Night
or Day, till he has his Revenge, but follows at
a good round Rate, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had delivered our Guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horfe, for the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firft;
when on the fudden, we fpy'd the Bear come out
of the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was,
the biggeft by far that ever I few. We were all a
little furprized when we faw him,but when Friday
faw him, it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the
Fellow's Countenance :0! 0 ! 0! iays Fridayfhree
Times pointing to him, 0 Mafter I Tou give me to
Leave, mefoakee to Hand with him$ me make you good,
laugh*
1 was furpriz'd to fee the Fellow fb pleased ; You,
Fool you j fays 1, he will eat you up: Eatee me up! Eatee
me up! fays Friday ^ twice over again; Me eatee
him up: Me make you good Laugh: Tou all flay here,
me jhow you good Laugh: So down he fits, and gets
his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair of
Pumps, (as we call the fist Shoes they wear) and
which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Ser-
vant his Horfe, and, with his Gun, away he flew,
fwift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking foftly on, and offer'd to
meddle with no Body, till Friday comingpretty
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could underftand
him } Hark ye, harkye; fays Friday 7 me fpeahee wit
you: We followed at a Difhnce • for now being
come down on the Gafcoign Side of the Mountains,
we were entered a vaft great Fojeft, where the
Country was plain, and pretty, open, thtf many
Trees in it fcatter'd here and there. Friday
.{ 3$° :]
Friday, who had, as we fay, the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
Stone and throws at him, and hit him juft on the
Head; but did him no more Harm, than if he had
thrown it againft a Wall 5 but it anfwer'd Friday's
End •, for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and
fhow us fome Laugh, as he calfd it.
As foon as the Bear felt the Stone,and fawhim,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking devi-
Jifh long Strides, and fhuflling along at a ftrange
Rate, fo as would put a Horfe to a middling Gal-
lop*, away runs Friday, and takes his Courfe, as if
he run towards us for Help -, fo we all refolved to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man 5
tho51 was angry at liim heartily for bringing the
Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Bufinefs another Way •, and efpecially I
was angry thathe had turn'd the Bear upon us, and
then runaway-, and I call'dout, Tou Dog;, fa id I,
is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your
Horfe, that we mayjhoot the Creature • he hears me,
and cries out, No Jhoot, no flwot, ftand ft ill, you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Beaft's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on
one Side of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for
,his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and dou-
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying
hisGuti down upon the Ground, at about five or
fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree*
The Bear ibon caaie to the Tree, and we fol-
lowed at a Diftance \ the firft Thing he did, he
ftopp'd at the Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lie, and
up he fcramblesinto the Tree, climbing like a Cat,
tho' fo monftroufly heavy: I was amazed at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and co.uld not
for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till fee-
ing
C350
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode nearer
to him.
When we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about half Way to him;
as foon as the Bear got out to that Part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, lays he to us,
now you fee me teachee the Bear dance \ fb he falls a
jumping and fhaking the Bough, at which the Bear
began to totter, but ftood ftill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back j then
indeed we did laugh heartily: But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal} when he fees him
Hand ftill, he calls out to him again, as if he had
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak English •, What, you
no come farther? Pray you come farther } fb he left
jumping and fhaking the Bough} and the Bear, juft
as if he had understood what he faid, did come $
little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and
the Bear ftopp'd again.
We thought now was a good Timetoknock him
on the Head, and I call'd to Friday to ftand ftill,
and \ye would (hoot the Bear \ but he cry'd out
earneftly, O fray I 0 fray! nojhoot7 me Jhoot by and
then -0 he would have faid, by and by. However, to
fhorten the Story, Friday danc'd fb much, and
the Bear ftood fo ticklilh, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what
the Fellow would do j for firft we thought he de-
pended upon fhaking the Bear off-, and we found
the Bear was too cunning for that too ^ for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fa ft with his great broad Claws and
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be
 «t bit.
But
But Friday put us out of Doubt quickly, for
feeing the Bear cling fall to the Bougfi, and that
he Would not be perfwaded to come any farther ^
Well, well, fays Friday, you no come farther, me goi
me go \ you no come to me, me come to you\ and upon
this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the Bough,
where it would bend with his Weight, and gently
lets himfelf down by it, Aiding down the Bough,
till he Came near enough to jumpdown on his Feet,
and away he run to his Gun, takes it up, and
ftandsftill. ,
Well, faid I to him, Friday, What will you do
now? Why don't you fhoot him? No fhoot, fays
Friday, no yet, me fhoot now, me no kill^ meftay,gtve
you one more Laugh: And indeed fo he did, as you
will fee pvefently; for when the Bear fee his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
flood-, but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
hira every Step, and coming backward till he
got into the Body of the Tree; then with the-
iame hinder End foremoft, he came down the
Tree, grafping it with his Claws, and moving
one Foot at a Time, very leifurely j at this Jim-
&tire, and juft before he could fet his hind Feet
upon the Ground, Friday ftepp'd clofe to him,
clappM the Muzzel of his Piece into his Ear, and
Jhot him dead as a Stone.
Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did
not laugh, and when he fayv ,we were pleas-d by
our Looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very loud \
So we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday, fo you
kill them, lays 1, why you have no Guns: No,
lays he, no Gun, but fhoot great much long Arrow.
This was, indeed, a good Diver Con to us:, but:
we wereftill in a wild.Place, and our Guide very
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; the
• Howling of Wolves run much in my Head j and in-
deed
deed, except the Noife I once heard on the Shore
of Africa, of which I have faid fomething already,
I never heard anything that fill'd me with fo much
Horror.
Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have "had us,
we fhould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monftrous Creature off, which was worth faving:
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
haften'd us, fo we left him, and went forward on
our Journey.
The Ground was Hill cover'd wit(h Snow, tho'
not fo deep and dangerous as on the Mountains,
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard after-
terwards, were come down into the Forreft and
plain Country, prefs'd by Hunger to feek for Food;
and had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Vil-
lages, Where they furpriz'd the Country People,
kill'd a great many of their Sheep and Horfes,
and fbme People too.
We had one dangerous Place to pafs, which our
Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves
in the Country, we (hould find them there; and
this was in a fmall Plain, furrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,
which we were to pafs to get through the Wood,
and then we fhould come to the Village where we
were to Lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we
enter'd the firft Wood ^ and a little after Sun-fet,
when we came into the Plain, we met with no-
thing in the firft Wood, except that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we few five great Wolves crofs the
Road, full .Speed one after another, as if they had
been in Chafe of fome Prey, and had it in View,
Part I. A a they
t m -3
they took wHbtid, ©F iVs; ahd wete ^oii^'and
out of,our Sight in a! fW Mtofttente.

r$$dy Foffcure i for he believ'd theire1 were tfiOre
Wolves a coming.
We kept out Arms ready, and Our Ey esv abqtoftfs,
but We faw no more Wolves, 'till we carte 'thfo'
that Wood, which was near half a League, anff en-
ter'd the Plain •, as foon as we came into the Pfeih,
we had Occafion enough to look about u£ \ The
ftrft Objed we met with ; was a de&d Bfytft \
that is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolyes
had kiirdj and at leaft a Dozen of them at Woffc ^
we could not fay eating of him, but pickirijg ofhis
Bones rather \ for they had eaten up all th^Flpth
before.
r We did not think fit to difturb them at their
IFe&ffc, neither did they take much Notice pf
us: Friday would have let fly at them/ buft I
would not fuffer him by«ny Means; for I found
we ?wete like to have more Bufinefs upon our
Hsncjs th&n we were aware of. We were not
gone half over the Plain, but we began to he^r the
Wolves houl in the Wood on our Left, in a fright-
ful Manner, and prefently after we faw about a
hundred coming on dire&ly towards us, all in, a
Body, and raoft of them in a Line, as regularly as
©n Artny drawn up by experienc'd Officers. I
icarce knew in what Manner to receive th£m ^
but; fbund to draw our felves in a clofe Line Was
theonly way: So we fornfd in a Morfient: But
that we might not have too much Interval, I or-

was a;raot;e furious Charge.than the.Creatures
nj5dd'a^Q^\u^ntKis.pl^ce \ they came on us with
a growimgkind of a noife and mounted the Piece
of Tirpber, (whichas I laid, was our Breaft-Work,)
as if they were only rufhing upon their Prey -7 and
thi$ pury of theirs, it feems, was principally occa-
iion*d by their feeing our Horfes behind us, which
was the Prey they aimed at: I order'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man} and they took
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kill'd feveral
of the V^olves at the firft Volley \ but there was
a iSJecefllty to keep a continual Firings for they
canle on like Devils, thofe bel)ind? pufhing on"
thole before* -
'When we had fir'd our fecond. Volley, of our
Fuzees? we thought they flopped a little, and I
hoped they would have gone off*, but it wgs hut
a Moment"; for others came forward again j fo
we firfed two Volleys of our Piftols, and I believe
in thefefour Firings, we kill'd feventeen or eigh-
teen of them, and lamed twice as many } yet they
came oji again.
I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haftily; fo
I calPd my Servant, not my Man Friday7 for he was
better employ'd^ for with the greateft Dexterity
imaginable, he, had charged my Fuzee, and his
own, while we were engaged, but as 1 faid, I caU'd
my other Mart, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
I bad ;him lay a Train, all along the Piece of Tim-
ber, and lptit be a large Train *7 he did fo, and hacl
but juft Time togetaway,when the Wolvescame

Upon which I order'd outlaft Piftols to be fiiM

upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and(weTaT-
Ty'd immediately upon near twenty lame pneV?
who we found ftrugling on the Ground, and
fella cutting them with our Swords, which an-
fw^i'd our Expectation ^for the Crying and fowl-
ing they made was better uhderftood by their Fel-
lows, fb that they all fled and left us. '' '/l
Weljad,firfl:^nd laft, kiil'd about thretfebrt
of, them; and had it been Day-light, we had
ItilFd many more: The Field of Battle being thus
.cleard, we made forward^again ; for we Ka4 ftill
Hear a League to go. We heard the ravenous
Creatures houl and yell in the Woods as we went,
Jeveral titnes*, and fometimss we fancy'ft we faw
4ome of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes,
;%ye were not certain •, lb in about an Ho\ir more,
K We came to the Town, where we were to lodge,
v Which wq found in a terrible Fright-, and all in
Xrms; foritleems, that the Night before, t;he
Wolves and fbme Bears had broke into the Vil-
lage, and put them in a tenible Fright; and they
Were obliged to keep Guard Night and Day, but
efpecially in the Night, to prefeive their Cattle,
and indeed their People.
The nextMotningour Guide was foil], and his
Limbs fwell'd with theranklingof His two Wouqds,
that he could go no farther *, fo we were oblig'd to
take
takjS a~r,ejy pjfidethe^e, andj*o to Tlidoufe, where

gre^Fofertat the Foot; of the Mountains, ffpeci-
atly)fwhen»the Snow lay,on the Ground. But they
enquired much what kfnd of a Guide we had got-
ten, that would venture to bring us that Way in
iuch a fevcre Seafbn •, and told us, it ^yas very much
we^wereuot all devonr'd. When we told them how
we plac'd our felves, and the Horfes in the middle^
they blam'd us exceedinglv,and told us it was fifty
Co one but we had been all deftroy'd; for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fb fu-
rious, feeing their Prey \ and that at other Times
they ate really afraid of a Gun \ but they being ex-
cefliye hungry, and raging on that Account, the
.Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them
iepfelefs of Danger •, and that if we had not By tlte
xontkiifdFire, and at laft by the Stratagem df the
^M'nofpbwder,mafter'd them, it had been great
0ddsbut thatwe had been torn to pieces-, where-
as had \#e been content to have fat ftill on Horfes
back, and fitM as Horfemen, they would not have
'taken the Horfes fomuch for their own whenMen
were on'their Back, a$ otherwife -, and withal they
told us, that at laft, if we had ftobd all together,
and left our Horfes, they would have been fo eager
to have devoured them, that they might have come
ofFfefe, efpecially having our Fire Arms in our
Hands, and being fo many in Number.
For my Part, 1 was never ib fenfible of Danger
in my Life} for feeing above threp hundred Devils
come roaring and open-mouth'd to devour us, and
have nothing* to fhelter us, or retreat to, I gave
^y fejf over foy loft ^ and £$ it was, I believe, I

I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in
my Pafiage through France -7 nothing but what o*
ther Travellers have given an Account of, with
much more Advantage than I can. I travelled* from
Thouloufe to Paris, and without any confiderahle
Stay, came to Calais, and landed fafe at Dover, the
fourteenth of "January, after having had a fevere
cold Seaibn to travel in. »
I was now come to the Center of my Travels,
and had in a little Time all my new difcover'd fi-
xate fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
brought with me having been currently paid.
My principal Guide, and Privy-Counfellor, was
my good Ancient \Vidow, who in Gratitude for
the Money I had fedt her, thought no Pains too
much, or Care too great, to employ for me •, and I
trufted her fo entirely with every Thing, that I
wasperfe&ly eafy as to the Security of my Effe&sj
and indeed I was very happy from my Beginning,
and now to the End, in the unfpotted Integrity
of this good Gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my EfFefts
with this Woman, and fetting out for Lisbon, and
fo to the Brafds; but now another Scruple came in
my Way, and that was Religion •, for as I had en-
tertain'd ibme Doubts about the Roman Religion,
even while,I was abroad, efpecially in my State of
Solitude } fo I knew theie was no going to the Bra-
fils for me, much lefs going to fettle there, nnlefs I
refolv'd to embrace the jfa/wwCatholick Religion,
without any Refervejj unlefson the other hand, I
refolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Piinciples, be a
Martyr for Religion, and die in the inquilition}ib

I refolv'd to <ftay^ at; Homer and if I could find
Means Aov m> m iifpofe of my Plantation.
. % this $>urpofe 1 wrote to my old Friend at
Lisbon, who in Return gave me Notice, that he
could eafrlyiddfpole of it there: But that* if I
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my
iName .to*the two Merchants, the Survivors of my
.Tnifteeswho liv'd in the Brafils, who mult fully
ttoderfland the Value of it, who liv'd juft upon the
SpQt, and who I knew were very rich, fo that he
believ'd they would be fond of buying it ^ he did
not doubt, but I fho.uld make 4 or 5000 Pieces of
.Eight the more of it.
*• i\ Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer
It!to them, and he did fo; and in about 8 Months
more, the Ship being then returned, he lent me an
Account, that they.had accepted' the Offer, and
had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor-
arefpondent of theirs at Lisbon? to pay for it
'In Return, I fign'd the inftrument of Sale in the
Form which they fent from Lisbon? and fent it to
MS old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for
,.g28000iPieces of Eight to me, for the Eftate j re*
ferving, the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, the old Man, during his Life, and 50 Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son.for his Life, which I
had promifed them, which the- Plantation was-to
make good at a Rent-Charge. And thus I have
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad-
venture^ a Life of Providence's Chequer-Work,
and of a Variety which the World will feldom be
able to (hew the like of: Beginning foolifhly, but
doling much more happily than any Part of it ever
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for.
