THE AUTHOR OF " ROBINSON CRUSOE" 

BY EDITH WYATT 

If one were asked to name offhand the story-book hero 
most widely known among English-speaking people, one 
would undoubtedly choose at a guess the vivid figure of 
Robinson Crusoe. 

His fame scarcely differs from that of a celebrity not 
fictional at all, but historical. Many persons who have 
never glanced at the book describing his adventures under- 
stand quite as concretely and definitely as they understand 
that George Washington spent a winter at Valley Forge, 
that Robinson Crusoe owned a gun, a parrot, and a dog; 
that he was cast upon a desert island; and that he found 
there a strange footprint in the sand. 

"Who conceived an image of such enduring charm? "Who 
created Crusoe? For long I had vaguely supposed that the 
life of Daniel De Foe, the author of our most celebrated 
fictive hero, was a subject like that of the Wars of the 
Roses, or all the shipping insurance news in small print 
on the back page of the newspapers — one of those very well- 
known and complicated topics which always appear to be 
made simply for other people to know about. When an ac- 
cidental circumstance I will describe presently inspired me 
to face the chilling fog of special information I feared, and 
to hunt up De Foe's name, in the library, it was a surprise 
to find that the tale of De Foe's life, after all, apparently 
required no wide, allied, historical reading for its compre- 
hension, but had been, it would seem, composed by fate for 
the understanding of any layman. 1 

De Foe was the son of a family of Dissenters: his father, 

1 Mr. Walter Wilson's, thick, old-fashioned biography, Mr. George Saints- 
bury's monograph, and his various delightful prefaces for Aitken's edition 
of the novels of De Foe, a sketch of Mrs. Oliphant's, the pages of Greene's 
Puritan England, the appreciations by Sir Walter Scott and Charles 
Lamb, and De Foe's own personal references in various pamphlets of his, 
are the chief sources of the account gathered here. 



88 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

a butcher, at Cripplegate in London. Daniel was a little 
child of about four, when the city was overwhelmed with 
the horror of the Great Plague of 1665 ; and the pestilence 
pouring through London, one of the most Titanic catas- 
trophes of history was killing people in the streets, literal- 
ly by myriads — ten thousand, in a week, four thousand, in 
one terrific night. 

It was under these circumstances that the De Foes left 
London, in the reign of Charles II, at the very time when 
Pepys was being importuned by his wife to buy her a pearl 
necklace, and when he says of the government of the Merry 
Monarch: " At court, there being so much emulation, and 
the vices of drinking . . . and loose amours that I know 
not what will be the end of it but confusion : and the clergy 
so high that all people I meet with do protest against their 
practice. ' ' 

The bigotry and partisanship of these Episcopal and 
Tory churchmen of the ruling powers against the Dissenters 
were becoming so extreme, that only a few years later it was 
not safe for a Dissenting or as we should say a Presbyterian 
minister to be seen in the streets of London: and their re- 
ligious meetings were held at night, like conspiracies. While 
De Foe was still a boy, the great Test Act was passed by the 
Houses of Parliament. This excluded from all civil offices, 
that is to say from all governmental honors, and all posi- 
tions of any considerable standing or power, those who 
would not become communicants of the Church of England. 
So that, in sending De Foe to be educated at a Dissenting 
xlcademy, his family destined him to a career of social ad- 
venture. 

Apparently, from Mr. Morton's Dissenting Academy, the 
boy entered into trade at eighteen as a commission agent for 
a hosiery house in Cornhill. He seems to have published at 
about this time a rather dull pamphlet on the gowns of the 
clergy. 1 From his range, volume, and genius De Foe was 
to become the most brilliant and influential pamphleteer 
England, or perhaps the world has ever known. Of his one 
hundred and ninety productions in this kind, however, he 
wrote nothing of value, until he was thirty-five or thirty-six 
years of age. and the seven pamphlets he composed before 
then may be left unnoticed. 

1 There is some, but very little doubt, as to whether this pamphlet may 
be certainly attributed to De Foe. 



THE AUTHOR OF " ROBINSON CRUSOE " 89 

In the mean time, when De Foe was about twenty-five, 
Charles II died, surrounded on his death-bed by all his un- 
married wives and mistresses, and all his natural children 
but one, his eldest son, the Duke of Monmouth. A few days 
after the Roman Catholic, James II, came to the throne, 
the Protestant Monmouth, landed at Lyme to support his 
right of succession : and here De Foe, in company with great 
numbers of other Nonconformists and Dissenting tradesmen 
from the clothier towns hastened to his standard. 

Monmouth's popularity rose. Garlands were hung on the 
doors where he passed. ' ' At Taunton a troop of young girls 
presented him with a flag and a Bible. ' ' His army received 
constant accession. But it was too untried to withstand 
the great force of James 's followers which faced it at Sedge- 
moor. De Foe and his companions were now to see King 
James's victory, and the beheading of their own leader fol- 
lowed by a bigoted persecution hard and senseless enough 
to outrage even the ruthless Marlborough who was forced 
to execute it. 

Over a thousand Dissenters were scourged and im- 
prisoned. Women were whipped from town to town. Eight 
hundred Nonconformists were sold into slavery across the 
sea. Judge Jeffreys passing through the country in the 
famous " bloody circuit " condemned and hung three hun- 
dred and fifty Englishmen. Three of these men had been 
De Foe's classmates at Mr. Morton's Dissenting Academy. 
De Foe himself chanced to be released on the singular 
ground that he was not a resident of the west of England, 
but had come there from London. 

Through the miseries and persecutions of the six years' 
reign of James II, De Foe was chiefly occupied by his 
mercantile trade. He became an important figure in the 
market at Cornhill and owner or part owner of the hosiery 
house. At the time when Parliament voted the expulsion of 
James he had been married some time, though we know 
little of his marriage, except that he had several children, 
of whom he wrote afterward that he loved them past his 
power to express. 

At the time of the coronation of William and Mary, he 
rode with an escort of the richest tradesmen of London. 

However, his affairs must even then have begun to go 
wrong, for in 1692 he failed for what was then the very 
large mercantile investment of £17,000. He made a com- 



90 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

position with his creditors, gave what he could on his debts, 
and afterward is said to have paid every cent of his obliga- 
tion. 

It was at this time of his fallen fortunes that he wrote, 
though he did not publish till two years afterward, The 
Essay on Projects of which Benjamin Franklin said that its 
opinions had influenced the chief events of his life. 

The essay outlines for the better guidance of the affairs 
of the country a number of policies of such foresight that 
nearly all of them have since come to form a part of the 
customs of England — a scheme for a National Bank, for 
Road Improvements, for a bankruptcy Commission, Aid and 
Benefit societies, for raising Internal Revenue, and for an 
institution for the education of women. 

But the chief interest of the Essay on Projects is its ex- 
hibition of De Foe 's constant clear curiosity about the man- 
agement of life and what Samuel Butler calls the Ways 
and Farings of Men. To be forming a plan — and an ad- 
mirable plan for establishing a bank for his country at a 
moment when he chanced to be £17,000 in debt — here was a 
spirit of no common strength. 

The Essay on Projects was, even before its publication, 
the source of a change in De Foe's prospects. An acquaint- 
ance brought to the attention of William III, De Foe's in- 
ternal-revenue scheme. This was in part adopted, and 
in the furtherance of the plan De Foe was made the govern- 
ment accountant for the tax on the glass industry. Partly 
through the prestige his occupation gave him, he formed a 
company for manufacturing the tiles the country had here- 
tofore imported from Holland, and became the manager of 
this company which was established on the Thames at Toot- 
ing. Here he lived in good style and kept a coach and a 
pleasure-boat. 

When it is said that among the nine or ten pamphlets 
issued by De Foe within the next few years, one was a 
commentary on the government's protection of vice among 
persons with means — what we should call police protection 
— and one an attack on the bribery, stock- jobbing, and cor- 
ruption prevailing in the disposal of seats in Parliament, 
it will be seen that exposure by means of special articles 
published in an inexpensive form is by no means a recent 
invention. 

One of these stock-jobbing Parliaments, in 1701, refused 



THE AUTHOR OF " ROBINSON CRUSOE " 91 

to consider King William's request for subsidies for that 
continental campaign against the horrors of the Inquisition, 
which was certainly then what no military campaign can 
be now, a part of the liberation war of humanity. One 
thousand freeholders and electors of Kent sent to the 
House of Commons, through five representatives, a signed 
petition asking the House to hear and pass upon the meas- 
ure. The five Kentish petitioners' request was denied by 
the House: their petition voted scandalous, insolent, and 
seditious, and they were cast into prison. Eight days later, 
as Robert Harley the Speaker was entering the House of 
Commons, De Foe, guarded by sixteen gentlemen, handed 
him a letter headed with this note: " Mr. Speaker: The 
enclosed memorial you are charged with in behalf of many 
thousands of the good people of England. . . . You are 
commanded by 200,000 Englishmen to deliver it to the House 
of Commons." 

The inclosure was De Foe's famous Legion Letter. It 
demanded the release of the petitioners and the hearing of 
their petition; and stated the grievances of the nation at 
the hands of the present Parliament, and the legal rights 
of the electors to control their representatives. 

It concludes eloquently: 

'' Thus, gentlemen, you have your duty laid before you, which 'tis 
hoped you will think of; but if you continue to neglect it, you may expect 
to be treated according to the resentment of an injured nation. For 
Englishmen are no more to be slaves to parliaments than to kings. 

" Our name is Legion and we are many. 

" Postscript. If you require to have this Memorial signed with our 
Names, it shall be done on your first order, and personally presented." 

Wilson says : 

" The Paper struck such a terror into the party in the house that 
from this time there was not a word ever spoken of proceeding against 
the Kentish Petitioners, and the members of that party began to drop 
off and to get into the country." 

When Parliament adjourned a few weeks later, the Kentish 
gentlemen were released; and the succeeding Parliament 
considered and indorsed the grant of subsidies for the King. 

De Foe's yeoman service to his party in all this, brought 
liim back much of the favor he had lost by a pamphlet on 
the Test Act written two years before — a pamphlet now 
destined to have in connection with his next considerable 
piece of public work a very strange effect upon his future 
history. 



92 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

Since the time when Dissenters had been excluded from 
all government offices unless they took the Sacrament of the 
Episcopal Church, or were fined for breaking the law, many 
had evaded the stringency of the act by assuming gov- 
ernment office, and fulfilling the provisions of the ordinance 
by an occasional attendance at Episcopal churches for re- 
ceiving Communion. This practice was called Occasional 
Conformity. As the good feeling between Episcopalians 
and Dissenters increased in William's reign. Occasional Con- 
formity became more frequent, and Dissenters more and 
more pbarisaical and complacent in their assent to a rite 
in which they had no faith. De Foe who seems, in holding 
his own office, always to have stoutly paid his fine, and 
never to have asserted a belief not his, criticized adversely 
his party's and sect's increasing custom in an essay which 
roused wide indignation throughout England. 

Four years afterward, when King William died, and his 
sister-in-law Anne, a strong though not a bigoted Episco- 
palian came to the throne, her coronation roused the Tory 
party and the Established Church to introduce in Parlia- 
ment a bill excluding Dissenters from all participation in 
the government of England upon any terms. It was called 
the bill against Occasional Conformity; and, naturally, 
caused a party struggle of the fiercest virulence. 

At this moment De Foe struck the bill a body blow by a 
highly original device. This was an anonymous pamphlet, 
purporting to be written by an Episcopalian : and is an iron- 
ical though well-merited statement of the High Church posi- 
tion. It is called ' ' The Shortest Way with the Dissenters. ' ' 

" Shall any law be given to such wild creatures (as these Dissenters) ? 
Some beasts are for sport, and the huntsmen give them the advantages of 
ground : but some are knocked on the head by all possible means of 
violence and surprise. ... If one severe law were made and punctually 
executed, that whoever was found at a Conventicle should be banished the 
Nation, and the preacher hanged we should soon see an end of the tale." 

As De Foe afterward tells us : " The case the book pointed 
at was to speak the first person of the party and then there- 
by not only speak their language but acknowledge it to be 
theirs: which they did so openly that confounded all their 
attempts afterward to deny it, and to call it a scandal thrown 
upon them by another." 

This is exactly what happened. The High Church party 
applauded with delight and entire gravity the arguments 



THE AUTHOR OF "ROBINSON CRUSOE" 93 

and plans of " The Shortest Way." One of the Tory 
leaders wrote : " Next to the Holy Bible and the Sacred Com- 
ments I take it for the most valuable piece I have." The 
more moderate of the High Church party were, however, 
so shocked at the unfairness of spirit on their own side 
the pamphlet had revealed and proven, that they would not 
push the Bill against Occasional Conformity. It was de- 
feated in the House of Lords. 

The world is very literal-minded. Not only the Tories, 
but the Dissenters misunderstood " The Shortest Way." 
They were raising a great hue and cry against the anony- 
mous Episcopalian author, when it became known that he 
was a Dissenter, that he was Daniel De Foe. At this both 
parties turned the more furiously against him. De Foe 
was proclaimed an enemy of the State who had stirred up 
sedition. A reward of £50 was offered for his arrest. 

The government proclamation and advertisement gives 
us the clearest description we have of his appearance, that 
of " a middle-aged, spare man about forty years old, of 
a brown complexion and dark-brown colored hair (but wears 
a wig), a hooked nose, a sharp chin, gray eyes, and a large 
mole near his mouth." 

Upon his arrest he received an unfair trial with treacher- 
ous counsel. He was sentenced to pay 200 marks to the 
Queen, to stand three times in the pillory, and to be im- 
prisoned during the Queen's pleasure. The moderate Har 
ley was out of power. William Perm appeared before the 
House of Commons to plead in vain for a commutation of 
this mean and brutal sentence. 

De Foe was pilloried on July 29th in 1703 at Temple Bar : 
during the next day at Cheapside, near the place where he 
had once ridden so proudly with the escort of William and 
Mary: and through the 31st at Cornhill, where he had once 
been an owner of one of the richest textile houses in the 
trade of London. On each occasion, admiring and cheering 
crowds guarded him to and from his punishment as though 
it had been a position of state. They hung the pillory with 
garlands: and placed tables in the streets, where they sat 
drinking his health and singing the satirical " Hymn to the 
Pillory ' ' which De Foe had composed in Newgate : and was 
now cried and sold from the sidewalks of Cheapside, Corn- 
hill, and Temple Bar. 

Inspiring is defiance in the face of squalid adversities. 



94 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

Undoubtedly it was the sheer pluck of De Foe's character 
that stirred popular enthusiasm. Probably only a very few 
persons in the cheering throngs understood that De Foe was 
pilloried because while he had ridiculed the Dissenters for 
their conformity when this had been a mere demoralizing 
hypocrisy among them, he now opposed the Episcopalian's 
effort against this same conformity of the Dissenters, be- 
cause the Episcopalians ' effort was the expression of a hate- 
ful bigotry and tyranny. 

De Foe remained in Newgate for two years. In this space 
of time, on account of his absence from his tile-factory he 
became again a ruined man. His family fell into poverty. 
He occupied his hours in prison by an unlucrative but ab- 
sorbing undertaking. From the walls of Newgate he sent 
out by his devoted printer, at first once a week, and then 
three times a week, a periodical called The Review. This 
sheet presented at regular intervals for the first time in the 
print of our language public and domestic topics of general 
interest. It is impossible to say whether one feels more 
glory or more shame for journalism in the fact that our first 
newspaper was written and edited by a man imprisoned in 
the interest of a just testimony to truth. 

In the following year, Harley again came into power in 
Parliament : and at once released De Foe, and found govern- 
ment employment for him as an agent in the negotiation of 
the Union with Scotland. 

Now for more than ten years De Foe was engaged in 
serving the government in this capacity, in publishing his 
Review and in pamphleteering. In a fairly short time after 
his release he had again repaired his fallen fortunes. 

But it must not be thought his prosperity was peaceful. 
This, a writer of De Foe's temper of mind, a follower of 
truth irrespective of party, and a discusser on these terms 
of the affairs and politics of his time, could hardly have ex- 
pected or perhaps desired in a world whose standard of 
ionor was even more than to-day simply a standard of con- 
tinuous and undiscriminating partisanship. 

Says Windsor: 

" Though a Protestant, when the bill for preventing the growth of 
Popery in Ireland had been forced upon the Queen, De Foe took part 
with the Roman Catholics against the bigotry of Protestantism. Though 
a friend of Godolphin he was always regarded with esteem by Harley. 
Though a friend of Harley he refused to support him on the subject of 
Peace." 



THE AUTHOE OF " ROBINSON CRUSOE " 95 

This is no road to popularity. De Foe had bitter enemies 
in all the political camps. At the time of Anne's death, De 
Foe was so surrounded by controversial and slanderous 
attacks — one of these last made by no less a person than 
Alexander Pope — that on his retirement from office in 1715, 
he published a pamphlet entitled " An Appeal to Honour 
and Justice," explaining his public stand on all the policies 
and sects he had defended and those he had opposed. 

We have said that he retired from his open connection 
with the government, on Queen Anne's death. But not long 
afterward he began and continued for many years a secret 
service of the most singular character for the Crown. The 
successive ministers of George I privately paid him for con- 
tributing to and partly owning, first one Jacobite newspaper, 
and later as many as three of these Tory journals, on a 
secret understanding of his with the administration that he 
would as he says " take the sting out of them." 

Much controversy has surrounded the ethics of this piece 
of conduct on De Foe's part. Controversy and disapproval 
may rage as they will. In his letters on the subject De Foe 
clearly prides himself on his masquerade among " the en- 
raged High Tories." There can be no doubt that he loved 
to lead national parties by the nose. He did not in the least 
object to being the center of brilliant and novel political 
schemes, and was clearly all his life long the kind of man— 
so often darkly disapproved by persons of more native 
obscurity — who " does not mind attracting attention." 
This trait easily accounts for the peculiar irascibility and 
somewhat self-righteous air of slight displayed against him 
by many of his contemporaries. 

De Foe was now in his sixtieth year; and while in the 
thick of his Jacobite journal scheme, he wrote and published 
anonymously his first work of fiction — Robinson Crusoe. 
At the age of sixty he set forth on the pioneer work of a 
great English novelist — literally the first English novelist. 
For the next eleven years he exercised in fresh fields his 
ruling passion for original design. 

The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, the Journal of the 
Plague Year, the Memoirs of a Cavalier, History of Colonel 
Jack, the Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders. 
Roxana or the Fortunate Mistress, all these following nar- 
ratives of the next decade are unique and creative composi- 
tions executed with first-hand force and conviction. 



96 THE NORTH AMEEICAN REVIEW 

Impossible in this brief account of the work of De Foe to 
describe his other tales of lesser merit, or the many pam- 
phlets, books of travel, and writings in other forms also pro- 
duced in this period of his life. 

Every one knows Robinson Crusoe — the footprint — the 
death of the goat — the making of the umbrella and the table 
and the chair — the inimitable conversations with Friday — 
and the return with the rescued captain and, his crew, among 
them a man who chanced also to be named Robinson. (It 
may be parenthetically remarked that this last touch alone 
would reveal a born master in methods of realizing a scene 
to his readers in all the bright mosaic of the curious colors 
of life.) 

Every one knows Crusoe. Less familiar is the Journal 
of the Plague Year — a history of the Plague purporting to 
have been written by a citizen living in London during the 
pestilence. No one who reads it will, I think, question De 
Foe's editorial power of synthetic statement, of choosing 
well the various materials, voices, journals, letters, and offi- 
cial documents that make the truth of a great actual story 
really live in the public mind. 

The dread of contagion — the horror of the frequent toll- 
ing bells and dead-carts — the silent streets — the lines of the 
doorways of the afflicted houses guarded by sentinels, and 
marked with a tall red cross — the presence of pain and mor- 
tality — and then the rising breath of relief, the lessened 
fatality of the disease, the lessening numbers of the sick — 
the returning of the citizens who had fled the stricken city — 
and at last again the merciful flow and hurry of London's 
full normal activity. All these are experiences the reader 
lives in the Journal of the Plague Year: and here De Foe 
shows at its height his genius for writing like Legion. 

Like the writing of Legion too is the Memoirs of a Cava- 
lier. Battle after battle, siege after siege — Magdeburg, 
Leipsic, Augsburg, Naseby, and Marston Moor — armies 
marching and counter-marching, camp and slaughter and 
rapine — you sit and watch all this passing before you with 
the full consciousness of the presence and movement of 
multitudes. 

In Moll Flanders, Colonel Jack, and Roxana, as in this 
war-chronicle, and in the Journal of the Plague Year, De 
Foe is a guide through the wilds of civilization. No swamp 
of misery is too miasmatic or tangled for him to push

through. He will walk among the worst jungles of the 
wretchedness, cruelty, and brutishness of men. Some one 
has said that many of the novels of Zola are indecent but 
moral: and the same discrimination may be truthfully re- 
peated of these three tales of De Foe's. It would I think 
betray a shallow lack of human sympathy and imagination 
on De Foe's part, if he had told these stories to the reader 
without conveying any sense of shock. It is right that they 
should be as shocking as they are. 

The Life of Moll Flanders 1 is the autobiography of a 
thief, of a middle-class woman a parish-charge and a waif, 
educated to be a servant, wronged by one master, married 
by another who dies, and then by a husband who deserts 
her. In her poverty she falls among pickpockets and evil 
and vicious companions. She is condemned to the gallows 
for attempting to steal two pieces of flowered silk. Through 
the efforts of a clergyman her sentence is commuted, she is 
transported to the American colonies, and here contrives to 
work out her salvation on land of her own with her desert- 
ing and returned husband. 

Colonel Jack is the autobiography of a thief who reforms 
rather early in life — at the age of twenty-six — becomes a 
planter, then a half-hearted Jacobite and adventurer — and 
at last goes back again to the soil and an evangelical repent- 
ance. 

The beautiful Roxana is the most considerable creature 
portrayed in any of De Foe's vivid narratives of vicious 
lives. After Roxana with her five children is deserted by 
her husband, a conceited brewer, she abandons the children 
to various hard fates with his relatives, and becomes the 
mistress of a jeweler who dies, leaving her a large fortune. 
The account of her days is first that of a triumphant prog- 
ress attended by royal lovers and patrons through vice till 
she wearies of it ; and then, in the guise of a Quaker widow, 
through respectability to a marriage with a rich and noble 
merchant. When he learns her past, he can forgive every- 
thing but her meanness to the children. This estranges him 
completely. He goes away from her, settling on her the 
merest provision for the necessities of life. After his death, 
she rashly ventures this in unwise speculation; loses it all;

tunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders has been one of the most suc- 
cessful books of the day in France.

and is thrown for debt into the debtor's prison where she 
dies. 

Undoubtedly in all these epic stories of human warfare, 
success, and defeat there are passages both dull and crass — 
moments when one feels that the author's habit of constant 
mental reference to the Nonconformist faith limits the free 
truth of his chronicle. Nevertheless here are epic stories 
of mortal struggle, moving and vital world-stories unafraid 
to show all the colors of truth. 

In the composition of these great novels De Foe seems 
at the last, like the Japanese artist of Mr. La Farge's anec- 
dotes to walk into his own painting and disappear. We have 
little record of the end of his days. He died of a lethargy, 
away from home. From a sad letter of his to a son-in-law, 
he appears to have been in poverty from giving up all his 
estate in trust for himself and his daughters to a son who 
deceived him. He mentions his religion, however, in this 
letter, with courage and hope: and it is impossible to con- 
ceive De Foe in any circumstances where he would not have 
found a considerable mental consolation. 

One afternoon before I had ever read anything of De 
Foe's but Robinson Crusoe, I chanced to see quoted in a 
book some one had left lying open on a library table these 
words of his : 

" He that hath truth on his side is a fool as well as a coward if he is 
afraid to own it because of the multitude of other men's opinions. 'Tis 
hard for a man to say all the world is mistaken but himself. But if it 
be so who can help it?" 

What makes style? It was as though the voice of Daniel 
De Foe spoke from the book, as actually as the voice of my 
friend who now came in ready for walking. And when this 
chance word led me to read De Foe and his biography, these 
were the story of a man who would have thought himself a 
fool not to own the truth he knew. 

He could own it by following the cause of the Duke of 
Monmouth through Sedgemoor and the Bloody Circuit: and 
in the Essay on Projects: and in the defiance of Parliament 
in the Legion Letter : he could own it by being pilloried for 
justice to Dissenters and Churchmen alike: and by mas- 
querading as a Jacobite to mitigate the excesses of the Tory 
press : and by telling in many forms of fiction that true story 



THE AUTHOR OF " ROBINSON CRUSOE " 99 

which was after all the history of his own life and will be 
the history of ours — the story of the soul of man in the 
midst of an unknown wilderness. 

When Friday cuts his father's bonds, and Moll Flanders* 
sleeps on the deck-planks of the transport, you breathe with 
them the wide air of the stories of peoples. You traverse the 
globe. Tou are a part of the march of events ; of the state 
of civilization and of the responsible world of men. 

Besides this fine pleasure, you feel with Crusoe and 
Colonel Jack and with Roxana too a quick pride in the 
human faculty of moving toward the light. This peculiar 
tone of bright and merciful curiosity and clear-thinking in- 
genuity throughout De Foe's work is indescribably beauti- 
ful and imparts a crystal splendor to all his life's labors. 
With a deep realization of the struggles, baseness, and in- 
justice of the world, you turn away at last from the spec- 
tacle of his brave existence of ups and downs, and from the 
multitudinous universe his writings present as you turn 
away from mountain forests in the morning light — re- 
freshed with new wonder and courage. 

Edith Wyatt.
