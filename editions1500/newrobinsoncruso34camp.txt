NEW ROBINSON CRUSOE, 



FOURTEENTH EVENING. 

KAR' BILL, Yeflerday I gave you the 
particulars of Robinfon's manner of li- 
ving. Three years pafied away, and it was 
flill the fame. In ail that time, and with 
fuch perfevering conflancy in labour^ hov/ 
far do ye think was he advanced in the 
making of his canoe ? Alas ! he had fcarcely 
cut through half the trunk of the tree, and 
it now Teemed a matter of doubt to him 
whetiiCi- he could cut down the tree in Id'^:^ 
A 3 than 



4 T H E N E W 

than three or four years more, though he 
were to work with the fame conftant regu- 
larity as before. 

In the mean time he never flackened the 
work. What elfe, indeed, could he have 
undertaken ? And, then, he was neither 
willing nor able to remain idle. One day 
the thought ilruck him, that as long as he 
had lived in this ifland, he had feen but a 
very fmall part of it. He was angry with 
himfel f for his own weaknefs,when he refledled 
that fear was the caufe which had prevented 
him from traverfing the whole of it. " Per- 
haps," faid he, " had I been lefs afraid, 
I might have difcovered many things 
v/hich would at prefent be very ufeful to 
me." 

This confideration determined him to fee 
out the very next morning by day-break in 
order to take a view of the whole ifland. 

Edw. How large might this ifland be ? 

Mr, Bill, Perhaps much about the ex- 
tent of the county of Middlefex, The 
fame day he made every requifite prepara- 

tioa

tion for his departure -, and the next morn- 
ing, having loaded one of his lamas with 
provifions for four days, having armed and 
accoutered himfelf, and prayed for the di- 
vine protedlion, he fet out on his journey 
with confidence. His defign was to keep 
as much as poffible to the fca-fidcj and to 
avoid fbreds, that he might be kis liable 10 
meet v;ith wild beads. 

His firft day*s journey was remarkable 
for no extraordinary accident. He tra- 
velled about twenty miles. The farther 
he went the plainer he could perceive that 
the fituation of his dwelling-place vvas in 
the barreneft part of the ifland. In m.any 
parts he found trees, fuch as he had never 
feen before, which appeared to bear fruits 
capable of furnifhing him with a nouriih- 
ment as wholefome as it was agreeable. It 
was not until fome time after that he knew 
thQ ufefulnefs of them, and learned their 
names. 

Amongfl: thefe trees was one caHed the 
A 4 paper 



6 T H E N E W 

paper mulberry tree^ the bark of which is 
wroiigljt into a fine fort of paper by the 
people of Japan, and makes a handfome 
fummer iluif for the inhabitants of Ota- 
heite. I will fliew you a piece of it, which 
I received as a prefent from a gentlemant 
who iiad been v/ith Captain Cook. Ro- 
binfon Hept the firil night in a tree, that 
he might be the more fecure from wild 
beafls, and at the firfl dawn of day he fe£ 
out again. 

He had not travelled far before he found 
himfelf at the Southern extremity of the 
ifiand. In fome places the foil was fandy. 
He had a mind to walk out upon a neck 
of land which extended pretty far into the 
fea, but fiiddenly darting back, he grew as 
pale as death. He looked round him all 
in a trem.bie, and then, hanging his head> 
flood flock ilill and incapable of motion, as 
if he had been fcruck by a thunderbolt. — 
[See the frontijpiece to this volume.'] 

Rich, Vv hat was the matter with him ? 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

Mr, BilL His eyes difcovered what he 
never expelled to find there, the tracks of 
men's feet imprinted in the fand. 

Ed'-jo, What ! does that frighten him ? 
I uhink he fhould rejoice at the fight. 

Mr. Bill. I will explain to you the rea- 
Ton of his fright. Upon his firfl: beholding. 
tntKt tracks, he did not reprefent to himfelf 
the men, whofe fleps had left the impref- 
fions he faw^ as civilized, humane, com- 
pafilonate beings, ever ready to affill their 
fellow creatures according to their pov/er ; 
but he imagined them to be barbarous, 
cruel, ferocious, ready, if they met him, to 
fall upon him, cut his throat, and devour 
him : in a word, he did not fuppofe that 
civilized Europeans had been upon the fpor, 
bui favages and cannibals \ that is, as 1 be- 
fore explained it to you, and which you 
could not hear without being fhocked,rnen 
whofe horrible cuilom it was to feed upon 
human flelh. 

Rich. That idea is enough, indeed, to 
ihock one. 

A 5 Mr.

M)\ BilL It would have been better for 
Robinlbn, had he been accuflomcd from 
his childhood not to give way to the im- 
pulfe of terror, even in the greateft dan- 
gers, and had he, at this nnoment, preferved 
iTiOre coolnefs and prefence of mind. We 
can all bring ourfelves to it, if we will but 
pay an early and conftant attention to the 
rendering of our bodies, as well as our nninds, 
found and vigorous. 

Rich. But I do not rightly underftand 
how we can bring ourfelves to this temper. 

Mr. Bill. By fortifying our bodies v/ith 
fobriety, regularity,, and exercife, confor- 
mably to the intent of nature, and by pre- 
ferving our minds free from blemifh, by a 
fteady and enlightened piety. Thus forti* 
fiedj v/e fiiall be able to bear every change 
of fortune, and look upon danger with an 
eye of indifference. Thus, my dear chil- 
dren, if you will alv/ays temperately con- 
fine yourfelves to thofe forts of food which 
are by fo much the miore wholefome, as 
they are m.ore plain and natural than others,

guife, as pernicious to the health as they 
are agreeable to the tafte y if you will avoid

body as the foul y if, as far as lies in your 
pov/er, you will accuftom your minds to a

procure yourfelves ; if, upon other occafionsj^, 
you contentedly bear with things that 
feem difagreeable, though you could avoid 
doing fo J if, farther, you contrail the habit 
of not having recourfe to others, but, on 
the contrary, of finding in yourfelves a re- 
fource for all your wants, thus, as far as lies

care to acquire and preferve to yourfelves 
the precious treafure of a confcience free 
from reproach^ which aiTures you of the 
protedion and favour of the Almighty : 
then, my dear children, you will gain, and 
you will feel yourfelves poiTeffed of, all the 
llrength of body and mind that you are ca- 
pable of pofTeffing. The mod whimficaj 
and moil undeferved changes of fortune will 
not trouble nor difcompofe your fouls. The 
moft difagreeable events may caufe you 
fome furprife, but will not have power to 
Hiake your fortitude, nor to alter the fere- 
nity of your minds -, perfuaded that, under 
the government of a Providence as wife as 
powerful, nothing can poITibly happen which 
will not turn to your greateft advantage. 

Robinfon, as you fee, had not yet reach- 
ed, by his progrefs in true piety, that de- 
gree of fortitude {q necefiary to his happi- 

nefe 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, If 

nefs and repofe. This may be imputed to 
the life which he had led for fome years, fo 
tranquil and fo unexpofed to dangers. In 
a ftate of conftant tranquillity, (mark well 
this truth, my dear children,) in a fituation 
of perfedt fecurity, man never acquires all 
the energy nor all the courage of which his 
mind is fufceptible. Does it fo happen that 
he is fuddenly placed in circumllances unu- 
fual and terrifying ? He is weak, timid, 
and overpowered with terror. Nay, too 
much eafe fometimes ferves no other pur- 
pofe than to render a m.an vicious. We 
ought, therefore, to receive as bleflings 
thofe trials which Heaven fends us from 
time to time, be they ever fo fevere, fince 
they are the means of knowing, of exer- 
cifing, and ftrengthening our courage by 
experience. 

You remember into what a confcernation 
the unexpe6led fight of fome tracks of men's 
feet threw the poor affrighted Robinfon. 
He looks round to every quarter -, at the 
noife of every leaf he feels frefh terror. In 

the 



12 T H E N E W 

the confufion of his fpirits, he knows not what 
to refolve on : at laft, muftering up all his 
flrength, he takes to flight, with the utmoft 
precipitation, like a man who is purfued ; 
and fo great is his terror, that he dares not, 
even once, look back. But fuddenly he 
Hops i his fear is changed into horror. 
What an obje6l ftrikes his eye 1 Ah ! my 
dear children, prepare yourfelves for the moil 
fhocking fpectacle in nature ; the horrible 
confequences of man's depraved (late when 
totally abandoned to himfelf, and deprived 
of all education. He faw a round hole, in 
the middle of which was a fpace whereon 
a fire feemed to have been kindled, though 
it was then out. Ail round this hole — —I 

fhudder v/hile I relate it he perceived 

hands and feet, fcuUs, and other human 
•bones, fcattered about, which prefented the 
horrible remains of an unnatural feaft, where 
a human body had been devoured 

i:'he Children, How iliocking ! What,. by 
rnen ? 

Mr, Bill, Can they be called men ? The/ 

have 



ROBINSON CRtTSOE. Ij 

have only the outfide of men : without edu- 
cation, degraded, rendered brutal, and like 
the moft ravenous animals, neither the loath- 
ing which fuch an a<^ion would naturally 
produce, nor the compaflionate feelings of 
humanity, prevent them from following the 
abominable cuftom of murdering their fel- 
low-creatures to feed on them. Thefe were 
their prifoners of war, on whom, after they 
had cut their throats and roafled them, 
they made a horrible feall, in which their 
ravage joy manifefted itfelf by dances and 
fongs, or rather the howlings of gorged can- 
nibals. 

- Charlotte, Oh ! the deteftable creatures ! 
Mr, Bill. Let us, my dear Chariot te^ de- 
teft their atrocious manners, and not their 
perfons : they have received no education^ 
no inftrudlion. If you had been lb unfor- 
tunate as to have received your birth 
amongil thefe favage people, you would, 
like them, run about naked in the woods, 
v/ithout the leail fhame, ftupid and fierce 
as a brute be all : you would paint your bo- 

dy 



14 T H E NEW 

dy and your face with various colours, parti- 
cularly red : you would make holes in your 
nofe and ears, and be very proud to carry in 
thenn, for ornament, birds feathers, fea 
iliells, and other trifles : you would, then, 
make one at the abominable feads of your 
depraved relations, and there take your 
(hare with as much pleaiure as you do now 
at cur beil dinners. Rejoice, therefore, all' 
of you, and blefs God that you belong to 
parents who were born and bred up in po- 
liihed fociety, where they have learned, from 
their infancy, to be humane, civil, polite, and 
friendly, and not to negle(5t any thing that 
may render you alfo mild, agreeable, com-- 
paiTionate, and fufceptible of every virtue.. 
Pity the unhappy lotof thofe men who, be-- 
ing left to themfelves, ftill lead a fivagc 
life like that of wild beafls in the- woods..

that ifland eat human flelli -, but^ it is to be 
hoped, their intercourfe with our people 
will, by degrees, bring them to leave off fo 
barbarous a cuftom. 

Henry. That would be well done* 
Mr, Bill. Robinfbn turned his eyes away 
from the hideous fpedacle ; it made him 
quite fick, and he would, in all likelihood, 
have fainted, if nature had not relieved her- 
felf, by forcing him to throw up v/hatever 
was upon his ftomach* As foon as he was 
a little recovered, he fled away again with 
fo much precipitation, that his lama could 
fcarely keep up with him j for this faithful 
animal followed clofe at his heels v/herever 
he went. Fear had io taken pofTeflion of 
Robinfon's faculties, that he quite forgpt- 
his lama, and, hearing its fleps clofe by 
him, as he ran, had not the leaft doubt but 
there was a cannibal behind in clofe purfuit 
of him. Filled with this notion, he fled with 
redoubled fpeed, toefcape i^rom the imagi- 
nary favage at his heels, and, in order to be 
kfs encumbered and lighter in his flight, he 

threw 



l6 T H E N E W 

threw away his ipear, his bow, his arrows^ 
and his hatchet. This might have been the 
moment to make ufe of them, but he never 
once thought of doing fo i in flight alone 
he placed all his dependence. But^ in his 
flight, he forgets whither he i^ lunningj he 
regards not which way he takes : the openeft 
ground is that v/hich he prefers, let it lead 
him where it will. Thus, after he had run 
for near an hour, it happened that he mad'e 
a circuit, which brought him back to the 
very fpot from whence he had fet out. 

Here was new terror ! nev/ perplexity I 
He forgot the place ; he had no idea that it 
was the fame which he had feen before ; he 
takes it for a fecond proof of the horrible 
cruelty, the fight of which he was endea- 
vouring to avoid. He turns away, there- 
fore, from the fpot, and continues his flight 
as long as he has ftrength to carry him. 
At length, quite exhaufted, he falls down 
without fenfc or motion. Here his lama, 
having overtaken him, lies down befide 
him^ fpent with fatigue. By mere chance 

it 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

it was the very fpot where Robinfon had 
thrown away his arms ; and thefe were 
the firftobjedls that flruck his eyes the mo- 
ment he opened them. Seeing his arms 
icattered about on the grafs, he imagined 
himfelf in a dream, and that whatever had 
pafled was no more. He could not con- 
ceive by what means they were convey- 
ed there, nor how he came there him.felf ; fo 
much had his fright difturbed all the facul- 
ties of his mind. • 

He rofe now to leave the place, but his 
confufion being fomewhat abated, he was 
not lb imprudent as to forget his arms : he 
gathered them up, and firmly refolved to 
part no more with the only means of his de- 
fence. He was fo weakened, that it was 
impoffible for him now to make fo much 
hafte as before, though equally urged by 
fear. He had no appetite for the remain- 
der of the day, and he never flopped but 
once, which was only for a moment, at a 
fpring to quench his thirft. 

He hoped to be able to get home tha-t 

fame 



l8 T H E N E W 

fame day, but found it impofTibk. Ac. 
Eight- fall he was within a couple of miles of 
his own dwelhng, at a place which he called 
his country feat. It was a pretty large en- 
elofure, which he had chofen as a kind of 
park for one part of his flock, becaufe the 
grafs was better there than iathe neigh- 
bourhood of his cave. The year before^ 
he had lain there feveral nights in the fum- 
xner time, being grievoufly tormented witb 
mufkitoes at his old dwelling-place. For 
this reafon he called the fpot his country 
feat. Flis flrength being quite gone, he 
was not able to go any farther. Whatever 
danger there mjght be in palTing the night 
in fo unfafe a place, neceiTity obliged him to 
ftop there. Quite worn out with fatigue,, 
and his mind ftill agitated with fear, he lay 
dovv'n to take fomerepofci but fcarcely was 
he half afiecp, when a frelh fubjed of terror 
had nearly deprived him of his fenfes onc^ 
more. , 

Rich. Poor fellow ! to what alarms he is 
expofed ! 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I9 

Edw. What was the matter, then ? 

Mr. Bill. He heard a voice in the air, 
•which very diflinfbly uttered thefe words, 
*^ Robinfon, poor Robinfon ! where have 
you been ? How came you here ?" 

Rich. Blefs me ! what could it be ? 

Mr. Bill Robinfon ftarted up, all in a 
tremble, not knowing what to think. He 
hears the fame words repeated -, he ventures 
to turn his eyes towards the quarter from 
which the voice came, and finds — —what 
think ye? 

^he Children. Nay, we can't tell, 

Mr. Bill. He found, what a coward, if 
he would take the pains to examine before 
he gave way to his fears, would almoft al- 
ways find— that he had no reafon to be 
alarmed ; he found that it was no voice in 
the air, but the voice of his own parrot, 
A-vvhich was perched upon the briinch of a 
tree^lofe by, 

the Children. Ha ! ha ! ha ! that is droll 
enough. 

Mr. Bill, No doubt the bird was tired 

of 



^0 T H E N E W 

of being left alone in the cave, and as it had 
many a time before followed its mafter to 
the place where he now was, it came thi- 
ther to feek him, and pronounced the fame 
words which Robinfon had repeated to it 
hundreds of times. 

His fright was now turned to joy at hav- 
ing found out the caufe of the falfe alarm, 
Flobinfon flretches out his hand and calls 
*^ Poll !'' The bird Eies to him, and wel- 
comes him with a hundred fond carefles, all 
the while crying, " Robinfon ! poor Robin- 
fon ! v/here have you been ?" 

Still refllefs and apprehenfive, Robinfon 
fcarce clofed his eyes the whole night. He 
had for ever before him the horrid fpot 
which firft occafioned his fright. He flrove, 
bur in vain, to banilh it from his imagina- 
tion I all his endeavours were to no purpofe. 
When once the imagination receives a vio- 
lent fhock, to what extremities does it caufe 
a man's thoughts to wander ? What a 
cloud of darknefs does paflion fpread over 
his reafon ? Robinfon thought of a thou- 

fand 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

fand plans for his future fecurity, every one 
more extravagant than the other. Amongft 
the reft — would you believe it ? — he had 
formed the refolution of deftroying, as 
foon as it was day-light, all the works that 
he had made, and not to leave a trace 
remaining of all that had coft him fo m^uch 
labour. The copfe in which he now lay, 
and the hedge enclofing the whole park, 
v/ere to be deftroyed ; his - lamas turned 
loofe ; his dwelling-place at the cave, and 
the willow row, to be all demolilhed \ his 
garden and trees to be grubbed up ; in 
fhort, every thing was to be facrificed to 
his fafety. He would not have the fmalleft 
appearance remaining of any thing that 
might feem to be the work of man's hands. 

Rich, For what reafon ? 

Mr. Bill That, if the favages fhould 
chance to pay a vifit to this fide of the ifland, 
they might not perceive, nor even fufpe6l, 
that there was a man there. 

Let us now leave him to his apprehen- 
Gons, as we can be of no afliftance to him ; 

and 



22 T H E N E W 

and while we go to reft, fheltered from the 
danger to which he thinks himfelf expofed, 
let us be fenfible of our own happinefs. Let 
us return thanks to the Supreme Being, that 
we were born in a country, where, living 
amongft men who are civilized, and willing 
to afford us friendlhip and afliftance, wc 
may compofc ourfelves to reft without hav-_ 
ing any thing to fear from the barbarity of 
inhurnan favages. 

The Children, Good night, papa; much 
obliged to you. How agreeable has this 
evening's entertainment been ! 



FIFTEENH EVENING. 

MY dear children, it is a good proverb 
which advifes us to conjult our pillow 
before we take any important refolution. 

Robinfon 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2$ 

Robinfon found the advantage of comform- 
ing to this advice. 

You remember the flrange refolutions 
which his excefTive fear made him form. 
He was very happy that he put off the per- 
formance of them until the next day. Scarce 
had the mild light of morning difperied the 
fhades of night, when he faw things in quite 
a different view. What he before judged 
prudent and neceflary, appears to him a 
fenfelcfs and extravagant proje6b. In a 
word, he rejeds all the hafly fchemes that 
fear had put in his head, and he forms other 
plans which his fober judgment approves. 

Let his example teach you, that, in affairs 
which may be put off, you jQiould not pafs 
from refolving immediately to performingi 
defer this latter till the next day, as often 
as you conveniently can, 

Robinfon now faw and acknowledged 
that his fright, the day before, had been car- 
ried to an extravagant pitch. *^ I have 
been here," faid he, " a long time, and no 
favage has ever yet come near my habi- 

VoL. III. B ution> 



24 T H E N E W 

tation, which is proof enough that they arc 
not fettled in this ifland. It is moil likely 
that they are inhabitants of another ifland, 
from whence fome of them come here now 
and then^ to celebrate their vidories by a 
horrible feaft -, and probably they never land 
but at the Southern point of the ifland, and 
return to their own country without having 
the curiofity to come any farther. It is, 
therefore, by the particular direction of 
Heaven that I have been thrown on this 
part of the coaft, the leafl fertile in the 
whole ifland. This very difadvantage is 
now the caufe of my fecurity. 

" Why fliould I not hope that the fame 
good Providence will continue to protedl 
me againft all dangers, fince I have hither- 
to been fo remarkably preferved from the 
greateft?" He then reproached himfelf 
bitterly for having the night before fhewn 
fo little confidence in his heavenly Father. 
Filled with forrow and repentance, he threw 
himfelf proftrate on the ground, to implore 
pardon for this new fault. Having now re- 
covered 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2J 

covered his ftrength, he walked towards his 
cave to put in execution the new defigns 
which he had juft formed. 

Rich. What did he propofe to do ? 

Mr, Bill. He intended to take fome pro- 
per meafures for his greater fecurity, which 
was very reafonable : for although it be our 
duty to depend on Providence, being per- 
fuaded, that, while we conform our lives to 
the divine precepts, we fhall not be forfaken 
in time of nttdy yet, on our fides, we 
fliould negledt nothing that may contri- 
bute to our happinefs or fecurity j for we 
certainly were never endowed with reafon, 
nor our minds, nor even our bodies, en- 
riched with fuch various faculties and pow- 
ers, for any other purpofe, but that we 
fhould, as far as in us lies, make them all 
unite towards rendering us more fecurely 
happy. 

The firil thing that he did, was to plant, 

without fide, at a fmali diflance from the 

trees which enclofed the front fpace before 

bis cave, a thick wood which might cover 

B 2 it 



^6 T H E N IS W 

it at a diftance, and hinder it from being 

With this defign, he planted, one after 
another, near two thoufand flips of that fort , 
of willow which he had before obfervcd to 
take root and grow up in fo fhort a time. 
He took good care not to plant them in 
rows : on the contrary, he avoided all regu- 
]arity,.on purpofe to give the whole the ap- 
pearance cf a natural growth rather than of 
artificial arrangement. He refolved next 
to dig a fubterraneous paflage from the bot- 
tom of his cave to ^he other fide of the hill, 
that, in a cafe of extremity, as, for inllance, 
when the enemy fhoiild have fcaled his bar- 
ricade, he might have a back-way to efcape 
by. This was alfo a troublefome and tedi- 
ous tafk j and you mufl underlland, that, in 
order to have leifure for it, he was obliged 
to give up the making of the canoe for a 
while. 

In opening this fubterraneous paflage, he 
began exadly as miners do, who firft dig a 
pit, and then a gallery. 

Ge9. 



ROB TN SON CRUSOE. i'J 

Geo\ What fort of a gallery ? 

Rich, Do you forget ? I can tell you. 
The miners, in making a mine, firft dig in* 
to the earth llraight down, as thofe do who 
are digging a well ^ and this perpendicular 
opening they call a pit. When they are 
come to a certain depth, they begin to hol- 
low it out horizontally; and this paflagc 
they call a gallery. Thus they go on from 
pits to galleries, and from galleries to pits, 
until they come to the vein or bed of metal 
which they are feeking. 

Mr. Bill, Very well explained. Ob- 
fei^e, that, when they dig thus fideways, or 
horizontally, the earth which is over their 
heads would foon crumble down, if they 
did not take care, as they went on, to keep it 
up : this they do by means of crofs planks^ 
which reach from one fide of the pafTage to 
the other, and reft upon uprights. Robin- 
fon took the fame precaution. 

Whatever earth he cleared out of it, he 

carried clofe to the hedge, and took care to 

level it. Thus, by degrees, he raifed a ter- 

B 3 race. 



28 T H E N ^ W 

race^ about ten fett high, and alnioft eight 
thick. At convenient diftances> he had left 
openings, or port- holes, that he nrjight fee 
she out- country. He had, befides, made 
fteps to go up to the top of the terrace, in 
cafe he fhould, one day or other, be obliged 
to defend his little fort from the top of his 
rampart. 

He feemed now fiiliiciently fecured 
againft a fudden or fhort attack. But, then, 
if the enemy Ihould be obftinate, and block 
him up for fome time, what are to be his 
refources ? 

^ This blocking up was not a vain fancy : 
it was by no means impofiible that fuch a 
thing might happen fome day or other. He 
thought it, therefore, neceffary to provide 
alfo againft fuch an event, and to contrive 
means whereby he might avoid the neceflity 
©f furrendering for want of provifions, or 
elfe dying of hunger. To prevent any 
fuch e;xtremity, he refolved to keep con- 
ftantly within the enclofure, at leaft, one of 
his lamas that gave milk, and to have, by 

way 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

way of referve for the fupport of this animal, 
a fmall rick of hay, which was not to be 
touched unlefs in cafe of neceffity. He 
was moreover refolved to lay up a flock of 
cheefe, fruits, and oyfters, and recruit it 
from day to day, according as the one or 
the other became unfit to keep. 

He had thought of another defign, but 
was obliged to give it up, forefeeing that it 
would be too tedious in the execution. He 
was defirous that the water of the neigh- 
bouring fpring, which formed a fmall rivulet, 
might be conveyed, if polTible, to the very 
door of his cave, that, in cafe of a fiege, he 
might not be deprived offonecefTary aeorr-' 
veniency. To effed this, he would have 
been obliged to cut through a fmall hill, 
which, howeverj was large enough to re- 
quire a very confiderable time betore ihz b- 
bour of a fingle man could complete fuch a 
cur. He thought it, therefore, better to 
give up the idea, and return to the making 
of his canoe. 

For fome years there happened nothing 
B 4 wordi 



^O T H E N E W 

worth relating. I haften now to an event 
which had more influence on the lot of Ro- 
binfon:, than all that had happened to hlni 
in his ifland as yet. 

One fine clear morning, as he was work- 
ing at his canoe, he perceived a very thick 
Imoke rifing at a diftance. The terror with: 
which he was at firfl feized upon fight of this, 
gave way to curiofity. He hallened to the 
top of his little hillock to difcover the true 
caufe of the fmoke. Scarcely was he ar- 
rived there, when he was ftruck with con- 
ilernation at the fight of five or fix canoes 
drawn up on the beach, and a fcore or two of 
favages dancing round a great fire, with the 
mofl: fantafiic motions and horrid cries 
imaginable. 

Though Robinfoji ought to have expeft- 
tpd tuch a fight one time or other, yet here 
again he was near falling into a fwoon with 
terror. However, this time he quickly re- 
covered his fpirits, by placing his confidence 
in his Maker. He ran down the hill to put 
himfelf in a pofture of defence, took his 

arms. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3! 

arms, implored the afTiftance of Heaven, and 
firmly refolved to defend his life to the laft 
extremity. Fortified in this refolution by 
his piety, he found himfelf mafter of fuffi- 
cient courage and prefence of mind to go 
Mp again by his ladder of ropes to the top 
of the hill> from whence he was defirous of 
viewing all the enemy's motions. 

Prefently his indignation and horror was 
raifed to the higheft pitch, when he beheld 
them drag two unfortunate wretches from 
the cajioes towards the place where the fire 
was. He fufpedled, at firft fight, that they 
were going to difpatch them ; and he very 
foon found that he was not miftaken. Some 
.of thefe monflers kill one of the captives, 
and two others fall upon him, no doubt, in 
order to cut him into pieces, and prepare 
their abominable feaft. During this fhock- 
ing execution, the other prifoner fat a me- 
lancholy fpedtator of what was doing, in the 
cxpcdiation of very foon receiving the fame 
treatment in his turn. But while thcfe bar- 
biirians wcr-c bufily taken up with the 
B-5. butchery 



22 T H E N E W 

butchery of his companion, he watches a 
monnent when no body had an eye upoa 
him, and, with the hope of efcaping death, 
he fuddenly flarts away, and Eies with alio- 
nifhing fwiftnefs diredtly towards Robin- 
fon's dwelling-place. 

Joy, hope, fear, and horror, alternately 
feized on Robinfon's heart -y they appeared 
fucceflively in his countenance, which was 
pale and red by turns. He felt a joy min- 
gled with hope, when he obferved the pri- 
ibner to gain ground confiderably on his 
purfuers : he was filled with fear and bj)rror 
when he faw both parties coming as ftraight 
as poflible towards his habitation. They 
were feparated from it only by a fmall creek^, 
which the favage^ who ficd^^ mull crofs, by 
fwimnaing, to avoid falling into the enemy's 
hands. Asfoon as he came to the bank of it, 
he threw himfelf in without hefitation, and 
croffed it with the fwiftnefs that he had exerted 
ki runnif>g. Twoof thofe who were neareft 
to him threw themfelves in after him^ and

tisfadlloh, that thele two laft were nor, by a» 
great deal, fuch expert fwimmers as he 
whom they purfued. He was landed be- 
fore they had half croITed the creek. At 
this moment, Robinlbn was animated with 
a courage and zeal, fuch as he had never" 
felt before : his eyes fparkled ;■ his heart 
throbbed, and feenved ro urge him to th6

his fpear, and, without hefitating,.runs dowa 
from the top of the hillock. In the twink- 
ling of an eye he pafTcs through the gi-ovc,. 
and, coming out on the other fide, finds him- 
felf juft between the purfuers and the pur- 
fued. He cries to the latter, '* Sropl tepl"' 
but he, turning about, is terrified ast the 
looks of Robinfon drell up in Ikins , he 
takes him for fome fuperior being,, and l^e- 
fltares whether to fali^at his feet or run away

within reach of the foremaft favage, he 
throws his fpear at him, and ftrikes him to 
the ground. The other favage, being about 
one hundred yards behind. Hops, quite fur- 
prifed, fixes an arrow to his bow, and dif- 
charges it at Robinfon, who was coming up 
to him. The arrow (truck him on the left 
breaft, where the heart lies 5 but luckily it 
came with no great force, and the fkins kept 
it off as well as a coat of armour could have 
done. The arrow fell at Robinfon's feet, 
and he felt not the fmalleft hurt from it. 

Our hero does not give his enemy time to 
Ihoot a fecond arrow 5 he rufties upon him, 
and, before the favage can draw the bow- 
firing, Robinfon lays him lifelefe in the 
duft. 

He now turns towards him whom he had 
protected, and fees him ftill on the fame 
fpot motionlefs, betwixt hope and fear, 
doubting whether the action that he had 
juft been witnefs to, was meant for his pre- 
fervation, or whether he himfelf muft fall,

Hops, walks OH a little way, ftops agaln^ 
advances flowly with evident marks of fear, 
and in the attitude of a fuppliant. Robin- 
fon makes him every fign of friendlhip pof- 
fible, and invites him to come ciofe up tO' 
him. The favage approaches ; but at every 
ten fteps proftrates himklfon the ground^ 
at the lame time to thank him ^d to teftify 
his fubmifiion to him. 

Robinfon takes off his muflv, and looks at 
him with a mild, humane, and friendly air* 
At this fight the favage hc-fitates no more, 
but fties towards his deliverer, proftrates 
himfelf, kifies the ground, takes one ofRo- 
binfon's feet and puts it on his neck, to fig- 
n'lfy that he was his flave. But our hero^^ 
v/haknew that he had more cccafion for a 
friend than a flave, quickly held out his 
hand to him in a friendly manner, raifed 
him up, and endeavoured, by all the means

be well ufed. However, there llili remain- 
ed fomething to be done. 

The firft favage was^ wounded, but not 
killed. Being now conie to hinnfelf, he was 
gathering herbs and applying them to his 
wound to flop the blood. Robinfon made 
the favage, who i\ood near him, obferve 
this, who immediately fpoke feme words in 
return. Though Robinfon did not under* 
Hand them, yet they pleafed his ear by their 
novelty, being the firft found of the human 
voice that, he had heard for many years. 
The Indian, fixing his eyes alternately upon 
Robinfon and his hatchet, pointing to it- 
with his finger, and then drawing his hand 
back again fhily, . gave him to underftand 
that he defired this weapon to difpatch the 
enemy. Our hero, though loth to fhed 
human blood, yet fenfible of the necefT'ty 
of killing the wounded ^ favage, gives his 
hatchet, and turns his eyes from feeing the 
bloody ufe that is going to be made of it. 
The Indian runs up to his adverfary, ftrikes 
off his head at a blowj and returns with the 

cruel

cruel fmile of gratified revenge. Then, 
making a thoufand wry faces, and throwing- 
himfelf into a thoufand odd poflnres, he lays 
at Robinfon's feet, by way of a trophy, the 
hatchet, together with the bleeding head of 
tie favage he had killed. 

Robinfon made figns to him to gather 
up the bows and arrows of the flain, and 
to follow him. The Indian, in return,, 
gave him to underlland, by figns, that, be- 
fore they went away, it would be pro- 
per to bury the two dead favages in the 
fand, that, if their companions fhould after- 
wards come to feek them, they might not 
find any remains of them. 

Robinfon having fignified that he ap- 
proved this precaution, the Indian fell to 
work with the afliftance only of his hands, 
but with fo much activity and difpatch, 
that in lefs than a quarter of an hour the 
two bodies were buried. They then fet 
out together towards Robin(bn*s abode, and 
went up to the top of the hillock.

Churlotte But, papa, was not Hobinfbn 
guilty of murder ? 

Henry. Oh ! thofe that he had killed were 
favages j there was no harm in killing 
them. 

Charlotte. Yet ftill they were men. 

Mr. BilL Certainly they were men, my 
dear Henry j favages or civilized is not the

right to take away their lives ? 

Rich, I think he did very right, 

Mr, Bill And why ? 

Rich. Becaufe they were inhuman crea-. 
tures, and would have murdered a poor 
wretch who perhaps had never done thera. 
any harm. 

Mr. BilL How did Robinfon know that? 
Might not the favage who was pairfued have 
deferved death ? The others were, perhaps, 
officers ofjuftice, adling under the authority 
of their fuperiors. Berides> who had made

Geo. And they would ail have come in a

Henry. And devoured his body. 

Mr. BilL Why that is a pretty good 
rcafon. You are not far wrong : he had a 
right to do it for his fecurity. But, am I 
cxcufable in taking away another man'* 
life that I may preferve my own I 

The Children. Yes, certainly. 

Mr. BilL Why fo ? 

Rich. Becaufe it is the will of our Ma- 
ker that we preferve our lives as long as it 
is in our power : whenever, therefore, any 
one goes about to deprive us of life, it muft 
certainly be juft to prevent him by taking 
away his, if there be no other means, 

Mr. Bill. Without doubt, my dear chil- 
dren, fuch a forced defence of ourfelves is 
allowable by all laws divine and human ; 
provided, however, that we have abfblutely 
no other means of faving our lives, than by

if, on the ocher hand, we deftroy our ene- 
my, when we have it in our power to pre- 
lerve ourfelves without doing fo, either by 
flight, or by the protedion of others^ or^ 
lailly, by putting it out of his power to hurt 
lis, we are then guilty of murder, and ame- 
nable to the law. 

Remember, my dear children, to thank 
God that you were born in a country where 
the government has taken fuch proper fleps 
for the fecurity of our perfons, that there is 
fcarcely one in one hundred thoufand un-

SIXTEENTH EVENING. 

J^R. BILL. What fhdl I read to yoTi 
this evening ? 

^he Children. The New Robinfon Cru- 
foe I 

Mr, BilL Robinfon's lot, my dear chil- 
dren, in which we are all fo deeply con* 
cerned, is ftill very uncertain. He went 
lip, as I told you yefterday evening, along 
Vt'ith the favage whom he had juft delivered, 
to the top of the hill behind his dv/elling, 
being both of them exceedingly uneafy as 
to what might liill befal them. The pof- 
ture of their affairs was dangerous and cri- 
tical; for, M-as ft not very likely, that the 
favages, after their horrible feafl, would fer 
out to feek their two companions who were 
miffing, as well as the vidlim that had ef-' 
caped from- them P In fuch a cafe, it could 
rot ht doubted but they would difcover 

Ro^ 



42 T H E N E W 

Robinfon's habitation, and, uniting all their 
forces, have broken into it, and mafTacred 
him, together with his new connpanion. 

All thefe thoughts came into his mind, 
while from the top of a hillock and fhel- 
tered by a tree he took a view of the fa- 
vages, who, by their extravagant dances 
and horrid howlings, exprefTed the joy that 
they felt after their barbarous fcaft. He 
deliberated how he ihould a6t; whether to 
fly, or fhut himfelf up in his fort. His 
thoughts rifing to the Almighty Protcftor 
of Innocence, he found in himfelf courage 
and refolution enough to choofe the latter 
determination. In order not to be per- 
ceived; he flipped behind the bufhes, crept 
to his ladder of ropes, made a fign to his 
companion to follow him and do as he did> 
and very foon they were both at the bot- 
tom. 

The Indian, feeing the commodious ar- 
rangement of every thing in his deliverer's 
dwelling-place, was feized with furprife. His 
eyes had never beheld any thing fo well laid 

out.

out. He felt the fame fort of admiration 
which a hufbandman would, who, from the 
wildeft part of the country, fhould find him- 
felf all of a fudden in the midft of a palace, 

Robinfon endeavoured by figns to make 
him underiland what they had to fear from 
the favages, if united, and that, in cafe they 
fhould come to attack him, he was refolved 
to defend himfclf to the laft extremity, and 
even to death. The Indian underflood him, 
and immediately, with a rcfolute air, bran- 
difhes the hatchet, which he flill held, fevc- 
ral times over his head, looks with a threat- 
ening countenance towards the enemy as if 
challenging them to combat, and thus en- 
deavours to aflfure his deliverer that lie was 
ready to defend himfelf courageoufly. Ro- 
binfon applauded thefe marks of intrepidity, 
armed the Indian with a fpear, a bow and 
arrows, and placed him fentinel at a kind 
of port-hole which he had made in liis ter- 
race, that he might have a view of whatever 
pafled in the empty fpace between that and 
thQ wood which he had planted.

About an hour afterwards, they heard, all 
at once, ftrange and dreadful cries at a dif- 
tance, which feemed to come fronn many 
lavages together. They both prepared for 
combat, and, by their looks, mutually en- 
couraged each other to make the moft vi- 
gorous defence. The cries ceafed-^pre- 
fently they began again, louder and nearer 
— they are fucceeded by a deep filence. — 
Quite near at hand— 

Charlotte. Oh! papa, if they come I 
fhall run away. 

Henry. What nonfenfe ! 

Geo. Do not be uneafy, Charlotte; Ro- 
binfon will contrive to defend himfelf. I 
am not in pain for him. 

Charlotte. You will fee 3 they are go- 
ing to murder him. 

Rich, Pfhaw, hold your tongue, 

Mr. BilL Quite near at hand fhouted a 
terrible hoarfc voice, which was repeated 
by the echo of the hillock. Already our 
two champions were in a pofture of defence ; 
already their bows were bent : the firft fa-

Mr. Bill, To furnifh you with a frefh 
opportunity of exercifing yourfelves in the 
art of conquering your defires. You arc 
all impatient to know the fuccefs of the 
bloody fight in which Robinfon feems

3EVENTEENTH EVENING. 

7\/[R' BILL. We laft night left Robin- 
fon and his companion on the watch, 
to obferve whatever/might be going for- 
ward on the outfide of the barricade. They 
continued on guard till it was almoft night ; 

but 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

but having perceived no enemy, nor heard 
any voice for fome hours, it feemed very- 
probable, that the favages, difappolnted in 
their fearch, had returned to their canoes, 
and were gone back to their own ifland. 
They laid down their arnns, therefore, and 
Robinfon brought out fcnnething for fup- 
per. 

As this day, fo particularly remarkable 
in the adventures of our hero, happened to 
be a Friday, he refolved, in feme meafure, 
to perpetuate the remembrance both of the 
day and the events which diftinguiihed it, 
by giving to the favage, whofe life he had 
faved, the name of Friday. 

Till now, Robinfon had fcarce time to 
look at him with attention. He was a 
well-made young man, about twenty years 
of age; his complexion was fwarthy, his 
hair black and long, not woolly like that of 
the negroes -, his nofe was ihorr, though not 
very flat, his lips fmall, and his teeth as 
white as ivory. In his ears he wore va- 
rious feathers and fhells, an ^ornament on 
C 3 which 



4? T H E N E W 

which he feemed to lay no fmall value ; in 
other refpedts he was naked^ 

Robinlbn, who had a proper regard for- 
decency, would not go to fupper, though 
hunger called him prefiingly, until he had 
fitted a fkin for his new gueft^ which ferved 
him by way of apron. He then made iigns 
to him to fit down beiide him and eat his 
fupper* Friday, as we iliall now call him, 
approaches Robinfon with all the tokens 
imaginable of refpedt and gratitude -, he 
falls down on his face before him, and places 
the foot of his deliverer on his own neck, as 
he had done before. 

RobinfoDj whofe heart could fcarce contain 
his joy on having found at length a compa- 
nion and a friend, which he had fo long and 
earneftly wiihed for, would have been glad 
to exprefs it by a thoufand marks of kind- 
Defs s but, not knowing the charader of his 
new gueft, he thought it prudent, for his 
own fecurity, to keep him in a Hate of re- 
fpedful fubjedtion, to receive his homage as 
due to him, and, in a word, to adt as his 

fove- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

fovcreign for fome time. He made him, 
therefore, underfland by figns that he would 
take him under his prored:ion, but on con- 
dition of perfedt obedience ; that he fhould 
perform whatever he was ordered, and abftain 
from every thing which he, his lord and 
mafter, fhould, of his good will and pleafurc, 
forbid him. While he inftrudted him thus 
by iigns, he pronounced the word Cacique, 
Fortunately he remembered to have once 
heard that the favages of South America call 
their chiefs and princes by that name. 

By this word Friday underftood, much 
better than by the figns which accompanied 
it, what his mafter meant ; and, to fhew 
that he accepted the condition of obeying, 
he repeated the word Cacique feveral times 
with a loud voice, intimating that he ap- 
plied it to Robinfon, and fell down proftrate 
at his feet once more. To iignify what re- 
fpedl he bore to the royal authority, he put a 
fpear into Robinfon's hands, and fixed the 
point againft his own breaft, fhewing and 
acknowledging thereby that his mafter had 
C 4 the 



50 T II E N E V/ 

the power of life and death over h'm, Ro- 
binfon, with the dignity of a monarch, held 
out his hand to blm^j alTiinng hini of his pro- 
tection, and ordered him again to fic down 
befide him and eat his fupper. Friday, out 
or refpedl, iat down on the ground, while 
K.obinibn was placed on a ieat of turf. 

HerCj my dears, you may rce an example 
of the nrlt beginning of kingly power in the 
world. Mqu^ who excelled others in wif- 
dom, fcrength, and courage, were the firft 
kings. Vv'^eak men implored the'prctedcion. 
aod help of the Wronger, either to defend 
them from the danger of wild beafts, which-' 
Were, in early times, more numerous than at 
|)refent, or to fecure themfelves againd the 
injuftice of violent men. In return, they 
cfromifed to fubmit entirely to them, and ta 
pay them every year a certain part of their 
fruits and Hocks, that the protedors, not 
having to provide for their ov^^n fubfldence, 
might be wholly at leillire to defend their 
fubjecls. Thi=^ yearly payment, which the 
fubjecls obliged themfelves to m.ake good to 



theii" 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5I 

their king, was called by the name of tribute^ 
impoft, public taxes j and the like. Such is 
the origin both of the power and riches which 
all the different forts of rulers in the world 
enjoy, and of the duty and fubmillion which 
their fubje(5i:s pay them. 

Robinfon was now, therefore, in effe6b a 
king. The ifland was his kingdom, his la* 
mas and his fruits were his treaiure, and Fri- 
day his fubjecl ; his only one, it is true, but 
a valuable one. His parrot was the only 
courtier that he had, and almoft. ufelefs in 
that character. Ncvertheiefs, his majcfty of 
the ifland vouchfafed to defcend even to his 
vafTal as far as his dignity would permit 
him.- 

Henry. What is a vafTal ? 

Mr. BUI. The fame as a fiave. — After 
fupper, it pleafed his majedy very gracioufly 
to give orders concerning every thing thnt he 
chofe to have obferved in the ceremony of 
going to bed. It was not prudent that Fri-

mafter of the horje and fleward of the houje^

it was not prudent, I fay, that this new fer- 
vant fhould fo foon repofe in the fame cham-

it proper that he fhould pafs the night, not in 
the cave, but in the cellar. How could he 
refolve to truft his life, and the fecret of the 
fubterraneous pafTage, to a ft ranger, whofe 
fidelity, having not been yet fufficiently tried, 
was far from being eflablilhed ? He there-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

terms in the annals of Robinfon's reign, 
wbjcii have been nnade public to the whole 
v/orld many years ago. Robinfon Crufoey 
king of a whole iilaod, abfolute mafber of 
the life and death of all his fubjedls, did nor 
bluQi, in the lead, to defcend, in the pre- 
fence of Friday, to a ierviie office. He went 
to the lamas that were kept in his enclofure, 
and with his own kingly hands began to 
milk them. It was meant for the inilruc- 
tion of his prime minifter, and to fnew him 
how to do the fame, as he intended, for the 
future, to commit the care ot thisbufinefs 
to him. 

Friday, with all his attention, could not 
underftand what his mafter was doing ; for 
neither he nor his ftupid countrymen had 
ever fufpe6led that the milk of animals 
might be proper food for mian, and as whole- 
fome as it was nourifhing. He had never 
tailed any, and was agreeably furprifed at 
the fweetnefs of it, when Robinfon per- 
fuaded him to put fome to his lips for a 
trial. 

After 



54 T H E N E W 

After the fatigues which they had fuf- 
fered during the day, they both found them- 
felves in want of repofe, Robinfon, there- 
fore, ordered his Have to go to the place 
of refl which he had pointed out to hina, 
and lay down himfelf, blefling Heaven for 
having, in one day, preferved him from fo 
many dangers, and given him one of his 
fellow- creatures to be his companion, and, 
perhaps, his friend. 



ElGHTEENTi^ EVENING. 

'DICHAR'D, I am curious to know what 
Robinfon will undertake now with his 
man Friday. 

Edw, Now that he has afTiftance, he 
will be able to perform many things which 
he could not before. 

Mr. ML 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

Mr. Bill, My dear children, you will fee 
every day more clearly what great advan- 
tages man derives from fociety, and what 
reafon we have to thank Heaven for hav- 
ing fo deeply engraven on our hearts the 
inclination that leads us to feek the com- 
pany and friendfhip of our fellow- crea- 
tures. 

The firft thing that Robinfon did the 
next morning, was to go with Friday and 
examine the fpot where the favages had 
held their abominable feaft the day before. 
In their walk, they came to the place where 
the two Indians were buried, whom they 
had flain the day before. Friday pointed 
it out to his mailer, and plainly hinted that 
he was defirous of digging up the dead bo- 
dies and fatisfyinghis unnatural appetite upon 
them. Robinfon, with a look of deteftation 
and horror, fhewed him how much he dif- 
hked fuch an inclination, and, lifting up his 
fpear in a threatening manner, fignified 
to him that he would run it through 
his body if ever he touched them. Fiiday 

under- 



56 T H E N E W 

underftood his mafter's threatening, and 
fubmrtted without hefitation to his orders ; 
yet he could not conceive why he was for- 
bidden to tafte a fort of food^ of which, 
from his earlieft youth, he had always 
been extremely fond. 

They foon arrived at the place of the 
feaft. What a fight ! The ground ftain- 
cd v/ith blood ! Rones fcattered about ! 
Robinfon turns his eyes away from it, and 
ordered Friday immediately to make a hole, 
and bury thefc loathfome remains cf barba- 
rous voracity. 

While Friday was at work, according to 
his orders, Robinfon was carefully ftirring 
the afhes backwards and forwards, in the 
hopes of finding fome fire ftill' amongil 
them : but to no purpofe ; the whole was 
extinguifhed, much to Robinfon's diffatis- 
faction, who, next to the valuable gift which 
Heaven had lately made him in his compa- 
nion, had nowfcarce any thing left to wifh for, 
except a fire. While he hung his head and 
looked forrowfjlly upon thefe alhes, the re- 
mains 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

mains of fire totally cxtinguifhed, Friday, 
feeing him fo melancholy, made feveral 
figns which Robinfon did not at all com- 
prehend i then he fnatches up the hatchet, 
flies off like lightning, darts- into the wood, 
and leaves Robinfon, who knew not his de- 
fign, in the greatefl: aftonilhment polTible. 

Having followed him with his eyes as 
long as he could, *^ What can this mean ?" 
faid he ; *^ Can the ungrateful fellow intend to 
forfake me ? Can he be treacherous enough 
to take polTefiion of my dwelling-place, 
and keep me out of it by force ? Or would 
he have the barbarity to deliver me up by 
flratagem to his favage countrymen ?" — 
Horrid thought ! — Tranfported with rage, 
he feizes his fpear, and fets out in purfuit of 
the ungrateful traitor, at once to punifb 
and prevent his bafe attempts. Already he 
was running full fpeed, when, fuddenly, he 
perceived Friday returning as fail. Robinlbn 
flops in a furprife j he fees, to his no fniall 
aftonifhrnent, the imaginary traitor holding 
up in the air a fmall bundle of dried grafs, 

which 



58 T H E N E W 

which firft appeared to fmoke, and then to 
be on fire. Friday throws it down, and 
haftily gathers round it other grafs and dried 
branches, and kindles a bright clear fire, 
which fills Robinfcn with joy and aftonifh- 
ment. He then underftood the reafon of 
Friday's fudden abfence. Not able to con- 
tain his joy, he flies, with tranfport, to Fri- 
day, embraces him with ardour and affec- 
tion, and, in his own mind, afks him par- 
don, a thoufand times, for the injurious fuf- 
picions that he had entertained of him. 

Edw. But where could Friday have found 
fire? 

Mr, Bill, He had haftened into the 
wood on purpofe to cut two dry branches. 
Thefe he had rubbed together with fuch 
dexterity and difpatch, that they took fire 
quickly. He then wrapped them up in 
dry grafs, and, running fwiftly with this 
bundle held up in the air^ the fire foon 
kindled the grafs, and broke out in a blaze. 

Mr, Mered, Here, again, Robinfon ap- 
pears to me to be very much to blame. 

Rich. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

Ricb, In what refpedt, pray ? 

Mr, Mered. In this j that, without hav- 
ing any fufEcient proof of Friday's trea* 
chery, he forms, in an inftant, the blacked 
fufpicion of him. How is it pollible to be 
fo exceflively diftruftful ? 

Ricb, What he feared might very well 
be true ; fo that he had a right to be upon 
his guard againfl: Friday. 

Mr. Mered. Underftand me right, my 
dear little friend. I do not blame him ei- 
ther for thinking it poflible that he was be- 
trayed by Friday, or for running after him 
to prevent the fatal defigns that he might 
have formed. This precaution was allow- 
able, nay necefTary, with refpedl to a perfon 
totally unknown to him. But what I am 
angry with him for, is, that he never 
doubted a moment the truth of his odi- 
ous fufpicions y that he fuffered himfelf to 
be tranfported with rage 3 that he was fo 
wholly mallered by this paffion, as never 
even once to think that Friday's intentions 
might be harmlefs. Now, our diftruft of 

other 



6d t h e n e w 

other men fhould never go fo far a5 thaf^ 
untefs we had already received certain proofs 
of thdr treachery/ In a doubtful cafe, let 
us fee the evil of another man — till then- 
let us judge well of him. 

Mr. Bill, A good maxim. Attend to it,. 
my dear children, that you may put it in 
pradlice hereafter. 

Robinfon, as I told you, was tranfported 
with joy to find his ill fufpicions ground- 
lefs, and himfelf onc^ more in poiTefiion of 
fire, of which he bad been fo long deprived^ 
and which he had fb long and fo earneftly 
wilhed for. He delights to behold the 
waving motion of the fiamics. At laft he 
fnatches up a burning branch, and haftens> 
with Friday to the cave. 

He indantly lights up a large fire, and 
places potatoes round it to road. He next 
runs to his flock, chufes out a young lama, 
kills it, and, having fkinned and cut it up, 
puts a quarter of it on the fpit, which he 
inftrudts Friday how to turn. 

While he is thus employed, Robinfon 

cuts 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 6l 

cuts off a piece from the bread of the lama. 
He then peels a few potatoes, bruifes and 
grinds fome maize between two flat ftones 
to make flour of it, and puts the whole into 
one of his pots, which, after he had pour- 
ed in a fufficient quantity of water, not for- 
getting fait, he fets over the fire. 

Geo, I know what he was going to make 
— ibme broth. 

Mr, Bill, The very thing. He had not 
tailed any for eight years pafl. You may 
guefs how much he longed for fome. 

Friday looked on while all thefe prepa- 
rations were making, but did not under- 
ftand to what purpofe they were made. He 
was acquainted, indeed, with the cuftom of 
roafting meat , but, as to all the reft of Ro- 
binfon's ^rookery, he was entirely in the 
dark. He knew not even the effedb which 
fire would produce on a veflTel full of wa- 
ter. The pot began to boil juft as Robin- 
fon went into the cave upon fome occafion 
or other. Friday, furprifed at this odd ap- 
pearance, had no idea what could thus put 

the 



62 T H E N E W 

the water in motion. But when he faw it 
bubble up and boil over the fides, he ima- 
gined, in the fimplicity of his heart, that 
there muft be fonne living creature at the 
t)Ottonn of the pot, which occafioned this 
tunnult in the water ; and, therefore, left it 
ihould boil away entirely, he put his hand 
in to feize the creature, whatever it was ; 
but, inftead of finding that, he felt fonae- 
thing which made hinn roar loud enough to 
ihake the whole hillock. 

Robinfon was ftartied, on hearing him 
cry out. His firft notion was that the fa- 
vages had furprifed them, and that Friday 
was already taken. Fear, and the natural 
inftindb of felf-prefervation, urged him to 
efcape, and fave his life by the fecret paf- 
fage under ground •, but he quickly re- 
jedbed this idea, confidering how bafc it 
would be thus to abandon his fubjedl, or ra- 
ther friend. Without hefitating, therefore, 
he fallied forth from the cave, firmly refolv- 
cd to Ihed the laft drop of his blood, if ne~ 

cefiary. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63 

ceffary, in refcuing Friday, once more, from 
the hands of his barbarous enemies. 

Mr. Mered. Now I like you, my friend 
Robinfon. 

Mr, BilL He fprings out, with his fpear 
in his hand ; but, to his utter aftonilhment, 
finds Friday all alone, crying, twifting him- 
felf about, and making a thoufand wry 
faces. Robinfon ftood motionlefs, not 
knowing what to think -, at length he found, 
after a few figns, by way of explanation, 
that all this outcry was occafioned by poor 
Friday's fcalding hir. hand. 

Robinfon had no fmall difficulty in quiet- 
ing him. But that you may know, what 
Robinfon did not learn until a year after, 
when they were both able to underftand 
cack other ; that you may know, I fay, why 
Friday had made fuch a noife and fo 
much ado, I muft firft inform you what no- 
tions ignorant people, in fome countries, 
who have had no inftrudion in their child, 
hood, commonly entertain when an accident 
Vol. III. D hap- 



64 T H E N E W 

happens to them of which they know not 
the reafon. 

Thefe poor people imagine that fome 
invifible being, or fome fpirit, is the caufe of 
every thing for which they cannot/ afTign a 
reafon. According to them, this fpirit never 
does any thing but by the orders of a perfon 
to whofe fervice it is bound. They diilin- 
guiih, by a particular name, thofe whom- 
they fuppofe to pofTefs fuch a power over 
one or m.ore fpirits -, if it be a man, they 
call him a conjurer ; if a woman, a witch. 

For inftance, in fome places, if an ignorant 
countryman has either of his cattle fall fud- 
denly ill, and cannot guefs its diforder, he, 
perhaps, will be weak enough to think that 
fome old perfon in the neighbourhood has 
bewitched the beaft -, that is, made it fall 
fick by means of an evil fpirit. 

Charlotte, Yes, papa; jufl fo Nanny, 
our dairy-maid, faid the- other day, when 
one of the cows went dry all of a fudden. 

Mr, BilL My dear Charlotte, you fnould 

try 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

try to convince the poor girl of her error ; it 
will certainly be better for her to be unde- 
ceived. 

If, on the one hand^ ignorant people give 
credit to thefe filly notions, there are not 
wanting, on the other, iinpoflors who turn 
fuch credulity to their own advantage, and 
cunningly trick thofc out of their money 
who are fo weak as to believe in witchcraft, 
or conjuring : for, by pretending to the 
art, they confirm the others in the notion 
that there is really fuch a thing. Under 
the name of conjurers and fortune-tellers, 
they promife, with an air of confident gra- 
vity, to break the charm, and force the evil 
fpirit to loofe its hold ; but they always de- 
mand, for their trouble, a certain recom- 
penfe, which is to be paid them before- 
hand. In return for this, they amufe their 
employers with empty words, ridiculous 
grimaces, unmeaning geftures, and nonfen- 
fical mummery. U the bead's illnefs 
ceafes of ics own accord, -the fortune-teller 
triumphs, and the credulous man, whom he 
D 2 ha5 



66 T H E N E W 

kas deceived, is difpofed, more than ever, t© 
be the dupe of fuch impofture. On the con- 
trary, if the ficknefs gets the better, and the 
beaft dies, the conjurer will, by his evafions 
and unintelligible cant, innpofe on the igno- 
rant owner, who will afterwards be as rea- 
dy as ever to confult a fortune-teller upoa 
the fame occafion. 

In proportion as men's underftandings are 
narrowed by prejudice and darkened by ig» 
norancc, the more they are inclined to this 
ridiculous fuperftition: you may imagine, 
therefore, that it is pretty generally received 
amongft favage nations. Whatever ^crofs 
accidents happen to them, of which their 
weak reafon cannot point out the caufe, they 
attribute them to evil fpiritsj and this was 
exa6tly Friday's cafe. 

He had never heard it faid, nor difcovered 
by his own experience, that water could be 
made to boil ; nor had he ever felt the ef- 
fe6l of it in that Hate, by putting his hand 
into it i fo that he could not conceive whence 
that acute and fudden pain proceeded, which 

he 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 
he felt on touching the boiling water, and, 
therefore, firmly believed that there was 
enchantment in it, and that Robinfon was 
SL conjurer. 

1 am going to put you on your guard, 
my dear children, that you may not be de- 
ceived in thefe matters. You will often, 
in the courfe of your lives, have occafion to 
fee effects of which you will not be able to 
difcover the caufes. You will meet with 
jugglers, perfons who deal in flight of 
hand, who will frequently furprife you with 
the ingenious tricks and devices that they 
ihew, but oftencx^ by the dexterity with 
which they perform them. For inftance, 
they will change, to all appearance, a bird 
into a moufe ; they will cut a bird's head off, 
and afterwards fhevv it to you alive and 
well ; in fhort, they will perform feveral 
tricks of the fame nature, and you fhall ne- 
ver be able, with the greateft: attention, to 
find out the manner of performing them. 
If, onfuchoccafions, you (hould be tempted 
to believe that there is witchcraft in the

matter, remember Friday, awd be afTured 
that you are in the fame error with him> 
and take that for fupernatural;> which, when 
explained, appears perfectly, natural and ea- 
fy. But, to give you a proper idea of this 
fubjed, we will, at fome convenient oppor- 
tunity, Hiew you one or two of thefe tricks, 
and, at the fame time, explain to you how 
they are performed, that you may be able 
to form a judgment of all others of the 
fame nature. 

Robinfon, as I told you before, did not 
eafily fucceed in comforting Friday, and 
perfuading him to take his place again at 
the fpit. He confented to it, however, at 
lad, but could not help looking ftill at the 
pot with a mixture of curioHty and horror. 
As to Robinfon, whom he took for a fuper- 
natural being, he could not lift his eyes to- 
wards him without ihewing the moft timo- 
rous refped:. What confirmed him in his 
opinion was his mailer's ruddy complexion 
and long beard, which gave him an appear- 
ance 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

ance fo different from that of Friday and his 
tawny, beardlefs countrymen. 

Edw. Have the favages of South Ame- 
rica no beard ? 

Mr, Bill, No ; and it has been Jong 
thought that they were beardlefs by nature. 
But fome pretend lately to have obfcrved 
that the reafbn of their feeming to have no 
beard, is th^ir taking the greateft care ima- 
ginable to pluck it up as it grows. 

But the broth, the potatoes, and the roaft 
meat, were now ready. As they had no 
fpoons, Robinfon poured out the broth in 
two pipkins, but nothing could induce Fri- 
day fo much as to taile it -, he had not the 
Icaft doubt of its being an enchanted liquor. 
It made him fhudder to fee Robinfon fup it 
with fo much appearance of fatisfadion y but 
he helped himfelf to the roaft meat and po- 
tatoes, which made him amends. 

You may eafily imagine how delicious 

thefc nourifbing vi6tuals, dreft properly on 

the fire, muft feem to Robinfon. They 

made him forget all his paft troubles and 

D 4 hard- 



70 T H E N E W 

hardfhips. He imagined himfelf not rn ^ 
defert; ifland, but tranfported to fome popu- 
lous country. Thus Providence, in an in- 
ilant, by a flow of unexpeded happi nels, 
cures thofe wounds which have been nnade 
in our hearts, and which, though intended 
for our good, the lenfe ofprefcnt pain makes 
us ever regard as the moft incurable evils. 
I hardly need tell you, that Robinfon, in 
that happy moment, remembered the Gi- 
yer of all good Things, and thanked him 
from the bottom of his heart. 

The meal being finifhed, Robinfon re- 
tired to meditate ferioufly on the happy 
change of his fituation. Every thing round 
him wore a more fmiling face. He was 
no longer folitary ; he had a companion, 
with whom, it is true, he was not able to 
converfe as yet j but the very company of 
this man was fome fatisfadion to him, and 
promifed to afford him the mod valuable 
aflillance. Befides, being no longer de- 
prived of fire, he might enjoy as wholefome 
and agreeable visuals as he could wiili, 

" What 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7I 
"What is there to hinder you now," faid he, 
** from living contented and happy ? En- 
joy in peace the many benefits which you 
have received from Heaven. You have 
fruits in abundance, and a numerous flock, 
which will always be more than fufficient 
to furnifh your table with whatever you de- 
fire. Make amends to yourfclf now, by 
cafe and good cheer, for the fatigues you have 
fuffered, and the fcantinefs of your provi- 
fions for thefe feveral years pad. let Fri- 
day, who is young and (lout, work for you. 
His fervices you have a right to claim, as 
you have faved his life at the rifk of your 



own." 



Here an idea occurred to him which total- 
ly changed the complexion of his thoughts. 

" But," faid he to himfelf, '' what, if you 
were very foon to fee an end of all this prof- 
perity ? If Friday were to die ? If your 
fire were to go out again ?'• This refle^lion 
made his blood curdle with horror, 

" And if, m.oreover, by being accuftom- 

cd to an eafy, delicate, inadlive life, you 

D 5 were 



72 T H E N E W 

were to render yourfelf incapable of fupport- 
ing a hard, folitary, and laborious way of 
living, fuch as you have already experien- 
ced ? If you fhould be forced to return to 
it ?" — He fighed heavily. 

" To what, then, are you principally in- 
debted for getting rid of the many faults 
and weaknelTes which once difgraced you ? 
Is it not to the fober and laborious life which 
circumftances forced you to purfue ? And 
now, by indulging yourfelf in fenfuality and 
idlenefs, you would run the rifk of lofing 
that health and flrength of body and mind 
which temperance and exercife have pro- 
cured you. Heaven forbid 1" With 

thefe words, he rofe haflily, and walked 
about in a thoughtful mode before the 
mouth of his cave. Meantime, Friday put 
away the remains of the dinner, and, by his 
mafter's order, went to milk the lamas. 

Robinfon continued to reafon with him- 
felf. "If you were to renounce labour 
and temperance, you would foon forget 
both the adverfity which you furmounted, 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

and the friendly hand which afTifted you. 
Very foon you would become ungrateful, 
prefumptuous, and, perhaps, impious.'* 
Horrid idea ! and falling on his face to the 
ground, he prayed to be preferved from fo^ 
dreadful a (late of depravation. This led; 
him to take a refolution as prudent as it was 
unalterable. 

" I will," faid he, '* partake of the gift3^ 
of Fleaven, but always with the greatelt 
temperance. The mcfl fimple vi6tuals>

fions be ever fo abundant and various,- 1

quences of thefe voluntary facrificesj his 
countenance, therefore, becoming more fe- 
rene, fpoke the pleahng fentiments of z 
heart overflowing with joy. But he was 
fufficiently acquainted, from experience, 
with the inconflancy of the human heart, 
not to be on his guard againft the fickle- 
nefs of his own. He thought it bed to 
make fome vifible mark, which, frequently 
meeting his eyes, might make him recollect 
his laudable refoiutions every day. For 
thispurpofe, he engraved, with his hatchetj 
in the rock over the entrance of his cave, 
thefe words — Labour and 'J'emperance. 

My dear children, I give you until to-

You will communicate your thoughts to me,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 



NINETEENTH EVENING. 

T> OBINSON had never been info happy 
a fituation fince his arrival on the 
ifland as he was now. The only thing 
that remained to trouble him, was his ap- 
prehenfion left the favages fhould return to 
feek for their two countrymen, in which 
cafe he might probably be expofed to the 
neceflity of fhedding blood. He fhuddered 
at the thought of being reduced, once more, 
to the dreadful choice of either deftroying 
his fellow- creatures or perifhing cruelly 
himfelf. 

Things being, therefore, in this fituation, 
it was incumbent on him to lajbour for his 
fecurity, and put himfelf into a ftate of 
defence. He had long been defirous of for- 
tifying his habitation ftill more; but, while 
he was alone, the execution of this defign 
appeared impoITible, Now, with the af- 

fiftancc 



76 THE NEW 

fiftance of a companion, he thought hinifelf 
capable of undertaking it. He mounts, 
therefore, to the top of his hillock, to form 
a plan of further fortification, which he 
very foon did, as his fituation enabled him 
to have the whole ground under his eyes at 
one view. He refolved, therefore, on the out- 
fide of the barricade of trees which enclofed 
his habitation, to dig a broad deep trench, 

' 'the inner bank of which fhould be defended 

^ with a ftrong row of paling. 

He, moreover, conceived the defign of 
dividing the neighbouring rivuiet. into two 
branches, one of which fhould run in this 
trench, and the other through the middle 
of the enclofed fpace before his cave, that^ 
in cafe of a fiege, he might not be in want of 
water. 

It was not eafy to make Friday compre- 
hend, by figns, the whole of this plan; but 
as foon as he had fome idea of ir, he. ran to 
the fea-fide, and came back loaded with 
great ihells, and with fiat and fharp ftones> 
fit to lerve for digging. They both, there- 
fore, fell to work immediately.

ROBINSON CRUSOEo^ 77 

I dare fay you can eafily imagine that 
this was no (light undertaking. The trenchg 
to be of any ufe, mufl: be, at lead, fix (ctt 
deep and eight broad ; the length might be 
about four fcore or one hundred yards. 

To execute fuch an undertaking as this 
without any inflrument of iron — no pickaxe 
— no fhovel — think what a difficulty it muft 
be. Befides, it required little lefs than four 
hundred pales -, to cut thefe and Ihape them 
with only one hatchet of ftone, was a labo- 
rious tafk.. Laftly, in order to turn the ri- 
vulet into this trench, there was a neceflity 
of digging a canal, which, in one pla-cCj. 
mufl crofsa rifing ground; and this, to crown 
the diiaiculty of the work, it was abfolutely 
necefTary to cut through. 

All thefe obllaclcs did not difcourage our 
friend Robinfon, who had taken a refolution 
that was not to be fhaken. By leading a 
life of temperance and continual labour, he 
was, in the execution of difficult undertak- 
ings, mafler of a degree of courage which Is 
not pofTelled by men brought up in idle- 

nefs. 



78 T H E N E W 

nefs, ufed to delicate living, and enervated 
by effeminacy. IVith God's help^ and with 
J)erfe'vera7jcey was his motto, in beginning a 
work of labour and time \ and> yi^u know, 
when once he was determined on a matter, 
he never relied until he had completely 
finiihed it. 

He was the fame on this occafion. Fri- 
day and he worked every day with equal plea- 
fure and earneftnefs, from funrife to funfet; fo 
that, in fpite of the awkwardnefs of their in- 
flruments, they advanced the work every day 
furprifingly. Fortunately, during two whole 
months the favages never appeared ; a con- 
trary wind hindered them from coming over 
to Robinfon's ifland. All this time he was 
able to work without being obliged to take 
any precautions againft the fear of an at- 
tack. 

Robinfon, who was earneftly defirous of 
being able to converfe with Friday, took the 
opportunity to teach him a few words of 
Englifli every day, while they were both em- 
plo}'ed at work ; and Friday, on his part, 

was 



HGBINSON CRUSOE, 79 

was fo attentive, that in a fliort time he made 
a confiderable progrefs. Robinfon took the 
moil natural and eafy way to communicate 
the language to him : whenever it could 
conveniently be done, he placed the objeft 
before his eyes,and then pronounced the name 
of it dlftindtly ; but when it was neceflary 
to communicate the names of things which 
could not be made perceptible in this manner, 
Robinfon accompanied the name v/ith gef- 
tures and figns fo expreffive that Friday could 
not poflibly mifunderftand. And, by thefe 
means, in lefs than fix months he was able 
to explain himfelf tolerably well in Eng- 
glifh. 

This was a frefh addition to RobinfonV 
happinefs. Hitherto Friday had been no 
better than a dumb man to him ; now they 
are able to communicate their thoughts to 
each other as friends. How frivolous did 
the pleafure feem which Robinfon ufed to 
enjoy in the fenfelefs chatter of his parrot, in 
comparifon to the real fatisfadion which he 
felc at prefent I 

The 



8o T H E 1^ E W 

The more he knew Friday the more he 
liked him. The young man was frank and 
good-natured, and had the greateft aftedion 
poflible for his mailer : fo that Pvobinfon 
grew fonder of him every day, and made him 
take Ihare of his cave, that they might pafs 
the nights together. 

In lefs than two months they iinifhed the 
trench ; and now they faw themfelves capable 
of defying the favages, or even of beating 
them ofFlhould they venture to attack them ; for 
before any one of them could erofs the trench 
and the paling, it was an eafy matter for the 
two befieged to fend an arrow or a fpear 
through his body. They looked upon them- 
felves, therefore, as fufficiently guarded againil 
all danger of this Ibrt. 

Robin fon and Friday, being one day near 
the fea-fide upon a rifmg ground, from 
whence they had an extenfive profpedt all 
over the fea, perceived, at a diftance, fome 
ifiands, which appeared like fmall clouds. 
Friday fixed his eyes attentively on that quar- 
ter. All of a fuddcn he flarts up, falls a 

dancing. 



ROBINSON CRUS^OE. 8l 

dancing, and thro;\^ himfelf into fo many 
extravagant attitudes, that Robinfon thought 
he was feized with a fudden frenzy. "Good! 
good !" cried he, flill continuing to ikip 
about. Robinfon aiked him the caufe of this 
extraordinary tranfport. " Yonder is my 
countryl*' anfwered he, almoft breathiefs with 
joy i " that is where my people live !** His 
countenance, his eyes, his geftures, all ex- 
prefTed the love which he bore his country, 
and his defire to fee it once more. Robin- 
fon was not at all pleafed with this difpofition 
of Friday's : it was certainly a laudable one, 
as it Ihewed that he loved his country, his 
friends, and his relations ; neverthelefs, Ro- 
binfon feared left he fhould leave him fome 
day or other, and return to his own ifland. 
In order to be certified on this head, he re- 
folved to found his intentions, and, therefore, 
began the following converfation, which will 
Ihew you the excellent difpofition of Fri- 
day. 
Robinfon, Would you be glad^ then» to^ 

returi^ 



tz T H E N r W 

return to your countrymen^ and live amonglf 
them ? 

Friday,. Oh, yes f I fhould be very glad 
to fee them agam^. 

Rob. Perhaps you long to eat man^s fleih 
with them again ? 

Frid. No, certainly. 1 would teach them 
not to be favages, but to live on milk and 
the flefh of animals, and, above all, to abftain 
from eating men* 

Rob. But, perhaps^, they would eat you^- 
felf?' 

Frid, No, they will never do fo. 

Rob. And yet they have devoured man-y 
jmen, and will many more flill. 

Frid, Ay, but only their enemies. 

Rob, Could you make a canoe that would 
carry you to them ? 

Frid. Yes, certainly. 

Rob, Well, then, make one, and fet out 
when you pleafe.— How I you look down \ 
What is the matter with you ? Why do you 
look fo forrowful? 

Frid, 



ROBINSOl^ CRUSOE. 83 

Frid, Becaufe my dear maftec is angry 
-with me. 

Rob, Angry 1 What makes you think fo? 

Frid, Becaufe he want^ to fend me away. 

Rob. Well, but did not you wiih juft now 
to be in your own country ? 

Frid. Yes j but if my mafter does not go 
there, I will not go — no — no more. 

Rob, Your people would take me for an 
€nemy and eat me, fo that you mufl go hy 
yourfelf. — But, what is the meaning of this? 
Why do you draw the hatchet from my iide, 
and put it into my hand ? Why do you lay 
down your head, and ftretch out your neck? 
What would you have me do ? 

Frid. Kill me : I would rather die than 
be fent away from you. 

Saying thefe words he ftied a flood erf 
tears. 

Robinfon was melted with tendernefs^ and 
enibraced him. Be comforted, my dear Fri- 
day ; I love you too well to wifli a fepara- 
tion from you : what I faid was only to try 
you, and to know if your friendship was 

equal 



84 THE N E W 

equal to. mine. Thefe tears of joy and af- 
fedion which you fee me Ihed, are pledges 
of my fincerity. Come to my arms once 
more. Let us dry up our tears, and never 
part. 

To diffipate the forrowful ideas that he 
had excited in Friday *s mind, he fpoke to 
him again of a canoe, and afked him feveral 
quefiions upon that fubje(5t. . Being fatisfied 
with his anfwers, he -took him by the hand, 
and led him to fee the canoe that he had 
begun fome years ago. Friday, on examin- 
ing it, laughed heartily to iind the work fo 
little advanced for the time. The tree was 
fcarce cut into the third part of its thicknefs. 
Robinfon a&ed him what fault he found in 
the work. Friday anfwered, that he could 
fee a vafl deal of time, had been loil:, and la- 
bour thrown away, which might have been 
fparedj for that a tree like this could be hol- 
lowed in a few days with fire, and that much 
better than by an}^ other means whatfoever. 
At thefe words Robinfon was traniported with 
joy : he fancied the canoe already finifhed •, 

he 




c^tyi^^ti:^ 




1^ O B t N S O N CRUSOE. 85 

Mt fancied himfelf already failing in it on 
the open fea ; already, after a happy voyage, 
he fancied himfelf landed on the continent, 
and converfing with Europeans. Ho^ de- 
lightful were all thefe ideas ! He relblved 
•that the work fliould be begun the very 
next naorning by break of day. . 

Geo. Ah ! then, our annufement will foon 
-be at an end. 

Mr, Bill, How fo ? 

Geo, When he has a boat he will foon 
fet fail, and then, when he comes home, 
papa will have nothing more to tell us about 
Hobinfon. 

Mr, BUI. And would you not give up 
that amufement for Robinfon's fake? Would 
you not freely procure him, at that fmali 
price, relief from the hardfhips he labours 
under in his defert ifle ? 

Geo, Why, yes — very true — I did not 
think of that. 

Mr. Bill. Befides, who knows wkat may 
happen ? Whether he may not be obliged 
to put off the working at the canoc^ or his 

Vol., III. E own 



86 T H E N E W 

own departure ? The future is very uncer- 
tain; it brings with it fo many changes, 
that, for the mod part, it deceives our ex- 
pedations. We often fee our befl founded 
hopes difappointed, and it is the part of 
wifdoai to exped and be prepared for thefe 
viciflitudes. 

Robinfon, who had experienced them fe- 
veral times already, returned home, per- 
fedlly refigned to whatever a good and wife 
Providence fhould order with refped to the 
accomplifhment of his wifh, being perfua- 
ded that his heavenly Father knew better 
than he what was for his real interefl ; and 
fuch, I hope, would be our way of thinking 
in fimilar circumftances.

ROBINSON GRUSOE. 87 



TWENTIETH £V£NI]0#» 

Ji/JR* BILL, My clear children, I men- 
tioned to you laft night, that, in the 
affairs of life, the bed founded hopes 
frequently vanilh and end in difappoint- 
ment. The adventures of Robinfon Crufoe 
have furnifhed you with frequent inflances 
of this truth, and you have learned, I 
hope, from them, and the inftrudions that 
I have given you, to bear calmly whatever 
events may happen contrary to your expec- 
tations. But I have fomething farther to 
propofe to you, while we are upon the fub- 
je6b of felf-denial, as proper to accompany 
the practice of that virtue. It is an excr- 
cife of the greateft utility, and, with your 
confent, 1 will mention it. 

"The Children. Oh, yes, papa ! yes, papa ! 

Mr. Bill If, then, you defire in the fu- 
ture part of your lives to labour in flrength-

ening your bodies, and exalting the powers 
of your minds, to the end that you may be- 
come diftinguifhed characters, and capable 
of. contributing effedlually to the happinefs 
of your fellow-creatures, and thereby to en- 
.hance your own, I offer to you, for that 
purpofe, the following plan. 

I will, on my fide, read to you, for your 
.inftrudion, the .writings of the. ancient phi- 
lofophers who were preceptors to the illuf- 
.trious perfons whom you fo much admired 
when I went over the ancient hiftory with 
you. Thefe writings contain the precepts 
which fuch philofophcrs gave to their fcho- 
lars, and by the obfervance of which their 
fcholars became great men. Every week! 
will write down one of thefe precepts upon 
a table covered with white paper j I will 
explain it to you, and fhew you how, in 
the courfe of the week, you may acquire, 
in an eafy and agreeable manner, the prac- 
tice of it. Yet, you muft not expefl 
that this can be done without fometimes 
.i^colling you a facrifice : you muft, at one 

time^ 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

time, refolve to deprive yourfelf of a fa- 
vourite amufementj at another, to bear 
with things very difagreeable. This is the 
true way to acquire that mafculine courage 
which is to alTift us in conquering our ir- 
regular inclinations, and in preferving a 
prudent equanin:iity upon all occafions of 
lofs, difappointnnent, and danger. As to 
us who are advanced in life, we fhall not 
be contented with merely pointing out 
the path to you, we will walk in it our- 
felves, and be your guides : in fhort, we 
fhall advife you to nothing of which we (hall 
not at the fame time fhew you the examjple. 
What fay you, my dear children, to this 
propofal ? 

1'he Children, We agree to it; we agree 
to ic. 

Mr. BilL Very well, then we fhall begin 
the firft convenient day. Ic is now tii-^e' 
to return to Robinfon. What I hinted to 
you yeflerday merely as pofTible, did, how- 
ever, happen in reality. 

^The Cbildren,^ What was that, papa-?- 

E 3 Mr. 



9Q THE NEW 

Mr, Bill, I faid, that, whatever reafon 
Robinfon might have to hope for a proba- 
ble and fpeedy departure from his ifland, 
there might, neverthelefs, happen fome un- 
forefeen obflacle which would caufe him to 
remain on it longer. This obftacle appear- 
ed the very next day. 

On that day the rains began, and fet in with 
great violence. Robinfon, during his flay 
on the ifland, had remarked that they take 
place regularly twice a year, and always 
about the time of the equinoxes. During 
this rainy feafon, which generally lafted a 
month or two, it was impoflible to do any 
work in the open air, it rained fo hard and 
fo inceffandy. He had alfo experienced, 
that nothing was more prejudicial to the 
health than to go much out of doors, or 
to get wet during this feafon. What was 
he to do now ? He found it abfolutely 
neceifary to put off the building of the boat, 
and to find fome employment without go- 
ing out of his cave. 

What a happinefs for Robinfon, during 

thefe 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9I 

thefe wet days and the long dark evenings 
of this feafon, to have fire and light, befides 
the company of a friend, with whom, while 
they were both at work together, he might 
converfe familiarly, and fill up the weari- 
fome hours with agreeable employment ! 
Formerly, he ufed to pafs thefe dull evenings 
all alone, in the dark, and without any thing 
todoj whereas, now, fitting with Friday 
before a good fire, and cheared with the 
light of a lamp, he converfes with a fellow 
creature, and is not afraid of time hanging 
heavy upon his hands. 

He learned from Friday all the methods 
which the favages have for procuring them- 
felves any conveniency, and Robinfon, in 
his turn, taught him a thoufand things of 
which favages have not the lead idea. Thus 
they both enlarged the extent of their know- 
ledge and induftry. By mutual afliftance, 
each exerting his particular talent, theyfuc- 
ceeded in making feveralfmall pieces of work 
which would have been impoffible to either 
of them fingly ; and this convinced them 
E 4 liow 



92 T H E N E W 

how infinitely advantageous it k for men^ 
to be united by fociety, and held together^ 
as it were, by the bonds of focial affedion. 
and love of their fellow- creatures, in com- 
parifon to being difperfed, and wandering 
on thx earth, each by himfelf, like brute 
beads. 

Of the bark of trees Friday could make 
mats of a texture fufficiently fine and firm at- 
the fame time to make a fort of fluff pro- 
per for cloathing. Robinfon, having learned 
the manner of this work, made, in conjunc- 
tion with Friday, a flock fufncient for- 
cjoarhing them both. And it was no 
ihiall fatisfadlion to him that he was now 
able to quit thofe inconvenient garments 
made of hard raw hides, which he had hi- 
therto been obliged to wear. 

Friday had alfo the art of making cord- 
age out of the ftringy covering of the co- 
coa-nut and the bark of plants refembling 
flax ; and this cordage was far fuperior to 
any that Robinfon could make. He had, 
alfo, a particular method of making nets 

with 



ROBI-NSON CRUSOE. 93 

with thread ; an occupation which feenned 
to render many an evening (horc that would 
otherwife have been infupportably tedious. ■ 

During thefe fedentary employments, 
Robinfon took pains to clear up the dark-' 
nefs of his friend's underftanding. He en- 
deavoured, particularly, to give him juft 
ideas of the Supreme Being. You will ea- 
fily judge how great was Friday's ignorance^ 
and how grofs his errors upon the article of 
religion, from the following dialogue be- 
tween Robinfon and him. 

RoVmfon. Tell me, Friday, do you know 
who made the fea, the land, yourfelf, and 
all living creatures ? 

Friday. Oh, yes, very well. Tc;/^^« made 
every thing. 

Roh. Who is ToHpan ? 

Frid. He that makes the thunder. 

Rob, Well, then, who is he that makes 
the thunder ? ' 

Frid. It is a very, very old man, that lived 

before any thing elfe in the world, and he* 

makes the thunder. He is older than the 

E-5., fun^ 



94 T H E N E W 

fun, moon, or ftars ; and all the creatures 
in the world fay O to hioi (that is, accord- 
ing to Friday's meaning, worfhip him). 

Rob, Where do your countrymen go 
when they die ? 

Frid. They go to ^oupan, 

Rob, And where is Toupan ? 

Frid, He lives upon the high moun- 
lains. 

Rob, Has any man ever (^^n him upon 
thefe high mountains ? 

Frid, None but the Owokakeys (that is, 
the priefts) are allowed to go up to him. 
They fay O to him, and then they bring us 
word what he fays to them. 

Rob, Do thofe enjoy any happinefs who 
go to him after they die ? 

Frid, Oh, certainly, if they have killed 
and eaten a great many of their enemies. 

Robinfon fhuddered at this difcovery 
of an opinion as erroneous as it was 
barbarous, and from that moment he la- 
boured ferioufly to give him jufter no- 
tions both of the Supreme Being and of 

a future 



ROBINSON GRirSOE. 95 

a future llate. He taught him that God 
is an invifible being, ahnighry, infinitely 
N^ife and good; that he created all things, 
governs and upholds all things -, that he 
hinnfelf is without beginning, is every where 
prefent, knows all our thoughts, hears our 
words, and fees all our adions ; that he de- 
lights in good and abhors evil, and that he 
will make happy in this .life, and in tliat 
which is to come, thofe who endcavoiii^> 
with all their heart, and with all their ftrength^ 
to become better and better every day. 

Friday heard thefe fublime and comfort- 
ing do6lrines with a refpedtful attention, 
and lodged them deeply in his memory. 
As the zeal of the mailer to inftruct was 
equal to the fcholar's defire to learn,, the 
latter was very foon clearly convinced of 
die principal truths of religion, at lead as far 
as the former was capable of explaining 
them to him. From that moment Friday 
efteemed himfelf infinitely happy in having 
been tranfported from his own country to 
d^is iQandi nor did the reBedion efcane

him, that the intentions of Providence to- 
wards him were favourable in fufFcring him 
to fall into the hands of his enemies, fince, 
had it not been for that event, he fhould 
never have known Robinibn. " Thus," add- 
ed he, " I fhould always have lived in ig- 
norance of the Being who is all-good and 
all-powerful/' 

Ever afterwards Robinfon accuftomed 
himfelf to pray, in Friday's prefence; and it 
would have been an affedling fight to fee with 
what joy and devotion mixed the poor 
Indian repeated the words of his mailer's 
prayers. They were now both of them as 
happy, in their way of life, as two men can 
be who are totally feparated from the reft of 
the human fpecies. 

The dull, rainy feafon pafled away with* 
out appearing heavy to them. The fky 
now cleared up, the winds abated, the 
ftormy clouds were difperfed ; Robinfon 
and his companion once more breathed the 
mild and temperate air of fpring, and felt 
their fpirits enlivened afrefh : they nowj 

there- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 
thercfore> joyfully fet about the important 
work which they had defigned before the 
rains came on. 

Friday, as being head carpenter in this 
bufinefs, hollowed the trunk of the tree by 
means of fire. This method was fo effec- 
tual and expeditious, that Robinfon could 
not help blaming his own ilupidity for ne- 
ver having thought of rr. But he fatis- 
fied himfelf by faying, " Yet, if I had 
thought of it, I could not have made ufe 
of it, as I had no fire." 

You will excufe me from defer ibing to 
you the daily progrefs that they made in 
this work, as an account fo particular would 
have nothing in it either entertaining or in- 
flrudive. I ihall only tell you, that the 
boat, which Robinfon alone would fcarce 
have finifhed in feveral years, was entirely 
completed, with the afliftance of Friday, in 
two months. Nothing was wanting now 
but a fail, which Friday undertook to pro* 
vide, and oars, which Robinfon promifed to 
furnifb. 

Rkb, 



§8 THE N F W 

Ricb. Ay 1 how could he make a fail ?^ 
H^ ihouM have cloth for that. 

Mr, BilL He certainly did not know 
ht)W to make cloth ; nor had he a loom ; but, 
as I told you before, he could make mats 
of the bark oftrees> and this matting the fa- 
vages ufe for fails'. 

They both fimfhed their tafKS nearly at 
the fame times Robinfon the oars, and 
Friday the fail. But now, though the ca« 
noe was fiitifhed, it was flill tabe launch- 
ed. 

Henry, What is that, papa? 

Mr, BitL Were not you with your uncle - 
once to fee a fhtp launched at Deptford ? 

Henry. Oh ! yes j I remember. 

Mr, Bill, Then you muft have obferved, . 
that theftiip refts upon a hollow frame of 
wood-work, which is called the flocks. 
When they flrike away the fide ftays that ; 
keep the veflel from moving, it Aides along 
the frame (which* is now called the ilah- 
chions) into the water, and this is termed 
launching a fhip, 

Unfor- 



ROBINSaN CRUSOE. 99 

Unfortunately, the place where they h-ad 
made the boat wa^ more than half a mile 
from the fea-fide. How were they to get io 
thither ? Mud they carry it, or drag it, or 
roll it along ? Each of thefe ways feemed 
equally impradlicable ; the canoe was too 
heavy to be {o managed. What are they 
to do ? Here they were at a full ftop : how 
were they to get over it ? 

Edw. Why, Robinfon need only have 
made a couple of levers, like that with 
which he rolled two great pieces of rock 
out of his cave when he was all alone. 

Mr. Bill, He had not forgot the ufe 
that might be made of lb fimple an inftru- 
raent; in fad, he had recourfe to it upon 
this occafion ; but the method was lb tedi- 
ous, that Robinfon expected to be a month 
before he fhould convey the canoe to the 
fea-fide. Fortunately, he thought of ano- 
ther method, to the full as fimple, which 
is ufed by carpenters and other tradefmen^ 
in Europe, for carrying- the heaviefi: bur-- 
thens. They ufe rollers foF the purpofe. 

Henry » 



100 THE NEW 

Henry, What are rollers ? 

Mr. Bill. They are pieces of wood made 
long and round, fomething like a rolling- 
flone. They are placed under die loads 
-which are to be conveyed fronn one place 
to another. A man pufhes the load at one 
end, which yields without much refiftance, 
and moves on towards the place whither 
it is to be conveyed, the rollers turning 
under it all the while, as if of themfelves. 

Robinfon no fooner made trial of this 
method, but he was highly pleafed to fee 
with what eafe and difpatch the boat could 
be moved along, and in two days time 
it was launched in the fea. His joy v;as 
doubled when he faw that it failed wit;h the 
greateft fleadinefs. 

It only remained now to make prepara- 
tions for their departure 3 that is, to lay in a 
ftock of provifions, as much as the boat 
could carry, and then to fet fail, both being 
equally eager to begin the voyage. But 
where were they to go ? Friday's wiQies 
were to return to his native ifland i Robin- 

fon^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOl 

foil, for his part, would have been glad to 
land on the continent of South America, 
where he hoped to meet either with Spani- 
ards or other Europeans. Friday's iQand 
was only about four miles off, and the con- 
tinent was more than a dozen or fourteen. 
If they landed firll on his ifland, they went 
fome miles farther off from the continent, 
and, by fo doing, encreafed the dan- 
ger of failing thither afterwards. Friday 
knew nothing of the fea thereabouts, but 
barely to fail towards his own iOand ; he 
was quite unacquainted with the pafTage to 
the continent, and Robinfon knew it no 
better, having never failed upon thefe feas. 
At length Robinfon's uncertainty gave 
place to a fixed defire of feeking to land on 
fome civilized country. In fpite of all Fri- 
day's objedions, and whatever he could urge, 
it was determined that they fhould prepare 
to depart the next morning, andfet fail, un- 
der God's protection , with the firft favour- 
able wind, for that quarter where Friday 

expefted 



cxpedted the neareft- pact of the continenr- 
lay. 

But this is enough for to-day. It is time 
for us to make our preparation for retiring- 
to reft. 



T W E N T y-F I R S T EVENING,. 

7if^^ -J^^^^- Robinfon and Friday have now 
put all their provifions on board the* 
canoe, and the wind is favourable to them 5 
fo that, my dear children, you have now to 
bid them farewell, perhaps, for ever. Who 
knows if v/e fhall ever fee them again, or, 
more properly fpeaking, whether we fhall- 
ever hear of them more ? 

i:^he Children; Oh ! how forry we are that 
they are going away ! 

Mr. BilL Suchis thelotof men. They 

cannot 



H OBI N SON CRUSOE. IO3 

ccannot flatter themfelves that they fhill al- 
ways live with thofe who are mod dear to 
cthem. They mufV, perhaps, more than 
once, endure the torments of inevitable fepa- 
:ration. It is, therefore, wife to prepare one's 
felf beforehand for thefe partings, which are 
as painful as they are, at times, indifpen- 
fable. 

Robinfon^ on coming out of his cave for 

^the laft time. Hopped upon the top of the 

hillock to indulge meditation for a moment, 

andfufFered his companion to go on before 

him. He reviewed, in his own mind, the 

various fituations in which he had been 

'during his folitary ftay on this ifland ; and 

when he recolleded the fingular care with 

which Providence had fupported him in a 

:moft extraordinary manner, his heart was 

^moved with gratitude. He ihed t-ears oF 

joy, and, -lifting up his hands and eyes to 

Heaven, he addreiTed the Almighty with 

the moft fervent devotion. 

" Oh ! heavenly Father, how fhall 'I fuf- 
'iiciently .thank thee for all that thou had 

hitherto 



104 THE NEW 

hitherto done for me ! Unable as I am ct 
exprefs in words the whole ardor of my 
thoughts, fuffer me to manifeft them alfo 
by the lowly pofture of adoration. On my 
knees, or proftrate with my face to the 
ground, or rolling in the duft, let me, as 
it were, fmk into nothing before thee. 
But every thing is open to thy eyes; thou 
readeft my heart 5 thou feed it filled with in- 
expreflible fentiments of the livelieft grati- 
tude. This heart, which thou haft vouch- 
fafed to amend, and which breathes but 
for thee s this heart, fo often filled with for- 
row, and fo often comforted by theej this 
heart. Oh Lord I is all that I can offer thee 
in return for thy innumerable kindnelTes : 
accept it, therefore, accept it whole, and 
finifh the work which thou haft begun in it. 
Oh 1 heavenly Father, receive me in thy arms, 
to which I commit myfelf with confidence, 
and difpofe of me according to thy fatherly 
mercy. May I never forfake the road of 
virtue in which thy goodnefs has placed 
me ! Suffer me not, Oh Lord ! to abandon

govern nae according to thy wife and good 
pleafure ; I will go wherever thou Ihalt con- 
duct me. I go, with equal tranquillity and 
confidence in thee, to expofe myfelf, per- 
haps, to freili dangers. Vor.chfafe ftill to 
accompany me, and grant me thy invifible, 
but effeiftual fafeguard ! Watch over my 
immortal foul, and ftrengthen it in the trials 
to which it may be expofed ! Preferve my 
heart from weaknefs, impatience, and ingra- 
titude towards thee 1 Oh, heavenly and eter- 
nal obje6l of my foul's love, my Creator, 
my Preferver, my all, my God !*' 

Here the power of utterance yielded in 
Robinfon to the force of his feelings : with his 
face to the ground, he had only flrength to 
weep. Encouraged, however, at length, by 
fecret confolations from above, he rofe up 
and call his eyes once more upon the coun- 
try which he was going to leave, and which 
feemed, on that account, to become more 
dear to him. Like a man who is quitting his 
native land without hopes of ever feeing it 

again.

again, his moifl and forrowful eyes wander- 
ed ftill with affedion over every tree which 
had once afforded hinn IKelter or an agree- 
able Ihade, and over every one of thofe 
works which owed their being to the labour 
of his hands and the fweat of his brow. 
All thefe objedts ieemed like fo many 
friends from whom he was going to be fe- 
.parated. What were his feelings, when he 
perceived his lamas feeding at the foot of 
the hillock ! If he had not quickly turned 
his eyes from thefe dear animals, his refo- 
lution to depart would have been fliaken. 

However, at length, his fortitude got the 
better of his tendernefs ; he recovered his 
courage. With his arms open and ftretch*- 
€d out towards the country, as if he would 
have embraced it^ together with all the ob- 
jedls that it contained, " Farewell," cried 
he, with a loud voice, " farewell, ye wit- 
neffes of my pad fufferingsj for the lafl 
time farewell 1" But this lad farewell was 
loft in fobs. Lifting, once more, his eyes 
to Heaven, he W:ent on without farther h^-

fitation towards the Tea (ide. As he went 
along, he perceived his faithful Poll, who ac- 
companied him, flying befide him from 
tree to tree. He felt an irrefiflible defire of 
taking Poll with him : .he, therefore, held 
out his hand, and calls the parrot by its 
name. Poll comes flying to him as fwift 
as an arrow, lights upon his hand, runs 
fwiftly up his arm, and refts upon his flioul- 
der. Robinfon now overtook Friday, who 
was waiting for him with impatience i and 
they both went aboard without farther de- 
lay. 

It was the 30th of November, at eight 
o'clock in the morning, the ninth year 
of Robinfon's fl:ay upon this defert ifland, 
that they fet fail, with clear weather and 
a frefli and favourable breeze. They had 
hardly got a few miles out to fea before 
they met with a reef of rocks. 

Harriet. Oh ! dear, let us know firfl: what 
a reef of rocks is. 

Mr. Bill, Seamen give this name to a 

number of rocks joined together, and 

F 2 either 



I«8 T H E N E W 

either entirely covered with water, or,. In 
feme places, rifing above it. This reef 
or chain of rocks reached from a pro^ 
montory of the ifland more than fciir 
leao-ues out into the fea. It feemed dan- 
gerous to fail over thefe rocks : they, there- 
fore, tacked ; that is, placed their fail in ano- 
ther poficion, that, by taking afweep round, 
they might get on the outfide of the reef, 

Edmr Bui if the water covered this reef, 
how could they know how far it reached 
into the fea ? 

Mr. Bill, They could judge of that by 
the waves which they faw break over it ; 
for in places where there are hidden rocks 
under the water, the waves rife higher, and 
appear whiter with foam, becaufc thefe 
rocks, in (topping them, make them rife 
and break them. 

Scarce had they gained the outmoft 
point of' the reef, when, all at once, their 
canoe was carried away with as much ra- 
pidity as if they had many fails fet and 
went before a ftrong gale of wind. They 

were 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I09 

were both terrified, and made hafte to furl 
their fail, becawfe they thought they had 
been furprifed by a fmart breeze. But 
this was in vain j for the canoe was carried 
over the billows no lefs rapidly than before ; 
and from thence they concluded that they 
were in the middle of a ftrong current, 
which forced them along. 

Henry, What ! are there currents in the 
fea? 

Mr, Bill. The bottom of the fea is no 
lefs rugged and uneven than the furface of 
the land 3 and under the water there are 
mountains, hills, and vallies, as well as 
upon land. Now, the water naturally runs 
with more fwiftnefs towards the parts that 
are lower 5 whence it comes to pafs, that 
there are currents in the fea as large as the 
Thames, and often exceedingly rapid. It 
is very dangerous for fmall boats to fall in- 
to thele currents, becaufe they find it diffi- 
cult, not to fay impofTible, to get out of 
them again ; fo that they are frequently car- 
ried a hundred leagues out of their courfe. 
F 3 Rich. 



no T H E N E W 

Rich, ^ih. \ poor Robinfon, what is to 
become of you now ? 

Harriet, Why did he not flay in his 
illand ? I thought fomething would happen 
to hina. 

Mr, Bill. In undertaking this voyage, 
he cannot be accufed either of levity or 
ralhnefs. He was moved to it by reafons 
of the greateft prudence, and mofl: mature- 
ly weighed. Whatever happens to him 
now, he may look upon as a decree of Pro- 
vidence, and to that he refigns himfelf en- 
tirely. 

They tried, in vain, to force themfelves 
out of the current by rowing : an irrefifti- 
ble power carried them along with the fwift^. 
nefs of an arrow 5 and they were now fo 
far out at fea as to have loft fight of the 
coaft of their ifland. Their deftrudlion 
appeared inevitable ; for, in lels than 
half an hour more, they would lofe fight of 
the tops of the higheft hills upon the ifland: 
after that, let the impetuofity of the cur- 
rent ceafe fooner or later, it was all over 

with 



ROBINSON C R U S C 1 III 

with them ; for they could not pofiioly re- 
cover the ifland, having no compafs to di- 
re6l their coiirfe. 

Henry. What fort of compafs ? 
Mr, Bill. A mariner's compafs. Edward, 
who has made choice of a fea life, will tell 
you what it is ? 

Edw, (laughing) I wifh 1 knew every 
thing that a good failor fhould know as well 
as I do that. A compafs, Henry, is a mag- 
netic needle in a round box. 

Henry. But what is a magnetic needle ? 
Edw, It is a long thin piece of fteel that 
has been touched and rubbed with a fort of 
ftone called a magnet, or loadftone ; from 
which rubbing it acquires this furprifing 
property, that, if balanced upon a copper pi- 
vot, one end of it will turn conllantly to- 
wards the North, By means of this com- 
pafs navigators can fleer their proper 
courfe, even when they fee nothing but the 
• iky and the fea ; otherwife they w^ould foon 
lofe themfelves, and not know which way 
to fail. 

F 4 ^ir. 



112 T H E N E W 

Mr, Bill, Do you underfland, Henry ? 

Henry, Pretty well. But to return to the 
boat in danger. 

Mr, Bill, Robinfon, having no com- 
pafs, could not pofiibly recover the ifland, 
if once he loft fight of it. What a dreadful 
fituation was he threatened with ! To be 
rolled and tofTed about upon a vail ocean, 
in a flight flciff, with provifions only for a few 
days ! Can any thing .be innagined more 
hopelefs of fafety ? It then appeared clear- 
ly that a true piety and a confcience void of 
reproach are an ineftimable treafure in time 
of diflrefs. Without this valuable refource, 
how could Robinfon have fupported the 
weight of defpair which threatened to over- 
whelm him. ? He would have aded as a 
perfoR deftitute of hope, and, perhaps, de- 
prived himfelf of life, to avoid the dread- 
ful alternative of perifhing with hunger. 

His companion, whofe piety was neither 
fo firmly eftabliihed, nor fo well tried by the 
number and duration of his diftrefiTes, as that 
of his mailer, was in the height of deipair. 

Una^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II3 

Unable to work, and abfolutely bereft of all 
courage, he reds his oar, looks at his maf- 
ter with a hopelefs, difconfolate air, and 
aflcs him whether they fhall plunge them- 
felves into the fea, to prevent, at once, by 
a fpeedy death, the cruel terrors of that lin- 
gering one which feemed inevitably to 
await them. Robinfon, at firft, fpoke to 
him affection ately^ and endeavoured to re- 
animate his courage ; he, then, mildly re- 
proached him for not putting his truft in 
the wifdom of Providence, which difpoles 
of every thing for the belt -, and briefly re- 
minded him of all that he had already 
taught him upon this fubjcd. *' Is it only 
upon land," faid he, " that we are in the 
hands of the Almighty ? Is he not alfa 
mafter of the ocean ? If he thinks right, 
can he not order thefe waves, which are now 
fo dangerous to us, to carry us to a. place 
of fafety ? Do you think, that, by throw- 
ing yourfelf into the fea, you could efeapc 
from the lot to which he has deftined you ? 
Learn, inconfiderate young man;,, that your

immortal foul will, during eternity, be un- 
der the boundlefs empire of the Almighty, 
and that it cannot hope for happinefs, if, re- 
bellious to its fovereign, it counterads his 
orders, by confenting violently to break the 
bonds wliich unite it to the body." 

Friday was fenfibly affected with the 
truth of thefe wholefome exhortations, and 
blufhed for his own weaknefs. He imme- 
diately took up his oar again, and they both 
continued to row, although they had not 
the fmallell hope that all their efforts could 
fave them. Robinfon faid, '^ We are but 
doing our duty; for while v/e have a 
Ipark of life remaining, we are bound to do 
every thing in our power to fave it. If v;e 
fail, we die with the comfortable affurance 
that fuch is the will of the Supreme Beings 
and his will, my dear friend,'' added he, 
raifing his voice to a tone of generous ani- 
mation, " his will is ever wife, even when 
we, miferable worms, cannot interpret it." 

The rapidity of the current continued ftill 
^i'.t fame : they couid now fee no more of the

ifiand than the tops of the hills ; and now, 
even of thenn, they could difcover but one, 
the very hlghefl, and that was leflening to 
their view very faft : in fhort, all hope of 
being faved was vanifhed. 

But when all human afliftance fails, whert 
the diflrefs of the unfortunate is at its heiglit^ 
then, my dear children, then comes in aid 
the powerful hand of Him who governs all 
things i and the man who was on the poinc 
©f perifhing, is placed wholly out of danger^ 
by means which he never would have fore- 
feen. This appeared in the prefent critical 
moment. Robinfon had loft all hope of 
avoiding a fpeedy death -,. but, at the very 
moment when, exhaufted with fatigue, he 
was obliged to ceafe rowing, he perceived, 
that the fwiftnefs of the boat's motion aba- 
ted all at once : he obferved alfo, that the wa- 
ter did not appear fo muddy as before ; and> 
cafting bis eyes over the furface of the fea^ 
he farther remarked that the current parted 
into two unequal branches, the largeft of 
which raa violently towards tlie North,, 
F 6 while 



Il6 T H E N E W 

while the other, kfs rapid, turned lliort to 
the South; and in this latter the canoe hap- 
pened to take its courfe. 

Tranfported with joy, he addrefles him- 
felf to his companion, who was half dead 
with fear. '^ Courage, Friday ! It is the will 
of Heaven that we fhall Hill be preferved!'' 
And immediately he pointed out to him the 
circum.ilances upon which he founded his 
hope. They both, therefore, took up their 
oars again, which fatigue had made them 
ht go. Re- animated with the fweet and 
iinexpedled hope of efcaping from deaths 
they exerted their lafl efforts to get out of 
the current, and faw,with infinite fatisfa6tion, 
that, for once, their labour was not ineffec- 
tual. Robinfon, who, from a long feries 
of difappointments, was accuflomed to let 
nothing flip his attention, obferved, at this 
moment, that the wind would be of fervice 
t;o them ; he, therefore, quickly unfurled the 
fail, which, catching the breeze, helped, to- 
gether with their redoubled exertions in row- 
ing.

ing, to carry them very foon out of the cur- 
rent into a fnnooth Tea. 

Friday was ready to jump for joy; he 
rofe up to embrace his mafter, who, how- 
ever, begged him to fufpcnd his tranfports 
for a moment, as there remained a good 
deal flill to be done before they could think 
thimfelves completely out of danger. In 
fadl, they had been carried out to fea fo 
far, that they could barely perceive their 
ifland, like a very fmall cloud in the far- 
theft extremity of the horizon. 

Henry, Horizon ? What is that ? 

Mr, Bill. When you are in an open 
country, does not the flcy feem, like a great 
arch, to touch the ground before you, 
which way foever you turn I 

Henry, Yes, it does. 

Mr, Bill, Well, then, the circle which 
thus bounds our view on all fides, where the 
earth feems to end and the fky to begin, is 
called the horizon. You will foon learn 
more about this. 

Our two intrepid failors rowed with ^o 

much

muchperfeverance, and a profperoiis breeze 
pufhed them on fo favourably towards the 
Eallern coafl of the ifland, for which they 
were making, that they very foon began to 
fee the mountains again. '* Come, my 
friend,'* faid Robinfon to Friday^ who fat 
toward the head of the boat, with his back 
to the ifland, ^^ come, Friday, we are near 
the end of our toil." He had fcarce finifh- 
cd thefe words before the canoe received 
fo violent a {hock, that the two rowers were 
thrown from their feats, and fell down at 
their length in the bottom of the boat, 
which now ftuck faft, and was foon covered 
with waves that broke over it. 

Mrs, Bill. Well, my dear children, I 
would give up my fupper, and^ I fuppofe,

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 11^ 



TWENTY-SECOND EVENING, 

SEVERAL of the Children at once. Well> 
papa, let us know quick what is be- 
come of poor Robinfon. 

Mr. Bill. You remember, that, at the ve- 
ry moment when he thought himfelf free 
from every danger, he fell into a frefh one, 
of a much more threatening nature than 
that from which he had jufl efcaped. The 
canoe (luck faft all at once, and the waves 
broke over it. If it has (Iruck upon a rock, 
there is no more to be faid — our friends are 
led:. 

Pvobinfon made hafte to feel all round 
the canoe with his car, and finding no more 
than about two feet depth of water, and a 
tolerably hard bottom, he jumped, without 
more ado, into the fea, Friday did the 
fame, and they both recovered their fpirits, 
on finding that the canoe had ftruck upon a 

bank 



t20 T H E N E W 

bank offand, and not upon a rock. They 
united their ftrength to free the boat from 
the fand, by pufhing it towards that fide 
where the water was deepefl. They fuc- 
ceeded, and when it was afloat they got 



into It again. 



Harriet. But poor Robinfon will catch 
cold — he has wetted his feet. 

Mr. Bill. My dear, when a man has 
flrengthened his conftitution by a fimple 
and laborious life, as Robinfon had, he does 
not fo eafily catch cold ; fo do not be un- 
eafy on that account. 

Rich. We ourfelves do not fo eafily 
catch cold as formerly. How often had 
we our feet wet lad winter, without feel- 
ing the leafl inconvenience from it ? 

Mr. Bill. A proof that your manner of 
living has already flrengthened you a little. 

After they had emptied the boat of the 
water that was in it, ufing for that purpofe 
their oars and the hUllow of their hands, as 
well as they could, they refolved to be more 
careful, and to ufe only their oars without a

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

fail, that they might be better able to guide 
the boat at their pleafure. They rowed, 
therefore, to clear the fand bank, keeping 
clofe by the fide of it, in hopes of foon com- 
ing to its end. This, however, they did not 
reach till after four hours rowing, to fuch a 
length the bank extended from North to 
South. Robinfon remarked that it reached 
to the very fpot where he was fhipwrecked 
nine years before, and, indeed, that this 
bank was really the fame upon which the 
{hip had ftruck. 

Henry. Struck, how ? 

Rich, Oh ! you are always interrupting. 

Mr, Bill. He does right in wifhing to 
be informed, and you are wrong, my dear 
Richard, to take his queftions amifs. Do 
fo no more. A fhip ftrikes, Henry, when 
it comes full againfl: a fand bank, or a rock^ 
from which it cannot difengage itfelf. 

Henry. Thank you, papa, for the expla- 
nation. 

Mr, BilL At length, as they were come 
into a part of the fea that was open and na- 
vigable* 



122 T H E ' N E W 

vigablc, they rowed with all their flrength 
to arrive at the ifland, which they now faw 
pretty near them. They came up to it 
jufl as the fun v^as fetting, and his beams 
only to be fecn upon the tops of the hills ; 
and they landed^ quite fpent with fatigue, 
but infinitely pleafed to be out of danger. 

They had neither of them taken any 
food the whole day 3 therefore, without wait- 
ing until they fhould arrive at the cave for 
a refrefhment fo abfolutely neceffary to 
them, they fat down upon the beach, and 
ate heartily of the provifions that they had 
put into the boat. When their meal was 
ended, they drew up the boat into a creek. 
You know, I fuppofe, what that is ? 

Rich. Oh, yes : it is a fmall opening, as 
it were, in the fhore, fomewhat refembling 
the Ihape of a bay or gulf. 

Mr.. Bill. Yes, but with this difference, 
that a bay is much larger, and a gulf ftill 
more fo. — They drew up their canoe in a 
creek, and fet out for their habitation, carry- 
ing 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I23 

ing back every thing that they had before 
put aboard the boat. 

Edw. Come, the ftory is not quite fi- 
nifhed yet. 

Mr. Bill, Robinfon and Friday are gone 
to bed. Friday is by this time fad aQeep i 
Hobinfon, after returning God hearty thanks 
for this frefh inftance of prefervation, is pre- 
paring alfo to compofe himfelf to reft. We 
might very well do the fame, but as it is 
not late, I will tell you what happened 
the next day. 

Robinfon, at breakfaft time, fpoke to his 
companion thus : ^' Well, Friday, do you 
find yourfelf difpofed to make a fecond at- 
tempt with me to-day, like that which wc 
made yefterday?'* 

Frid. Heaven forbid ! 

Rob, Then you are determined to fpend 
your days with me in this ifland ? 

Frid, Ah ! if my father was here with 



-us! 



Rob, Then your father is ftill alive ? 
Frid.. Unlefs he has died fince I left him. 

Here 



f^4 THE N E W 

Here Friday, who was deeply afFecfled, 
let fall the potatoe that he held in his hand, 
and, fitting motionlefs, he fhed a flood of 
tears. Nor could Robinfon contain his, 
when he thought of his parents. Loft in 
the tender recollection of former fcenes, 
they both maintained a long and deep fi- 
lence. 

Rob, Be comforted, Friday ; your father 
is probably ftill alive. We will go and find 
him out the firft convenient day, and 
bring him hither. 

This was joyful news for Friday 5 it put 
him almoft befide himfelf: his exclam.a- 
tions, his attitudes, were fuch as expreffed 
the tranfports of his joy : he falls at Ro- 
binfon's feet to thank him, but, in the ful- 
nefs of his heart, he is not able to utter a 
word. 

Mrs. Bill Ah, my dear children, what 
an admirable pattern is this of filial love in 
a favage, who has received no education, 
no inftru6lion from his father ; who is in- 
debted to him for nothing but barely life, 

and 



I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12^ 

and even that a life which is really mife- 
rable. 

Mr, Bill, So true rt is that God has en- 
graven in the hearts of all men principles 
of afic6lion and gratitude to their parents. 
Ahs ! what a horrible monger muil that 
man be, if it were poflible for fiich to exill 
amongft us civilized beings, who fliould 
ftifle in his heart thefe firil workings of na- 
ture, who Ihould feel no- more than indif- 
ference for his parents, and who ihould 
knowingly give them caufe of forrow and 
vexation 1 If ever you meet with fuch a 
monfter, my dear children, remain not with 
him under the fame roof j avoid him, he 
is the peft of fociety ; he is capable of the 
moft dreadful crimes, and will not fail to 
experience the terrible effedts of heavenly 
vengeance. 

When the tranfports of Friday's joy were 
a little calmed, Robinfon afked him if he 
knew the paflage over to his father's ifland 
fo well as to be certain, that, if they under- 
took it, they fhould not be expofed to dan- 
gers 



126 T H E N E W 

gers like thofe which they had experienced 
the day before. Friday aflured him that 
he knew the paflage perfedtly, and would 
undertake it with confidence even by night; 
that he had failed it feveral times with his 
coi3ntr}'men, when they came to this ifland 
to feaft after their vidories. 

Rob, Then you were amongft them when 
they killed men and ate them ? 
Fri* Certainly. 

Rob. And you took your Ihare with them 
too ? 

Fri. Alas ! I knew not that there was 
any harm in it. 

Rob, On which fide of die ifland did you 
generally land ? 

Fri, Always on the South fide, as being 
nearefl to our ifland, and alfo becaufe co- 
coa-nuts are to be found there in plenty. 

This was an additional proof to Robin- 
fon that he had good caufe to thank God 
for having fufFered him to be Ihipwrecked 
rather upon the Northern coaft than the 
Southern^ as, in this latter cafe, he would

foon have fallen a prey to the favages. He 
then repeated his promife to Friday that he 
would fhortly crofs over with hinn to his 
ifland, and endeavour to find his father. 
He nnade him fenfible, however, that this 
was not to be done inn mediately, as the pre- 
fent feafon v/as precifely the feafon for 
working in the garden, and this important 
bufinefs would by no means permit them 
to be abfenr. 

They, therefore, fct about this work with- 
out delay. Robinfon and Friday ftrove to 
furpafs each other in the art of digging. 
During the intervals of reft, they employed 
themfelvcs in finding ou: means to improve 
their gardening tooh. Robinfon, whofe 
patience and invention were equally inex- 
hauflible, fucceeded in making a rake, 
though he had no more than a fharp-point- 
cd flone to make the holes which were to 
receive the teeth : from the nature of the 
inftrum.ent that he ufed, one may guefs how 
long he v/as in making them. Friday, for 
his part, contrived with a iharp flone to 

Vol, III, G make 



128 T H E N E W 

make two fpades of fo very hard a wood, 
that they were nearly of the fame flrength 
and efFedl as if they had been made of iron. 
Robinfon was not content with providing 
merely for his wants , he thought of making 
fome improvenncnts about his habitation, 
and, by degrees, of ornamenting it. Such, 
my dear children, has ever been the natural 
confequence of the progrefs of the arts. 
While men were obliged to think of nothing 
but the means of providing for their fub- 
fiflence and fecurity, they had not the lead 
idea of cultivating thofe arts which ferve 
merely to adorn the objeds that furround 
thenn, or to procure them pleafures more 
refined than thofe which they enjoy in com- 
mon with other animals 3 but no fooner were 
they affbred of their fubfiftence and fafety, 
than they fought to unite the agreeable 
with the neceflary, the beautiful with the 
ufeful. Hence arofe, and were gradually 
brought to perfection, architedture, feulp- 
ture, painting, and all the other arts known 
by the general denomination of the fine arts, 

Robinfon 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I29 

Robinfon began by improving and orna- 
menting his garden. He divided it regu- 
larly into different quarters by pretty broad 
walks, which he marked out with a line. 
He planted hedge-rows, and made fummer- 
houfes and dark walks. One quarter was 
defigned for a flower garden, another for 
a kitchen garden, and the third for an or- 
chard. This lad he enriched with all the 
bed of the young lemon-trees that he found 
fcattered over the ifland, befides a variety 
of other young trees, which he grafted with ^ 
felons from the bread-tree. I had forgot 
to tell you, that in one of his walks he had 
difcovered a fecond tree of this fpecies. 
Friday, who was prefent at the operation of 
grafting, could not fufficiently exprefs his 
furprife ; he had no idea of the intent of it, 
and would have doubted its fuccefs, had any 
other perfon but Robinfon mentioned it to 
him. 

They planted potatoes and fowed maize, 

both in great quantities; and, as the foil 

had probably lain fallow fince the creation 

of the world, whatever they fowed fprung 

G 2 up 



>30 T H E N E W 

\ip as favourably as they could wifb, and 
brought them a plentiful crop. 

At times they went a fifhlng with the 
nets which Friday had made during the 
rainy feafon, and always caught more of the 
finny tribe than they could confume : they^ 
therefore, releafed thofe which they thought 
fuperfiuous, throwing them back into their 
own element. " It is abufing God*s gifts/* 
Robin fon fenfibly obferved, *^ to grafp at 
more than is necelTary to fatisfy our wants j 
and it is an odious cruelty to take away the 
lives of harmlefs animals, v/hen we aro 
about to ufe them for our nourifhment/' 

After fifhing they generally bathed. Ro* 
binfon could not fufficiently admire Friday's 
cle vernefs in fwi m min g a:nd di vi ng. He 
commonly chofe fome fteep rock againd 
which the waves broke. He would cail 
himfelf headlong from the ,tGp of this^ 
rock into the fea, remain fome minute^ 
under water, and by the time that Ro- 
binfon was become uneafy about him, he 
would pop his head up all at once, and then 
throw himfelf into a thcufand different po- 

fitions : 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I3I _ 

fitions: now ftretchedon his back, he let the 
waves roll him about ; at another time — 
but, were I to tell you the particulars of his 
performance, it would almoft appear incredi- 
ble to you. On thefe occafions Robinfon 
refleded with admiration upon the furprifing.. 
diverfity of men's natural difpofitionSj capa- 
ble, in a m.anner, of arriving at any perfee-i 
tion, if rightly exercifed from their infancy.* 

Sometimes they went a fowling or hunt- 
ing. Friday was no lefs fkilled in ufing the 
bow and arrow than in making them. They 
killed birds and young lamas, but never 
more than were requifite for their table, 
Robinfon, 1 obferved before, confidered as a- 
very blameable degree of cruelty the odious 
paGTion of killing any animal whatfoever foF 
mere amufement, and without a view ta 
conveniency. 

Whatever fuperiority Robinfon might 
have over Friday with refpedt to underftand- 
ing and induftry, the latter, in his turn, was 
poffeiTed of much fkill and dexterity, to 
which his mailer had hitherto been a ftran- 
G 3 ger. 



1^2 T H E N E W 

ger, but which, however, were of infinite* 
fervice to them. He had the art of nnaking, 
out of bones, fhells, ilones, &c. all forts of 
tools, which he ufed very dexteroufly in carv- 
ing wood, the work of which feenried almoft 
as well executed as if it had been cut with 
iron. For inftance, having found a long 
bone, he nnade a chifel of it,* of a branch of 
Goral he made a rafp , a knife he nnade out 
of a fhell, and a file of a fifh's &in. With 
thefe tools he provided for their apart- 
ment many little pieces of furniture, which- 
Contributed to render their fituation much 
more commodious. 

The art of reducing the fruit of the bread- 
tree into a kind of pafte or dough, was of 
the greateft im^portance. This pafte was as 
Bourifhing as eur bread, and had nearly the 
fame tafte. The favages ufe this pafte raw,, 
but Robinfon gave it a little toafting on the 
fire, which made it eat alm.oft as agreeable 
as any bread. 

He learned, alfo, from Friday, the ufe of 
the chocolate-nuts, which halving formerly 

found. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, T^^ 
found in one of his exciirfions, he had 
brought home a fmall ftoek of thenn for trial. 
When they were roafted before the fire, they 
afforded a food very agreeable to the tafte,. 
and as wholefonne as it was nourilhing. 

Robinfon, who was fond of making expe- 
riments, pounded a few handfuls of thefe 
nuts between two fiat Hones, and, having 
reduced them to powder, he boiled them 
with milk. What an agreeable furprife I 
The moment he tailed it he knew it to be 
chocolate. 

Henry, Ay! 

Mr. Bill. Yes, like our chocolate in every 
refpedl, but that he had no fugar with itr 
Thus every day Robinfon found new re- 
fources to fupply his wants and gratify his> 
palate. But I muft fay, to his praife, that 
he perfevered neverthelefs in his reiblutiori 
a-nd habit ofliving temperately, and of con- 
fining himfelf to the plained forts of food,. 

From this time they began to undertake 
longer and more frequent excurfion& alt 
©ver the ifland, particularly when they cb> 

fervedi 



134 T H E N E W 

ferved that the wind wa^ unfavourable for 
the favages to come over. In thefe excur- 
fions they made feveral difcoveries whicb 
they eafily turned to their advantage. 

When their work in the garden v^as finifli- 
ed, they fixed upon a day to go in queft of 
Friday^s father; but the nearer the time 
approached, the more Robinfon's anxiety 
encreafed. *' What if thefe favages," faid 
he to himfeif, ^* ihould treat you as an 
enemy ^ What if they fliould pay no regard 
to any thing that Friday could fay ? In. 
jfhort, what if you fhould fall a prey to their 
HiOnftrous appetites V* He could not help 
communicating all thefe apprehenfions to 
his friend, Friday protefted to him, by 
tvery thing the moft facred, that thefe fears 
were ill-founded; that he knew his country- 
fnen well enough to afiurc him that they 
were incapable of ufing thofe ill who were 
not their enemies. Robinfon was convin- 
ced that Friday would by no means fpeakfo 
pofitively, if there was the fmalleft room 
f©r doubt. He, therefore, banilhcd all fear 

and

and fufpicion, depended upon Friday's good 
faith, and refolved to fet fail die very next 
day. 

With this intention they again floated their 
canoe, which had been drawn up on the 
beach, and moored it to a (lake fixed in the 
ground. The fame evening they roafted a 
quantity of potatoes, and prepared other 
provifions, intending to lay in a (lock for at 
lead eight days. Friday fhewed upon this 
occafion that he was not io;norant in the art 
of cookery. As they had juft killed a young 
lama,^ he propofed to his mailer a method 
of roafling it whole in lefs time than they 
could on the fpit, and he engaged that its 
flelh ihould eat more tender and juicy when 
drell after this manner. He went to work 
thus. 

Fie dug a hole in the ground about two 
feet deep; this he filled with fcveral layers 
alternately of dry wood and fiat Hones. 
Here he raade the fire, over which he held the 
lama, to finge it, or burn its hair entirely 
off: he then fcraped it with a ihell, and 

made 



136 THE NEW 

made it as clean as if it had been fcalded in 
boiling water. With the fame Ihell he cut 
it open, and then took out the bowels. In 
the mean time the wood was burnt to char- 
coal, the hole was completely heated, and 
the ftones red hot. He took out the wood 
and the flones as faft as pofiible, only leav- 
ing as many of the latter as were fufficient 
to cover the bottom of the hole. On thefe 
ftones he fpread a layer of leaves of the cocoa- 
nut-tree, and on thefe leaves placed the la- 
ma, which he covered again with other leaves^ 
and, laftly, over thefe he laid what remain- 
ed of the hot ftones. The whole was co- 
vered with earth. 

When they took up the lama after it had 
lain there fome hours, Robinfon was cu- 
rious to tafte it, which he did, and found 
that the meat of it was really more tender, 
more juicy, and more favoury than if it 
had been roafted on the fpit. From that 
time, therefore, he conftantly ufed this me- 
thod.

Rich. It isexciCciy the famv .vdv that the 
people of Otaheite bakv their dogs. 

Mr. Bill. Very true. 

Geo. Their dogs ? Do they eat their 
dogs ? 

Rich. Certainly. We read of them lad 
'winter. Captain Cook's people tafled foiTie 
of the flefh of their dogs dreil in this nnan- 
ner, and found it excellent. 

Harriet. Excellent indeed ! 

Mr. Bill. You know, I fuppofe, that thefe 
dogs do not feed as ours ; they do not eat 
fiefh, but fruits ; fo that the meat of them 
inay tafte quite different from the flefh of 
our dogs.

NEW ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 

: CJ X CAS 

" — ' - r • : 



TWENTY-THIRD EVENING. 

T> OBINSON and Friday might have 
been aQeep about half an hour, when 
the former was fuddenly awakened bv a 
violent ftorm, which began and was at the 
height ahnofl in the fame inflant. The 
roaring of the wind was dreadful, and the 
earth ihook with repeated claps of thunder, 
'' Do you hear this;'' faid Robinfon, to Fn^ 
day, awaking him. ^^ Heavens !" replied 
he, " what would have become of us if we 
A3 had 



4 T H E N E W 

had been furprifed at fea in fuch weather?" 
Juft at that nioment they heard the report 
of a gun at a great diftance. 

Friday thought it was thunder ^ Robin- 
fon was firmly perfuaded that a gun had 
been fired, and this belief filled him with 
joy. He flarts up from bed, runs to the 
fire-place, bids Friday follow him, fnatches 
up a burning piece of wood, and mounts 
his ladder of ropes. Friday followed his 
mailer*s example, without knowing what his 
intentions were. 

Roblnfon made hafle to kindle a large 
fire upon the top of the hillock, to lignify 
to the people at fea in diflrefs that they 
would find a fafe refuge upon that ifland ; 
for he had not the lead doubt that there 
was fome fliip in diflrefs near at hand, and 
that the report of the gun which he had 
heard was a fignal of their danger. But 
fcarce had the fire begun to blaze up before 
there came fuch a fhower of rain as put it 
out in a moment. Robinfon and Friday 
were obliged to haften to the cave, for fear 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

of being carried away by the water, which 
ran in floods. The whiftling of the wind, 
the roaring of the weaves, the loud burfts of 
thunder, all found with redoubled tunnuki 
and though, in the midft of this tremendous 
agitation of the elements, Robinfon thought 
he could diftinguilh now and then fome re- 
ports of cannon, yet he doubted whether 
they might not be the burfting of thunder 
at a diftance. However, notwithftanding 
his doubts, he indulged himfelf with the flat- 
tering thought that there might be a fliip 
near at hand, the captain of which, if he 
efcaped the danger of this dreadful ftorm, 
might take him and his faithful Friday on 
board, and carry them to Europe. Ten 
times he attempted to light the fire, and 
ten times the rain put it out. All that re- 
mained in his power to do for the unfor- 
tunate people who were flruggling againft 
fhipwreck and death, he did : he prayed 
for them with the greateft: devotion. 

Rich. He was not afraid, then, of the 
ftorm, as formerly ? 

A 4 Mn 



6 T H E N » W 

Mr. BilL No^ you fee him now per- 
fe6lly cured oi that fenfelefs fear. But how 
was this cure wrought ? 

Rich, By his having a clear confcience, 
which reproached him with no crime, 

Mr, BilL Rights and, moreover, by a 
firm perfuafion that the Ahnighty is a being 
of the pureft benevolence, and that, confe- 
quently;, nothing happens to thofe who are 
endowed with true piety and virtue but what 
conduces finally to their greateft happinefs. 
■—It was day-break before the florm ceafed. 
As fcon as it was clear, Robinfon, fufpended 
between hope and fear, went to the fea-fide, 
accompanied by Friday, to afcertain whe- 
ther his conjcvSiures were well or ill founded. 
But the firft difcovery that they made filled 
Robinfon with grief, and almofl plunged 
Friday into defpair. The wind had driven 
their boat out to fea. It would have melted 
any one with compaffion to be witnefs of 
Friday's excelTive grief, when he faw him- 
felf difappointed in the pleafing hope of 
foon returning to his father. His natural 

com- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

complexion forfook his face, and was fuc- 
ceeded by a ghaftly palenefs : he could not 
utter a fingle word ; his eyes were mourn- 
fully fixed upon the ground ; his whole bo- 
dy was agitated as if his foul were ftriving 
to part from it, and to break the bonds 
which held them united. Suddenly his 
grief burlls forth in a flood of tears, and 
he beats his bread and tears his hair, fob- 
bing all the while as if his heart would 
break. 

Robinfonhad learned, from his own mif- 
for tunes, to feel for thofe of others, and 
particularly to calm and footh the forrows 
of the afflided. He was touched with 
•Friday '5 excefs of grief; he felt for his fi- 
tuation, and endeavoured to comfort him 
by exhortations full of tendernefs and good 
{tnCe. " Who knows," faid he, " whether 
the lofs of our canoe may not be for our 
advantage ? Or who can tell of what fer- 
vice this fiorm, which has carried away our 
boat, may be in its co.nfcquences either to 
Us or to others r" '^ What fervice 1" faid 
A 5 Friday 



8 T H E N E W 

. Friday tardy; " it has deprived us of our 
canoe, that is all/' 

" Then becaufe neither you nor I, narrow- 
minded, fhort-fighted beings as we are, can 
perceive any other effect of the florm than 
the lofs of our canoe, do you fuppofe that 
God, whofe wifdom is unbounded, had no 
other purpofe in view when he flirred up 
this tempeft ? How can thy feeble undcr- 
ilanding dare to judge of and limit the 
immenfe defjgns of Omnipotence!" " That 
is right," faJd Friday, ^*^ in a general view ^ 
but, as to us in particular, of what fervice 
can the ftorm be to us ?'* '' You mufl not 
aik me that queition. Nothing lefs than 
emhifcience can comprehend the bound- 
kfs plans of that Being who rules the Uni- 
verfe. I may, indeed, exhauft myfelf in 
conjectures, but who will fatisfy me whe- 
ther they are juft or not ? Perhaps there 
might have been raifed or gathered over 
our ifland fo great a quantity of dangerous 
exhalations, that nothing lefs than fuch a 
florm could difperfe them, and thus pre- 

ftrve 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

ferv'e us either from fame violent diftemper 
or even from death itfelf. Perhaps thk 
boat^ the lofs of which grieves us fo much, 
might only have ferved to convey us to 
our ruin. Perhaps — But why all thefe per- 
hapfes ? Is it not fufficient for us to know- 
that it is God who raifes and lays the tem- 
peft at his will, and that in him all crea-- 
tures have a wife and tender father ?'* 

Friday, recovering his compofiire, was 
afhamed of his error, repented of his mun- 
murs, and fubmitted to the decree of Prc<- 
vidence. In the mean time, Robinfon did. 
not ceafe to caft his eyes round to every 
part of the vaft ocean that v/as open to his 
view; he could not help looking out for 
fome veffelj but there was not the fmalleft: 
appearance of one. He concluded, there- 
fore, that he had been miliaken, and that 
what he had fuppofed to be thereport of guns 
had certainly been thunder. Grievad at 
the thought of giving up fo agreeable a. 
hope, he returned forrowfully towards his 
habitation. 

A 6 But 



10 T H E N E W 

But even here he was not at eafe : his 
fancy ilill ran upon a veflel at anchor near 
the iPiand. He went up^ therefore, to . 
the top of the hillock, from whence there 
was a full view of all the Wefcern coafl, but 
he could difcern nothing that flattered his 
hopes. Still vexed and uneafy, he went to 
a very high hill, from the top of which he 
could view the Eaftern coaft, and climbing 
with all fpeed up to the fummit, he cafts his 
eyes round the fea — But heavens ! what 
is his joy when he difcovers that he has 
not been miftaken ! 

ne Childre7i, Oh dear ! 

Mr, Bill, He fees a fl'iip, an3, notwith- 
fianding die diilance, he fees it fo diftindily 
as to be convinced that it is one, and of 
pretty large burthen. You will excufe me, 
my dears, if I forbear attempting to de- 
fcribe the exceiTive tranfports of his joy. 
He. flies like lightning to his cave, and ar- 
;rives quite out of breath. He fnatches 
up his arms, without which he never went 
to any great diftancc, and unable to fay 

any 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II 

any more to Friday, who was aftonifhed to 
fee him in fuch a hurry, than thefe words, 
"There they are! quick! quick!" he 
rem.ounts the ladder of ropes, and fets ofr 
again with the utmofl precipitation. — 
[See the Fronti/piece to this volume,"] 

From his mafter^s hurry and confufion, 
and the few words that he fpoke, Fri- 
day fuppofed the favages to be at hand ; 
taking up his arms, therefore, he followed 
him with all fpeed. 

They had at leaft twelve miles to go be- 
fore they came to that part of the fhore off 
which the veiTel feemed to lie at anchor; 
nor did Friday learn the caufe of his maf- 
ter's hurry until he arrived at this fpot. 
Robinfon fhewed him the ihip at a diftance. 
Friday could not conceal his ailonifhrnent ; 
for, notwithdanding the diftance, he guefied 
it muft be at leaft a hundred times bigger 
than any thing which he had ever [tt:\ of 
the kind. 

Robinfon expreffed his joy in a thoufand 
different ways 3 fometimes he danced, fome- 

times 



12 T H E N E W 

times he halloo'd, and fometimes he em- 
braced Friday with tears in his eyes, and 
congratulated the good fortune of both. 
Now, indeed, they fhould fet off for Eu- 
rope^ and come to England ! Now Friday 
fhould fee how the people live in that 
country ! what houfes they inhabit^ and how 
they pafs their time in peace, enjoying all 
the conveniencies and pleafuresof life! Thus 
he ran on without flopping, and would 
perhaps have talked for an hour, had he 
not recolle6i:ed, that to lofe the precious, 
time in ufelefs words was now particularly 
unreafonable, and that he ought, by every 
method in his power, to endeavour to make 
himfelf vifible to the people in the fhip. 
But how was this to be done ? Here was 
what puzzled him. 

He endeavoured to make them hear him^, 
but to no purpofe, though the wind had 
changed during the ilorm, and blew, at 
prefent, off the iiland towards the fhip; 
He then begged his friend to make a fire 
diredly, which might be k^n by the peo*- 

pie 



ROBINSON CR0SOE. TJ 

pie on board. This was quickly done; 
and they kindled a blaze that rofe as high 
as the tops of the trees. He had his eyes 
conftantly fixed upon the Ihip, expeding 
every moment to fee them lower a boat, 
and fend it towards the fhore. But his ex- 
pe<5lations were all in vain. 

At laftj as the fire had been lighted now 
more than an hour without any appearance 
of a boat, Friday offered to fwim to the 
fhip, notwithftanding its diflance, and in- 
vite the crew to come on fhore. Robinfon 
joyfully conlented to this, on condition, 
however, that he fhould take care not to 
expofe himfelf rafhly, nor negled; any thing 
for the prefer vation of his life. Imme- 
diately Friday ftrips off his cloaths of 
matting, cuts a branch, and, holding it 
between his teeth, fprings boldly into the 
waves. Robinfon accompanied him with 
his eyes and mofl friendly wifhes. 

Charlotte, But why the branch, papa ? 
Mr. BilL A green branch is, among the 
ravages, a fign of peace. Pie who ap- 
proaches 



14 T H E N E W 

proaches them with a bough in his hand^ 
has nothing to fear from them. It was for 
his fecurity^ therefore, that Friday took this 
precaution. 

He arrived fafe at the veflel, and fwam 
round it twice or thrice, calling the people, 
but nobody anfwered. Perceiving the lad- 
der at the Ihip's fide, he went up by it, hold- 
ing the branch in his hand. 

When he was high enough to fee all over 
the deck, he was frightened at the fight of 
an animal, fuch as he had never k^n in his 
life ; it was covered with black woolly hair, 
and as foon as it faw Friday, it uttered 
fijch noifes as pcrfedly furprifed him. How- 
ever, it foon ceafed crying out, and appear- 
ed fo mild and fo engaging, that Friday was 
nov/ no longer afraid of it : the creature ap- 
proached in a manner fo humble, and crept 
along wagging its tail and whining fo plain- 
tively, that Friday fuppofed it to be entreat- 
ing his help and prote6lion. When it had 
crept clofe up to him, and Hopped, Friday 
Ventured to pat it, and the creature feemed 

tranf- 



R O B I N S O xV CRUSOE. 1^ 

tranfported with joy. Friday walked all 
over the deck, calling the people, but no- 
body appeared. While he was loft in ad- 
miration of the many furprifing objeds that 
he faw on the deck, and was ftanding with 
his back to the hatch*way, he received, all 
of a fudden, fo violent a blow behind, that 
he fell flat on his face. Getting up in a 
great fright, he looks round him, and ftands 
petrified with confternation, on beholding a 
creature of a pretty large fize, with crooked 
horns, and a long bulhy beard, rearing it- 
felfupon its hind legs, and preparing, with 
a threatening air, to make a fecond attack 
upon him. Friday roared out as loud as he 
was able, and jumped into the fea. 

The firft of thefe animals, which was 
black, and which I need not name, as, no 
doubt, you know what it is, from the ^e-

Rich, Oh ! it was a water fpaniel. 

Mr. Bill. You have guefTed it. The

into the water, and fwims after him. Fri-

day, hearing the noife of fomething that fell 
into the water behind him, imagined the 
horned monfler to be purfuing him. He 
was fo terrified at the thought, that he was 
fcarce able to fwinn, and ran great danger of 
drowning : a frefh inftancc from which 
we fee how hurtful the palHon of fear is, 
fince it hurries us into dangers to which we 
fiiould never be expofed, if we did not fuf- 
fer ourfelves to be overpowered by it. 

He did not even dare to look behind 
him : however, after he had a little recover- 
ed from his fright, he fwam fo faft that the 
fpaniel could fcarcely keep up with him. 
When he reached the fhore, being unable 
to fpeak, he fell down quite fpcnt at Ro- 
binfon's kct. The fpaniel landed a few 
minutes after. 

Robinfon fpared no pains to bring his 
faithful companion to himfelf. He rubbed 
hrs temples, fhook him, and called him 
aloud by his name. But it was fome time 
before Friday opened his eyes and fpoke. 
.As foon as he was able, he began to relate 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I7 

the terrible adventure that had happened to 
him ', how the fhip appeared to him a great 
mountain of wood, on which ftood up three 
large trees (meaning the mafts) ; how the 
black creature had fhewn him a thoufand 
marks of fondnefs i and how the monfter 
with the beard and horns had attempted to 
kill him : laftly, he added, that he believ- 
ed the monfler to be mafter of the floating 
mountain of wood, as he faw no man on it. 

Robinfon liftened to him with a good deal 
of furprife. The horned monfler he fuppo- 
fed to be a goat. As to the (hip, he conclu- 
ded that it was fad upon a rock or fand bank, 
and that the crew, fearing to be wrecked, 
had quitted it, and taken to their boats for 
fafety, but he could not conceive what was 
become of them. If they had reached the 
ifland, the fpot where he then ftood with 
Friday was the moft likely place for their 
landing i but he could perceive no traces of 
them. If they had perifhed, yet either their 
bodies or their boats, or both, would, in 
all probability, have been thrown upon 

fome 



iS T H E N E W 

fome part of the fhore. However, at 
length, he recoUeded that the wind had 
changed during the ftorm, and, from an 
Eafterly gale, had ihifted fuddenly to the 
Weil. This circumftance feemed to explain 
to him what he found fo much diiHculty 
in comprehending at firft. 

" Certainly,'" faid he to himfelf, '' the 
people who took to their boats mufl have 
been driven back by the Wefterly gale from 
reaching this Itiore; the wind mud have 
carried them Eaftward^ fo that, perhaps, they 
have perifhed in the open fea^ perhaps 
they were carried away by fome current -, or, 
perhaps, before the fhifting of the wind, 
they might have touched on one of the 
iflands to the Weft ward. Heaven grant 
that this lad conjeclure be true V^ cried he^ 
with a figh. And he communicated his 
opinion to Friday, who thought it not im- 
probable. 

" But what are we to do V' faid Robin- 
fon. " Whether the crew have periftied, 
or are only tofled about by the winds, in ei- 
ther

thcr cafe we can do nothing better than un- 
load the fhip of whatever efFe(fls we can 
move. But how are we to attempt this 
now that we have no canoe ?'* At that mo- 
ment he felt for the lofs of his canoe almoft 
as much as Friday had a few hours before ; 
he thought of every method pcHible either 
to replace it, or to fubftitute foaiethlng elfe 
in its room ; but he was a long time without 
hitting upon any thing that v/ould anfwer. 
To build another canoe, would take up 
too much time. To fwim to the Ihip, was 
an attempt that he durft not undertake on 
account of the diftance. Befides, what 
could he expedb to fave by doing fo ? 

Rich. I know very well what I would 
have done. 

Mr, Bill, Well, what would you have 
done ? 

Rich, I would have made a raft, 

Mr, Bill, That was precifdy the idea 
that ftruck Robinfon at laft. " A raft," 
faid he to himfelf, " will be foonell made." 
\ Henry, Now, what is a raft ? 

Rich. 



20 T H E N E W 

Rich. A raft is a number of beams tied 
clofe together, fo that one can walk upon 
them, and this will carry you upon the wa- 
ter as well as a boat. 

Mr. Bill. You are very right ; and juft 
fuch a raft did Robinfon intend to make to 
carry him to the fhip, that he might fave 
whatever goods he could bring away. It 
was refolved that one of them fhould go to 
the cave and bring back provifions for a 
day, as well as all the cordage and tools that 
he fhould find. As Friday was the more 
a6live of the two, he was charged with this 
bufinefs ; and while he performed it^ Robin- 
fon cut down trees proper for the raft. 

Friday could not be back before night- 
fall : in the mean time Robinfon was much 
delighted with the fpaniel, for which he felt 
a kind regard as coming fi'om Europe, 

The fpaniel, for its part, feemed perfectly 
happy in meeting with fo good a maflcr, 
and played a number of amufing tricks be- 
fore Robinfon. At Friday's return, Robin- 
fon gave the fpaniel part of his fupper, 

though 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 21 

though this was the firfl food that he had tail- 
ed himfelf the whole day. Luckily it happen- 
ed to be a moon-light night -, they both, 
therefore, worked without ceafing till near 
midnight, when they found themfelves fo 
overpowered with fleep, that they could no 
longer refift its approaches. 

E^w. I do not wonder at that i they had 
not flept the whole night before. 

Geo. Befides, they had been ftirring about 
fo much all the day, efpecially Friday. 

Mr, Bill. They lay down upon the grafs, 
and the fpaniel at their fttz^ as their guard. 
Thus, till the return of the dawn, they re- 
frefhed their bodies, and gathered new 
iirengrh in found and undiihirbed repofe.

TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING. 

T^^* Bill, Scarce had the ruddy morniDg 
begun to appear in theEaftern part of the 
horizon, when the wakeful Robinfon roufed 
his companion to go on with the work which 
they had begun the day before. They work- 
ed fo incefTantly the whole day, that the raft 
was finifhed that very evening. 

Thy had joined a double row of trunks of 
trees together in fuch a manner with cords 
and willow twigs, that it formed, as it were, 
a folid floor:, ^t to lie even on the water, and 
about twenty feet long, with nearly the fame 
breadth. They had alfo been careful to con- 
flrud this raft upon rollers clofe to the 
beach, that they might the more eafily fet 
it afloat without lofs of time. 

Fortunately, the tide was on the ebb about 
break of day. They did not delay a mo- 
ment in launching their raft, that they might 

have

have the advantage of the ebb, which, like a 
current, would carry them out towards the 
Ihip. They pu(h off, are now upon the open 
fea, and in lefs than half an hour come along- 
fide of the fhip. 

What were Robinfon's feelings when he 
approached this European veffel ! He would 
have kilTed it, and glued his lips to every 
part of it if poffible ! That it came from 
Europe, was built, manned, and conveyed 
thither by Europeans, were circumflances 
which could not fail to render it dear to himo 
But, alas ! thefe Europeans themfeives had 
jdifappeared — perhaps had been fwallowed up 
by the waves ; an affliding furmife to Robin- 
fon, who would chearfully have facrificed 
half of the days that he had ftill to live, on 
condition of finding the crew, and fetting fail 
with them for Europe. But as he was o- 
bliged to give up this hope, it only remained 
for him now to fave as much of the goods out 
of the fhip as he could for his own ufe. 

Geo. But could he take poffeflion of goods 
that did not belong to him ? 

B z Mr. 



£4 THEN E W 

Mr. Bill. What think yoUj Richara, 
could he do fo ? 

Rich, He might, to be fure, take them 
out of the Ihip, and carry them afhore ; but 
if ihe owners appeared, he was obliged to re- 
Hore them. 

Mr. Bill. Thus juftice decrees certainly. 
If he did not take out the goods, they woitld 
be fpoiled by degrees in the fea- water ; he 
had, therefore, fome right to the ufeofthem; 
he might, without any fcruple, take to him- 
felf whatever he found moft neceffary, and 
keep it, looking upon it as a recompenfe, 
which the owners, if ever they appeared, 
could not juftly refufe him for the trouble 
that he had taken in faving the remainder of 
the cargo. 

As to what concerns {hip wrecks in gene- 
ral, the following cuftoms are oblerved in 
fome civilized ftates- The Ihipwrecked 
goods are generally divided into three parts ; 
the fir-ft for the owners, if living, or, if not, 
•for their heirs i the fecond is given to -thofe

KOBl'MSON CRUSOE, a^ 

who have faved the goods; and the laft be^ 
k)ngs to the fovereign of the country. 

Edw, The fovereign 1 Why has he a 
ftiare ? 

Mr, Bill. That is a queftion to which I 
cannot, at prefent, give you a very fatisfadtory 
anfwer ; how^v^r, I will inform you of every 
thing on the fubjed that is within your com- 
prehenfion. The prince or fovereign of the 
country, by whatever title h« is flyled, main- 
tains upon his coafts a number of perfons 
§rho are obliged, by their flation, to look 
after fhipwrecked goods, that none of them be 
carried off, but that whatever is faved may be 
lodged in a place of fecurity. Without this- 
precaution, the merchant, to whom the cargo 
belongs, would feldom recover any part of 
it, becaufe the goods would always be either 
flolen or fpoiled. Now, as the fovereign is 
at the charge of maintaining thefe people, it- 
is but jiift that he Ihould be indemnified by 
thofe who reap the advantage of fo expenlive 
an efhblifhment. For this reafon, it has- 
been regulated in fome countries, that the 
B 3 third 



26 THE NEW 

third part of fliipwrecked goods fhould h^ 

long to the fovereign of the place. i 

Confequently, Robinfon was authorized to 

appropriate to himfelf two-thirds of the 

goods that he might be able to recover out of 

the fhip, and to apply them to whatever ufe 

ihould feem beft to him, as being his lawful 

property. 

Ricb. Two-thirds ? 

Mr. Bill, Yes -, one-third for his pain» 
^nd trouble, and the other, as being the only 
lawful fovereign of the ifland near which tfap 
veffcl had been wrecked. 

Edw, But who made him fovereign of 
the ifland ? 

Mr, Bill. Common fenfe. A countr^^ 
like any thing elfe, which has no owner, na- 
turally belongs to him who firft takes pof- 
feflion of it; and fuch was exactly the cafe 
here. 

When Robinfon was a little recovered 
from the excefs of joy which he felt at the 
i]ght of an European fhip, his firfl wifh was 
that it might not prove to be damaged, but 

capabte 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2j 

capable of being fet afloat. In this cafe he 
was refolved to embark in it with Friday, and 
frt fail, if not for Europe, at leall for fome 
•European colony in South America, or the 
Weft Indies, notwithflanding the danger of 
being on the open fea in a ihip without fuffi- 
cient hands to work it, and without having 
the knowledge of navigation which a fea- 
yoyage requires. He failed round the fhip 
on his raft, and examined the depth of wa- 
ter about it, but had the mortification to be 
convinced that he rauft never expedt to fee it 
afloat again. ^ 

The ftorm had lodged it between two 
rocks, where it was jammed in fo faft, that 
there was not the leaft poiTibility of moving 
it one way or the other, and it was likely to 
lemain in its prefent fltuation until the force 
of the waves fhould difengage it by dafhing 
it in pieces. Difappointed in all his hopes 
for the prefervation of the ihip, Robinfon 
haftened aboard to examine the cargo, and 
fee whether that was damaged. Friday ftiii 
temexnbered his fright fo ftrongly, that he 
B' 4 could 



^8 T H E N E W 

could fcarce perfuade himfelf to accompany 
his mafter upon deck. He vemured, how- 
ever, at laft, though not without trembling, 
as the firft obje6l that met his eyes was the 
terrible horned monfter. 

But he was no longer fo fierce as before : 
he was Iain dovvn, and feemed exceedingly 
weak and hardly able to rife. The fadt was, 
that, for three days paft, nobody being at 
hand to give him liis ufual food, he had receiv- 
ed little or nonourifhment. Robinfon,who fuf- 
pedted this to be the cafe the moment he faw 
the animal's enfeebled llate^ made it his firft 
care to feek for fomcthing to appeafe its hun-- 
ger. As he was very well acquainted with 
the iniide of a Ihip, he was not long in find- 
ing what he fought, and had the pleafure to J 
fee the goat devour with the greatefl eagernefs 
what he brought it 5 while Friday, for his 
part J could never fufficiently admire the odd 
figure of the animal, as he thought it, hav- 
ing never feen any thing like it before. 

Robinfon began next to take a furvey of 
the fhip j he went from deck to deck, and 

from 



ROBINSON CRU80E. 29 

from cabin to cabin, and found every where 
a thoufand things, which, in Europe, one 
would fcarce think worth looking at, but 
which to him were of infinite importance. 
In one part was a ftock of bifcuit, rice, flour, 
corn, wine, gunpowder, balls, fhot ; in ano- 
ther place were Ihip cannon, mufkets, pif- 
tols, fwords, hangers, and cutlaffes ; elfe- 
where there were hatchets, faws, pincers, 
gimlets, rafps, planes, hammers, iron bars, 
nails, knives, fciflars, needles, and pinsi 
Farther on, he fees pots, porringers, plates,, 
fpoons, tongs, bellows, fire-fhovels, and 
other kitchen utenfils, fome of wood, others 
of iron, tin, and copper. Laflly, he fiiids 
chefts full of cloaths, linen, {lockings, (hoes,, 
boots, and a number of other things, for any 
fingle one of which, if it had been offered to 
him forfale, Robinfon would freely have gi- 
ven his lump of gold, which he had long 
fince forgotten. 

Friday was loft in amaze at the fight of fo 
many objedtS;, all equally unknown to him,- 
and the ufes of which he could not fo much 
B 5 as

as guefs. Robinfon, on the other hand, 
could not contain himfelf ; he wept for joy : 
like a child, he touched every thing, fnatch- 
cd up every thing, but laid it down as fooa 
as he faw any thing elfe that he liked better. 
He was going, at laft, down to the hold, but 
found a confiderable quantity of water in it ; 
a proof that there was a leak in the fliip's. 
bottom. 

He confidered what he had befl carry afhore 
in this his firft trip, and found fome diffi- 
culty in making his choice. Now he thought 
one thing moft indifpenfably neceliary^ now 
another, and frequently rejeds what he had 
juft preferred, and makes it give place to ano- 
ther, which is alfo rejeded in its turn. At 
length, however, his choice was fixed upon 
the following objcds, as being to him the 
moft valuable of any that he could carry 
away: ift. two barrels, one of gunpowder, 
the other of ihotj 2d. two muf^ets, two 
brace of piftols, two hangers, and two cut- 
laffes ; 3d. two fuits of cloaths, complete, 
for himfelf and Friday j 4tb» two dozen of 

ihirts ;

paper, pens, and ink; 7th. a tinder box,

head of bifcuit; 9th. fome pieces of fail 
cloth ; loth. and laft, the goat. 

Hemy, The goat ? Oh 1 he could have: 
done without the goat. 

Mr, Bill. That is very true, Henry ^ 
but the goat could not fo vvell have done 
without him. Robinfon was too compaf- 
fionate to leave the poor creature expofed to 
the danger of perifhing with the fhip,.,which- 
might be funk before he came back>- Be- 
fides, there was room for her (for it was a 
fhe goat) on the raft after it had been load- 
ed with every thing that feemed to claim* 
his greateft regard. No ! he did not 
forget the poor goa^ — he carried her with 
him. 

But he diidair^ed to take many articles

monds, he found amongft the captain's ef- 
fe<5ls, but was in no wife tempted to take 
them away, as they could not pofTibly be 
of any fervice to him. 

He had employed fo much time in exa* 
mining the fhip, in opening and emptying 
the chefts, in indulging his joy and admi- 
ration, in chufing and placing upon the raft 
what he liad a mind to carry away, that, 
tvhen all v;as done, he had only an hour to 
fpare before the tide would begin to flow 
again. They were obliged to take the ad- 
vantage of it; for, without the flow of the 
tide, they would hardly be able to gain the 
Ihore, Robinfon fpent this hour in dining 
after the European fafliion, which he had 
not done for a long time before. 

Fie brought out, therefore, a piece of 
liung beef, a few herrings, fome bifcuit, 
butter, cheefe, and a bottle of wine, and 
laid the whole upon a table in the cabin. 
Friday and he fat down upon chairs. The 
very circumftance of dining at a table, fit- 



ting 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

ting upon chairs, having plates, helping 
themfelves with knives and forks ; in (hort, 
of making a meal with the advantage of fo 
many European conveniencies, gave Robin- 
fon a pleafure that it would be impofTible 
to exprefs : not to mention the viduals, 
particularly the bread, which had been lb 
often in vain the objeft of his wifhes. You 
cannot imagine how delicious they tailed 
to his palate. One fhould, like him, be 
deprived for nine years fucceflively of all 
thofe forts of food, and all thofe conve- 
niencies, in order to conceive, in its full ex- 
tent, the luxury that he enjoyed. 

Friday, who knew nothing of the Euro- 
pean manner of eating, was very much puz- 
zled in handling his knife, and dill more his 
fork. Robinfon fhewed him how to ufe 
them ; but Friday, endeavouring to imitate 
him, and to put a bit of meat into his mouth 
with the fork, from pure habit lifted up his 
hand with the handle of the fork to his lips, 
while the piece of ineac went off towards his 
ear, Robinfon having made Friday tafte 

the 



34 T H E N E W 

the wine, he firmly refufcd to drink any of 
it : accuftomed, as he was, to fpring wa- 
ter, his palate could not bear the fiery 
ftrength of a fermented liquor. The bif- 
Guit, on the other hand, was quite to his 
tafte. 

The tide now beginning to fiow, they get 
upon the raft, pufh off, and are carried 
gently towards the ifland. In a fhoit time 
they come to fhore^ and haften to land the 
goods with which the raft was loaded. 

Friday was very curious to know the 
meaning of all thofe things and their ufes. 
To fatisfy his curiofity, Robinfon goes out 
of fight behind a bufli, and dreffes himfeif in 
a fhirt, ftockings, and Ihoes, together with 
an officer's uniform complete -, then, put- 
ting a laced hat upon his head, and a fword 
by his fide, he comes, all at once> and Ihews 
himfeif to Friday. Seized with ailonifh- 
ment, Friday flarts back a few paees^ doubt- 
ing, at firfl: fight, whether it were really his 
mafter, or fome being above the human 
fpecies. Robinfon could not help laughing 

at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

at his amazement j he held his hand out to- 
him in a friendly manner, afluring him that 
he was flill the fame, flill his friend Robin- 
fon, though he had undergone a change of 
drefs, and, in fome meafure, of fortune. 
He gave him a fuit of failor's cloaths, Ihew- 
ed him the ufe of each part, and defired him 
alfo to retire behind the thicket and change 
his drefs. 

Friday went accordingly ^ but, how long 
was he drefiing ! and how many trials did he 
make ! He put on each part of the drefs 
wrong : for inllance, he put his two legs 
through the fleeves of the fhirt, ran his 
two arms into the breeches, covered his 
head with the feat of them, and tried 
to button the jacket behind. What awk- 
ward attempts at drefling I However, he 
was fortunate enough to correcl; all his mif- 
takes, and, at length, dreffed himfelf pro- 
perly at all points. 

He jumped for joy, like a child, when he 
faw how well he was clothed, how conve- 
fiicnt and eafy this drefs was to the body, 

and 



36 THE N E W 

and how proper to defend him from the 
flings of mufKitoes. The ihoes alone were 
difagreeable to him ; he thought them in- 
convenient and ufelefs. He begged leave,^ 
therefore^ to put them off, and Robinfon 
gave him full permifiion* to do in that re- 
ipefl: whatever he pleafcd. 

He alfo fhewed him the ufe of the hatch- 
ets and ieveral other tools, with which he 
was quite delighted. They began to make 
immediate ufc of them, in cutting a malt 
for their raft, that, with the help of a fail, 
they might, for the future, be able to go to 
and from the fhip without being obliged to 
wait for the ebb and flow of the tide. Ro* 
binfon undertook this talk alone, and fent 
Friday to his dwelling-place to milk the 
iamas, which they had negleded for two 
days paft. 

During his abfence, Robinfon loaded one 
of the mufkets. He propofed to have the 
pleafure of furprifing his friend with the 
aftonifhing effeds of gunpowder. As Fri- 
day, at his return, was admiring the dif- 

patch 



RIOBNSON CRUSOE. 37 

patch with which Robinfon had finifhed his 
work, the latter perceived a fea-gull flying 
awa7 with a fifh that he had feized out of the 
water. He fnatches lip his mufket, and 
fays to Friday, " Do you fee that fea-gult ? 
He fhall fall this moment." And fo fay- 
ing, he levels at the bird, draws the trigger, 
and fires. The fea-gull falls. 

Imagine, if you can, Friday's terror andfur- 
prife. He fell down as if it were himfelf that 
had been flior. Immediately his old fuper- 
ftitioh revived concerning Tou^ariy who pro- 
duces the thunder. Aftonifhed and coji- 
fufed as he was, he took his mafter for ^ou- 
pan. He raifed himfelf up on his knees, 
and held out his hands, in a trembling and 
fuppliant manner, towards Robinfon, with- 
out being able to utter a fmgle word. 

Robinfon was far from making a joke of 
any thing that concerned religion,, though 
ever fo erroneous. The moment, there- 
fore, that he fufpedled Friday's fuperftitious 
notions, he was vexed that he had not pre- 
vioufly informed him of what he was going 

to 



38 T H E N E Vr 

to do when he fired, and, therefore, haflen- 
cd to clear up his miftake. He raifed him 
in a friendly manner, embraced him af- 
fedionately, bid htm. take courage and 
ccafe trembling i and added, that he would 
teach him, in a moment, how to make the 
fame thunder and lightning j for there was 
nothing but what was perf:dly natural in 
every thing he had feen and heard. He ex- 
plained to him the nature and efFedls of 
gunpowder ; fhewed him the conftru6lion of 
die gun ; and, loading it in his prefence, 
gave it to him, that he might fire it ofF^ 
But Friday was ftill in too great a fright, 
and begged Robinfon to try the experiment 
ia his ftead. He, therefore, fet up a mark 
about a hundred yards off, and fired, while 
Friday flood by his Mc, 

He was very near falling a fecond time,. 
(b terrible did what he, law and heard ap-i 
pear to him. There were feveral grains of 
fhot in the mark, which had entered pretty 
deeply into the wood.. Robinfon, having re- 
marked this to him, made him perceive 

how 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3^ 

how fecure they mufl be for the future a- 
gainft all attacks of the favages, while they 
had this artificial thunder and lightning in 
their power. What he was now witnefs to, 
and what he had feen in the fhip> infpired 
bim with fo profound a veneration for Eu- 
ropeans in general and Robinfon in parti- 
cular, that for fome days he could not re- 
cover that air of familiarity which he had 
ufually kept up with his friend. Night 
coming on put an end to the agreeable hk^ 
bours of this happy day.

He had not ever fince his coming to the

feen himfelf fo happy as at prcfent ; and* 
never was man more touched with love and 
gratitude towards his Supreme Benefadtor,

How often, when alone, did he offer up 
his thanks, in the moft refpedtful pofture,. 
to the Heavenly Difpofer of all Things, for 
the bleffingS' that he had vouch fafed him 1 
Nor was he content, widi feeling thefe fen- 
timents of gratitude himfelf, he endeavoured 
aifo to communicate them to Friday. With 
this view, he taught him,, before they went 
to reft, a prayer of thankfgiving, which they 
both repeated with foftened and grateful 
hearts, to the praife of the Supreme Being>. 
the Univerfal Father of Nature. 

The next morning they rofe pretty early, 
and carried all their goods into a coppice, 
where they covered them with boughs of 
tcees to fecure them from the rain if it 

ihould.

Ihould fall, and then fet off with the firft ebb 
to return to the wreck. 

I forgot to tell you that they had provi- 
ded themfelves with oars, fo that this trip 
was made in much lefs time than the for- 
mer, and to the full as fortunately. They 
took care, in the iirft place, to lower down 
upon their raft all the planks that they could 
find in the Ihip, with which they might 
cover the raft as it were with another floor, 
and fo keep the goods much drier than 
thofc which they had carried away the day 
before. 

Robinfon examined the cargo afrefh, to 
•chufe whatever he Ihould think preferable 
in fo great a quantity of goods, which he 
could not carry away all at once. He was 
not, indeed, fo much puzzled this time, as 
•he had already fecured the moft necefTary 
articles ; however, he chofe nothing with- 
t)ut fully weighing the value of it. 

Amongft other things he refolved to 
carry away one of the fix fmall carriage 
guns that were in the ihip.

, iRicb. A gun ! I think he might hav€ 
carried away fomething more ufeful. 

Mr, Bill, Yes, fo we may think who 
fee things at a diftance, Robinfon, on the 
contrary, who judged of his fituation from 
a nearer view of it, thought this gun a very 
necefTary article, were it only for his eafe 
and fecurity. 

Rich, How fo ? 

Mr. Bill, The part of the Ihore, where 
he was obliged for the prefent to lodge 
what goods he had brought out of the Ihip, 
was open on every fide, and, unfortunately, 
at no great diftance from the fpot where the 
favages ufed to land. He might, indeed, 
depend with tolerable fecurity upon the ufc 
of his guns and piftols, in cafe of an attack, 
but the idea that he fhould be thereby re- 
duced to the cruel necelTity of killing fome 
of thofe unhappy favages, made him Ihud-' 
der whenever he thought of it. His de- 
ilgn was, therefore, in having a piece of 
cannon on the Ihore, to fire a ball over 
their heads when they approached^the ifland

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

In their canoes, a'nd fo terrify them, and 
jtrjake them perhaps fheer off and return to 
their bwn country. 

You fee now, my dear Richard, how^ 
Jiable we arc to be miftaken, when we take 
^pon us to give an opinion concerning the 
behariour of other perfons. We very fel- 
dom know all the motives that induce a 
man to a&: j how can we, therefore, be fo 
prefunrrptuou^ as to fet up forjudges of his 
actions ? A wife man thinks that he can 
never be too circumfpe6l iti the judgment- 
which he-pafles upon 'the rohdnft of othei^ 
perforiS; he even forbears to give an opi- 
nion unlefs he be obliged; he is fdifiblethat 
he has enough to do to look to himfelf and 
his own affairs; and thus, my dear "chil- 
dren, we will endeavour to adl for the fti- 
tvlre. 

Befides the piece of cannon, they placed 
^Ifo upon the raft the following articles 1 
rft. three fmali bags, one of rye, another 
of barley, and the laft of peafe; 2d. a 

chefi 



44 T H E N X W 

cheft of nails and fcrews ; 3d. a dozen of 
hatchets ; 4th, a barrel of gunpowder^ 
with balls and Ihot i 5th, a fall j 6tht a 
^indftone. 

y^/Vi^. Why that ? 

Mr, BilL To fliarpen knives, hatchet^ 
and other tools, when they required it^ 

Rich. Were there no ftones upon the 
iQand ? 

Mr, Bill. Yes, plenty 5 but none fit for 
iharpening their inftrunrients. Have not 
you obferved, that thofe ftones which are 
ufed for that purpofe are of a particular 
fort, and much fofter than moft others ? 

Rich. Yes, I have. 

Mr. BilL Well, Robinfon had never yet 
found upon his iQand any of that fort of 
ilone, ivhich has lefs hardnefs than ftone in 
'general, and feems compofcd of grains of 
land. But a grindftone is not only exceed- 
ingly ufeful, but indifpenfably neceffary to 
thofe who make ufc of Iharp iron tools. 
He preferred it, therefore,, without helita- 

tion, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4- 

tion to the gold-duft and diamonds^ which 
he had valued fo little before, and had left 
behind him in his firft trip to the vefTel. 

Before he fet off to return^ Robinfon ex- 
amined the condition of the fhip. He 
found that the leak was gaining ground, 
and that the rubbing of her fides againfb 
the rock, occafioned by the motion of the 
waves, had already loofened and Parted fe- 
veral planks. He forefaw, therefore, that 
the firft guft of wind would daili the fhip 
to pieces, and concluded that he rauft be 
expeditious if he wiflied to fave much more 
<:>f the cargo. 

As the wind blew then towards Ihore, 
they were able to reach it folely by the af- 
iiftance of their fail and oars, though the ebb, 
which had fcarce run half down, was againft 
them. In their way to the fhore, Robinfon 
blamed himfelf much for one thing. His 
way of thinking here proves him to have 
been a perfed lover of juftice. 

Edw, For what did he blame himfelf, 
papa ? 

Vol. IV. C Mr. 



46 T !H E NEW 

Mr, Bill. For not carrying away the 
gold-dufh and diamonds. 

Edw, What would he have done with 
them ? 

Mr. Bill. He had no view of ufing thefe 
things himfelf, but he reafoned thus : " It 
is not abfoiutely impofnble," faid he, *^ that 
the captain of the vefTcl may be ftill a- 
live, and come fome day or other to exa- 
mine whether he cannot fave part of the 
cargo. If a gale of wind were to rife and 
dafh the Ihip to pieces before you could 
go back to itj and thus the diamonds and 
gold-duft were to be loil, how could you 
juftify yourfelf to the ov;ner and to your own 
confcience, for having thought merely of fa- 
ving what might be ofufe to you^rfelf, without 
paying the lead attention to his intereft by 
faving the goods that would be moft valu- 
able to him ? Perhaps his fortune, and that 
of many other perfons, depend on this 
flight inftance of attention which yooi have 
neglefled to pay them. Robin fon ! Ro- 
binfon 1" cried he, highly diflatisfied with

himfelf, " how far art thou ilill from being 
as jufl as thou oughtefl to be !" 

He was on the point of pufliing back a- 
gain before he landed, his confcience was 
fo touched at his negledling a duty which 
he with reafon looked upon as facred> 

In the mean time they approached the 
ihore^ and, jufl: as they were about to land, 
they ran the rilk of feeing all their goods loft 
in the fea ; for, as it continued ftiil to ebb, 
and the depth of the water leflened every 
moment, the headmoft part of the raft was 
foon upon the dry fand, and, confequently, 
higher than the fternmofl:, which was fup- 
ported by the water, that was falling every 
inilant. Luckily Robinfon and Friday 
were both aftern, and, therefore, able to 
flop the goods which were flipping off, and 
to keep them from rolling into the fea. 

After they had made all things fteady, 
they were obliged to Vvalk in the water and 
mud up to the knees before they could get 
them afhore. By their care and precaution 
in this bufinefs, nothing was either loft or da- 
C 2 magcd, 



4S T H E N E W 

maged, and they were ready to put to lea 
asain before the return of the tide. 

Robinfon was no fooner aboard the fhip 
but he haftened to convey upon the raft the 
barrel of gold-dufl and the cafKet of jewels ; 
and, having thus relieved his confcience of 
a load which lay upon it, he thought he had 
now a right to think of himfelf. 

In this trip he carried away, among other 
articleSjfome wheel-barrows which happened 
to be aboard, I know not for what ufe ; a 
great quantity of cloaths and linen -, a num- 
ber of tools and pieces of furniture ; a lan- 
tern, and all the papers that were in the 
captain's cabin. As the tide was nov/ flow- 
ing up, they fet fail, and, having the ad- 
vantage of wind and tide, they were quickly 
aibore. 

Robinfon fpent the red: of the day in 
taking a precaution which he thought in- 
difpenfably neceflary. He trembled at the 
idea, that, were a heavy fhower to come on, 
he fhould be difabled from ufing what he 
counted the moft valuable of all his effecfls, 

namely. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

nai-nelvj his gunpowder. To prevent fuch 
an accident, he .refolved that very day to 
make a tent of a large failcloth which he 
had laved, and to lodge his trealure under 
it, where it would be iafely ilieltered from 
the rain. 

As he was now provided v/ich fciffars and 
with needle and thread, this work v/as foon 
finifhed, and Friday was not long before 
he knew enough of it to be able to aiTill 
hinn. He could nqt fuiRciently adnnire the 
admirable invention of the needle and fcif- 
fars i and frequently declared, that, in com- 
parifon of the induflrious Europeans, he 
and his countrymen were no better than 
poor idiots. 

They finifhed the tent before fun-fet, and 
Robinfon had fbill time to fhew Friday the 
effect of a gr^at gun. Fie charged it with 
a ball, and pointed the muzzle towards the - 
fea, that the ball might fkim the furface of 
the water, and Friday might fee dillindlly 
how far the gun would carry. Robinfon 
put fire to the touch-hole, and though Fri- 
C 3 day 



50 T H E K E W 

day was already in fome meafure prepared 
for it by two Ihots from the aiufkec, yet 
the explofion being now mueh louder^ terri- 
fied him fo much, that he trembled from 
head to foot. The bail marked its courfe 
on the furface of the water by lightly dip- 
ping and rebounding until it was out of 
fight. Friday affirmed, that a lingle fhot 
like this would be fufficient to turn his 
whole nation of countrymen to fudden flight, 
if they were even approaching by thou- 
fands ; becaufe they would not have a doubt 
that he who could produce fuch thunder 
muil certainly be Toupan. 

After night- fall, Rcbinfon put a light in 
his lantern to caft an eye over the papers 
that he had faved, in order to difcover the 
fhip's deftination, and to whom fhe belong- 
ed : but,^ unfortunately, all thefe papers, as 
well as the books, were written in a lan- 
guage that he did not underftand. Here, 
therefore, he had frefli occafion to be forry 
for having negleded the ftudy of foreign 
languages when hx might have kc^-nt them. 

. But 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5I 

But this forrow^ coming too late, was of no 
life. 

Two circunnftances, however, which he 
obferved, gave him fome information con- 
cerning the fhip's deftination, and the ob- 
ject of her voyage. He found, amongil 
others, fome letters for perfons in Barba- 
does, an ifland in the Weft Indies, where 
there is a great traffic for (laves. 

Henry, Traffic for flaves, papa ? 

Mr, BilL I will explain it to you. In 
Africa — you remember, I fuppofe, which 
way that quarter of the world lies ? 

Henry, Oh, yes ; towards the South. 

Mr, Bill, In Africa, which is the coun- 
try of the negroes, men, in ignorance 
and ftupidity, do not feem to differ much 
from the brutes. Their chiefs or kings, 
who are as favage as themfelves, treat them 
accordingly. If any Europeans arrive oa 
their coafts, whole crowds of blacks are of- 
fered to them for fale, as we fell cattle here 
in a market. Even fathers bring their 
children, and exchange them for trifles. 
C 4 Thus 



52 T H E N E W 

Thus the Europeans every year purchafe a 
great number of negroes, and carry them to 
the Weft Indies^ where they are forced to 
work at the hardeft labour, and are treated 
in every refpe(fl with a great deal of feve- 
ricy. The lot of fuch a Jlave (for fo thefe 
unfortunate people are called by their pur- 
chafers) is truly Vv^retched, nor can we won- 
der that many have even preferred death to 

Rich. It is not well" done to ufe human 
beings in that manner. 

Mr. Bill. Certainly it is very unjuft; and 
we have hopes that in time this ijiiquitous 
traffic of flaves will be abolifhed. 

Robinfon found alfo, among the papers, 
an account from which he gathered that the 
ihip was bound for Barbadoes, and had a 
hundred flaves aboard. Having commiUni- 
cated this circumftance to Friday, he added, 
** Who knows if thefe poor wretches are 
not indebted for their liberty to the ftorm 
which occafioned the fhip to ftrike ? Who 
knows whether they have not faved them^-

ifland, where, their tyrants having no lon- 
ger any power over them, they now live 
after their fafhion, happy and contented ?" 
Friday agreed that this conje6ture was not 
wholly improbable. ^' Well then, my 
friend," replied Robinfon, with fome warmth, , 
*' could you now repeat the queftion that 
you lately afked me ?" 

jFr/W. What queftion ? 

Rclf. You afKed m.e, of what ufe could l 
the ftorrp be that carried away our canoe ? 

Friday looked down, quite aihaa>ed and 
confounded ? 

** Oh ! Friday," faid Robinfon, animated 
with pious zeal, ^^ acknowledge, here, thej 
hand of an all-powerful and all-wife God, , 
which has appeared fenfibly in this affair. 
Confider what the ftorm has given us, in . 
return for the little that it has taken away. 
Cafe your eyes on all thefe different articles ; -

deed, an unpleafant thing to owe one's 
happinefs to the misfortunes of another 5. 
yet, the greateft nunnber of thofe who were 
in the fhip are now, perhaps, better off than 
before fhe ftruck. As this fuppofition is 
not wholly void of probability, what think 
you now of the power which governs the 
world r' 

** I think,'' anfwered Friday, " the wif- 
dom and goodnefs of that power are inex- 
prefTible, and I was a fenfelefs idiot in fay- 
ing what I did.*' At the fame time, he 
lifted up his hands and eyes towards Hea- 
ven, and implored pardon for the fault which 
he had committed through flupidity. 

Robinfon took as much care of the pa- 
pers which he had been looking over, as of 
the diamonds and gold-duft, that, if ever 
he returned to Europe, he might, by means 
of them, difcover the perfons to whom he 
(hould reftore the treafure that he had faved 
out of the fhip. 

For fix days fucceflively they made two 
or three trips a day to the wrecks and brought 

to 



ROBINSON CRirSOE. 5J 

to land every thing that they could pofTibly 
convey away. A thoufand little matters 
which we would fcarcely think it worth 
while to pick up, becaufe we have never 
felt how difagreeable the lots of them is, 
were of infinite value to them, and, there- 
fore, they did not negledl to take them 
away. One part of the cargo confifted of 
elephants teeth , thofe they did not touch, 
becaufe they could make no ufe of them^ 
They alfo left behind feveral hogfheads of 
coffees as Robinfon was determined not to 
fall again into the habit of ufmg pernicious 
fuperfluities though ever fo agreeable : but 
they tore up and carried away as many of 
the ihip's planks as they could, becaufe they 
feemed hkely to be ufeful, and, confe- 
quently, valuable. They took away even 
the remaining five pieces of cannon, toge- 
ther with all the iron that they either found 
loofe or could loofen from the fhip's works. 
After they had made eighteen trips,all with 
good fuGcefs, they obferved, as they were on 
board the nineteenth time^ that a ftorm was

rifiiig very fail. They made hade, there* 
fore> to load the raft and pufli offi hoping 
to gain the Ihore by rowing before the llorm 
fhould gather flrength. But in vain ; they 
were fcarce half way towards the ihore when 
a violent gale of wind, accompanied with 
thunder, lightning, and rain, fwelled and 
agitated the fea in fuch a manner, that the 
waves, rolling over the raft, carried off all 
the goods that were upon it. As to them- 
felves, they held pretty clofe for fome time 
to the maft, fo that the waves could not 
wafh them away, though at times they went 
clean over their heads. 

At length, the flightnefs of the raft be- 
gan to give way to the fury of the waves. 
The cordage and ofier bindings, which held 
the pieces of it together, being loofened,, all 
the beams of which it confided quickly came 
afunder. 

Harriet, Heavens! what will, become of 
poor Robinfon ? 

I'he Children. Softly ! have patience ! 

Mr. Bill. Friday fought to fave himfelf 

by 



ROB 1 K 5 ON C R U S O E. ^J 

by fwimming,- and Robinfon feized a piece 
of wood, with which he was fometimes 
plunged into the deep,, and fometimes rode- 
upon the ridge of the waves. But, being 
lon9:er under water than above, he bad lod- 
his breath, an^d could neither fee nor hear. 
His ftrength now forfook him, and he was- 
almoft infenfjble ; he inters a weak cry, and 
fmks dov/a, oppreiTed by a huge wave, which 
carries away the beam that fupported him. 

Happily his faithful Friday was not far^ 
from him^, though he might have faved him-^- 
feif and gained the fliore fooner if he had 
chofen to do fo. When, he faw him fink, 
he, without heiitating a moment, dived down, , 
feized him with his left hand, and by means 
of his right rofe with him again to the furface 
of the water. He then exerted bimfelf with 
fo m-uch fuccefs, that, in a few minutes, he 
reached the Ihore with his mafter's body,

Friday, who was diflradled at his mader's 
prefent condition, carried him a little farther 
up on the beach, hung over him, called 
him with a loud voice, fhook him, rubbed 
him, and joined his lips to his mouth to 
communicate breath to him if poflible. Ar 
length he had the . inexpreliible fatisfa6lion 
to perceive figns of life in him ; he, there-- 
fore, continued his exertions, and Robinfon 
quickly recovered the ufe of his faculties. 

Opening his eyes, he alked, in a weak 
and trembling voice, " Where am I ?" " In 
my arms, my dear mailer !" anfwered Friday, 
with tears in his eyes. An affecting fcene 
now took place between them. Robinfon 
thanked Friday a thoufand times, and called 
him his faviour : Friday, for his part, thro' 
joy at feeing him reftored to himfelf, was alr> 
moft ready ta run wild. 

My dear children, we cannot finifh the 
account of that day's adventures with any 
circumftance more interefting than this* 
Enough, therefore, for the prefent time.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59- 



TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING. 

J^R, BILL. Well, my dear children, 
our friend Robinfon is reftored to life 
once more. A good night's fleep in his 
tent, upon a bed that he had faved from the 
wreck, recovered him fo well, that he was., 
up at day-break -, he felt himfelf pofTeiTed 
of his ufual flrength, and returned thanks to 
God for having preferved both his life and 
health. The ftorm had continued the 
whole night, and h€ waited, with, impa- 
tience, until it was broad day-light, to fee 
what was become of the fhip. 

The fun was now above the horizon, 
and Robinfon faw, to his grief, that the 
fliip had difappeared. Planlcs and tim- 
bers, fcattered here and there upon die 
beach, were fufficient tokens that the ftorm. 
Lad dallied it to pieces. This being the 

cafe^ 



60 T H E N E W 

cafe, he found fome reafon to aoplaud his- 
own forefight in faving every part of the 
cargo that he could. Happy the man- whofe 
prudence and caution always regulate his 
condud, and who,, in all the accidents 
■which deprive hinn of any advantage, can 
fay to hinnfelf, with truth, as Robinfon 
€ouldupon this occafion, that it was not his 
fault ! How much this inward facisfadioa 
•willlighten the misfortunes, which, with* 
out it, would be accompanied with the 
greateft vexation ! 

Robinfon and Friday were particularly 
careful to gather all the remains of the 
wreck together on one fpot of the beach. 
They forefaw that every plank and every 
^linter might be of ufe another time. Wherji 
they had finifhed every thing that concerned 
the wreck, they formed a regular plan of 
the employments which were to take place 
next. 

The objedl was, at prefent, to convey all 
thefe goods to their dwelling-place; but 
tiiey thought it dangerous, while they car- 
ried 



R©B1NS0N CRUSOE. 5l 

rled one parcel, to be at fo great a diflance 
from the reft. Robinfon fettled it, there- 
fore, that they (hoiild carry the goods and 
(land guard alternately, the one in the 
morning, the other in the afternoon. He 
loaded the carriage guns, ranged them 
befide each other, like a battery, and point- 
ed them towards the fea. They kindled a 
fire, which he who ftood fentinel was to 
take care to keep up ; and they placed a 
match befide the guns, that they might be 
ready to fire whenever the cafe required it. 
Robinfon made the firft journey to carry 
the goods home. In order to fpare his befl 
cloaths, he had dreft himfelf like a failor j 
and, inflead of the weapons that he formerly 
wore, he had now a cutlafs by his fide, and 
two loaded piftols in his girdle. He began 
by loading his wheel-barrow with fome 
cafks of gunpowder and other articles 
which were moft in danger from the rain. 
The water-fpaniel, which had never quitted 
him, was, by no means, a ufelefs compa- 
nion on this journey. Robinfon harneffed 

hiai 



€2 T H E K E W 

him to the wheel-barrow, and the dog was 
of confiderable fervice to him in conveying 
the burthen forward. As thefe fpaniels are 
very docile, and capable of being taught 
many things, this dog was foon trained to 
his new employment, and acquitted himfelf 
in it as well as any beaft accuftomed to the 
draught. He carried alfo a parcel in his 
■mouth, which he had been taught to do by 
thofe to whom he formerly belonged. 

At his return^ Rbbinfon brought all his 
lamas, ready harnelTed for carrying burthens, 
in order to ufe them for that purpofe. As 
-there were feven of them, and each of them 
was able to carry one hundred and fifty 
pounds weight, you may cafily calculate the 
weight of goods v/hich they, all together^ 
conveyed home every journey. 

So many articles could not all be flowed 
in Robinfon's cellar. He haftened, there- 
fore, to pitch another large tent in the en- 
clofed ground before his cave. This was 
meant as a ftore-tent for the prefent, until 
other m^ans fhould be contrived for fecu- 

iing 



ROBINSON CHUSOE. 63 

ring the things. In eight days the whole 
was carried home, except a nunnber of 
boards and tinibers which they Ihehered as 
well as they could with thickets and brulh- 
wood. 

Harriet. But, papa, you have not told us 
any thing more about the goat. 

Mr. Bill, Ah ! very true j I had nearly 
forgot her. Well, the goat, as you may 
fuppofe, was brought home alio, and put 
into a little park along with the tame la- 
mas, and fhe agreed very well v;ith them. 

What agreeable employments have Ro- 
binfon and Friday now before them ! They 
fcarce know v.here to begin. However, 
Robinfon, who had contracSted a tafle for 
regularity, as well as the habit of it, quickly 
diilinguillied the more neceiTary labours 
from thofe which were lefs ^o^ and did not 
hefitate in giving the preference to the for- 
mer. The m.oft important of all was the 
building of a flied, or ftorehoufe, to Ihelter 
the goods, which could not be put into the 
cellar, more fecurcly than they were under 

the 



•64 T H E N E W 

the tent. Here it was neccfTary to do the 
bufinefs of a houfe-carpenter, to which they 
had neither of them ferved an apprentice- 
fhip. 

But what could be dliBcult to the induf- 
trious and perfevering Robinfon now that 
he was provided with all forts of tools ? 
The moft troublefome pieces of v^ork, and 
thofe in which he had the leaft experience, 
were no more than a play to him who had 
happily fuccecded in fo many others with- 
out affiftance or proper tools. The cut- 
ting down and hewing out of the trees, the 
^uaring of the beams and rafters, th^ join- 
ing and fitting of them, building of brick 
walls, making of a double roof, one of 
boards, and the other of the leaves of the 
cocoa-nut tree — were all executed with fur» 
prifing difpatch. 

The little building, when finifhed, was 
riot much unlike one of our country cot- 
tages. Robinfon had taken care to bring 
away with him the (hip's cabin windows ; 
they ferved to give light to the building, 

without

without the inconveniency of holes that 
would let in the wind. The giafs was an 
objefl of particular admiration to Friday ; 
he had never feen any before, and he learnt, 
by experi<:nce, the commodious purpofes 
that it ferves. 

When all was put under cover and in 
pi'oper order, Robinfon thought of contri* 
V'ing for himfelf a convenient way of enter- 
ing his fortrefs without weakening it. The 
mod fecure method for the purpofe was by 
means of a common gate and a drawbridge^ 
Being provided with every neceflary for this 
Uvidertaking, as nails, chains, hinges, locks, 
and iron work of all forts, he immediately 
began upon it. They firft made the gate 
and the drawbridge ; and, afterwards, they 
made an opening in -the terrace and pali- 
fade fufficient for the width of the gate, 
which they next reared up in its place -, 
then they laid down the bridge in fuch a 
manner, that, when raifed, it might lie 
againft the gate, and cover it. Laflly, they 
loaded the guns, and placed them upon the

terrace, in fnch pofitions, that two of them 
Ihould defend the right flank, two the left, 
and two the front of their fortification : 
fo that henceforward they might be quite at 
their eafe as to the attacks of the favages, 
and had, befides, the advantage of an eafy 
and convenient way for going in and out. 

When harveft time was come, Robinfon 
made ufe of an old hanger, inftead of a 
fickle, to cut down his maize, and his wood- 
en fpade lerved him for digging his pota- 
toes. How eafily was the work performed 
with fuch inftruments ! It would have been 
a pleafure to fee them gather their harveft, 
and ftill more to alTift them. 

Henry. Oh ! I wifh I had been there ! 
How I would have worked I 

Edw, Nay, you have no occafion to go 
fo far as Robinfon Crufoe*s ifland for work. 
Papa will find you plenty, if you are fond 
of it. There is wood to be fawed, to 
be fplit, and to be carried i there are plats 
in the garden to be dug up ; there is weed- 
ing and watering of the flowers ; and, in 
fliort, yoa will always And enough to do. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

Mr, Bill, Why do I fet you to work at 
thefe different employments ? 

Rkb, To accuftom us never to be idle, 
to (Irengthen our bodies, and preferve us 
in good health. 

Geo. For my part, I like it, and you fhall 
always find me, papa, as diligent and induf- 
trious as Robinlbn himfelf. 

Mr, Bill, Well, we fhall fee that. We 
are very fenfible that Robinfbn was the bet- 
ter for it, and every one of us alfo experi- 
ences more and more the happy effeds of 
aa a6live way of life. 

When the harveft was gathered, Robinfoa 
made two fiails. Friday foon learned the 
ufe of them, and in one day they thrafhed 
all their maize. It filled two facks which 
might contain about fix bufhels. They 
had a ftock of bifcuits which would laft: 
fome months ; but as it mufV, of courfe, 
lefTen every day, Robinfon refolved to fup« 
ply its place occafionally with bread, which 
he intended to make himfelf. 

He had brought a hand-mill from the 
D 2 ihipi 



.63 THE N E W 

iliip, and wanted nothing but a fieve to bolt 
tlie flour, and an oven for baking the bread. 
He found expedients for both. Some fine 
rnuQin, of which there was a whole piece 
amongft the goods faved fronn the Ihip, 
ferved him to make the bottom of his 
fieve ; and the buikling of the oven gave 
him very litde trouble ; fo that the whole 
was finifhed before the rainy feafon came 
on. 

He made, by way of trial, tvvo forts of 
bread, one of rye flour, and the other- of 
maize. The rye bread was by far the bet- 
ter tailed of the two, which determined 
Robinfon to give it the preference. He 
propofed to fow the greatefb part of his land 
with rye, inftead of maize, ,that he might 
always have a (lock of grain fufficient to 
fupply them v.'ith bread j nor did this feem 
an undertaking beyond his power to accom- 
plrQij.affifted as he was by his man Friday, 
fmce in this ifland they might have two 
crops in the courfe of the year. 

There was one article that would have 

been 



R O B I N S O N C R U S E. 69 

been exceedingly ufeful to thenrij but, unfor- 
tunately, they could find nothing of the fort 
amongfl the goods in the Ihip ; and that was 
an iron fpade. It is true, Friday had made 
one of hard wood that might ferve upon 
occafion, but ftill they found room to wilh 
for a better 3 for it is certain, that an- iron 
fpade is, after all, more handy and effedlive 
for breaking up the ground, than a wooden 
one can polfibly be. Robinfon, therefore, 
who determined, for the future, to make 
agriculture his principal employment, as 
being, of all forts of labour, the moil agree- 
able and moil ufeful, conceived the defign 
of fixing up a forge to make fpades him- 
felf, and, pofTibly, other inftruments be- 
fides. 

This defign was not fo extravagant a$ 
perhaps you may think it ^ for every thing 
neceflary for a forge was to be found in his 
florehoufe. There was a fmall anvil, fe- 
veral pair of pincers, a pretty large pair of 
bellows, and fuch- a flock of iron, both 
Wrought and in bars, as would probably be 
D 3 fufficient 



fO T H E N E W 

fufficient to keep him in work all his hfe- 
time. This plan was, therefore, innmedi' 
ately put in execution. 

By means of a large boarded roof, which 
they put over the kitchen, it was fo extended 
that they v/ere able to fix up a forge in 
it, and to work at it even during the rainy 
feafon. Part of this feafon, therefore, they 
ipent in working fnniths work ; and if they 
fucceeded upon the v/hole, it was not with- 
out fome difappointments and unfucccfbful 
trials. When the fpades were finifhed,Robin- 
fon had a mind to go a little farther, and to 
try his abilities at making a plough \ and in 
tliis alfo, to his inexpreffible joy, he perfe6tly 
fucceeded. 

This plough was, you may fuppofe, very 
different from ours. It confided of a fin- 
gle branch of a tree \ one end of which, 
bending down, rcfled on the ground, and 
was furnifbed with aibck, and alfo a handle, 
by means of which the perfon who ploughed 
jnight guide it at pkafure : at the other 
end they were to harnefs their oxen, or 

horfes : 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Jx 

hoiTes; but as they had none, they were 
obliged themfelves to fupply their places. 
In a word> this plough was exadly like 
that in ufe amongft the ancient Greeks, at 
their firft undertaking the pradtice of agri- 
culture. I can give you a fKetch i)f it here. 




Henry, Really, it is a very curious 
plough. 

Geo, Had it no wheels i 

Mr. Bill No : you fee it had not. All 
inftruments were at firfl as fimple in their 
make as this plough. By degrees mea 
made additions for greater convenience : 
fo by altering and improving they encrea- 
fed the utility and commodioufnefs of the 
tools neceffary for their different labours. 

In the mean dme, Robinfbn had eVery 

reafontobe proud of this inveiidon i it was 

D 4 wholly 



72 T H E N E W 

wholly his own, for he had never feen a plan 
of it. By all that we can learn froni hiftoryj 
many ages of the world elapfed before men 
arrived at the invention even of fo fimple a 
machine as this plough ; and the inventors 
of it were looked upon by pofterity a& men of 
fuch exalted wifdom, that, after their death, 
they were paid divine honours. Richard, 
you remember the name of him to w^hom 
the Egyptians attribute the invention of the 
plough. 

Rich. Yes ; it was Ofiris, whom, for that 
reafon, they afterwards worfhipped as agod» 

Mr, Bill. The Phoenicians afcribed this 
ufeful invention to one Dagon, whom they 
alfo regarded as a being of fuperior order, 
and called the Son of Heaven . 

Edw, But could not Robinfbn make the 
lamas draw the plough ? 

Mr. Bill. At firft he doubted whether 
they were fit for this work, as they feemed 
rather beafts of burthen than of draught; 
however, he determined to make a trial of 
them, and the fuccefs of it exceeded his 

hopes. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 
hopes. They became gradually accullom- 
ed to the work, which, at length, they per- 
formed in every refpedl as perfectly as if 
Robinfon and Friday had been brought up 
ploughmen, and the lamas had been trained 
like our beafts of draudit. 

To fow their field according to all the 
rules of art, there wanted but one inllru- 
ment, which they could fcarcely do with- 
out, and which they had not found in the 
lliip.- 

Henry, lean guefs what that was. 

Mr.BtlL What do you think ? 

Henry.- A harrow. 

Mr. Bill. You are rig-ht. Without it 
tillage would be imperfecfl. By means of 
it we break the clods, throw the grains of 
corn into the furrows, and cover them, 
without which they would never fpring up, 
but be devoured by the birds. 

In the firft place, Robinfon made as ma- 
ny iron teeth as he thought v/ouid be ne- 
ceflary for the harrow. After fome unfuc- 
cefsful attempts, hcj at length, fucceeded in 
making the wooden fram^e in which thefe 
^ i iron 



74 T H E N E W 

iron teeth were to be fixed. Laftly, he 
made as many holes in the frame as it was 
to contain teeth, and when he had driven 
them in, and clinched them, the harrow 
was finifhed. 

The rainy feafon being over, he fowed 
two bufhels of rye, one of barley, and half a. 
bufhel of peafe i and, at the end of five 
months, he had the fatisfadion to gather a 
crop of twelve times as much feed as he had 
fown, namely, twenty-four bufhels of rye,. 
twelve of barley, and fix of peafe ; a ftock 
more than fufficient to laft them fix months. 
But, like a prudent ceconomift, he was will- 
ing to have a fuperabundance of every 
thing, becaufe there might come on a fea- 
fon of fcarcity y befides, hail or other acci- 
dents might deftroy his crops. He refolv- 
ed, therefore, to have a barn, which, being 
filled every half year, might always contain 
a fufficient flock, in cafe a crop fbould hap- 
pen to fail. ~ 

With this intention, when the weather 
was fettled fair, they unroofed the flore- 
houfe, in oider to add another flory to it, 

which.

which might ferve as a granary. The build* 
ing of this required more Ikill and labour 
than that of the ground floor ; but their 
indefatigable perfeverance triumphed over 
all difficulties, and the woik was fbon hap- 
pily completed. 

During thefe tranfadions, the goat ye^- 
td two young ones -, fb that the ipecies- 
might now be multiplied and kept up ort 
the ifland. The fpaniel ferved as a- guard 
by night, and Poll, the parrot, amufed: 
them at table, and pretty often alio whentv 
riiey were at work. On the other hand,, the: 
lamas were become more valuable to thenr 
than ever ; as, befides affording milk, but- 
ter, and cheefe, they afiifted in tilling the 
ground.- In order, therefore, to be per- 
fe6lly happy, Robinfon wanted nothing; 
now but — ^guefs. 

Rich. To be with his father and mov

Mr. Bill, And to have forie more com-

to die before the other, who would their 
remain a poor hermit, feparated from all 
the reft of mankind. Yet Robinfon looked 
upon it as a blameable weaknefs to make 
one's life miferable by the dread of evils 
that arc pollible, but ftill concealed in fu- 
turity. ^' The fame power," thought he, 
'^ who has hitherto provided for me in all 
things with fuch unexampled bounty, will 
flill continue to exert it in my favour." 
Thus his life pafTed in tranquillity and con- 
tent. He enjoyed inwardly peace of mind ; 
and, without, every thing promifed him the 
moft perfed fecurity. Happy ftate 1 May 
God grant you all to enjoy the fame !

TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING. 

J^R. Bill Well, my dear children, I 
have a great number of things to re- 
late to you this evening. 

"the Children, Oh 1 fo much the better ! 
that is charming ! 

Mr, Bilk Provided only that I find my- 
felf able to do it. 

"The Children, Oh ! dear papa, we fhall 
take care not to interrupt you, fo that you 
will certainly be able to get through it. 

Mr, Bill, Well,, I fhall try ; but prepare 
yourfelves for a frefh fcene of horror, the 
event of which cannot be forefeen — ^By your 
motions I can nearly perceive what your 
conjedlures are ; the fequel will £hew whe- 
ther they are jull. 

If I were to go on now enumerating to 
you all that Robinfon performed every day 
by the help of the tools with which he was 

provided^ 



fS T H E N E W 

provided, the recital would not amufe you 
very much. 

Rich, It might be agreeable enough j 
but we can eafily imagine all that. 

Mr, Bill, I Ihall only inform you, that 
they fucceflively attempted many different 
arts, and imitated moft Ibrts of tradefmen 
— the baker, the blackfmith, the taylor, 
the ihoemakcr, the carpenter, the joiner, 
the wheelwright, the potter, the gardener; 
the butcher,^ the fifberman, and feveral 
others -, they imitated them, I fay, with {q 
much fuccefs, that they were foon able to 
make up a hundred things, for which we in- 
dolent Europeans require as many diffe- 
rent workmen. Their ftrength encreafed 
in proportion as they exerted it, and their 
minds, being in a ftate of conftant adivity^ 
and always in fearch of fome ufeful objedt, 
were improved every day more and more. 
May not this be regarded as a proof thair 
we were created for the fame adlivity, fince 
health, virtue, and happinefs, are the necef- 
fary confequences of it ? 

Six 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

Six months palTed away in thefe agreeable 
ennploynnents, during all which time Fri« 
day durft not revive the fcheme of taking a 
voyage to his own country 5 but frequently, 
after finifhing his tafk of work, he would 
go up the hill from whence he could fee 
bis native ifland, and there, buried in 
profound thoughtfulnefs, he lamented the 
misfortune of being feparated from his fa- 
ther, perhaps for ever. Robinfon, for his^ 
part, had avoided fpeaking on the fubjedlv 
becaufe it was not in his power to comply 
with his friend^s wifh while the neceffary ar- 
rangements, which their new way of living 
required, were ftill unfiniihed. 

At prefent the moll indifpenfable part& 
of the bufincfs were completed, and Robin- 
fon was the firft to propofe the building of 
another boat, to go and feek Friday's father.. 
At this propofal, the young man's joy was 
as great as formerly on the fame occafion,. 
and his thankfulnefs to Robinfon appeared- 
in the fame manner. The work was begun 
the very next day, and, with, the help of 

good 



So THE N t W 

good hatchets, was finifhcd, as you may ea-- 
fily imagine, much better and much fooner 
than the firfl time. 

One morning that Robinfon was engaged 
in the ordinary cares of his habitation, he 
fent Friday to the fea-fide for fom.e turtle, 
which was now become a rarity to them. 
After a fhort abfence, he came back run- 
ning at full fpeed. Out of breath with run- 
ning and with fright together, he could 
but juft ftammcr out thefe words, *^ Here 
they are ! here they are 1" 

Robinfon, in a fright, afked him haftily 
whom he meant. ^^ Oh ! mailer ! mafler i" 
anfwered Friday, " one, two, three — fix ca- 
noes 1" In his flurry he could fcarcely bring 
out the number fix. 

Robinfon ran haftily up to the top of the 
hillock, and faw, not without fhuddering, 
that Friday had counted right. He perceiv- 
ed fix canoes full of favages,- juft ready to 
land. Coming down immediately, he bid 
Friday be of good courage, who ftood 
trembling all the while j and he afked him, 

whether, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8l 

whether, if they fhould come to an engage- 
ment with the enemy, he would ftand by 
him faithfully, to the bed of his power. 

" Yes/' anfvvered he, " to the lafl drop 
of my blood /' for, having had time to re- 
cover himfelf, he felt his courage mount by 
degrees to its ufual pitch. " Well,'* faid 
Robinfon, '^ let us endeavour to prevent 
thefe monfters from executing their horrible 
defigns. I will explain my intention to you 
as we go along -, this is not the time to 
talk — we muft a<5l." 

With thefe words, he wheeled down one 
of the carriage guns, took fix mufkets, two 
brace of piftols, and two hangers. Each of 
them put a brace of piftols in his girdle, 
a hanger by his fide, and three mufkets on 
his fhould er, and when they had taken a 
fufficient quanrhy of powder and ball, 
they harneffed themfeives to the gun, and 
with a firm countenance took the field under 
all that formidable and warlike apparatus. 

Having pafied the drawbridge, they 
halted. Friday went back into the fort to 

raifc 



raife the bridge and fhut the gate, and the:?,- 
by means of the ladder of ropes^which always 
hung to the rock, he came out again, and 
joined his general. Robinfon thought this 
precaution. necefTary, that,in cafe their under*- 
taking ftiouid not fucceed, the enemy might 
not be able to get pofleiTion of his fortrefs. 

Here Robinfon explained to Friday the 
plan that he had formed. " V/e will go round 
the hillock/' faid he, *^ and walk through' 
the thickell part of the wood, that we may 
not be perceived by the enemy ; and, then^ 
ero fling amongft the thickets, which extend 
almoft to the fea-fide, we fh all approach the 
favages without being perceived by them. 
When within reachofthem^ we will fire the 
great gun, and the ball pafTing. over their 
heads, no doubt, will terrify the barbarians^ 
make them abandon their prey, and take tO' 
flight in their canoes." 

Friday thought the plan not Impra(5i:ica*. 
ble. " Thus,'* continued Robinfon, " we 
fhall have the fatisfaction of faving the un- 
fortunate wretches whom they intend to 

devour^. 



11 O B I N S O N <: R U S O E. S3 

devour, without fhedding a drop of blood. 
But if, contrary to our expedations, they 
fhould be encouraged by their numbers, 
and not take to flight, then, my dear Fri- 
day, we muft fhew that we are men, by 
bravely facing the danger to which wc fhali 
expofe ourfelves from the mod lauda- 
ble intentions. He, from whom nothing 
is hidj fees what induces us to endanger 
our lives ^3 he will preferve them if it be 
for our (advantage.: therefore, his will be 
done."- 

And fo faying, he gave his hand to his 
Gompanion, and they mutually promifed 
to aflift each other to the lafl drop of their 
t^ood. 

Having arrived without noife almofl at 
the laft of the thickets, they there made a 
halt. Robinfon, in a low voice, defired 
Friday to ileal with all pofiible circumfpec- 
tion behind a large tree which he fhewed 
him,, and then to come back and inform 
him whether he could difcover the enemy 
from that fpot. He brought word back 

that 



84 T H E N IE W 

that they were eafily to be feen fitting round 
a large fire, and picking the bones of 
one prifoner whom they had already dif- 
patched , that, not far froni then), he faw 
another lying on the ground, and tied hand 
and footj who feenned to be a white man, 
and had the appearance of a beard -, and 
that, in all probability, he was going foon to 
ihare the fame fate. 

Robinfon was ftartled at this report, ef- 
pecially when he heard mention of a white 
man. Having a profped glafs about him 
which he had found aboard the fhip, he 
went to the tree himfelf, and from thence, 
by the help of this inftrumcnt, could difco- 
ver that Friday's account was perfe6lly 
true. He faw about fifty favages fitting 
round a fire, and could clearly diflinguifti 
the prifoner to be an European. 

He could fcarcely contain himfelf; his 
heart throbbed, his blood boiled. If he 
were to yield to the fury of his firfl paflion, 
and fall upon thefe barbarians at once, it 
would be the way to Ihed much blood. 

Bur, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 
But, as the blind inftindl of paffion fhould 
never get the better of reafon, he reftrains 
his tranfports in order to avoid that un- 
pleafing necefTity. 

As there was a fpot farther on equally 
iteltered with thickets, he went behind a 
bufh pretty near the favages, and which had 
an opening in the nniddle of it large enough 
to fee through, though not to be remarked 
at a diftance -, there he points his cannon in 
fuch a manner that the ball would pafs over 
the heads of the favages high enougli not 
to hurt them. Then he told Friday, in a 
iow voice, to imitate exadly what he fliould 
fee him do. 

He lays down two of his mu fleets on the 
ground, and holds the third in his hand ; 
Friday does the fame : he then applies a 
lighted match to the touch-hole of the can- 
non, and fires it off*. 
t At the noife of the report, the favages 
fell backwards on the grafs as if they had 
been ail Ihot at once. Robinfon and Fri- 
day, on their fide, attentive to what pafled, 

and 



8^6 T H E N E W 

and uncertain what might be the events 
prepared for engaging if that fhonld hap- 
pen to be neceflary. In lefs than a mi- 
nute the favages rife off the ground, reco- 
vering from their aftonifhment; the moft 
fearful run to their canoes., but the boldeft 
take up their arms. 

They had been frightened merely by the 
neife of the cannon ; unfortunately^ they 
did not perceive the fire, nor hear the whift- 
ling of the ball. The fright was, therefore, 
not near fo great as had bfen expelled. 
After looking round on every fide without 
difcovering any thing that could terrify 
them again, they gathered courage, and 
thofe who were running away prefently re- 
turned. They all (ct up a dreadful yell, 
and began :their w^ar dance^ fhaking their 
weapons with furious looks and geftures. 

Robinfon was undetermined what to do ; 
but obferving with furprife, that, when the 
dance was ended, the whole company of the 
favages not only took their places again, 
but feat two of their number to feize the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

unfortunate European, he could not con- 
tain himfelf any longer. He looks at Fri- 
day, and fays to him, in a low voice, " You 
take the right, I the left, and Heaven be 
our defence !'* So faying, he prefents and 
fires ; Friday does the fame. 

The man took much better aim than the 
mafter ; for on the enemy*s left there fell 
five, and on the right only three : of thefe 
eight three were killed, the reft wounded. 
The confternation with which thofe who 
were not hurt took to flight, cannot be de- 
fcribed. Some ran one way, fome ano- 
ther, all of them yelling in the moft hi^ 
deous manner. Robinfon was going to 
fally out from behind the bufhes, fword 
in hand, in order to take advantage of their 
rout, and deliver the unfortunate Euro- 
pean, who lay bound hand and foot ; but 
he faw, with arionifhmenr, a party of the 
runaways rally all of a fudden, and ftand 
upon their defence. He made hade to 
take up a fecond mufliet, and Friday do- 
ing the fame, they both fired at once. 

Vol. IY. E At 



88 T H E N E W 

At this difcharge there fell only two of the 
enemy; but feveral of them being wound- 
ed, fome more, fome lefs dangeroufly, be- 
gan to run away, howling dreadfully : pre- 
fently, three of them fell down, but ftill 
v*'ich fome remains of life. 

Robinfon, when he laid down the gun 
that he had jufl fired, to take up the third, .d 
which was dill loaded, faid to Friday in a 1 
loud voice, " Now let us fhew ourfelves :'* 
at the fame inftant, they both ftart from 
their concealment, and appear before the 
favages. Robinfon flies to the unfortunate 
prifoner, to fhew him that relief was at 
hand ; but as he approaches him, perceives 
that fome of the favages, who before were 
running away, now that they difcovered 
their enemy, flopped fhort, and rallied 
to prepare for combat. He noticed this 
to Friday, who perfectly underflood his 
mafler's meaning, advanced a little way, 
fired, and faw one of the Indians fail. 

In the mean time, Robinfon, with hi« 
knife, cut the bulrufhes with which the 

prifoncr's 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 
prifoner's hands and feet were tied, and afk- 
ing him in Englifh and Latin who he was, 
the man anfwered in Latin, ChriftianuSy 
Hifpanus j that is, a Chriftian and a Spa- 
niard. His excelTive weaknefs hindered 
him from faying any more. Fortunately, 
Robinfon had taken care to provide a bot- 
tle of wine, in cafe of being wounded. He 
gave the Spaniard a little, which revived 
him exceedingly, fo that he foon began to 
recover his flrength. Robinfon then fur-- 
nifhed him with a hanger and a piftol, that 
he might help them to complete the defeat 
of the favages, and, mean time, Friday was 
ordered to bring all the mufkets, that they 
might be loaded afrefh. 

The moment the Spaniard was armed 
with a hanger and a piftol, he fell furioufly 
upon his enemies, and difpatched two of 
them in the twinkling of an eye. Friday, 
with the fixth muiket, which had not been 
fired yet, advanced to fupport him, while 
Robinfon was hailening to load the other 
five. The two champions found fome re-

Mance at firft, and were foon feparated i 
for the Spaniard canne to clofe engage- 
ment with a very ftout -Indian, and Friday, 
on the other hand, afcer firing his laft muf^ 
ket, purfued, fword in hand, a whole party 
of runaways. Tonne of whom fell beneath 
his arm, odiers jumped into the fea to fwim 
to their canoes, and the reft fled and hid 
themfelves amongft the bufhes. 

But the Spaniard was now hard put to 
it. He had, it is true, at firll, notwith- 
ftanding his weaknefs, attacked the Indian 
with great impetuofity, and given him two 
woimds in the head with his hanger : but this 
fo enraged the favage, that with his heavy 
ftone falchion he was near cutting the Spa- 
niard down, who found it as much as he 
could do to parry off his blows : nor, indeed, 
could he at length prevent the furious In- 
.dianfrom feizing him by the middle, throw- 
ing him to the ground, and twilling the 
hanger out of his hand ; but in the very 
foment that he was going to cut off his 
head, Robinfon, perceiving the Spaniard's 

danger,

danger, fired at the favage, and killed hiai 
On the fpot. 

Scarce was the Spaniard raifed from the 
ground before he feized a loaded nnufketj 
and went with Friday in purfuit of the fa- 
vages who had fled into the coppice. As 
diey were few in number, and for the mofi 
part wounded, Robinfon thought it btft to 
remain on the field of battle, and obftrv:e 
the motions of thofe who bad efcaped to 
their canoes. His two friends were not long 
before they joined him again, with the af- 
furance that there were no more of the enemy 
in the wood. 

They were both about to enter one of 
the canoes which the favages had left, and 
to purfue thofe who were rowing off to fea } 
but Robinfon flopped them. ** My friends," 
faid he, '^ it is enough j we have, perhaps, 
fhed more blood than v/e ought. Let us 
fuffer thofe to live who have no longer the 
intention or the power to hurt us.** 

" But if we fuffer them to efcape,** re-

plied Friday, " they will, perhaps, return 
and attack us in greater numbers." 

** Well," anfweredRobinronjClappinghim 
on the fhoulder in a friendly manner, and 
pointing to the Spaniard, '* is not our army 
alfo ftronger now by one- third than it was 
in the morning? Thus reinforced, we fhall be 
able at any time to cope with an army of 
thefe miferable enemies, efpecially if we 
Hay for them behind our entrenchments.'* 

Harriet, That was .well done of Robin- 
fon, to fpare the remainder of the favages. 

Mr, Bill. It was certainly a6ling with 
prudence and humanity. It would have 
been too cruel to kill, without necelTity, a 
fingle one of thefe unfortunate wretches, 
who had not the lead fufpicion that there was 
any harm in what they were doing, and who, 
on the contrary, embraced, as the cleared 
truth, that deplorable error, which taught 
them that to kill and eat a great number of 
their enennies was a very meritorious a6tion, 

Edw. Yet, I think, they ought to have 
knOFn that it was not right to do fo. 

Mr.. 



RO&INSON CRUSOE. 93 

Mr, BilL My dear friend, how could 
they have known it ? 

Edw, Hey-day ! Why any little child 
knows that it is not right to kill a man= and 
then eat him. 

Mr, BilL Bat how does the litrle child 
know this ? Is it not by being early fo in- 
flruded ? 

Edw. Yes, certainly. 

Mr, BilL And if he had never been in- 
ftrucfted on thdefubjedt -, if his father, his mo- 
ther, and all thofe whom he ought to love 
and refpedt, had always told him that it is 
a very laudable adtion to kill one's enemy, 
and eat his body I 

Edw, Nay, why — to be fure — then- 

Mr, Bill, Why, then, a child would ne- 
ver fufpedl the contrary. He would rather 
partake, as foon as he was of age, in the 
killing and the feafting. This was the c^e 
with thofe poor lavages. Let us thank God 
that we were not born amongfl them,, bwt 
had civilized parents,who early inflrufted us 
E 4 in

in the difference between good and cvll^ 
juflice and injuflice. 

Our hero, the friend of human kind5fhed 
tears of GompafTion when he traverfed the 
field of battle to alTift thofe who were ftill 
alive. It was all over with the greateft part 
of them, and the reft expired in his arms 
while he poured wine upon their wounds^ 
and endeavoured to recover them. The 
favages loft one and twenty men, and the 
vidorious army, far from having loft any„ 
had only one wounded; the Spaniard, 
when he was thrown down, had received a 
fevere bruife. 

Harriet, But how came this Spaniard 
amongft the favages, papa ? 

Mr, Bilh That is more than Robinfon 
himfelf has yet had time to be informed of; 
therefore, let us reftrain our curiofity until 
to-morrow. 

I'be Children, Oh ! then, we muft flop

JJARRIET. Well, papa, now for the 
Spaniard ; what brought him amongll 
the favages ? 

Mr, Bill, Have a little patience, and )xiu 
fliall hear. Some incidents happened in the 
mean time which I muft firfl relate to you. 

Rich, Indeed! well, that roufes my cu- 
riofity. 

Mr. Bill, Robinfon, having a mind to ex- 
amine one of the two canoes which the favages 
had kft behind them^ went towards it, and, to 
his great aftonifhment, he found in it ano- 
ther unfortunate creature, tied hand and foot 
as the Spaniard had been, and locking more 
dead than alive, 

Robinfon made hafte to cut his cords, and 

would have lifted him up, but he was not 

able either to Hand or fpeak. He lay groan- 

E S ing. 



96 THE NEW 

ing, no doubt, under the apprehenfion that 
they were going to put him to death. 

As he was an Indian, not an European, 
Robinfon called Friday, who was then bufy in 
burying the dead bodies, to fpeak to him in 
his native tongue. Scarce had he call eyes 
®n the prifoner before Robinfon and the 
Spaniard faw a fcene take place which drew 
from them tears of benevolent, fympathy.v 
Friday, all of a fudden, like a man befide 
himfelfj flies to the prifoner, embraces him>. 
locks him in his arms, cries^. laughs, jumps,,, 
dances, roars,, clafps his hands, ftrikes himfelf 
en the face and bread, cries out again, and^ 
in Ihort^. aits, like one that is delirious. It 
was fome tkne before Robinfon, who quef- 
lioned and urged him repeatedly, could draw 
from him this Ihort anfwer,," It is my h^ 
ther 1" 

It would be difficult to defcribe all the 
marks of filial love and affedion which thia 
excellent young man fhewed upon this oc- 
cafion. Twenty times he jumped out of the 
canoe upon land; and from the land into 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 
the canoe again; Some times, fitting down, 
he opened his jacket, and preffed his father's 
head to his bofom to warm it ; at o- 
thers, he rubbed the joints of his arms and 
legs, which were numbed by having been fo 
lightly bound ; and now he embraced him 
again, and covered him with kifles. Ro- 
binfon, who had ft ill fome wine in his bot- 
tle, gave it to him to wafli his father^s limbs, 
which were grievoufly fwelled. He then 
ftepped afide to let Friday indulge his joy 
with more freedom. 

Returning after fome time, he aiked him 
if he had made his father take any nourifh- 
ment. " The glutton," anfwered he, point- 
ing to himfelf, ** had before eaten up all/' Ro- 
binfon gave him his breakfaft, which he had 
not touched, and Friday gave it to his father. 
Scarce had he received it when his fon ftarted 
out of the canoe in a hurry, and went off fo 
quick, that before Robinfon had time to fay 
Where are you going, Friday was already out 
of fight. 

He foon appeared again, but did not come 

back

>ack,with quite fuch expedition. - When he 
was pretty near, they could fee that he had 
a pitcher of water in one hand, and foaie 
vidluals in the other. He gave • the water 
to his father, and the victuals to his mafter 
in return for the breakfaft which he had 
received from him. The cold water afforded 
vifible refrefhment to the old. man, who wias 
ready to faint with thiril. 

Robinfon then turned towards the Spa- 
niard, who, exhaufted with fatigue, was \y* 
ing flretched upon the grafs* He made Fr> 
day help him alfo.to fome refrefhment. The 
Spaniard, by his looks, endeavoured toexprefs 
his gratitude. He flrrove to rife, but- was not 
able, being prevented by the pain that h=e 
felt in the joints of his hands and feet, which 
were fwelled from having been bound fo 
very tightly. Friday was ordered to fit 
down belide him,, to bathe his arms and 
legs with wine, and to take the fame care of 
him as he had of his father. 

It was truly moving to behold thi3 afrec- 
tionate fon^. who^ while he attended, the

Spaniard, turned his head every momens 
towards his father to fee how he was. At 
one time, when the old man,, in order to 
repofe himfelf, lay down at full length, Fri- 
day, quite uneafy, flew to him without 
i^eaking a word j but when, he faw that 
his father had only lain down to be mors 
at his eafe, he returned in a moment, and 
continued his attention to the Spaniard. 
Robinfon now had a mind to try whether 
he could not, with Friday *s afliftance, con'i- 
vey the Spaniard to the canoe; but Friday, 
who was young and flrong, took that tafk 
upon himfelf alone, and carried him with 
eafe upon his fhoulders. When they had 
placed in the other canoe, not only the 
cannon and the muflcets, but alfo all the 
arms of the conquered Indians, Frid:,)? 
quickly entered the firft, and, though the 
wind began to frefnen, and was, rather a^ 
gainll him, yet he made fuch fpeed, by 
dint of rowing, that Robinfon, v/ho ran oa 
foot along the fea-fide, could by no means 
equal the fvaftr*efs of the canoe. He waa 

fcarce. 



loo THE N E W 

fcarce half way home when he faw Friday 
returning, who pafled by him in his way to* 
fetch the other canoe ; and before Robinfon 
could get up to the firfl:, where the Spa-^ 
niard and Friday^s father were, Friday was 
there with the fecond : with fuch remarkable 
fwiftncfs did he row. 

They were now oppofite their dwelling- 
place. Robinfon haftened thither for feme 
planks and poles, which he put together in 
the form of a litter or bier, to convey the 
difabled men to his habitation with more 
cafe. He and Friday carried them up, one 
after the other. What a treafure was here 
for Robinfon, who longed for nothing Co' 
much as the happinefs of enlarging hia 
company ! His heart beat with joy when • 
he refleded, that, for the future, he need- 
not apprehend being forced to lead a- life 
of foiitude again. His fatisfa6lion was- 
complete. As the two invalids feemed to 
have occafion for nothing fo much as reft, . 
Robinfon prefently warmed fome wine to 
bathe their bruifed limbs, while Friday made 



them 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. IDS 

them up a bed, on which, when ready, they 
delayed not to repofe thcmfelves. 

The two hofts then prepared a good 
fupper. Friday was ordered to go to the 
park, and bring home a young lama ; 
Robinfon undertook all the reft. He 
could not help fmiling frequently at the 
thought that he fhauld now refemble a 
king flill more than ever. The whole 
ifland was under his dominion ; all his fub- 
jeds were indebted to him for their lives^ 
acknowledged his will as their fnpremer 
law, and were bound to expofe themfelves 
in his caufe to the greateft dangers if ne- 
ceflary. One circumftance was remark- 
able, that he counted in his dominions as 
many different feds of religion as he had 
fubjects. Friday had adopted his mafter's- 
religion,, which was the Proteflant ; the Spa- 
niard was a Roman Catholic, and Friday's 
father was an idolater. 

" What is to be done in this matter ?" 
feid RdDinfon to himfelf : *' have I not a 
right to oblige them all to embrace the be- 
lief 



X02 THE N F V/ 

lief which I think beft I" He was fome 
time refleding on this fubje6t, becaufe it 
was one that had never engaged his thoughts 
before. 

What anfwer think ye^ mj dear children, 
fhould found reafon have given to this quef- 
tion ? Ought he to force his fubjedls to re- 
ceive his particular religion, or ought he 
not? 

^be Children, He fhould not conftrain 
them in any refped. 
Mr.BilL Why not? 
Rich, Becaufe a man's belief, or way of 
thinking, is independent of all the world, 
provided he behaves himfelf inoifenlively in 
other rclpedls. 

Mr, BilL But if a. mafter fees clearly 
that his fubjedl is in an error, may he not 
lawfully force him to renounce it ? 

Rich, What would be the confequence ? 
When a man is forced to^ believe, he be- 
comes neither the honefter nor the wifer 
for it. ' 

Mr» Rill That is true, for violence can 

never 



ROBTNSON CRUSOE. IO3 

never convince him that he was in an error 
before j and of what ufe can profefling be, 
when it does not proceed from convi6lion. 
Befides, how is a man certain that he whom 
he would force to embrace his belief, is 
really in an error ? May he not be mifta- 
ken himfelf ? 

Henry, Certainly, that might be the cafe. 

Mr, Bill. How fo ? 

Henry. Becaufe every man is liable to be 
deceived. 

Mr. Bill. Confeqfuently, no man has a 
right to advance his opinions as inconteila- 
ble truths. 

In fine, my dear children, it belongs to 
God alone to be the infallible judge of our 
belief: he alone can decide on the truth 
or falfehood of our opinions : none but he 
can know perfectly whether our fearch af- 
ter the truth has been carneft and fincere, or 
flight and negligent ; nor is there any but he 
who can judge how far our errors are to be 
imputed to us. 

Robinfon faw this matter nearly in die 

fame 



r04 THE N E W 

fame light. "Far from me/' faid he, " be 
the indifcreet zeal which endeavours to 
force men into>its belief! Far from me be 
the blind frenzy of perfeeuting and torturing,, 
fellow- creatures, merely becarufe they have 
the misfortune to be deceived, or the virtue 
to refufe profefling publicly that of whicb 
they are not convinced inwardly. In my 
ifland, at lead,, fuch injuftice fnall never' 
find a place. I will do every thing in my 
power to enlighten my new fubjects -, but 
if I am not happy enough to convince them< 
of their errors^ or of the truth of my reli*- 
gion, then I fhall leave them to believe 
what they can believe^, and to give an ac- 
count of their faith, not to me, who am- 
their equal, and liable to error, but to God- 
alone, the unerring judge of all.**" 

He, therefore, refolved, that all, without 
di{lin6lion,fhould enjoy the free exercife of 
their religion, if it fhould fo happen, that,- 
notwithdanding previous inftru6lion, they 
could not agree amongft themfelves upon^ 
one fingle form of rdigious^ worfhip. 

Friday 



"R O S I N S O N C R U S O Eo IGJ 

iFriday being now returned, they forth- 
with proceeded to get ready the fupper, 
*^ Let us celebrate this day/' faid Robinfon^ 
" as a double feftival : on the one hand, 
we have refcucd two fellow-creatures from 
•the voracity of thofe monflers in human 
•^fhape ; on the other hand, you have found 
your father." 

Friday had no occafion to be exhorted to 
^rejoice ; indeed, his heart had never expe- 
rienced fuch joy before, and he fhewed k 
'Continually, by finging, jumping, and laugh* 
ing, all the while that he performed what h« 
•had to do with equal diligence and exad- 
ncfs. Chearfulnefs and gaiety, far from 
being a fault, is ever an amiable quality, 
w?hen, inftead of making us abfent and neg- 
flcdful, it chears us in our labours. 

The two guefts now awoke. Although 
they flill kk fome pain, yet they found 
themfelves <:onfiderably relieved, and able, 
<with the a0iflar\ce of Robinfon and Friday, 
to rife and fit at table. The old Indian 
feemed a§ much ftruck and allonifhed at 

-every 



IC6 THE NEW 

every thing that he beheld as his Ton had for- 
merly been on his firft feeing the efFeds of 
European induftry* 

Friday adted as interpreter in the conver* 
fation that his mafler had with the old man 
and the Spaniard. 

G^o. Did Friday underiland Spanifh ? 

Mr, BilL No; but the Spaniard, who 
had been fix months amongft the favages, 
could fpeak the language of Friday's coun- 
try tolerably well, fo that he could under- 
iland him. The following is the fubflance 
of his account : 

** Our ihip was bound to the Coaft of A- 
frica for flaves. We were returning from 
thence, having exchanged all our goods for 
gold du{l, elephants teeth, and negroes. 
We had taken a hundred ilaves on board, 
and were carrying them to Barbadoes to fell 
them : twenty of them died on account of 
our flowing them too clofe one upon another. 
A violent gale of wind, which lafled feveral 
jdays, drove us out of our courfe, and carried 
us towards the Coaft of Brafil. Our ihip 

fprung 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

fprung a leak, fo that we durft not truft our- 
felves out to Tea again, but coafted along the 
main land. Suddenly we were attacked by 
another gale from the Weft, tliat carried us 
off the coaft, and, in the night, we ftriick 
upon fome rocks not far from an iiland. 
We fired feveral guns, and made other fig- 
nals of diftrefs, being refolved not to quit the 
fhip until the laft extremity. We fet the 
blacks free, that they might aflift us in 
pumping, as the fhip leaked in more places 
than one; but the moment they faw themfelves 
at liberty, they, with one accord, feized our 
boats, being determined, by means of them, 
to fave their lives, and efcape from their maf- 
ters. 

What could we do ? It was impofTible 
for us to have recourfe to force ; we were but 
fifteen againft four fcore, and, befides, the 
greateft part of them were armed. On the 
other hand, how could we think of remain* 
ing on board a wreck without a fmgleboat? 
This would have been expofmg ourfelves 
to certain death. We remonftrated with 

them 



IbS THE N E W 

them, and even entreated them ; we endea- 
voured, by our fupplications, to prevail oa 
thofe, who had lately been our flaves, either 
to remain with us or take us with them. 
Here I cannot help Ipeaking in the higheft 
terms of the humanity and generofity of 
thefe blacks. Though they had received the 
moft rigorous treatment from us, yet they 
were moved with companion, and fuffered 
us to get into the boats, on condition that wc 
gave up our arms. We jumped in, there* 
fore, difarmed, and the boats were fo over- 
loaded that we expeded to fmk every mo* 
mcnt. 

However, we did every thing in our 
power to reach the ifland, but fuddenly the 
wind changed, and carried us out to fea in 
fpitc of the laborious exertions of the row-* 
crs. . Our deftruction now appeared no 
longer a matter of doubt: neverthelels, 
the boats, though overloaded and toil about 
by the mod violent waves, ftill had the good 
fortune to live -, and, contrary to all expec- 
tation, without loling a fangle man, we were 

carried 



ROBINSON CRirsOE. 109 

carried to an ifland perfedly unknown to 
us, where the inhabitants, fimple and hu-» 
mane, received us with the moil hofpitable 
benevolence. 

We have lived with them ever fince, in 
the beft manner we could, but ftill vtry 
indifferently. Thefe poor favages have no- 
thing themfelves to fubfift on but fifhing, 
and a few fruits which the ifland produces 
fpontaneoufly. They ihared their little flock 
of provifions with us chearfully, and (hewed 
us their manner of fifhing, that we might 
ourfelvcs provide a part of our fubfiflence. 
The negroes were not fo ill off as we, both 
becaufe they were accuflomed nearly to the 
fame way of living, and alfo becaufe they 
had recovered their freedom.. 

Some days ago, this ifland was in- 
vaded by a nation of neighbouring In- 
dians. Every one took up arms, and we 
Ihould have thought ourfelves'' wanting in 
the mofl elTential duty of fociety if we had 
not aflifled people from whom we had re- 

VoL. IV. F ceivcd 



no T H E N E W 

ceived fuch friendly entertainment. I fought 
by the fide of this brave old man, who, 
like an enraged lion, threw himfelf into the 
hotted of the connbat. I faw him fur- 
rounded, and would have refcued him, but 
bad the misfortune to be made prifoner 
along with him. 

In this dreadful captiv.ity we pafTed two 
days and two nights, bound hand and foot, 
without receiving any nourilliment. They 
now and then threw "us pieces of {linking 
fifh, fuch as the fea left dead on the beach ; 
and thefe they caft to ys.with as much dif- 
dain as if we had been the vilefl of animals. 

This morning, at break of day, we were 
dragged to the canoes in order to be con- 
veyed to the place where thefe barbarians 
were accuftomed to devour therr vidimus. 
Providence brought you to our affillance ; 
generous men ! you delivered us 3 fo that we 
have received-' more at your hands than ever 
we ihall be able to repay you.'' 

Here the Spaniard was filentj being pe- 
netrated 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, III 

nctrated with gratitude, he Ihed abundance 
of tears. Robinfon, for his part, was de- 
lighted to find that his former conjedures 
were amply confirmed, and Friday joined 
him in admiring the wifdom and goodnefs 
of Providence. 

The Spaniard, on being afked who owned 
the (hip's cargo, anfwered, that the vefTei 
had been fitted out by two merchants of 
Cadiz ; that one of them had given an or- 
der for the purchafe of Haves, but the other, 
■detefting this traffic, defired to have gold- 
duft in return for his goods. , 

Upon this, RoSinfon took the Spaniard 
hy the hand, led him to his cellar, then to 
the ftorehoufe, and fhewed him the moil 
valuable effeds of the wreck fafely flowed 
in both places. Friday took upon him 
to recite the particulars concerning them, 
.and the Spaniard was fo flr^ck with aflo- 
niihment that he could Icarce utter a v/ord. 
• ' Robinfcn enquired alfo in refpedl to the 
owner of the diamonds and the ofHcer's 
drefs. He was told that they were both part 
F 2 of 



112 THE NEW 

of the effeds of an Englilh ofEcer^ who, hav- 
ing refided many years in the E aft Indies, 
was returning to England, but, falling Tick 
on his way home, lie defired to be fet afhore 
en the coall: of Africa, where he died, and 
his effecfLS were put on board the Spanifh 
fhip to be conveyed to Barbadoes, whence 
they were afterwards to be fent to England. 

Robinfon fhewed him alfo the papers 
that he had taken out of the fhipj by means 
of which the Spaniard learnt the name of the 
merchant to whom the gold-duft belonged, 
and alfo that of the officer's widow to whom 
the diamonds and cloaths fliould be reftored. 
From that mom.enc Robinfon looked upon 
the gold-duft, the diamonds, and the pa- 
pers, as a facred depofit entrufted to his 
care. 

Night approaching, all parties found 
themfelves fo exhaufted by the fauigues and 
dangers of the day, that each one had 
occafion to retire earlier than ufual to fetk 
refreftiment in flecp. They did, there- 
fore, what we ihall alfo do as foon as

we have returned thanks to God for having 
this day permitted us to enjoy uninterrupted 
happinqfs and tranquillity. 



TWENTy-NINTH EVENING. 

Kf^' -B/ZL. The next morning Robin- 
fon aflembled all the ftrength of his 
empire, in order to perform an office which 
'required this jun<5lion^ and which could not 
be put off. There was reafon to fear that 
the ftench of the dead bodies of the Indians 
fiain the day before might have a dange- 
rous efFcct upon the air : they provided 
themfelves, therefore, each with a hatchet, 
and repaired to this fcene of horror. 

Henry, With hatchets ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes ; not to dig graves : if 

that had been the defign, they v/ould have 

provided themfelves with fhovels, fpades, 

F 3 and 



214 T H E N E W 

and pickaxes; but they intended to cut down 
wood, and make a pile to burn all the bo- 
dies to afhes. 

Rich, That was the cuftom of the Ro- 
mans. 

Mr, Bill. And many other nations be- 
fides. Robinfon did not chufe to imitate 
the imprudence of his countrymen, who, at 
that time, buried their dead in the midft of 
towns, and even within their churches, where 
confequently the living mufl breathe an air 
infeded by the diforders of the dead. 

Harriet, Hey ! why they do fo ftiil, pa- 
pa. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, unfortunately, they do fo. 
Let this example make you fenfible how 
difficult it is for men to abolifh ancient cuf- 
toms, though univerfally acknowledged to 
be pernicious : wherefore, I advife you, by 
early application, to acquire wifdom and 
virtue. If once we adopt error and vice, if

Every body knows in this age that the 
flench of dead bodies is poifon to the living; 
and yet nobody fcruples to depofit thenn in 
feurying-grounds in the midil of cities, or 
even in the vaults of churches, where they 
are not fo much as covered with earth. 
Another century and more will ejapfe before 
people will think ferioufly of abolifliing Co 
pernicious a cuftom.

I fhould fettle that matter. 

Mr, Bill, Tliis, my dear, is one of the 
principal motives that fhould induce you 
to acquire all the good qualities and all the 
merit pofTible : then, diftinguifned by your 
countrymen, they will honour you with their 
confidence, and confer on you dignities which 
will authorize you to reform dangerous a- 
bufes, and to introduce wholefome cuftoms. 
Heaven feems to intend each of you to be

trufted with the power of promoting your 
country's happinefs. Every thing that is

truft the goodnefs of Providence has be- 
llowed upon you. You are born of en- 
lightened and virtuous parents,who enjoy the 
confidence and love of their country; you 
are endowed with the happieft qualifications 
of body and mind, which have never yet 
been fpoiled ; and, I may venture to affirm, 
that you are receiving an education which 
few men have the happinefs to receive. It 
would be a difgrace to any of you to fruf- 
trate the good intentions of Providence, 
which has done every thing to enable you

pable of the greateft things. Your beha-

tation, and, if poflible, prevail upon your 
countrymen to bury the dead in places 
where the flench of their bodies may not

Edw. Have patience ! Let me try what 
I can do. When I go to town, I will fpeak 
of it to my grandpapa and my uncles^ they 
will take care to manage it. 

Mr. Bill. Do, my dear. Robinfon 

and his com.panions, having burned the 
dead bodies, returned to the dwelling-place. 
In the mean time, Friday informed his fa- 
ther of the horror wherewith civilized na- 
tions look upon the eating of human flefh j 
Vv^hich appeared very flrange to the old 
man. But Friday, having repeated to 
him all that he had himfelf learned from 
his mafter on the fubje6l, gave him at length 
a dilguft to the barbarous cuftom. As the 
fon was called Friday, Robinfon gave the 
father the name of T'hurfday, and thus we 
iball call him for the future. 

Robinfon fummoned them all to council, 
F 5 where 



Il8 THEN© W 

\v!iere Friday ftill ferved as interpreter, and 
his mafler, as chief, opened the affembly 
"with the following fhort fpeech : 

" My dear friends, all who are prefent 
fee themfelves now in polTeflion of what- 
ever can contribute to render their lives 
peaceable and conannodious : neverthelefs, I 
ftd, that, in the enjoyment of thefe good 
things, my heart will never find fatisfadlion 
while I know that there are perfons who 
have a greater right to- them than I have^ 
and yet languifh in the want of them. I 
fpeak of your countrymen, my dear friend, 
my dear European ; I fpeak of the Spaniards 
who are now amongft the favages. I wilh 
that each of you would communicate to me 
his advice and opinion concerning the pro- 
pereft means for bringing thofe unfortunate 
people hither, and making them Ihare the- 
fame lot with us.'^ 

After he had finilhed, each gave his opi- 
fiion in his turn. The Spaniard firft offered 
to go for them, all alone, in one of the ca^ 
feocs that they had taken from the Indians. 

Thurf^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 
Thurfday declared that he v/as ready to 
undertake the fame expedition. Friday was 
of opinion, that his father, on account of 
his age, fhould remain on the ifland, and 
that he himfelf, who was fitter for the en- 
terprize, fiiould accompany the Spaniard. 
A generous contefl: arofe between the father 
and fon, which of them fhould expofe his 
life ; and Robinfon was obliged to interpofe^ 
and terminate it by adecifion to which they 
fubmitted without murmuring. He pro- 
nounced, that Thurfday and the Spaniard 
fhould make the proje6ted attempt^ and 
that Friday fhould remain with him. 

Charlotte. But why did not he fend Fri- 
.day, papa, rather than the poor old man ? 

Mr. Bill, His affeftionate friendfhip for' 
Friday v;ould not permit him to expofe 
him to a danger which he himfelf did not 
Ihare with him. Befides, the Father knev^ 
the fea, and cbuld navigate it, better 
than the fon. As to the Spaniard, there 
"Was a neccfSty that he (hould gO;, becaufe3.

if he did not, his countrymen would, per- 
haps, not accept Robinfon's invitation. 

It was, therefore, agreed, that they fhould 
fet fail together as foon as they all four had 
finifhed ploughing and lowing a field at 
ieaft ten tinnes larger than that which they 
cultivated before, bccaufe the encrcafe of 
the colony would neceffarily occafion a 
greater confumption of food. 

Each of them, therefore, turned plough- 
man for fome weeks, and as they all la- 
boured with a good will, the work was both 
very well and very fpeedily performed. At 
the end of a fortnight they were ready to 
prepare for the voyage. 

Before their departure, the Spaniard gave 
a proof not only of his honefly and grati- 
tude towards Robinfon, but alfo of his pru- 
dence and circumfpection. He reprefented, 
that the other Spaniards were, like him- 
felf, no more than common failors, and, con- 
fequently, people without education; that he 
did not know them fufFiciently to anfwer for 

their 



R03INS0N CRUSOE. 121 
their behaviour j and that, therefore, he was 
of opinion, that Robinfon, as mailer of the 
ifland, fhould draw out an agreement, ex- 
prefTing the conditions upon which they 
fhould be received, and that none fhould be 
admitted without previoufly accepting his 
terms. 

Robinfon, delighted with this proof of 
his new fubjedl's fidelity, immediately pur- 
fued his advice. The agreement which 
he drew up in conlequence of it, was 
worded as follows : 

*^ All perfons who are defirous of red- 
ding in Robinfon Crufoe's ifland, and of 
enjoying there the conveniencies of life 
which they are invited to ihare, mufl con- 
fent, 

«' In the firft place, to conform in every 
thing to the will of the lawful mafter of 
the ifland, and to fubmit chearfully to 
whatfoever laws and regulations the faid 
mafler fhall judge necelTary for the good of 
the territory. 

^/ Secondly, 



122 THE NEW 

'^ Secondly, to be adive, fober, and vir- 
tuous; for no idle, drunken, vicious per- 
fon will be tolerated in this iiland. 

*^ Thirdly, to abftain from all quarrels, 
and, in cafe of receiving offence, by no 
means to become judges in their own caufe, 
but to carry their complaints before the 
mafter of the ifland, or the perfon to whom 
lie Ihall delegate the office of judge. 

*^ Fourthly, to join^ without murmuring, 
in all the labours which the good of the 
community ihall require, and, in^ cafe of 
neceffity, to aiTift the mafter of the ifland 
at the hazard of their lives. 

''Fifthly, iiiould any perfon prefume to 
oppofe any one of thefe juft laws^ all the 
other members of the community ihall be 
bound to unite againft him, either to oblige 
him to return to his duty, or to baniih him

It was fettled that the Spaniard fiiould 
tranflate thrs agreement into his native lan- 
guage, and take pen and ink with him, that 
his countrymen might fign it before they 
embarked. 

They next chofe the befi of the canoes^ 
and prepared for their departure. 

Geo, But was there room in one canoe 
for all the Spaniards ? 

Mr. Bill. No : they only wanted this ca- 
noe to fail to the other ifland : for their re- 
turn they could ufe the boats belonging to 
the Spanifh Ihip^ which, as the Spaniard de* 
Glared, were fbiil in very good ccmdition.. 

When their provifions v/ere laid in, the 
wind being favourable, the two deputies fet 
fail, after taking a t^riendly leave of Robin- 
fon and Friday. The latter was fo affedted 
at the reparation, that even the day before

hours together, and took from him all de- 
fire of nourifhment. At the moment of 
his father's departure he became incanfola- 
bie. Every now and then he embraced 
him, and bedewed him with his tears. It 
was not without fome difficulty that the old 
man could efcape from him to enter 
the canoe, and, even after they had pufhed 
off from fhore, Friday threw himfelf into 
the fea, and fwam to the fide of the boat, to 
fhake hands with his father once more, and 
give him his laft farewell, which was almofl 
llifled with fobs. On his return afhore he 
fat down upon a rifmg ground, where he re- 
mained fighing and fhedding tears with his 
eyes fixed upon the canoe, which fcudded 
before the wind until he had entirely loil 
fight of it. 

Robinfon, to amufe him, Ipent the reft 
of the day with him in iiiooting game, and 
traverfing the hills. They had not gone 
very far, when the fpaniel, that accompa- 
nied them, flopped at the foot of a rock all 
overgrown with buflies, and fell a barking. 

They 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12^ 

They went up to him, and obferved a hole 
in the rock, which a man could not enter 
v^ithout creeping. 

Robinfon, who loved minutely to examine 
every thing that drew his attention, defired 
Friday to try if he could get into the hole, 
who, in making the trial, had fcarce put his 
head withinfide, before he drew it out again 
in a hurry, uttered a dreadful roar, and ran 
away with the greateft terror and precipita- 
tion, never once liftening to Robinfon's 
voice, who called him back repeatedly. At 
length, overtaking him^ Robinfon afked, 
with much furprife, why he had run away. 
" Ah !'* replied he, fcarce able to fpeak, 
^* ah ! my dear mafter, let us run, let us 
fave ourfelves Vv^ith the utmoft fpeed. In 
that cave is a moft terrible monfler; his 
eyes are like burning fire, and his throat fo 
wide that he could fvvallow us both at 
once." 

" A monftrous throat indeed !" faid Ro- 
binfon : " I Ihould be curious to fee it." 

''- Ah 1" 



126 THE K E W 

" Ah r* cried Friday, falling on his 
knees, " for Heaven'^s fake do no fuch thing* 
The monfler would infallibly devour you, 
and then poor Friday would have no mafler.'^ 
" Has it devoured you ?'* faid Robinfon, 
fniiJing. Here Friday hefitated to anfwer. 
His mailer, therefore, defired him to haften 
to the dwelling-place, and fetch a lantern. 
In the mean time, he went back to the 
rock, and flood fentinel before the hole, 
with his mulket in his hand. 

Robinfon faid to himfelf, *^ What could 
Friday have feen to terrify him fo ? Was it 
a wild beail? a lion ? a tiger? a panther? 
or any fuch animal ? In that cafe it would 
certainly be rafh of me to enter the hole. 
But if there were fuch animals in this ifland, 
1 fhould have feen fome of them long before 
now. Befides, if it had been one, Friday 
could not have efcaped its claws. No, no s 
it is no fuch thing. His fearfulnefs has

know what it is, were it only to cure this 
good young man of his childilh aptncfs to 
be frightened. 

Friday now arrives with the lantern 
lighted. He endeavoured once more, with 
tears in his eyes, to difluade his mafter from 
expofing himfelf to a danger which he faid 
was fo evident, and in which he would ine* 
vitably meet his ruin. Robinfon was a 
ftranger to fear ; when he had once deter- 
mined upon a ftep from mature reflection, 
he was afterwards immoveable: exhorting 
Friday, therefore, to take courage, he ad- 
vanced boldly towards the cavern, with a 
lantern in one hand, and a loaded piftol 
in the other. 

His head was fcarce withinfide of the hole, 
when, by the feeble light of the lantern, he 
perceived an objed which really made him 
Ihudderj neverthelefs, he did not run away. 
Holding his lantern farther in, the better to 
difcover this unknown monfter, he found 
it to be a lama that was dying of old- 
age, looking round, and perceiving no 

other 



128 THE NEW 

Other animal but this harmlcfs lama, he 
crept entirely into the cavern, and bid Fri- 
day follow him. 

The poor fellow was all of a tremble, 
yet he could not think of abandoning his 
mafter ; he, therefore, made a noble effort 
to overcome his fear, and, in ihort, had the 
courage to creep into the hole after him, 
%vhere he faw with aftonifhment how much 
his fright had deceived him with regard to 
the great fiery eyes and huge throat of the 
animal. 

As he entered, Robinfon faid to him^^ 
fmiling, " Well, Friday, you fee what fear 
can make us bel^'-^ve. Now, where are the 
great blazing eyes? Where is that prodigious 
throat that you faw^" 

Frid, And yet I really thought I faw 
them 5 nay, I could have fworn it. 

Rob, That you thought fo I have not 
the leaft <3oubt i but you ought to have 
known how deceitful fear is, and that its de- 
lufions make us feem to fee a thoufand things 
which never exiiled. Believe me, Friday,

it is the foundation of all ftories concerning 
ghofts, and I know not what idle fancies 
of the fame fort. The firll tellers of thf fc 
abfurd tales were fearful old women, or 
cowardly men of the fame flamp. They 
imagined, like you, that they faw fome- 
thing which they did not fee; and, 
like you too, juft now, they would have 
fworn that they faw what they did not fee. 
Be a man, Friday; for the future always 
look twice; and banifh from your bread 
this fearfulnefs, which would be fcarce ex- 
cufable in a girl. Friday promifed to do 
his befl. 

While they were talking, the old lama 
expired. Robinfon and Friday dragged ft 
out of the hole, in order to bury it. They 
next more attentively examined the fpoc 
where they were, and found it to be a 
very fpacious and agreeable cave, which 
they might in future turn to advanta- 
geous ufes. It appeared as if hewn out 
by defign: it was cool without the leall 
dampnefsi and the walls, which feemed to

fides with as much fplendour as if it had

Robinfon refolved to convert it into an 
agreeable retreat, where he might enjoy a 
refrelhing coolnefs during the hotter pare 
of the day, and alfo lodge any of his pro- 
vifions that were liable to be fpoiled by the 
heat. Luckily it was no more than a fhort 
mile from the dwelling-place, whither Fri- 
day prefently repaired, and brought back 
tools, with which they both fell to work 
to enlarge the entrance. They intended to 
make a door, and this talk employed them 
agreeably during the abfence of their two 
deputies.

twenty times a day to the top of the hillock 
or the fca-fide, and wearied his eyes to no 
purpofe in looking out for them. One 
-day when Robinfon was bufy at the dwelling- 
place, Friday cam^e towards him full fpeed, 
finging, jumpingj and bawling like a mad- 
inan, while he was ftill as far off as he 
eould fee his mailer, — " They are coming ! 
^ — they are coming !" 

Atthefe agreeable tidings Robinfon took 
his profpc'fl glafs, and haftened to the top 
•of the hillock. With his naked eye he 
.could perceive at a ditlance a boat making 
fail towards his ifiand ; hut when he put the 
proiped glafs to his eye, the joy that was 
in his countenaacje^difappeared., and he faid 
tp Friday, fihaking his head, " I doubt 
whether thofe are the people that we wiih

" My friend," faid he, '' they are neither the

boat, with Englilh failors in it." Friday 
began to trennble from head to foot. " FoU

to an eminence from whence they could 
better difcover the Northern coaft. Scarce 
had they reached it and looked out to fea, 
when they were ftruck motionlefs, and, as it 
were, petrified with aflonifhment. They 
perceived, at the diftance of about a couple 
of leagues, a large Englifh fhip lying at an- 
chor.

Mr, Bill, There are men to be found> who 
have been fo ill inflru6led in their earlcer 
years as not even to know that theft is a 
crime. Thefe wretches make no fcrupie 
of taking away other people's property, ci-

thought himfelf happy, had he fallen into 
the hands of pirates, been carried away 
a (lave, and thus reftored once nnore to 
the fociety of naen i but now that his fi- 
tuation was nnuch more agreeable, h^

prehenfions to Friday, and they retired in^ 
order to obferve, at a diftance. thofe who ■ 
were comiing in the boat, and endeavour to 
difcov^r their defign. 

Robinibn and Friday polled themfelves 
on a rifinor o-round that was covered with 

o o 

trees and underwood, from whence, with- 
out being perceived, they could have an 
eye upon whatever paiTed. They faw the 
boat, with eleven men in it, come to land at 
a part of the Ihore that was fmooth and 
fandy, and about a mile from the place where 
they were. The flrangers landed 3 eight of 
them were armed, and the other three tied 
neck and heels. Thefe they unbound as

in particular, they judged that he was foli- 
citing the compaflion of thofe who were 
armed : he fell at their feet in the pofture 
of a fuppliant. The other two now and 
then lifted up their hands to Heaven, as 
if to implore fuccour and deliverance. 

Robinfon, fiiocked and grieved at this 
fight, knew not v^hat to refolve on : mean- 
time, Friday approached him with an air of 
triumph, and whifpered, " Well, I find, 
mafter, your countrymen eat their prifoners 
too." " Plhaw !" faid Robinfon, a little out 
of humour, " they will do no fuch thing :" 
and he continued to obferve them with his 
profped glafs. 

It was not without lliuddering that he 
faw fome of thofe who were armed lift up 
their hangers feveral times over the head of

All three fat down with forrowful and 
defponding hearts on the fpot where the reflb

This fight reminded Robinfon of his own 
deplorable fituation the day he was call afhore 
upon the ifland, and it infpired him with the 
refolution of rifking every thing for the pre- 
fervation of thefe unfortunate people, if they 
fhould prove deferving of it. Having thus

three priforvers. The firft failor that they 
came up to lay with his face to the ground> ' 
and flept fo foiindly that they feized him by 
the hands and feet, and crammed a hand- 
kerchief into his mouth,, before he was well 
awake. They tied his hands behind his 
back, and commanded him to remain oa 
the fpot without llirring an inch, or making 
the leaft noife, on pain of being put to 
death that moment.. They made him 
turn his head towards the fea, that he might 
not obferve what was paffing amongfl his 
comrades. 

The fecond met with the fame treatment^; 
he was tied hand and foot, turned, and 
threatened in the fame manner. Fortune,, 
or, more properly fpeaking, Providence ap- 
peared on this occafion the protedlor of in- 
nocence and avenger of villainy. Six of 
them were now tied, but the tw£) laft 
awoke, ftarted up, and took their arms,

They threw down their arms^, and, iit 
their turn, fell upon their knees to entreat 
their captain's, pardon. Their hands being- 
tied in the fame manner atj thofe of the reft,, 
they were all condudled to the cavern which- 
had been lately difcovered, these to be con- 
fined. They were then informed that the 
guard who was to have tht care of them 
would fhoot the firft man through the head 
who Ihould attempt to come out at the- 
door. It was alfo thought expedient to take, 
their knives away. 

After diiS) Robinfon and Friday, with 
their new friends, went down to the boat :- 
they drew it up on the beach^ and bored- 
holes in its bottom to render, it for thevpre- 
fent unfit for ufe.

fore, to put it out of their power to taK^r 
back the firft. ^ 

What they expected happened accord-s- 
ingly. About 3 o^clock in the afternoon, . 
the Ihip fired a gun for thefailors who were- 
on fhore to return. This fignal not. being, 
obeyed, though thrice repeated, they faw 
another boat put off from the Ihip towards .- 
the iiland. Robinfon, with his companions, ,, 
retired to a rifmg ground, in order from . 
thence to obferve what meafures circum- 
ftances might require them to purfue. 

The boat having come to land, the men 
jumped out and ran to the firft, but were 
not a little furprifed to fee it drawn up a. 
good way on the beach, and with holes in' 
its bottom. They looked all round, and 
called their companions by their names, but 
nobody anfwered. They were ten in num-^ 
her, all well armed. 

Robinfon, being informed by the captain, 
that, amongit thofe whom they had made 
prifoners, there were three who from fear 
alone had joined in the mutiny, fent Fri- -

day and the mate for diem immediately. 
On their appearance, the captain, to whom 
Robinlbn had communicated his defign, 
after reproaching them a little for their be- 
haviour, afked them, whether, if he fhould 
pardon them, they would remain faithful to 
him for the future. " To the lad moment of 
our lives," they faid, trembling, and falling 
on their knees. ** Before this mutiny," 
continued the captain, ^^ I always took you 
for honeft men, and am willing to believe 
that you were forced to take a part in it. I 
hope, however, you vviil mjake amends for 
the pad by being fteady and faithful in 
future." The three failors, heartily re- 
penting of their folly, fhed tears of joy on 
being forgiven* The captain gave them back 
their arms, and defired them to yield a punc- 
tual obedience to their common chief. 

In the mean time, the people of the fe- 
cond boat were continually calling out, and 
now and then firing their guns, with the ex- 
pectation that their fcattered comrades 

would

would hear and join them. At lafl,, find«- 
ing all their refearches ufelefs, and the day 
now drawing to a clofe, they began to fear 
for themfelvesj they put ofF^ therefore, in- 
tending to lie at anchor about a hundred 
yards from the fhore. The captain and 
Robinfon were apprehenfive left they fhould 
go back to the Ihip, and the crew fhould 
take the refolution of fetting fail and going 
off with the velTel, and not wait longer to 
fearch for their ftrayed companions. This 
apprehenfion filled Robinfon and the refl 
with much anxiety. 

Luckily a thought ftruck him, from 
which they promifed themfelves great fuc^ 
cefs. He ordered Friday and one of the 
fallors to go behind the thickets, about a - 
mile from the boat, and anfwer the men 
whenever they called J then/ as foon as they 
perceived that the others heard them, they. 
were to go farther in by degrees am.ongft 
the underwood, in order to draw the failoris 
after them to as great a diftance as poffible 

from- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

from fhore ; and, having done this, Friday 
and the failor were to return as quick as they 
could by another way. 

This ilratagem fucceeded connpletely. 
No fooner did the failors in the boat hear 
a voice anfwer them, than they haftened to 
land again, and, taking their mulkets, ran 
towards that quarter from whence they 
heard the voice. Two were left to guard 
the boat. 

Friday and his companion performed 
their part admirably. They drew the failors 
after them amongft the thickets about three 
miles from the fhore, and then they haflen- 
ed back with all fpeed to join their com- 
manders. In the mean time, Robinfon 
had unfolded to the captain his whole plaa 
for mattering thefe people without blood- 
Ihed. 

Night now came on, and, it grew by do^ 
grees darker and darker. Robinfon and 
his companions advanced filently towards the 
boat, till within about twenty yards of ity 
Boperceived by the two failors who guarded

it; then they all (liewed thernfelves at once, 
and, with much noife and clattering of their 
arms, threatened the two men with inftant 
death if they dared to ftir a fcep. They 
begged for quarter, upon which Pvobin-- 
fon's party went up to them, and tied theirr- 
hands. This done, they made hafte to* 
draw up the boat to a confiderable diftance- 
from the water, led away their two prifo- 
ners, and concealed themfclves behind the- 
bufhes, to wait for the return of the other - 
faiiors. They came back ftraggiing one 
after another, and all. exceedingly fatigued' 
■with their unfuccefsful expedition. Their- 
aftoniihment and vexation at not findino; 
the boat is impoffible to be, expreiTed. As. 
foon as there were five of them together^ 
one of thofe who had been pardoned was 
fent to them to afk whether they chofe to 
lay down their arms and furrender that mo- 
ment without murmuring; adding, that,, 
in cafe of their refufal, the governor of the 
ifland had polled a detachment of fifty- ^ 
men not thirty yards off, whofe fire couldi

that the governor's people had already ta- 
ken their boats, and made all the reft of 
their companions prifoners ^ fo that there 
was no choice kit them. but either to furren- 
der or. die. . r,.,- ,..» ,\ r. 

At the fam.e time Robinfon and his com- 
pany made a clattering with their arms, 
to confirm the laiior's account of their num- 
ber. " Can we hope for pardoi: ?" faid one 
of them. The captain, who was unfeen, an- 
fwered, *^ Thomas Smith, you know my 
voice; lay down your anns inftantly, and 
you fhall all have your lives fpared, except 
Atkins." He, it feems, was the principal 
ringleader of the miUtiny. 

They ^aU immediately threw down their- 
arms. Atkins beggedform.ercy, entreated 
the captain's campafTion, and reprefented to 
him that he was not more guilty than the 
reft. The captain anfvvered him, that all 
he could do was to intercede for him with 
the governor, and he muft wait the ef- 
fect of that interceflTion, Then Friday and

the three failors were fent to tie their hands | 
and the other three mutineers returning at 
the fame time from their ramble among the 
thickets, they were informed of what had 
pafied, and, dropping all thoughts of re- 
finance, fubmitted to be tied with the reft. 

Upon this, Robinfon, as one of the go- 
vernor's officers, came forward to the pri- 
foners. The captain, who accompanied 
him, chofe out thofe whom he thought ca- 
pable of a fincere repentance : thefe were 
fent to be lodged near the entrance of the 
dwelling-place ; the others were put into the 
cavern* Amongft thofe who had been put 
there before, there were two whom the cap- 
tain thought to be equally difpofed to re- 
turn faithfully to their duty, and thefe were 
ordered to be brought to him. 

To-morrow evening, my dear children^

THIRTY-FIRST EVENING. 

Jl/T^' BILL, My dear children^ we now 
draw near the conclufion : Robinfon's 
lot will foon be decided : a few hours 
more and our friend will know whether he 
is fentenced to remain in his ifland without 
hopes of quitting it, or whether he fhall be 
able to gratify his moil earned wilh of again 
feeing his parents. 

This depends on the captain's fuccefs. 
Will he, or will he not, with the afTiftance 
of the failors who have returned to their du- 
ty, be able to make himfelf m.after of the fhip? 
If he can, all our friend's anxiety will be at an 
end ; if not, things will remain as they are, 
and he mud not think of leaving the ifland. 
Thofe whole lives had beenpromifed them, 
were lodged, as before mentioned, near the en- 
trance of the dwelling-place -, they were ten 
in number. Robinfon informed them, as 
from the governor, that, their offence being 

mutiny. 



1^0 THE NEW 

mutiny, they fliould not receive a full par- 
don, but on the condition of affifting 
their lawful commander to recover pof- 
fefiion of his Ihip. They all protefted 
that they would perform this condition 
with the greateft chearfulnefs and fidelity. 
Robin fon added, that, if they acquitted 
themfelves properly of this juft and reafon- 
able duty, they would not only exempt 
themfelves from all manner of punifhment, 
but alfo fave the lives of their comrades in 
prifon, who, if the fhip was not recovered 
that very night, were all to be hanged the 
next morning at break of day. 

This was alfo told to the prifoners : they 
were then left together for a while, that, in 
this interview, the criminals threatened 
^ith fpeedy death rn.ight confirm the others 
in their fidelity, which was the only pofli- 
ble means that could fave their hves. 

In the mean time, the Ihip's carpenter 
was ordered immediately to repair the boat 
that had been fcuttled -, and, as foon as this 
was done, they launched them both. It 
was agreed, that the captain ihouid com- 
mand

nnand one, and the mate the other, the 
:crew being equally divided between them* 
Every man was provided with arms and am- 
munition. Robinfon took the captain by 
'the hand, and wifhed him good fuccefs* 
The two boats now fet fail. 

Edw, I wonder that Robinfon did not go 
with them. 

Mr, Bill, It was not for want of cou- 
rage j but prudence did not permit him to 
go upon this expedition. The prifoners in 
his abfence might efcape, and make them- 
felves m.Ellers of his dwelling-place. This, 
being his only retreat in cafe of danger, and 
containing ail his refources, was of too 
much confequence to him that he lliould 
imprudently run the rifle of lofing it. The 
captain himfelf faw the propriety of this con- 
fideration, and was of opinion that Robinfon 
and Friday fhould flay and guard :heir lit- 
tle forrrefs. 

Robinfon, whofe defliny v/as now going 
to be decided, felt an anxiety and agitation 
of mind that did not fuffer him to reft. 
Sometimes he fat down in the cave, 

fome- 



1j52 the NEW' 

Ibmetimes he walked about upon the ter- 
race, and fomctimes he went up the ladder 
of ropes to the top of the hillock, to take 
advantage of the filence of the night, and 
liflen whether any thing was to be heard 
from that quarter where the Ihip lay. 
Though he had fcarce taken any nouriih- 
ment the whole day, he could not prevail 
upon himfelf to do it now* His anxiety 
was continually encreafing, becaufe he ex- 
pected the fignal that had been agreed up- 
on between them : three guns were to be 
the token of the captain's fuccefs, and it 
was already midnight. He at length re- 
fiedled, that he was wrong to fiudluate be- 
tween hope and fear, fo tremklingly alive to 
both ; and hefeafonably recolledled a max- 
im v/ith which he had, not long ago, en- 
deavoured to fortify his man Friday. 
** In a doubtful cafe," faid he, ^^ always 
exped the worft. If this worfl does not 
happen, fo much the better for you ; if it 
does, you are prepared for it, and have al- 
ready deilroyed half its power to hurt." 
Confequently, Robinfon coniidered as in- 
dubitable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

dubitable the ill fuccefs of the expedition. 
He mufiered up all his fortitude and re fig- 
nation to Providence, to enable him to fup- 
port this misfortune. He now gave up 
all hope — when, fuddenly, the deep and 
diflant found of a gun was heard. As if 
he had been roufed out of his fleep, he lif- 

tens a fecond report then a diird I 

There is no longer any room for doubt : 
the captain has recovered the fliip, and 
will very fpeedily fet fail for Europe. 

Intoxicated widi joy, he flies, he Hides 
down the ladder, throws his hands round 
Friday's neck, who lay afleep upon the 
grafTy (lope of the terrace i he prefies him 
to his bofom, and bedews him with his 
tears, unable to utter a fingle word. ^^ What 
is the matter, my dear mailer ?" faid Fri- 
day, opening his eyes, and terrified at all 
this hurry and fudden overflow of afTedion, 
" Ah! Friday !" was all the anfwer that 
Robinfon, in the fulnefs of his joy, could 
return. 

" Heaven have companion on my poor 
Vol. IV. H mailer's 



154 THE NEW 

mafter's head !" faid Friday to hlmfelf, 
imagining him to have loft his fenfes. 
*^ You muft go to bed, my dear mafter /' 
and at the fame time he was taking him by 
the arm to lead him to the cave. Robin- 
fon, in a tone of voice which exprefled his 
tranfport, cried, " Me ! me to bed ! Fri- 
day, at the very moment when Heaven is 
crowning the only wifti that my heart has 
cherifhed fo long ! Did you not hear the 
three guns ? Know you not that they are 
happily mafters of the fhip ?'' 

Friday, on being informed of this for- 
tunate event, rejoiced, it is true, but more 
on his mafter's account than his own. The 
thoughts of foon quitting his native cli- 
mate for ever, damped the fatisfaftion 
which he would otherwife have enjoyed in 
going with RobinfoH and his father to a 
country from whence fo many wonderful 
things had already been prefented to his 
view, and where he expedled to fee others 
ft ill more marvellous. 

Robinfon was never fo affeded with the 

tranfports 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 55 

tranfports of joy before. Sometimes he 
went up to the top of the hillock, threw 
himfelf on his face, lifted up his eyes to- 
wards the ftarry vault, and returned God 
thanks for having at length procured him 
the means of departing from this defert 
ifland ; prefently he would go down 
again, Ihake his dear Friday by the hand, 
talk of nothing but Plymouth and Exeter, 
and begin to pack up the goods. In this 
agitation he pafied the night without once 
thinking of repofe. 

At the flrft peep of dawn his eyes were 
turned towards that quarter where the fhip 
lay at anchor. He waited with impatience 
for the moment when broad day-light fhould 
give him a full view of the inllrument of 
his deliverance. The moment comes — 
Heaven ! is it poffible ? — Dreadful idea ! — 
He k^Sy without the fmalleft room for 
doubt — that the ihip is no longer there. 
He fhrieks, and falls down in a fwoon. 

Friday ran to him, but was a long time 

before he could comprehend what was the 

H 2 matter 



156 ^ T H E NEW 

matter with his mafler. At lengthy Ro- 
binfon, flretching his trembling hand to- 
wards the Tea, '^ Look there!" faid he, 
with a feeble and almofi" inarticulate voice. 
Friday no fooner turned his head that way 
than he difcovered the caufe of his mafler 's 
grief. 

I fee, my dear children, you know not 
wkich fentiment to indulge. You are di- 
vided between joy and compafiion. You 
hope that this incident, will prolong the 
ftory ; but our friend's melancholy fituation 
moderates and reflrains the livelinefs of 
your fatisfadlion. You all maintain a pro- 
found filence; I will take advantage of it, 
and go on. 

Robinfon Ihews us here, by his example, 
how careful even the befb men fhould be 
4iot to fuffer their pafTions to get the better 
of them. If he had not at firft indulged an 
immoderate joy, he would not afterwards 
have fallen into an exceflive degree of for- 
row, which entirely darkened his reafon; 
he would have been fenfible that he ought to 

fupport 



ROBINSON C R U S O E. 157 

fiipport the iliock with refignation, though 
it deftroyed his deareft hopes ; he would 
have refleded that Providence has means to 
refcue us fronn diftrefs, even when we think 
it impolTible. This refle6tion would hay^ 
contributed to reftore him to tranquilhty. 
Once more, my dear children, you fee how 
much remains to be amended even in per- 
fons the moft forward in the path of virtue. 
While Robinfon was defponding, and 
Friday endeavouring to comfort him, they 
fuddenly heard a noife at the back of the 
hillock as of feveral people walking. They 
rife in a hurry, and looking on that fide 
from whence the noife came, they were 
agreeably furprifcd to behold the captaia 
coming up the hillock, accompanied by 
fomc of his people. Robinfon fprung for- 
ward to take him by the hand, and happen- 
ing 10 turn himfelf that way he perceived 
the fhip at anchor in a creek on the Weilern 
fide of the ifiand. Judge whether his grief 
was banifhed in a moment. This light 
informed him at once that the captain had

changed his llation before the break of day, 
and moored the fhip in that fafe and com- 
modious harbour. 

Robinfon was fo overjoyed that he could 
not quit the captain, who on his fide was no 
lefs dehghted. They thanked and congra* 
tulated each other a thoufand times. The 
captain related the manner of his becoming 
mafter of the fhip without killing or wound- 
ing a fingle perfon. The night was fo dark 
that the mutineers neverfaw him, and fo made 
not the lead difficulty in receiving thofe on 
board who accompanied him. The m.oft 
refradory were going, it is true, to fland 
upon their defence, but their refiftance 
would have been vain ; they would imme- 
diately have been overpowered and laid in 
irons. When he had finifhed his recital, 
he indulged his feelings of gratitude to 
his deliverer. " It is you/' faid he, with 
tears in his eyes, " it is you, generous man! 
who by your compaffion and prudence 
have faved me and reftored m.y Ihip. It 
is now yours j you ihall difpofe both of that

ed the men to lay on the table fome refrefli- 
ments that he had brought from the ihip, 
and the whole company, with hearts full of 
joy, fat down to an excellent breakfaft. 

In the mean time, Robinfon related his 
ftrange adventures, which more than once 
excited the captain's higheft admiration. 
The latter entreated Robinfon to tell him 
tvhat he fhould do for him. *' Befides what 
I ftipulated yeflerday," anfwered he, " in 
return for the afTiftance that ! afforded you, 
I have three things more to defire of you. 
In the firft place, I requeil you to wait the

The captain, having aflured him that 
thefe articles fhoiild be pundually perform- 
ed, fent for the prifoners, picked out the 
mofl guilty, and told them their fentence, 
which they heard with a degree of fatis- 
fadlion^ very well knowing that by law they 
were liable to be put to death. Robinfon, 
ever full of humanity, gave them inftru6lions 
concerning the manner of procuring them- 
feives fubfiftence, and promifed to leave 
them what was his beft treafure in the ifland, 
namely his tools, his furniture, and his cat- 
tle. At the fame time he recommended 
to them, over and over, to put their trufl 
in Heaven, to agree together, and to be in^ 
duftrious, afluring them that the pradlicc of 
thefe virtues would not a litde contribute 
towards rendering their confinement in this 
ifiand agreeable. , 

He was ftill fpeaking, when Friday, out 
of breath, brought the pleafing news that 
his father was coming with the Spaniards, and 
that they were that moment landing. All 
the company prepared to go and meet them; 

Friday

: Friday flev/ to the/ea-fide^ and embraced 
his father again and again, before the reft 
came np. 

Robinfon faw with furprife, that, amongft 
thofe who came in the boats, there were two 
women. He queftioned Thurfday concern- 
ing them, who told him that they were na- 
tives whom the two Spaniards had married* 
As foon as thefe two Spaniards learned that 
Robinfon was going away, and intended tx) 
leave fome failors behind him upon the 
ifland, they requefted permiffion to remain 
there alfo with their wives, alledging, that, 
after the accounts which' they had heard gf 
this ifland, they could not defire a better 
eflablilhm.ent. .- . ? 

Robinfon, charmed at their requeft, moft

he refolved to give the Spaniards a degree 
of authority ov^r them. 

Thofe who were to be left on the ifland 
were fix Englifhnnen, and two Spaniards 
with their wives. Robinfon called the whole 
together, and declared his will to them in 
the following words : 

^' I hope none of you will difpute my 
right to do as I pleafe with the property of 
this ifland and all that belongs to it. I 
wifh equal happinefs to all of you who re- 
main here after me. To fecure it, there 
mii-ft be a certain order and fubordination 
amongft you, which it belongs only to me 
to prefcribe. I declare, therefore, that I ap- 
point the two Spaniards as fubftitutes in my 
place, and that they Jhall for the future be 
the lawful mafters of the ifland. You fhall 
all pay them the ilri(51:efl; obedience; they 
alone fhall have poiTeflion of the little fort 
and live there ; they alone fhall have under 
their care ail the arms, ammunition, and 
tools, but which they will lend you, when- 
^'Cver you have occafion for them, provided

you Ihall unite for the common defence.. 
Your labours both in the garden and the- 
field fhall be performed in common, and 
every crop be equally divided amongft you 
all. Perhaps one day or other I may have- 
an opportunity of hearing from you. Per- 
haps I may even refolve to come and finifh.

They all agreed to thefe regulations^.and^ 
promifed the moil perfed obedience. 

Roblnfon then took an inventory of the 
few goods that he ihtended to carry away with 
him;, and v*'hich were to be immediately put 
on board the fnip. They were^. lil. the

"and, laflly, the lump of gold which was his 
own property. 

•' All thefe articles being carried aboard, 
-and the wind favourable, their departure 
-was fixed for the next day. Robinfon and 
Triday prepared a dinner, by way of enter- 
tainment before their departure, for the cap- 
tain and thofe who were to compofe the fu- 
ture colony on the ifland. They ferved up 
the bed of every thing that was amongft 
their provifions, and the victuals were fo 
well prepared, that the captain could not 
fufficiently admire Robinfon's fkill in enter- 
- taining his com.pany. The captain, to imi- 
tate the generofity of his hoft, and to con- 
tribute in fome meafure to the welfare of 
the new inhabitants of the ifland, ordered a 
quantity of provifions to be brought from 
the ihip, together with gunpowder, iroii, 

and

krid workiiTg tools, all which he beftowed 
as a prefent on the colony. 
c Towards evening, Robinfbn made his 
excufes, and begged permiffion to be alone 
for an hour, alledging that there remained 
fbme important bufinefs which he wifhed 
to fettle before his departure. Every one 
withdrawing, he went to the top of the 
hillock 3 there he revolved in his mind the 
feries of events that had happened during 
his abode upon the ifland, and his heart, full 
of the livelieft filial gratitude, opened itfelf 
in thankfgiving to his Supreme Benefador. 
How fhall I exprefs his pious acknowledge- 
ments ? But hearts like his will find in their 
own feelings the expreffion of thofe fenti- 
ments which I want words to interpret. 

The time of their departure being arrived, 
-Robinfon affedionately exhorted the co- 
lony to be unanimous, induftrious, and, 
above all, religious -, and, bearing in his 
breaft a regard for the welfare of the whole, 
he recommends them as his brothers to that 
divine protedion which he had always

wonderfully experienced. He looks round 
once more with inward fatisfadion : again^ 
he thanks Heaven both for preferving, 
hira hitherto,, and for delivering him atpre- 
ient by a miracle of goodnefs and wifdom :. 
for the lafl time,, he bids farewell to the in- 
'babitants whom he leaves in the iiland, but 
in a voice fcarcely to be heard. At length 
he goes aboard^ accompanied by Thurfday 
and Friday..

Mr, Bill. The wind was freih,. and blew 
fo favourably that the ifland feemed to. with- 
draw from themi very fafl:,. As long as it was 
in fight, Robinfon, ftanding upon the deck, 
in mournful filence, kept his eyes fixed up- 
on the fpot, which, from his having lived' 
upon it for 12 years, and experienced and. 
furmounted many diftrelTes there, was become 
almoft as dear to him as his own native

country. At length, having loft fight of 
the illand, and the top of its higheft hill, he 
retired into the cabin with Thurfday and 
Friday, in order to relieve the opprefTion of 
his thoughts in the amufement of friendly 
converfation. 

They had a very fine voyage, and in 
twenty-four days caft anchor in the harbour 
of Cadiz, where they landed all their Spa- 
nifh pailengers. Robinfon went into thie 
town to enquire for the merchant to whom- the 
barrel of gold-duft belonged which he had 
faved from the wreck. Ht was fortunate 
enough to find h-im, and to learn that tht 
honeft ^merchant, by recovering this gold, 
would be extricated fi-om the greateft diffi- 
culties. The lofs of his fhip had been fol- 
lowed by the moft difagreeable conie- 
quences : it had thrown his affairs into {udi 
confufion that he failed. 

Henry, Failed? how? : • : 

Mr. Bill. When a man owes more than 
>he can pay, he gives up whatever property 
he has remaining to be divided proportion-

ably amongft his creditors, who thus lofe 
each of them more or lefs -, and in this cafe 
a man is faid to become bankrupt, or to 
fail. 

The barrel of gold-duft was more than 
fufficient to pay off the merchant's debts. 
Penetrated with gratitude, he wifhed to be- 
ftow the remainder upon his benefador. 
Robinfon, far from accepting it, declared 
that he was already too well rewarded in the 
fatisfaftion of having prevented the ruin of 
an honeft merchant. 

From Cadi2 they kt lail for England. 
In this part of the voyage a melancholy 
event happened. Thurfday fell fuddenly 
ilii all the affiftance that could be given 
him was of no fervice. You may imagine 
what Friday fuffered, and what was his ex- 
cefs of grief on the death of a father whom 
he loved beyond expreffion. The two lamas,, 
alfo, being no longer able to endure the 
voyage and the fea air, died foon after. 

Th.e fhip arrived without any accident at 

Portfmouth.. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

Portfmouth. Robinfon hoped to find there 
the widow to whom he was to reftore the 
diamonds. He found her, indeed, according 
to the diredlion that he had received for her, 
but in very low circumftances. Having re- 
ceived neither remittances nor even tidings 
from India for two years, fhe and her children 
were reduced to very great diftrefs; in fhort, 
they were aimed in rags, and poverty was 
painted in the countenance of each perfon of 
the family. Robinfon, therefore, once more 
experienced the fatisfadlion, fo delightful to 
every man of benevolence, of being an in- 
flrument in the hands of Providence to dry 
up the tears of the^imfortunate, and put an 
end to their diftrefTes. He gave her the dia- 
monds; and as a plant that is almoft parched 
in ftalk and branches recovers its ftrength and 
verdure after a kindly and refrefhing fhower, 
he faw this family, through returning plenty, 
and the fatisfadion naturally accompanying 
it, lift up their heads once more, make a pro-

arifing from independence which they had 
long fince defpaired of attaining. 

As Robin fon found here a fmall Teffel 
going to Plymouth immediately, he took 
leave of his captain, not chufing to go by 
land, and haftened with Friday aboard the 
•Plymouth veiTel, which fet fail that fame 
evening. 

This fhort pafTage was foon performed. 
They were already in fight of the Eddiftone 
light-houfe, when all of a fudden a violent 
ftorm arofe, which carried the veffel to the 
Weflward.,. AH that fkill and adivity could 
do was put in pradicc tatack and keep out 
to fea, but to no pwpofe : a furious gull of 
wnd rendered all dieir exertions ufelefs^ .it 
"forced the ihip upon a fand-bank with fuck 
'violence that ihe bulged. 

The water came pouring in fo faft that 
they had not a thought of faving her : in faCt, 
the people had fcarce time to take to their 
boats, which was the only refource they had 
to prefer ve their lives. 

They

They fortunately reached fhore at a place 
not far from Plymouth. Robinfon and the 
fhip's crew immediately fleered their courfe 
thither; he, like a poor traveller, now twice 
fhipwrecked, and faving out of all his effects 
nothing but his faithful Ipaniel, who fwam 
after the boat, and Poll, his parrot, which 
flew upon his IHoulder tkie moment ihe faw 
him leave the fhip. He flopped in Ply- 
mouth that night, and the next day learned, 
that, iamongft the goods faved from the 
wreck, were his umbrella and fuit of cloaths 
made of fkins. Thefe, being of no ufe to the 
finder, were reftored to him by a fiflierman 
for a trifling gratuity. As to his great 
wedge of gold, it was loft irrecoverably. 

^i<:i7. Poor Robinfon I 

Mr. Bill. He is now exadlly as rich as 
when he formerly fet fail from Plymouth. 
Perhaps Providence permitted this lofs, to 
prevent any rafh young perfon from being 
dazzled by Robinfon's example, and tra- 
yerfing the world, like him, in the hope 
of returning with a treafure found by 

ehance.

chance. As to Robinfon, the lofs gave hini 
very little concern. Propoiing, as he did, to 
live, all the reft of his days, as foberly and 
with the fame perfeverance in labour, as he 
had vvhilft upon his ifland, he found a lump 
of gold to be quite unnecelTary in the pro- 
fecution of fuch a plan. 

He now took the coach for his native city 
Exeter. He had already learned at Portf- 
mouth that his mother was dead, that affec- 
tionate and tender mother, and he had bitterly 
lamented her lofs. Buried in melancholy on 
account of this event, he attended very little 
to the accidents of the road, and paffed 
through the towns of Brent, Aihburton, and 
Chudleigh, without taking the fmallefl notice 
of them. At length he ftops in Exeter: his 
heart beating with joy, he fprings out of the 
coach, and if it had not been for the num- 
bers of people in the ftreet, whofe prefence 
fomewhat abafhed him, he would have fallen 
on his face to kifs the ground of his native city. 

Going into the inn at which the carriage 
(lopped, he chofe to fend to his father, in

order to prepare him by degrees for the un- 
expected return of his fon. The man who 
was charged with this meflage had orders to 
tell the old gentleman, at firft, that a perfon 
defiredto fpeak with him, who brought him 
agreeable news from his fon : he was, after 
fome time, to add, that his fon was coming 
to Exeter ; and, laftly, to declare that the 
bearer of thefe agreeable tidings was his fon 
himfelf. Without this preparation, the good 
old man might have been feized with fuch an 
excefs of joy as would have cod him his life. 
After this precaution, Robinfon, who (till 
knew the flreets perfedlly well, flies to his 
father's houfe. As foon as he arrived there, iii 
a tranfport of inexpreffible extacy he throws 
himfelf into his father's arms, who trembled 
all over. *' Oh, my father !" — '' My dear 
fon!" — was all that they could fay. Throb- 
bing and fpeechlefs, they remained fome 
time locked in each other's arms ^ at length, 
a feafonable flood of tears relieved both their 
breafls, which were almoll fufFocated with 
joy, 

Friday, 



174 THE NEW 

Friday, whom the multitude of differenc 
objects that he faw, filled with furprife, was 
ilaring about in , filence. His eyes could 
never have enough. The firft day he few 
nothing, I may fay : he was dazzled, con- 
founded, and could fix on no objed:. 

In the mean time, the noife of Robinfon 
Crufoe's return and his furprifing adventures 
was Tpread rapidly through the city of Exeter. 
He was thefole fubjed: of converfation, and 
every body crouded to fee him, every body 
defired to hear him relate his adventures him- 
felf. His father's houfe was for ever full of 
people, and Robinfon was employed in re- 
lating his flory from morning to evening ; 
in the courfeof which he never forgot to ad- 
drefs to the fathers and mothers who heard 
him the following exhortation, *' If you 
love your children, I pray you, teach them, 
in their early years, to be godly, fober, and 
laborious:" and if there happened to be 
young perfons prefent, he was careful to give 
them this wRolefome advice, *VMy dear 
children, obey your parents and your teach^

ers; learn diligently whatever you have a 
capacity to learn ; fear God, and be careful 
—oh, be careful to avoid idlenefs ! It is the 
mother of every vice." 

Pvobinfon's father was by profefTion a 
broker, and he wilhed to fee his fon apply 
to his own bulinefs, in order to take it up 
after his death ; but Robinfon, long accuf- 
tomed to the pleafure of manual labour, beg- 
ged his permiffion to learn the trade of a car- 
penter, and his father not oppofing his incli- 
nation, he put himfelf, together with Friday, 
apprentice to that bufinefs, in which they ' 
made fuch proficiency, that, before the end 
of the year, they could work with as much 
neatnefs and difpatch as any of the trade in 
Exeter* 

After fome time, they opened the bufinefs 
in partncrlhip, and during their whole lives 
remained faithful friends and infeparable con> 
panions. Induftry and fobriety were fo much 
a fecond nature to them, that they could not 
have pafTed even half a day in idlenefs or 
loofe living. In remembrance of their for-

mer folttary way of life, they pitched upon 
one day in the week to live in the fame man- 
ner as they ufed in their ifland, as far as that 
could be done. Concord between them- 
felves, indulgence for the faults of others, 
beneficence towards thofe whom they knew, 
and humanity to all men, were virtues fo 
habitual to them, that they could not conceive 
how any one who negledted the pradtice of 
them could be happy. They were particularly 
diftinguifhed by a pure, fincere, and adtive pie- 
ty. Joy and love were feen to fparkle in their 
eyes, whenever they pronounced the name of 
the Supreme Being*, and they were in pain 
whenever they heard this facred name uttered 
in vain and from mere levity. Therefore, 
the bkffing of Heaven vifibly crowned all 
their endeavours. Being always adlively 
employed about fomething ufeful, they reach- 
ed a very advanced age in health and peace -, 
and the remotefl pofterity will refpedl the 
memory of two men, who, by their example, 
have Ihewn to the world in what manner we 
may belt work out our temporal welfare in
