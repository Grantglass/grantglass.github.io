Robinson Ckvsoe^&c. 




HAT homely Proverb iifed on 
fo many Occafions in England, viz^ 
T^hat ixhat is bred in the Bone ijill 
not go out of the Flejhy was never 
more verify 'd, than in the Story 
of my Life. Anyone would think, 
that after thirty-five Years A^liction, and a Va- 
riety of unhappy Circumftances, Vv'-hich few Men, 
i't any ever, went thro' before, and after near fc- 
ven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fuhicfs 
of all Things -, grown old, and when, if ever, it 
might be allowed me to have had Experience of 
every State of middle Life, and to know which 
was mod adapted to make a Man compleat- 
]y happy; I fay, after ail this, any one would 
have thought, that the native Propenfity to Ram- 
bling, which I gave an Account of in my firfl 
Fart IL B Setting 



[2. ] 



Setting out into the World, to have been pre* 
dominant in my Thoughts, fliould be worn out> 
the volatile Part be fully evacuated, ot at 
leaO: condensed, and I might at 6i Years of 
Age have been a little inclin'd to ft ay at Home, 
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any 
more. 

Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign 
Adventures was taken away in me ; for I had no 
Fortune to make, I had nothingto feek : If I had 
gain'd ten thoufand Pounds I had been no richer; 
for I had already fufficient for me, and for thofe I 
had to leave it to ; and that I had was vifibly 
encreafing ; for having no great Family, I could 
not fpend the Income of what I had, unlefs I would 
fet up for an expenfive Way of Living, fuch as 
a great Family, Servants, Equipage, Gayety, and 
the Uke, which were Things I had no Notion of, or 
Inclination to ; fo that I had nothing indeed to do, 
but to fit ftill, and fully enjoy what I had got, and 
"fee it encreafe daily upon my Hands. 

Yet all thefe Tilings had no Effect upon me, or 
at leaft, not enough to refift the flrong Inclination 
I had to go abroad again, which hung about me 
like a chronical Diflemper; particularly the De- 
fuQ of feeing my new Plantation in the Ifland, 
and the Colony I left there, run in my Head con- 
tinually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my Ima- 
gination run upon it all Day ; it was uppermoft in 
all my Thoughts, and my Fancy worked (o fteadi- 
ly and llrongiy upon it, that I talk'd of it out of 
Sleep ; in fliort, nothing could remove it out of 
my Mind; it even broke fo violently into all my 
Difcourfes, that it made my Converfation tirc- 
fome; fori could talk of nothing elfe, all my 
Difcourfe run into it, even to Impertinence, and I 
faw it my fclf. 

I have 



en 

I have often heard Perfons of good Judgment 
fay, That all the Stir People make in the World 
about Ghofls and Apparitions, is owing to the 
Strength of Imagination, and the powerful Ope- 
ration of Fancy on their Minds j that there is no 
fuch Thing as a Spirit appearing, or a Ghofl: walk- 
ing, and the like : That People's poring affedio- 
nately upon thepafl Converfation of their deceased 
Friends, fo reah'zes it to them, that they are 
capable of fancying, upon fome extraordinary 
Circumftances, that they 'fee them, talk to 
them, and are anfwered by them ; when in Truth, 
there is nothing but Shadow and Vapour in 
the Thing, and they really know nothing of the 
Matter. 

For my Parr, I know not to this Hour, whe- 
ther there are any fuch Things as real Apparitions^! 
Spectres, or Walking of People after they are dead;^ 
or whether there is any Thing in the Stories they 
tell us of that Kind, more than the Produd of 
Vapours, fick Minds, and wandring Fancies : 
But this I know, that my Imagination workM up 
to fuch a Height, and brought me into fuch Exta- 
fies of Vapours, or what elfe I may call it, that I 
adually fuppos'd my felf, ofcen-times upon the 
Spot, at my old Caflle behind the Trees , faw my 
old Spaniard, Friday's Father, and the reprobate 
Sailors I left upon the Ifland j nay, I fancy'd I talk'd 
with them, and look'd at them fo Ikadily, tho'I 
was broad awake, as at Perfons juil: before me ; 
and this I did, till I often frighted my felf with the 
Images my fancy reprefentcd to me. One Time in 
my Sleep I had the Villainyof the three Pyrate Sai- 
lors fo lively related to me by thefirft Spaniard sind 
Friday's Father, that it was furprizing ; they told 
me how they barbaroufly attempted to murder all 
the Spaniards^ and chat chey fee Fire to the Provifi- 

B z ons 



[4] 



ons they had laid up, on Purpofe to diftrefs and 
ftarvethemi Things that I had never heard of, and 
that indeed were never all of them true in Fad : 
But it was fo warm in my Imagination, and fo rea- 
liz'd to me, that to the Hour I faw them, I could 
not be perfwaded, but that it was,or would be true ; 
alfo how I refented it, when the Spaniard com- 
plained to me, and how I brought them to Juftice, 
try'd them before me, and ordered them all three 
to be hang'd. What there was really in this, fliall 
be feen in its Place : For however I came to form 
fuch Things in my Dream, and what fecret Con- 
verfe of Spirits injeded it, yet there was very much 
of it true. I fay, I own, that this Dream had no- 
thing in it literally and fpecifically true : But the 
general Part was fo true, the bafe villainous Beha- 
viour of thcfe three harden'd Rogues was fuch, and 
had been fo much worfe than all I can defcribe, 
that the Dream had^too much Similitude of the 
Fad; and as I would afterwards have punifhed 
them feverely, fo if I had hangM them all, I had 
been much m the Right, and fhould ha"* been ju- 
ftifiable both by the Laws of God and Man. 

But to return to my Story. In this Kind of 
Temper I had liv*d fome Years, I had no Enjoy- 
ment of my Life, no pleafant Hours, no agreeable 
Divcrfion but what had fome thing or other of 
this in it ,* fo that my V/ife, who faw my Mind 
fo wholly bent upon it, told me very ferioufly one 
Night, That /lie believed there was fome fecret 
powerful Irapulfe of Providence upon me, which 
had determine me to go thither again ; and that 
fhe found nothing hindred my going, but my being 
engag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me, 
that it was true, fhe could not think of parting 
with me ; but as flie was afl^urd, that if fhe vv-as 
dead, it would be the iirft Thing I fhould do : So 

as 



[5] 

as It feem'd to her, that the Thing was determiVd 
above, fhe would not be the only Obflrudion ; 

For if I thought fit, and refolv'd to go here 

(he found me very intent upon her Words, and 
that I look'd very earneftly at her ; fo that it a lit- 
tle diforder'd her, and fhe flopp'd. I ask'd her. 
Why fhe did not go on, and fay out what fhe was 
going to fay ; but I perceiv'd her Heart was too 
full, and fome Tears flood in her Eyes : Speak out 
my Dear, faid I, Are you willing I fhould go ? No, 
faysjhe very afecliomtely, I am far from willing : 
But if you are refolv'd to go, fays fhe, and rather 
than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with 
you; for tho' I think it a mofl prepoflerous Thing 
for one of your Years, and in your Condition j yet 
if it mufl be, faid fhe again weeping, I won't 
leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, you muil do it. 
There is no reliftingit,-' and if Heaven makes it 
your Duty to go, he will alfo make it mine to go 
with you, or otherwife difpofeofme, that I may 
not obflrud it. 

This affedionate Behaviour of my Wife's 
brought me a little out of my Vapours, and I be- 
gan to conljder what I was doing ; I corrected 
my wandring Fancy, and began to argue with my 
feif fedately, what Bufinefs I had. after threefcorc 
Years, and after fuch a Life of tedious Siiflerings 
and Difaflers, and clofed in fo happy and cify a 
Manner : I fay, what Bufinefs 1 had to rufh into 
pew Hazards, and put my felf upon Adventures 
fit only for Youth and Poverty to run into ? 

With thofe Thoughts, I confidered my new En- 
gagement, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and 
my Wife then great with Child of another ; that I 
had all the World could give me, and had no 
Need to feek Hazards for Gain ; that I was de- 
clining in Years, and ought to think rather ot Ica- 

B 3 V ing 



ving what I had gain'd, than of feekfng to en- 
creafe it j that as to what my Wife had faid, of it$ 
being an Impulfe from Heaven, and that it fhould be 
my Duty to go, I had no Notion of that j fo after 
many of thefe Cogitations, I ftrnggled with the 
power of my Imagination, reafon'd myfelfoutof 
it, Oi I believe People may always do in like Cafes ^ if 
they willy and, in a Word, I conquerM it ; com- 
posed my felf with fuch Arguments as occurM to 
my Thought, and which my prefent Condition 
furnifh'd me plentifully with ; and particularly, as 
the moft effeftual Method, I refolv'd to divert my 
felf with other Things, and to engage in fome Bu- 
iinefs that might efte^cually tye me up from any 
more Excurfions of this Kind ,* for I found that 
Thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, 
had nothing to do, or any Thing of Moment im- 
mediately before me. 

To this Purpofe I bpught a little Farm in the 
County of Bedford^ and refolv'd to remove my 
felf thither. I had a little convenient Houfe upon 
it, and the Land about it I found was capable of 
great Improvement, and that it wa^ many Ways 
fuited to my Inclination, which delighted in Cul- 
tivating, Managing, Planting and Improving of 
Land; and particularly, being an Inland Country, 
I was removed from converfing among Ships, Sai- 
lors, and Things relating to the remote Part of the 
.World. 

i In a Word, I went down to my Farm, fettled 
my Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, 
Waggon, Horfes, Cows, Sheep; and fettingfe- 
rioully to Work, became in one half Year, a meec 
Country Gentleman,- my Thoughts were entirely 
taken up m Managing my Servants, Cultivating 
the Ground, Enclofing, Planting, tXc. and I liv'd, 
as I thought, the moft agreeable Life that Naturd 

was 



f7] 

was capable of di reding, or that a Man always 
bred ro Misiortunes was capable of being rctrea^ 
ted to. 

I farmed upon my own Land, I had no Rent 
to pay, was Innited by no Articles ,• I could pull 
up orcLi|downasI pleafed : What I planted, was 
for myfelf, and what I improved, was for my Fa- 
mily ;, and having thus left oH' the Thoughts of 
WanAing, 1 had not the leaft Difcomfort m any 
Part of Life, as to this World. Now I thought 
indeed that I enjoyed the middle State of Life^ 
that my Father fo earneflly recommended to me, 
andliv'd a kind of heavenly Life, fomething like 
what is defcribed by the P-oet upon the Subjci^ 
of a Country Life. 

Free jr cm Vices ^ free. from Care, 
Age has no Pain, and Youth no Snare. 

But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow 
from unforefeen Providence unhing'd me at once ; 
and not only made a Breach upon me inevitable 
and incurable, but drove me, by its Confequences, 
into a deep Relapfe of the wandring D]fpolition> 
v^hich, as I may fay, being born m my very Blood, 
foon recovered its Hold of me, and like the Re- 
turns of a violent Diflemper, came on with an 
irrefiftible Force upon me j io that nothing could 
make any more Impreilion upon me. This Blow 
was the Lofs of my Wife. 

It is not my Bufinefs here to write an Elegy upr 
on my Wife, give a Charader of her particular 
Virtues, and make my Court to the Sex by the 
Flattery ot a Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few 
Words, the Stay of all my Affairs, the Center o| 
all my Enterprizes, the Engine, that by her Pru- 
dence reduced me to that happy Compafs I was 

B 4 i\h 



[ 8 ] 



in, from the mofl extravagant and ruinous Pro- 
jed that fluttered in my Head, as above ; and 
did more to guide my rambling Genius, than a 
Mother's Tears, a Father's Inftrudions, a Friend's 
Counfel, or my own reafoning Powers could do, 
I was happy in liftening to her Tears, and in be- 
ing mov'd by her Intreaties, and to the laft De- 
gree defolate and dillocated in the World by th? t 
Lofs of her. 

When fhe was gone, the World look'd aukward- 
ly round me , I was as much a Stranger in it, in 
my Thoughts, as I was in the Bmfils^ when I went 
firft on Shore there ; and as much alone, except 
as to the Afliftance o£ Servants, as I was in my 
Ifland. I knew neither what to do, or what not 
to do. 1 faw the World bufy round me, and Part 
labouring for Bread, and the other Part fquan- 
dring in vile Excelfes or empty Pleafures, equally 
miferable, becaufe the End they proposed flill fled 
from them ; for the Man of Pleafure every Day 
furfeited of his YicQ^ and heaped up Work for 
Sorrow and Repentance ; and the Men of Labour 
fpent their Strength in d^iily Strugglings for Bread 
to maintain the vital Strength they laboured with, 
fo living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living 
but to work, and working but to live, as if dai- 
ly Bread were the only End of wearifome Life, 
and a wearifome Life the only Qccafion of dzil^ 
Bread. 

This put me in Mind of the Life I liv'd in. my 
Kingdom, the Ifland ; where I fuffer'd no more 
Corn to grow, becaufe I did not want it ; and bred 
no more Goats, becaufe I had no more Ufe for 
them : Where the Money lay in the Drawer 'till it 
grew mouldy, and had fcarce the Favour to be 
lopk'd upon in 20 Years, 

A|l 



[ 9] 

All thefe Things, had I improved them as I 
ought to have done, and as Reafon and Religion 
had didated to me, would have taught to me to 
fearch farther than human Enjoyments for a full 
Felicity, and that there was fomething which cer- 
tainly was the Reafon and End of Life, fuperiour 
to thefe Things, and which was either to be 
poflefl'ed, or at leafl hoped for on this Side ^he 
Grave. 

But my fage Counfellour was gone, I was like a 
Ship without a Pilot, that could only run afore 
the Wind : My Thoughts run all away again into 
the old Affair, my Head was quite turned with 
the Whimlies of foreign Adventures ,* and all the 
pleafant innocent Amufem.ents of my Farm, and 
my Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which be- 
fore entirely poffefs^'d me, were nothing to me, had 
no Relifl], and were like Mufick to one that has 
no Ear, or Food to one that has no Tafte : In a 
Word, I refolved to leave off Houfe-keeping, lett 
my Farm, and return to London i and in a few 
Months after, I did fo. 

When I came to London^ I was Ml as uneafy as 
I was before, I had no Relifh to the Place, no 
Employment in it, nothing to do but to faunter 
about like an idle Perfon, of whom it may be faid, 
he is perfedly ufelefs in God's Creation ,* and it is 
not one Farthing Matter to the reft of his Kind, 
whether he be dead or alive. This alfo was the 
Life which of all Circumftances of Life was the 
moft my Averfion, who had beep all my Day5 
ufed to an aftive Life ; and I would often fay to my 
felf, A State of Idlenejs is the 'very Dregs of Life ; and 
indeed I thought I was much more fuitably em- 
ployed, when I was twenty fix Days a making ipe 
^ P^al Bpard. 

It 



[ 10 ] 

It was now the beginning of the Year i<^93» 
when my Nephew^whom as I had obferved before, 
I had brought up to the Sea, and had made him 
Commander of a Ship, was come Home from a 
fhort Voyage to Eilboa^ being the firfl he had 
made ; and he came to me, and told me, that 
fome Merchants of his Acqnaintane had beenpro- 
pofing to him to go a Voyage for them to the Eafl 
Indies y and to Chrnuy as private Traders : And 
now Uncle, fays he, if you wiil go to Sea with 
me, I'll engage to land you upon your old Ha- 
bitation in the Ifland, for we are to touch at 
the Brafih. 

Nothmg can be a greater Demon ft rat ion of a 
future State, and of the Exiftence of an invifible 
World, than the Concurrence of fecond Caufes 
with the Ideas of Things, which we form in our 
Minds, perfectly referved, and not communicated 
to any in the World- 

My Nephew knew nothing how far my Di- 
ftemper of Wandring was returned upon me, and 
I knew nothing of what he had in his Thoughts 
to fay, when that very Morning before he came to 
me, I had in a great deal of Confufion of Thought, 
and revolving every Part of my Circumflances m 
my Mind, come to this Refolution, ^tx.. That I 
would go to Lisbon^ and confult with my old Sea- 
Captain ,* and fo if it was rational and pra(5ti-^ 
cable, I would go and fee the Ifland agani, and 
fee what was become of my People there. I had 
pleafed my felf with the Thoughts of peopling 
the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence, 
getting a Patent for the Pofleifion, and I know 
not what ; when in the Middle of all \\\\Sy in 
comes my Nephew, as I have (aid, with his Pro- 
^*c(5t of carrying nie thither, i\\ his Way to the 
EnflLidies. 

1 paus*d 



[ II ] 

I paiis'd a while at his Words, and looking 
fleadily at him, M^hat Devil, faid I, fern you of 
this unlucky Errand? My Nephew ftartl'd as if he 
had been frighted at firft ; but perceiving I was 
not much difpleas'd with the Propofal, he reco- 
yer'd himfelf. I hope it niay not be an unlucky Pro- 
pofal, Sir, fays he, I dare fay you would be pJeas'd 
to fee your new Colony there, where you once 
reigned with more Felicity, than moft of your 
Brother Monarchs in the World. 

In a Word, the Scheme hit fo exaftly with my 
Temper ', that is to fay, the PrepoCTcffion I was 
under, and of which I have faid fo much, that I 
told him in few Words, if he agreed with the 
Merchants, I WQuld go with him : But I told 
him, I would not promife to go any farther than 
my own Illand. Why Sir, fays he, you don't want 
to be left there again, I hope ? Why, faid I, can 
you not take me up again in your Return ? He 
told me, it could not be poiTible, that the Mer- 
chants would allow him to come that Way with 
a loaded Ship of fuch Value, it being a Month^'s 
Sail out of his Way, and might be three or four: 
Befides, Sir, i^ I fhould mifcarry, faid he, and 
not return at al!, then you would be jnil reduced 
to the Condition you were in before. 

This was very rational ; but we both found out 
a Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed 
Sloop on board the Ship, which being taken in 
Pieces, and fhipp'd on board the Ship, might by 
the Help of fome Carpenters, whom we agreed to 
"carry with us, be fet up again in the liland, and 
finifhed, fit to go to Sea in a few Days. 

I was not long refolving ; for indeed rhe Impor- 
tunities of my Nephew join'd in fo eifedually with 
^ly Incination, that nothing could oppofe me: 
ipn the other Hand, my Wife being dead, I had 



C 12. ] 

no Body concernM themfelves fo much for me, as 
to pcrfwade me one Way or other, except my 
ancient good Friend the Widow, who earneftly 
llruggled with me to confider my Years, my eafy 
Circumfliances, and the needlefs Hazards of a long 
Voyage ; and above all, my young Children : But 
it was all to no Purpofe, I had an irrefiftible De- 
fire to the Voyage ; and I told her, 1 thought 
there was fomething fo uncommon in the Impref- 
fiohs I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, that 
it would be a Kind of refilling Providence, if 
I foould attempt to ilay at Home ; after which, 
flie ceafed her Expoflulations, and join'd with me, 
not only in making Provifion for my Voyage, but 
^Ifo in fettling my Family Affairs for my Ab- 
fence, and Providing for the Education of my 
Children. 

In Order to this, I made my Will, and ftttled 
the Eflate I had in fuch a Manner for my Chil-? 
dren, and placed in fuch Hands, that 1 was per- 
feftly eafy and fatisfied they would have Juftice 
done them, whatever might befal me ; and for 
their Education, I left it wholly to my Widow, 
with a fufficienr Maintenance to her (elf for her 
Care : All which fhe richly defer ved ; for no 
Mother could have taken more Care in their ^^• 
ducation, or underflood it better ^ and as flie li- 
ved 'till 1 came Home, I alfo lived to thank her 
for it. 

My Nephew was ready to fail about the Be- 
ginning o^ January 1694-5, and I with my Man 
Friday went on board in the Downs the 8ch, ha- 
ving befides that Sloop which I mentioned above, 
a very conlidcrable Cargo of all Kinds oi necef- 
fary Things for my Colony, which if I did not 
find in good Condition, I rvfolv'd tp leave fo. 



Firft, I carried with me fome Servants, whom 
I purpofed to place there, as Inhabitants, or at 
leaft to fee on Work there upon my own Account 
while I ftay'd, and either to leave them there, or 
carry them forward, as they Ihould appear wil- 
ling. Particularly, I carried two Carpenters, a 
Smith, and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who 
was a Cooper by Trade, but was alfo a gene- 
ral Mechanick ; for he was dexterous at making 
Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn, was a 
good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker i he alfo 
made any Thing that was proper to make of 
Earth, or of Woodj in a Word, we call'd him 
Onr Jack of all Trades, 

With thefe I carried a Taylor, who had ofle- 
red himfelf to go Palfenger to the Eafi Indies with 
my Nephew, but afterwards confented to flay on 
our New Plantation, and prov'd a moil neceflary 
handy Fellow as could be deHr'd, in many other 
Bufineffes, befides that of his Trade \ for as I ob- 
ferved formerly, Neceflity arms us for all Employ- 
ments. 

My Cargo, as near as I can coIle(5t, for I have 
not kept an Account of the Particulars, confifted 
of a fufficient Quantity of Linnen, and fome thin 
Ettglijh Stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I ex- 
pected to find there, and enough of them, as by 
my Calculation might comfortably fupply them 
for feven Years. ^ If I remember right, the Mate- 
rials I carried for clothing them with, Gloves^ 
Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all fuch Things as 
they could want for Wearing, amounted to above 
200 Pounds, including fome Beds, Bedding, and 
Houfhold-Stuif, particularly Kitchen Uteniils, with 
Pots, Kettles, Pewter, Brafs, O'c. and near an 
hundred Pound more in Iron-Work, Nails, Tools 

of 



[ 14] 

of every Kind, Staples, Hooks, Hinges, and eve- 
ry neceflary Thing I could think of. 

I carried alfo an hundred fpare Arms, Muskets, 
and Fuzees, belides fome Piflols, a confiderable 
Quanticy oF Shot of all Sizes, and two Pieces of 
Brafs Cannon ; and becaufe I knew not what 
Time^ and what Extremities I was providing for, 
I carried an hundred Barrels of Pov/der, befides 
Swords, Cutlaflcs, and the Iron Part of fome Pikes, 
and Haiberts j fo that in Ihort we had a large Ma*- 
gazine of all Sorts of Stores ; and 1 made my Ne- 
phew carry two fmall Quarter-Deck Guns more 
than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if 
there was Occafion ,* that when we came there, 
we might build a Fort, and Man it againft all 
Sorts of Enemies ,• And indeed, I at Hrfl thought 
there was Need enough for it all, and much more, 
if we hop'd to maintain our Pofleflionof the Illand, 
as fiiall be feen in the Courfe of that Story. 

I had not (iich bad Luck in this Voyage as 1 
had been ufed to meet with ; and therefore fhail 
have the lefs OccaHon to interrupt the Reader, 
who perhaps may be impatient to hear how Mat- 
ters went with my Colony j yet fome odd Acci- 
dents, crofs Winds, and bad Weather happened, 
on this firft Setting-out, which made the Voyage 
longer than I expected it at iirfi ; and I who had 
never made but one Voyage, (viz. ) my firfl Voyage 
to Guinea, in which I might be faid to come back 
4gain, as the Voyage was at firft deligned, began 
to think the fame ill Fate flill attended me ,* and 
that I ^vas born never to be contented with be- 
ing on Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate 
at Sea. 

Contrary Winds firft put us to the Northward^ 
and we were obliged to put m at Gal-xay in he- 
land, where we lay Wind-bound two and twen- 
ty 



[■5] 



ty Days ; but we had this Satlsfadrion. with the 
Difafter, that Provilions where here exceeding 
cheap, and in the utmoft Plenty ; To that while 
we lay here, we never touched the Ship's Stores, 
but rather added to them ; alfo I took in feveral 
live Hogs, and two Cows, and Calves, which 
I refolv'd, i^ I had a good Paifage, to put on 
Shore in my Illand, but we found Occalion to dif- 
po(e otherwife of them. 

We fet out the 5th of Fehnmry from Ireland^ 
and had a very fair Gale of Wind for fome Days. 
As I remember, it might be about the 20th of F^- 
hruary iw the Evening late, when the Mate having 
the Watch, came into the Round-houfe, and told 
us, he faw a Flafli of Fire, and heard a Gun fir'd, 
and while he was telling us of it, a Boy came in, 
and told us the Boatfwain heard another. This 
made us all run out upon the Qiiarter-Deck, where 
for a while we heard Nothing, but in a few Mi- 
nutes we faw a very great Light, and found that 
there was fome very terrible Fire at a Diftance. 
Immediately we had Rccourfe to our Reckonings, 
in which we all agreed, that there could be no 
Land that Way, in which the Fire fhewed it felf, 
no not for five hundred Leagues, for it appeared 
at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded it muft be 
fome Ship on Fire at Sea ; and as by our hearing 
the Noife of Guns juft before, we concluded ic 
could not be far off, we flood directly towards it, 
becaufe tlie farther we fail'd, the greater the Light 
appeared, tho' the Weather being haizy, we could 
not perceive any Thing but the Light for a while. 
In about Half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being 
fair for us, though not much of it, and the Wea- 
ther clearing up a little, we could plainly difcern 
that it was a great Ship on Fire in the Middle of 
the Sea. 

I was 



C i<5 ] 

1 w^s moft fenfibly touch'd with this Difafler^ 
tho* not at all acquainted with thePcrfonsengag'd 
in it ; I prefently recolleded my former Circum- 
fiances, and in vv^hat Condition I was in, when 
taken up by the Portugal Captain ', and how much 
more deplorable the Circumflances of the poor 
Creatures belonging to this Ship muft be, if they 
had no other Ship in Company with them. Upon 
this, I immediately order'd, that five Guns fhould 
be fir'd, one foon after another, that, if poffible, 
we might give Notice to them, that there was 
Help for them at hand^ and that they might en- 
deavour to fave themfelves in their Boat ,• for tho 
we could fee the Flame of the Ship, yet they, it 
being Night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by ibme Time upon this, only driving 
as the burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-Light ; 
when, on a fudden, to our great Terror, tho' 
we had Reafon to exped it, the Ship blew up 
in the Air ; and immediately, that is to fay, ia 
a few Minutes, all the Fire was out, that is to 
fay, the reft of the Ship funk. This was a terrible^ 
and indeed an affliding Sights for the Sake of the 
poor Men, who, I concluded, muft be either all 
deftroyM in the Ship, or be in the utmofl Diflrefs 
in their Boat in the Middle of the Ocean, which 
at prefent, by Reafon it was dark, I could not 
fee. However, to dired them as well as I could, 
I caufed Lights to be hung out in all the Parts 
of the Ship where v/e could, and which we had 
Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Night 
long, letting them know by this, that there was 
a Ship not far off. 

About 8 Clock in the Morning we difcover'd 
the Ship's Boats by the Help of our Perfpcftive 
Glalfes, and found there were two of them, both 
throng'd with People, and deep in the Water : We 

perceiv- 



[ I? ] 

perceived they rowM, the Wind being againfttliem, 
that they faw our Ship, and did their utmoft to 
make us fee them. 

We imnfiediately fpread our Antient to Jet them 
know we faw them, and hung a Waft out as a Sig- 
nal for them to come on board, and then mads 
more Sail, flanding diredly to them. In little 
more than half an Hour we came up with them, 
and in a word, took them all in, being no lefs than 
fixty four Men, Women, and Children; for there 
were a great many Paflengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a F/ench Mer- 
chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from 
Quebecky in the River of Canada. The Mailer 
gave us a long Account of the Diftrefs of his Ship, 
how the Fire began in the Steerage, by the Negli- 
gence of the Steerfman ; but on his crying out for 
Help, was, as every Body thought, entirely put 
out, when they found that fome Sparks of the firfl 
Fire had gotten into fome Part of the Ship, fo dif- 
ficult to come at, that they could not effedually 
quench it, till getting in between the Timbers, 
and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded 
into the Hold, and mafter'd ail the Skill, and all 
the Application they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into 
their Boats, which to their great Comfort were 
pretty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great 
Shalloup, befidcs a (mall Skfft-j which was of no 
great Service to them, other than to get fome 
frefh Water and Provilions into her after they had 
fecur'd their Lives from the Fire. They had in- 
deed fmall Hope of their Lives by getting into 
thefe Boats at that Diflance from any Land, only 
as they faid well, that they were efcap'd from the 
Fire, and had a PoiTibility that fome Ship might 
happen to be at Sea, and might take them in. 

Part II. C Thcj; 



[ 18] 

Tfiey had Sails, Oars, andaCompafs, ^tldwefe' 
preparing to make the beft of their Way back ta 
JSIevjjound-Land, the Wind blowing pretty fair", 
for it blew an eafy Gale at S. E. by E. They had 
as rhudi Provilionsand V^/ater, as with fparing it 
lb as to be next Door to Starving, might fupport 
them about 12 Days, in which, if they had na 
bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, the Cap- 
tain faid, he hop'd he might get the Banks of 
Newfound- Land, and might perhaps take fome Fifh 
to ftiftain them till they might go on Shore, But 
there were fo many Chances againil them in all 
thefe Cafes ; fixh as, Storms to overfet and foun- 
der them, Rains and Cold to benumb and perifh 
their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep them out and 
ilarve them, that it rnufl have been next to mira- 
culous if they had efcapM. 

In the midil: of their Confultations, every one 
being hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain 
with Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a 
fuddenfurpri2''d with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, 
and after that four more; thefe were the five 
Guns which I caufed to be fired at firil feeing the 
Light : This reviv^'d their Hearts, and gave them 
the Notice, which, as abo've^ I defir'd it fhould, 
(viz..) that there was a Ship at hand for their 
He;p. 

It was upon hearing thefe Guns, that they 
took down their Mails and Sai s ; the Sound com- 
ing from the Wnidward, tliey refolv'^d to lye by 
till Morning. Some Time after this, hearing no 
more Guns, they Er'd three Mtiskets, one a con- 
fiderable While after another ; but thefe, the 
Wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some Time after that again, they were ftiH 
more agreeably furprizM with feeing our Lights, 
and hv-arins the Guns, which, as I have faid, I, 

caused 



[ 19 ] 

Gaiis'd to be fir'd all the re/l oF the Night ,• ihk 
fee them to woik with their Oars, to keep their 
Boats a-head, at lead:, that we might the fooner 
come up With them ; and at laft, to their inex- 
prefTible Joy, they found we liiw them. 

It is impoiible forme to exprefs the feveral Ge- 
ftiires, the ilrange Extafies, the Variety of Po- 
flures wiiich thole poor delivered People run into, to 
exprefs the joy of their Souls at fo unexpeded a 
Deliverance i Grief and Fear are eafily defcribed; 
Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few Motions 
of the Head and Hands make up the Sum of its 
Variety : But an Excefs of Joy, a Surprize of Joy, 
has a Tiioufand Extravagances initi there Vv^ere 
fome in Tears, (ome raging, and tearing them- 
felves, as if they had been in the greateft Agonies 
of Sorrow, fome ftark- raving and down-right Lu- 
natick, fome ran about the Ship ftamping with 
their Feet, others wringing their Hands ; fome 
were dancing, fome linging, fome laughing, more 
crying ; many quite dumb, not able to fpeak a 
Word ; others lick and vomitings feveral fwoon- 
ing, and ready to faint ; and a few were CrolTing 
themfelves, and giving God Thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might" 
be many that were thankful afterward, but the 
PalTion was too ftrong for them at firft, and they 
were not able to mailer it ; they were thrown into 
Extafies, and a Kind of Frenzy, and it was but a 
very few that were composed and ferious in their 
Joy. 

Perhaps the Cafe may have fome Addition to it 
from the particular Circumftance ot that Nation 
they belonged to, I mean the French, whofe Tem- 
per is allow'd to be more volatile, more pafiio* 
nate, and more fprightly, and their Sp :civS more 
fluid than in other Nations. I am noi Philofo- 

C 2 phec

pher enough to determine the Caufe, but nothing 
I had ever (een before came up to it: The Exta- 
fies poor Friday^ my trufty Savage, was in, whe n 
he fo und his Father in the Boat, came the neareU 
to it, and the Surprize of the Mafter and his two 
Companions, whom I deliver^ from the Villains 
that fet them on Shore in the Iflands, came a lit- 
tle Way towards it ; but nothing was to compare 
to this, either that I faw in Friday, or any where 
elfe in my Life. 

It is further obfervable, that thefe Extrava- 
gances did not fhew themfelves in that different 
Manner I have mention\l in different Perfdns only: 
But all the Variety would appear in a Ihort Suc- 
ceffion of Moments in one and the fame Perfon. 
A Man that we faw this Minute dumb, and as in 
were ftupid and confounded^ fhould the next Mi- 
nute be dancing and hallooing like an Antick ; 
and the next Moment be tearing, his Hair, or pul- 
ling his Clothes to Pieces, and ftamping them un- 
der his Feet, like a mad Man ,• and a few Mo- 
ments after that, we fhould have him all in Tears, 
then fick, then fwooning,* and had not immediate 
Help been had, would, in a few Moments more 
have been dead. And thus it was not with one or 
two, 'or ten or twenty, but w4th the greatePu Part 
of them ,• and if I remember right, our Surgeon 
was obligM to let above thirty of them Blood. 

There were two Priefls among them, one an 
old Man, and the other a young Man; and that 
which was llrangefl was, that the oldeft Man 
was the word. As foon as he fet his Foot on 
board our Ship, and faw hfmfelf fafe, he dropt 
down ftone-dcad, not the lead Sign of Life could 
be perceived in him ; our Surgeon immediately ap- 
ply'd proper Remedies to recover him, and was 
the only Maa in the Ship that belrev'd he was not 

deadi 



[II} 

dead. At length he open'd a Vain in his Arm? 
having firfl chaff'd and riibb'd the Part (o as to 
vv^arm it as much as poflible : Upon this the Bloody 
which only dropp'd atfirfl, flow'd (omething free- 
ly ; in three Minute* after, the Man open'd hiis 
Eyes, and about a Quarter of an Hour after that, 
he fpoke, and grew better, and quite well. After the 
Blood was ftopp'd, he walk'd about, and told us he 
was perfectly well, took a Dram of Cordial whicri 
the Surgeon gave him', and was what we call'd, 
Co?ne to bimfelf. About a Quarter of an Hour after, 
they came running into the Cabin to the Surgeon, 
who was bleeding a Prench Woman that had fain- 
ted, and told him, the Prieft was gone flark mad. 
It feems he had begun to revolve the Change of 
his Circumftance, and again this put him into aii 
Extafy of Joy, his Spirits whirfd about fafler than 
the Veffels could convey them ; the Blood grew 
hot and feverifh, and the Man was as fit for Bedlam 
as any Creature that ever was in it. The Surgeon 
would not bleed him again in that Condition, 
but gave him fomething to dofe,. and put him to 
Sleep, which after fome Time operated upon him, 
and he wak'd the next Morning perfedly coni- 
pos'd and well. 

The younger Prieft behav.'d with great Com- 
mando^ his Pailion, and was really an Example 
of a ferious well-govern'd Mind. At his firfr com- 
ing on board the Ship, he threw hirafclf flat on his 
Face, proftrating himfclf in Thankfulnefs for his 
Deliverance^ in which I unhappily and linfeafonar 
biy-difturb'd him, really thinking he had been in. 
a Swoon ; biit he fpake calmly, -thankV* ftic, told 
me, he was giving God Th4^iks for his Delive- 
rance, andbegg'd me to l,e^v.(rHim a few Moments, 
and that, next to his Tvlaker,^ he v/oiild^givx me 
Thanks alfo. ^'V ''^" ' 

C 3 ^^^ tvi^^s 



[ 11 3 

I was heartily forry, that I difliirb'd him, an4 
not only left him, but kept orhers from interrup- 
ting him alfo. He continued in that Pofture about 
three Minutes, or little more, after I left him, 
then came to me, as he had faid he would, and 
with a great deal of Serioufnefs and AfFed^on, but 
vjith Tears in his Eyes, thank 'd me that had un- 
der God, given him and fo many miferable Crea- 
tures their Lives. I told h;m, 1 had no Room to 
move' him to thank God for it, rather than me : 
But I added, That it was nothing but what Rea- 
fon" and Humanity dictated to all Men, and that we 
had as much Reafon as he to give Thanks to God, 
who had blcfs'd us. fofar as to make us the Inftru- 
ments of his Mercy to (o many of his Creatures. 

After this, the young Prieit apply'd himfelf to 
his Country-Folks, and laboured tocompofe them , 
perfwaded, entreated, argued, reafon'd with them, 
":lnd did his utmoft to keep them within the Exer- 
cife of their Reafon ; and with fome he had Suc- 
cefs, tho' others were for a Time out of all Go- 
vernment of themfelves, 

' Tdannot help comniitting this to Writing, as 
•perhaps it may be ufefulto thofe into whofe Hands 
It may h^h fot the. guiding rhemlelves in ail the 
Extravagances "of their PaiTionsi for if an Excefs 
of Joy can carry Men out to fuch a. Length beyond 
the Reach of their Reafon, what will not the 
Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a provoked 
Mind, carry us to ? And indeed here I faw Reafon 
for keeping an exceeding Watch over our Paflions 
of every Kind, as well thofe of Joy and Satisfa- 
^ion, as thofe of Sorrow and Anger. 

Wewcrefomethingdifordered by theft Extrava- 

oanccs among our nevv^ Guefts for thefirfl Day, but 

when they had been retir'^d. Lodgings provided for 

them as well as our Ship would allow, and they 

- " had 



L^3l 

had flept heartily^ as moil of them did, they were 
quite another Sort o^ People the next Da} . 

Nothing of <2:ood Manners orcivil Acknowledg- 
ments tor the Kindnels fiiewn them was wai.ting ; 
the Eench, 'tis known, are naturally apt enough' 
to exceed that Way. The Captain and one of the 
Priells came to me the next Day, and defiring to 
fpeak with me and my Nephew, the Commander^ 
began to confult with us what fhonid be done 
with them ; and firfl they told us, ihat as we had 
favcd their Lives, To aii they h?.d was. little enbl-gh 
for a Return xo us for that Kindnefs received. 
The Captain faid, they had faved feme' Money 
and fome Things of Value in their Boats, catch'd 
haftily out of the Flames, and if we wonid ac- 
cept it, they were ordered to make an Gfftr of 
it all to us ; they only defired to be fet on Shore 
fome where in our Way, where, if 'poiTible, they 
might get Fafl'age to Frame, ^-^'1 ^J- *^ -''^ ^^-V^ '-^ 

My Nephew was for accepting tlhefr Money at 
firft Word, and to confider wliat to u'o with them, 
afterwards ; but 1 over-rul'd him in that Part, 
for I knew what it was to be fet en Shore in a 
ftrange Country ; and if the Portugal Captain that 
took me up at Sea had ferved me fo, and took all 
I had for my Deliverance, I mufl l-:ave ftarv'd, or 
have been as much a Slave at the Brafih as I had 
been in Barhary', the meet being fold to a MnhG" 
metan excepted ; and perhaps a Porttigiiefe is not 
much a better Mafter than a 'Tw% if not in fome 
Cafes a much worfe. ' - ♦ 

I therefore told the French Captain, that we hdll 
taken them up in their Diftrefs, it was true ; but 
that it was our Duty to do fo as we were Fei^ow- 
Creatures, and as we would defire to be fo deli- 
vered if we were in the like, or any other Extremi- 
ty i that we had done nothing for them but what 

C 4 we 



[ H ] 

we believed they would have done for us, if wc 
had been in their Cafe, and they in ours ; but that 
we took thenfi up to fave them, not to plunder 
them ; and it would be a mod barbarous Thing to 
take that little from them which they faved out of 
the Fire, and then fet them on Shore and leave 
them : That this would be firft to fave them from 
iDeath, and then to kill them our felves ; fave them 
from Drowning,^ and abandon them to Starving j 
and therefore I would not let the kaft Thing be 
taken from them. As to fettmg them on Shore, I 
told them indeed that was an exceeding Difficulty 
to us, for that the Ship was bound to the Eafi Indies ; 
and tho' we were driven out of our Courle to the 
Weilward a very great Way, and perhaps were di- 
reded by Heaven on Purpofe for their Deliverance, 
yet it was impolTible for us wilfully to change our 
Voyage on this particular Account, nor could my 
INephew, the Captain, anfwer it to the Freighters, 
with whom he was under Charter- Party to pur- 
fue his Voyage by the Way of Bra/il ; and all I 
knew we could do for them, was to put our felves 
in the Way of meeting with other Ships home- 
ward bound from the IVe/l Indies, and get them 
PafTage, ifpoHible, to England or France. 

The firfl Part of the Propofal was fo generous 
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for 
it ; but they were in a very great Confternation, 
.cfpecially the PafTengers, at the Notion oi being 
carried away to the E.^fl Indies ; and they then in- 
treated me, that feeing I was driven fo far to the 
Wcftward, before I met with them, I would atleaft 
keep on the fame Courfe to the Banks of Neuj- 
fomd-landy where it was probable I might meet 
with fome Ship or Sloop that they might hire to 
carry them back to Canada, from whence they 
j;;amc, 

I thought 



t>-5 1 

I thought this was but a reafonable Requeil on 
their Part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; 
for indeed I confidered, that to carry this whole 
Company to the Eafi Indies^ would not only be 
an intolerable Severity upon the poor People, but 
would be ruining our whole Voyage by devouring 
all our Proviiions; fo I thought it no Breach of 
Charter- Party, but what an unforefeen Accident 
made abfolutely neceflary to us, and in which no, 
one could lay, we were to blame ; for the Laws 
oi God and Nature would have forbid that we 
fliould refufe to take up two Boats full of People 
in fuch a diflrefs'd Condition ; and the Nature of 
the Thing as well refpeding our {qIvcs as the 
poor People, oblig'd us to fet them on Shore fom^ 
where or other for their Deliverance : So I con- 
fented that we fliould carry them to Newfound- 
land^ if Wind and Weather would permit, and if 
not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the 
Wefl Indies. 

The Wind continued frefh Eafterly, but the 
Weather pretty good ; and as the Winds had con- 
tinued in the Points between N. E. and S. E. a 
long Time, we miiled feveral Opportunities of 
fending them to France; for we met feveral Ships 
bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from 
St. Chriftopher's, but they had been fo long beating 
up againfl the Wind, that they durfl take in no 
Paflengers for fear of wanting Provifions for the 
Voyage, as well for themfclves as for thofe they 
fhould take in ; fo we were obliged to go on. It 
was about a Week after this that wc made the 
Banks o^ Newfound-land, where, to fhorren my Sto- 
ry, we put all our French People on Board a Bark, 
which they hirM at Sea there^ to put them on 
Shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if 
they could get Provifions to vidual themfelves 

with. 



[2(5] 

V/ith. When, I fay, all the French went on Shore, 
1 (hould remember, that the young Prieft I fpoke 
of, hearing we were bound to the Eajl Indies y de- 
fired to go the Voyage with us, and to be fet on 
Shore on the Coaft of Coromandel, which I readi- 
ly agreed to, for I wonderfully lik'd the Man, and 
had very good Reafon, as will appear afterwards ; 
^Ifo four of the Seamen entered themfelves on our 
Ship, -and proved very ufeful Fellows. 

From hence we directed our Courfe to the Weft 
Jndiesy fleering away S. and S. by E. for abouc 
twenty Days together, fometimes little or no Wind 
at all, when we met with another Subjecl for our 
Humanity to work upon, almoft as deplorable as^ 
that before. 

It was in the Latitude ofay Degrees, 5 Minutes 
North, and the 19th Day o^ March 169^-'), when 
we 'fpy^'d a Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. we 
foon perceived it was a large Veiferl, and that (lie 
bore up to us, but could not at firfl know what 
to make of her, till after coming a little nearer, 
we found fhe had loH her Main-top-Mafl, Fore- 
maft and Boltfprit, and prefently fhe fired a Gun 
as a Signal of Diflrefs ; the Weather was pretty 
good. Wind at N. N. W. a frefh Gale, and we 
loon came to fpeak with her. 

We found her a Ship of Briflol, bound Home 
from Barhadoesy but had been blown out of the 
Road at Barbadoes a few Days before fhe was rea- 
dy to fail, by a terrible Hurricane, while the Cap- 
tain and chief Mate were both gone on Shore ; fo 
that befidesthe Terror of the Storm, they were 
-but in an indifferent Cafe for good Artifts to bring 
the Ship Home. They had been already nine 
Weeks at Sea, and had met with another terrible 
Storm after the Hurricane was over, which had 
blown them quite out of their Knowledge to the 

Weil- 



Weftward, and in which they lofl their Mafls, as 
above. They told us they expe&d to have feen the 
Bahama Iflands, but were then driven away again 
to tie South- Eaft by a flrong GaJe of Wind at 
N. N. W. the fanie that blew now, and having no 
Sails to work the Ship with but a main Courfe, 
and a kind of fquare Sail upon a Jury Fore-maft 
which they had fct up, they could not lye near 
the Wind, but were endeavouring to ftand away 
for the Canaries. 

But that which was word of all, was, that they 
^^ere almod ftarvM for want of Provifions ; befides 
the Fatigues they had undergone, their Bread and 
Flefii was quite gone ; they had not one Ounce left 
in the Ship, and had had none for eleven Days; 
the only Relief they had, was, their Water was not 
all fpent, and they had about half a Barrel of 
Flower left ; they had Sugar enough ; fome Sue- 
cades, or Sweet-meats, they had at firft, but they 
were devoured, and they had feven Casks of Rum. 

There was a Youth and his Mother, and a Maid- 
Servant on Board, who were going Paflengers, 
and thinking the Ship was ready to fail, unhappi- 
ly came on Board the Evening before the Hurri- 
cane began, and havijig no Provifions o^ their own 
left, they werein a more deplorable Condition than 
the reft, for the Seamen being reduced to fuch an 
extreme Neceffity themfelves, had no Companion, 
we may be fure, forthe poor Fallen gers, and they 
were indeed in a Condition that their Mifery is 
very hard to defcribe. 

1 had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Cu- 
riofity had not led me, the Weather being fair, and 
the Wind abated, to go on Board the Ship. The 
Second Mate who upon this Occafion command- 
ed the Ship, had been on Board our Ship, and he 
told me indeed they had three PaiTengers in th« 

Great 



[ ^8 1 

Great Cabin, that were in a deplorable Con- 
dition ; nay, fays he, I bch'eve they are dead, fot 
I have heard nothing of them for above two Days, 
and I was afraid to enquire after them, faid he, 
tori had nothing to relieve them with. 

We immediately apply 'd our feJves to give 
them what Reh'cf we could fpare ,* and indeed I 
had fo far over-ruled Things with my Nephew, 
that I would have viduall'd them, tho' we had 
gone away to Virginia^ or any Part of the Coafl: of 
America, to have fupply'd our felvesj but there 
was no NeceiTity for that. 

But now they were in a new Danger ; for they 
were afraid of eating too much, even o f that little 
we gave them. The Mate,or Commander, brought 
iix 'Men with him in his Boat, but thefe poor 
Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and were fo weak, 
they. could hardly iit to their Oars: The Mate 
himfelf was very ill, and half ftarv'd ; for he de- 
clar'd he had referv'd nothing from the Men, and 
went Share and Share alike with them in every 
Bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat fparingly, but fet Meat 
before him immediately, and he had not eaten 
three Mouthfuls before he began to be Sick, and 
out of Order ; fo he flopt a while, and our Surr 
geon mix'd him up fomething with fome Broth, 
which he faid would be to him both Food and 
Phyfick ; and after he had taken it, he grew bet- 
ter. In the p:iean Time, I forgot not the Men ; I 
order'd Viduals to be given them, and the poor 
Creatures rather devour a than eat it; they w-ere 
fo exceeding hungry, that they were in a kind ra- 
venous, and had no Command of themfelves ; and 
two of them eat with fo much Greedinels, that 
they were in Panger of their Lives the next 

Morning. 

"" The 



[ ^9] 

The Sight of thefe People's Diflrefs was very 
moving to me, and brought to Mind what I had a 
terrible Profped of at my firft coming on Shore in 
the Ifland, where I had neither the leaft Moath- 
- ful of Food, or any Profpea: of procuring any j be- 
fidesthe hourly Apprehenlion liiad of being made 
the Food of other Creatures : But all the while the 
Mate was thus relating to me the miferable Con- 
dition of the Ship's Company, I could not put 
out of my Thought the Story he had told me of 
the three poor Creatures in the Great Cabin, (viz.,) 
the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-fervant, whom 
he had heard nothing of for two or three Days, 
and whom-he feem'd to confefs they had wholly ne- 
g]Q6t€dy their own Extremities being fo great ; by 
which I underftood, that they had really given 
them no Food at all, and that therefore they muft 
be perifli'd, and be all lying dead perhaps on the 
Floor, or Deck of the Cabin. 

As I therefore kept the Mate, whom we then cal- 
led Captain, on board with hisMen,to refrefh them, 
fo I alfo forgot not the flarving Crew that were 
left on board, but order'd my own Boat to go on 
board the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve 
Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or 
five Pieces of Bed' to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd 
the Men to caufe the Meat to be boifd while they 
flay'd, and to keep Guard in the Cook- Room, to 
prevent the Men taking it to eat raw, or taking it 
out of the Pot before it was well boii'd, and then 
to give every Man but a very little at a Time ; and 
by this Caution he preferv'd the Men, who would 
othervv^ife ha' killed themfelves with that very 
!Food that was given them onPurpofe to fave their 
Lives. 

At the fame Time, I order'd the Mate to go 
into the Great Cabin, and fee what Conditipn the 

poor 



[ 30 1 

poor Pa(rengers were in, and j£ they were alivej 
to comfort them, and give them what ReFrefh- 
ment was proper ; and the Snrgeon gave him a 
large Pitcher with fome of the prepared Broth 
which he had given the Mate that was on board, 
and which he did not queltion would reflore them 
gradually. 

I was not fatisfy'd with this, but as I faid a- 
bove, having a great Mind to fee the Scene of Mi- 
fery, which I knew the Ship itfelf would prefent 
me with, in a more lively Manner than I could 
have it by Report, I took the Captain of the Ship, 
as we now call'd him, with me, and went myfelf 
a little after in their Boat. 

I found the poor Men on board almofl in a Tu- 
mult, to get the Visuals out of theBoyler before 
it was ready : But my Mate obferv'd his Order, 
and kept a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, 
and the Man he plac'd there, after ufing all pofli- 
ble Perfwafion to have Patience, kept them off 
by Force. However, he caufed fome Bisket 
Cakes to bedipp'd in the Pot, and fofcen'd with the 
Liquor of the Meat, which they calls Brews, and 
gave them every one, one, to Tiay their Stomachs, 
and tcld chem it was for their own Safety that he 
was obiig'd to give them but a little at a Time. 
But it was all in vain ; and had I not come on 
Board, and their own Commander and Officers 
with me, and with good Words, and fome Threats 
alfo of giving them no more, I believe they would 
have broke into tne Cook-Room by Force, and 
tore the Meat out of the Furnace : For Words 
are indeed of very fmall Force to a hungry Belly. 
However we pacify 'd them, and fed them gradu- 
ally and cautiouily for the firft Time, and the next 
Time gave them more, and at laft fili'd their Bel- 
lies, and the Men did well enough. 

But 



[31] 



But the Mifery of the poor PaiTengers in the 
Cabin, was of another Nature, and far beyond 
the rell j for as firft the Ship's Company had fo 
little for themfelves, it was but too true that they 
had at firft kept them very low, and at laft total- 
ly negleded them j fo that for fix or feven Days, 
it might be faid, they had really had no Food at 
all, and for feveral Days before very little. The 
poor Mother, who as the Men reported, was a 
Woman of good Senfe and good Breeding, had 
fpar'd all (he could get, fo affedionately for her Son, 
that at laft fiie entirely funk under it : And when 
the Mate of our Ship went in, fhe fat upon the 
Floor or Deck, with her Back up agamft the 
Sides, between two Chairs, which were lafh'd faft, 
and her Head funk in between her Shoulders, like 
a Corpfe, tho' not quite dead. My Mate faid 
all he could to revive and encourage her, and with 
a Spoon put fome Broth into her Mouth ; Ihe o- 
pen'd her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could 
not fpeak ; yet (he underftood what he faid, and 
made Signs to him, intimating that it was too 
late for her, but pointed to her Child, as if (he 
would have faid, they fhould take Care of him. 

However, the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd 
wich the Sight, endeavoured to get fome of the 
Broth into her Mouth ; and as he faid, got two 
or three Spoonfuls down, tho' I queftion whether 
he could be fure of it or not : But it was too late, 
and fhe dy'd the fame Night. 

The Youth, who was preferved at the Price of 
his moft affedionate Mother'^s Life, was not fo far 
gone, yet he lay in a Cabin-bed as one ftretch'd 
out, with hardly any Life left in him ; he had 
a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth, having 
eaten up the reft of it ; however, being young, and 
having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate 

got 



[ 3i ] 

got fomething down his Throat, and he began fen- 
fibly to revive, tho' by gluing him fome time after 
but two or three Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was 
very fick, and brought it up again. 

But the next Care was the poor Maid ; fhe lay 
all along upon the Deck hard by her Miftrefs, 
and juft like one that had fallen down with an A- 
poplexy, and flruggled for Life : Her Limbs were 
diftorted, one of her Hands was dafp'd round the 
Frame of a Chair, and fhe grip'd it fo hard, that 
we could not eafiJy make her let go ,* her other 
Arm lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both to- 
gether fet fail againft the Frame of the Cabin Ta- 
ble. Li fhort, fhelayjufllikeone in the laft Ago- 
nies of Death, and yet Ihe was alive too. 

The poor Creature was not only ftarv'd with 
Hunger, and terrify 'd with the Thoughts of 
Death, but as the Men told us afterwards, was 
broken-hearted for her Miflrefs, whom flie faw dy- 
ing for two or three Days before, and whom fhe 
lov'd mofl tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor Girl ; 
for when our Surgeon, who was a Man of very 
great Knowledge and Experience, had with great 
Application recovered her as to Life 5 he had her 
upon his Hand as to her Senfes, for fhe was lit^ 
tie lefs than diflraded for a confiderable Time af- 
ter, as fhall appear prefently. 

Whoever fliail read thefe Memorandunti muft be 
defir'd to confider^ that Vifitsat Sea are not like 
a Journey into the Country, where fometimes Peo- 
ple if ay a Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our 
Bufinefs was ro relieve this diftrelfed Ship's CreWj 
but not to lye by for them ; and tho' they were 
willing to Reer the fame Courfe with us for fome 
Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace 
with a Ship that had no Mafts. However, as their 

Captain 



Captain begg'd of us co help him to fet up aMain- 
Top-Ma/l, and a Kindof a Top-Maft tohis Jury 
Fore-Maft. We did, as it were lye by him for 
three or four Da.ysy and then having given him 
five Barrels of Beef, and a Barrel of Pork, two 
Hoglheads of Bisket, and a Proportion of Peas, 
Flourj and what other Things we could fpare ; 
and taking three Casks of Sugar, fome Rum, and 
fome Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction, we 
left them, taking on board with us, at their own 
earneft Requell:, the Priefl, the Youth, and the 
Maid, and ail their Goods. 

The young Lad was about feventeen Years of 
Age, a pretty, well-bred, modefl, and fenfible 
Youth, greatly dejeded with the Lofs of his Mor- 
ther, and as it feems had loft his Father but a few 
Months before at Berbadoes, He begg'd of the 
Surgeon to fpeak to me to take him out of the 
Ship, for he faid the cruel Fellows had murther'd 
his Mother i and indeed. fo they had, that is to fay^ 
faffively; for they might ha* fpar'd a fmall Sufte- 
nance to the poor helplefs Widow, that might 
have preferv'd her Life, tho' it had been but /ufl: 
to keep her alive. But Hunger knows no Friend^ 
no Relation, no Juflice, no Right, and therefore 
is remorfelefs, and capable of no Compaflion. 

The Surgeon told him how fair we were going, 
and how it would carry him away from all his 
Friends, and put him perhaps in as bad Gircum- 
ftances almoft as thofe we found him in ; that is 
to fay, Ilarving in the World. He faid he matter'd 
not whether he went, if he was but delivered 
from the terrible Crew he was among: That the 
Captain (by which he meant me, for he could 
know nothing of my Nephew) had fav'd his Life, 
and he was fure would not hurt him j and as for 
the Maid, he was fure> if fhe camc-co herfelf, flie

would be very thankful for it, let us carry them 
where we would. The Surgeon reprefented the 
Cafe (o affectionately to mc, that I yielded, and 
we took them both on board with all their Goods, 
except eleven Hogiheads of Sugar, which could 
not be removed, or come at ; and as the Youth had 
a Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander 
lign a Writing, obh'ging himfelf to go as Toon 
as he came to Briftoly to one Mr. Rogers a Mer- 
chant there, to whom the Youth faid he was re- 
lated, and to deliver a Letter which I wrote to 
him, and all the Goods he had belonging- to the 
dzQCdScd Widow -, which I fuppofe was not done, 
for I could never learn that the Ship came to Bri- 
fiol, but was, as is mod probable, loft at Sea, be- 
ing in ib difabled a Condition, and fo far from a- 
fry Land, that I am of Opinion, the iirft. Storm

Sea, for (lie was leaky, and had Damage in her 
Hold when we met with, her.. • v • 

. I was now in the Latitudcof. i^..Deg. 3 2 Min. 
and had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to 
Weather, tho'* at iirft the Winds, had been con-^ 
trary. I fhall trouble no body with the little In-- 
cidents of Wind, Weather, Currents, &c on the 
reft of our Voyage ; but fhortning my Story for 
the fake of what is to follow, fhail obferve that 
I came to my old Habitation, the Ifland, on the 
loth oiJprtl 16^^. It .was with no fmall Difficul- 
ty that I found tiie Place; for as I came to it, 
and went from it before, on the South and Eaft 
Side of the liland, as coming from the Bmjilsy (a 
now coming in between the Main and the Ifiandy 
arid having no Chart for the Coaft, npr any Laud- 
Mark, I did not knowit when I (aw it, oc know 
whether I law it 01; rou 

^ We 



[ 55 ] 

\X% beat about a great xvhile, and went on Shore 
^n fevera) liland in the Mouth otthe great River 
Oiomoque, but none for my Purpofe. Only this I 
learned by my Coafting the Shore, thati was un- 
der one great Miftake before, viz,, that the Con- 
tinent wliich I thought I faw, from the Ifland I 
liv'd in, was really no Continent, but a long Kland^ 
or rather a Ridge of lilands, reaching from one 
to the other Side of the extended Mouth of that 
great River, and that the Savages who came tQ 
my Illand, were not properly thofe which we call 
Caribkes, but lilanders, and other Barbarians of 
the fame Kind, who inhabited fomething ne^rei: 
to our Side than the rcii ; >' 

, In fhort, I vidted feveral of thefe Jflands to <np 
Purpofe i fome I found were inhabited, and fome 
were not. On one of them I found fome Sfaniardiy 
and thought they had liv'd there j but fpeaking 
with them, I found they had a Sloop lay in a 
fmali Creek hard by, and they came thither to 
make Salt, and to catch fome Pearl Muiiels if they 
could, but that tliey belonged to the Ifle de Trini- 
dad, which lay farther North, in the Latitude of 
10 and II Degrees. 

But at lafl coafting from one Ifland to another, 
ibmetimes with the Ship, fometimes with the 
FrenchyL?ii\s Shailoup, which we had found a con- 
venient Boat, and therefore kept her with thelt 
very good Will ; at length I came fair on the South 
Side ot my Ifland, and I prefently knew the very 
Countenance of the Place ; fo I brought the Ship 
fafe to an Anchor, Broadfide with the little Creek 
wiiere was my old Habitation. 
. As foon as I faw the Place, I call'd for Friday^ 
and ask'd him ii he knew w^here he was ? He 
look'd about a little, and prefently clapping his 
Hands, 9^y'<i> yes^ therey 0)£s^ tkre^ 

V z poia- 



^dinting to our old Habitation, and fell a dan- 
cing and capering like a mad Fellow, and I had 
iiiLxh ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea^ 
to fwim afhore to the Place. 
, "Well, Fridajy fays I, do you think we fhall find 
"kn7 ^ody here or no? And what do you think, 
Ihatl we fee your Father ? The Fellow flood mute 
as a Stock a. good while ; but when I nam'd his 
father, the poor affeftionate Creature look'd de- 
]Qd.Qdy and I could fee the Tears run down his 
Face very plentifully. What is the Matter, Fri^ 
'day\ fays 1 ? Are you troubled bccaufe you may 
fee your Father? No, no, Jap he, fliaking his 
Head, no fee him more, no ever more fee again 5 
mhyfo, faid I Friday, how do you know that? O 
nOj O no, (siys Friday, he long ago die, long ago; 
he much old Man. Well, well, faid /, Friday, 
you don't know ,• but fhall we fee any one elfe 
then? The Fellow, it feems, had better Eyes 
than I, and he points jufi to the Hill above my 
old Houfe 3 and tho' we lay half a League ofl-^ he 
cries out, we fee!' we fee!, yes, we fee much 
f^ien there, and -tlitre, and there. I looked, but 
I could fee.no body, no not with a Perfpediv^ 
Glafs, whfch was, I fuppofe, becaufe I could not 
liit the Place, forthe .Fellow was right, a.^ I found 
upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was ^vt 
or fix Men alrpgether, flood to look at the Ship^ 
not knowing what to think of us. 
' As foon as F.vW^/ had told me he fa w People, 
1 caus'd zhz Endijh Ancient to be fpread, and fir'd 
three Guns, to ^i\t them Notice we were Friends", 
aadin about half a Qcarter of an Hour after, we 
perceived a Smoke ri^e from the Side of the Creek ; 
fo I immediately orderM a Boat out, taking FW- 
daywidx me, i'nd hangmg out a white Flag, or 
Flag of Truce, 1 went diredly on Shore,- taking 

with 



[37] . 

with me the young Pryer I mention'd, ro whoni 
it had told the whole Story of my living rhere* 
and the Manner of it, and every PartfcuJar botn o^ 
my felt-"i and thofe I left there i and who was o» 
that Account extremely dciirous to go witii me. 
We had befidcs about fixteen Men very well 
arm'd, if we had found any new Guefts there 
which we did not know of,' but we h<ia no N'wed 
of Weapoqs. 

As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, 
near high Water, we row'd directly ii, to the Creek, 
and the hrfl Man I hx'd my Eye upon, was the6>^- 
niard who(c Life 1 had fav'd, and whom I kne v by 
his Face perfe6tly v. ell , as ro his Habit I fhaii de- 
fcribe it afterwards. I ordered no body to go on 
Shore at fir ft but my fclf, but there was no keep- 
ing Friday in the Boat; for the affeiftionate Crea- 
ture had fpy'd his Father at a Di/lance, a good 
Way off of the Spaniards y where indeed I faw no- 
thing of him ; and if t'.ey had nor /et him go on 
Shore, he would have jumpy into the Sea. He was 
no fooiier on Shore, but he flew away to his Father 
like an Arrow out of a Bow. It wouid have 
made any Man have flied Tears in Slight of the 
firmed Refolution, to have feen the firli Tranfports 
of this poor Fellow's Joy when he came to his Fa- 
ther; how he embraced him, ki/s'd him, flrok'd his 
Face, took him up in his Arms, /er him down 
upon a Tree, and lay down by him, then flood 
and look'd at him, as any one would look at a 
ftrange Pidure for a Quarter of an Hour toge- 
ther ; then lye down on tlie Ground, and fli oke his 
Legs, and kifs them, and then get up again, and 
ftare at him ; one would ha' thought u\c Fellow 
bewitch'd : But it would ha' made a Dog laugh 
to fee how the next Day his Paflion run out 
another Way : In the Morning he walked along the 
D 3 Shore, 



[38] 

Shore, to and again, with his Father feveral Hours, 
always leading hinm by the Hand, as if he had 
been a Lady ; and every now and then he would . 
come to fetch fomething or other for him to the 
Boar, either a Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Bis- 
ket Cake, or fomething or other that was good. 
In the Afternoon his Frolicks run another Way ; 
tor then he would fet the old Man down upon 
the Ground, and dance about him, and make a 
Thoufand antick Poftures and Gcflures ,• and all 
the while he did this, he would be talking to him^ 
and telling him one Story or another of his Tra- 
vels, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, 
to divert him. In fhort, if the fame filial Affedi- 
on was to be found in Chriflians to their Parents^ 
in our Part of the World, one would be tempted 
to fay, there would hardly ha' been any Need of 
the Fifth Commandment. 

But this is a Digreilion ; I return to my Lan- 
ding. It would beendlefs to take Notice of alP 
the Ceremonies and Civilities th^t the Spaniards 
received me with. The firft Spaniard^ whom, as I 
faid, I knew very well, was he whofe Life I had 
fav'd ,* he came towards the Boat, attended by 
one more, carrying a Flag of Truce alfo; and he 
did not only not know me at firR, but he had 
no Thoughts, no Notion of its being me that was 
come, till I fpoke to him : Seignior, faid I in Por- 
tiiguefe. Do you not know me ? At which he fpoke 
not a Word ; but giving his Musket to the Man 
that was with him, threw^ his Arms abroad, and 
faying fomething in Spamjh^ that I did not perfedly 
hear, comes forward, and embraced me, telling me 
he was inexcufablc, not to know that Faceagain^^ 
that he had once feen, as of an Angel from JHea- 
ven fent to fave his Life : He faid Abundance of 
yery.handfome Things, as a ^ell-bred SpaniardaX- 

way? 



I 39 1 > 

ways knows how ; and then beckoning to the Fer- 
fon that attended him, bad him go and call out his 
Comrades. He then ask'd me, if I would walk to 
my old Habitation, where he would give me Pof- 
feflion of my own Houfe again, and where I Ihould 
fee there had been but mean Improvements ; (o I 
walky along with him ; but alas 1 I could no more 
find the Place again, than if I had never been there ; 
for they had planted fo many Trees, and plac'd 
them in fuch a Pofture, fo thick and clofe to one 
another ', and in ten Years Time they were grown 
fo big, that in jloort the Place was inacceffible, ex^ 
cept by fuch Windings and blind Ways, as they 
themfelves only, who made them, could find. 

I ask^'d them what put them upon all thefe For- 
tifications ? He told me, I would fay there was 
Need enough of it, when they had given me an 
Account how they had pafs'd their Time fince 
their Arriving in the Ifland, efpecially after they 
had the Misfortune to find that I was gone. He 
told me, he could not but have fome Satisfadion in 
my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone 
away in a good Ship, and to my Satisfadion ; and 
that he had often-times a ftrong Perfwafion, that 
one Time or other he fhouldfee me again : But no- 
thing that ever befel him in his Life, he faid, was 
fo furprizing and affliding to him at firft, as the 
Difappointment he was under when he came back 
to the Ifland, and found I was not there. 

As to the three Barbarians (To he cail'd tiiem) 
that were left behind, and of whom he faid he had a 
long Story to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought 
themfelves much better among the Savages, only 
that their Number was fo fmall. And, fays he, 
had thfy been ftrong enough, we had been ali long 
ago in Purgatory ; and with that he crofs'd him- 
felf on the Breaft : But Sir, fays he, I hope you will 
D 4 not 



[40l 

not be difpleas'd, when I (hall tell you how forcM 
by Neceflity we were oblgM, for our own Preferva- 
tion, to difarm them, and make them our Subjects, 
who would not be content with being moderately 
our Mafters, but would be our Murtherers. I an- 
fwer'd, I was heartily afraid of it when I left 
them there ; and nothing troubled me at my par- 
ting from the Idand, but that they were not come 
back, that I might have put them in Poffeflion of 
every Thing firfl, and left the other in a State of 
Subjedion, as they defervM : But if they had re- 
duced them to it, I was very glad, and fhould be 
very far from finding any Fault with it ,• for I knew 
they were a Parcel of refradory, ungovern'd Vil- 
lains, and were fit for any Manner of Mif- 
chief. 

While I was faying this, came the Man whom 
he had fent back, and with him eleven Men more: 
In the DiRrcis they were in,it was impoffible to guefs 
what Nation they were of : But he made all clear 
both to them and to me. Firll: heturn'd to me, and 
pointing to them, faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the 
Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you ; and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them 
know who I was , upon which they all came up 
one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and 
ordinary Fellow^s, and I the like, but really, as if 
they had been Ambafladors of Noblemen, and I a 
Monarch or a great Conqueror ; their Behaviour* 
was to the iafl Degree obliging and courteous, and 
yetmix'd with a Manly, Majeflick Gravity, which 
very well became them ; and in Ihort, they had fo 
much more Manners than I, that I fcarce knew 
how to receive their Civilities, much Ids how to 
return them in Kind. 

The Hiflory of their coming to, and Condud in 
the lilaad, after my going aw^y, is fo very re- 
markable, 



[4-11. 

xnarkaWe, and has fo many Incidents, wh.ch tha 
■former Part ot m) Relation iviil ;.elp to underT 
fland, and which will in moft of the ParcicuJars, 
refer to that Account 1 nave already ^iven, that t 
cannot bat commit them with gi-cai Delight to the 
Keadmg of tnofe that come after iue. 

I fliall no longer trouble the Siory with a Re- 
lation in the firfi Perfon, which wih put me to 
the Expence of ten thoufand Said fs, and Said he's, 
and ne Told mes^ and I ToldhirnSy and me like; 
but I (hall colled the Fads hiilorically, as near 
as I car\ gather them out of m.y Memory from wiut 
they related to me, and from what I met with in 
my converfing with them and with the Place. 

In Order to do t^iis fuccindly, and as intelligi- 
bly as I can, 1 muft go back to the Circumitance 
in which l\dt the liland, and in which the Per- 
fons were of whom I am to fpeak. And firltit is 
necefl'ary to repeat, that I had fent away Friday's 
Father and the Spaniard, the two whofe Lives I 
had refcued from the Savages: I fay, I had fent 
them away in a large Canoe to the Main, as J then 
thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's Companions, 
whom he had left: behind him, in order to fave 
them from the like Calamity that he had been in ; 
and in order to fuccour them for the pre fent, and 
that if poffible, we might together find ibme Way 
for our Deliverance afterward. 

When 1 fent them away, I had no viiible Ap- 
pearance of, or the lead Room to hope for my 
own Deliverance any more than I had twenty Years 
before; much lefs had I any Fore- knowledge of 
what afterwards happened, I mean of an Englifiy 
Ship coming on Shore there to fetch me off ; and 
it could not but be a very great Surprize to them 
when they came back, not only to find that I was 
gone, but to nd threcStrangers kit on the Spot, 
' ' pof- 



[ 4^ ] 

pofleffcd of all that I had left behind me, which 
would otherwffe have been their own. 

The firft Thing, however, which I enquired 
into, that I might begin where Heft off, was of 
their own Part ; and defired he would give me 
a particular Account oF his Voyage back to his 
Countrymen with the Boar, when I Tent him to 
fetch them over. He told me there was little 
Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable hap- 
pened to them on the Way, they having very calm 
Weather, and a fmooth Sea ; for his Countrymen 
it could not be doubted, he faid, but that they 
were overjoyed to fee him. ( It feems he was the 
principal Man among them, the Captain of the 
Vefiel they had been Ihipwreck'd in having been 
dead fome Time) they were, he faid, the more 
furpnzed to fee him, becaufe they knew that he 
was fallen into the Hands of the Savages, who, 
they were fatisfied, would devour him as they did 
all the reft of the Prifoners ; that when he told 
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what: 
Manner he was furnifhed in carrying them away, 
it was like a Dream to them ; and their Aflonifh- 
ment, they faid, was fomething like that o^Jofefl/s 
Brethren, when he told them who he was, and 
told them the Story of his Exaltation in Pharaoh's 
Court : But when he fhewed them the Arms, the 
Powder, the Ball, and the Provifions that he 
brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they 
were reflorcd to themfCiVes, took a jufl Share of 
the Joy of their Deliverance, and immediately pre- 
pared to come away with him. 

Their firfl Bufinefs was to get Canoes ; and in 
this they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon 
the honefl Part of it, but to trefpafs upon their 
friendly Savages, and to borrow two large Cances, 

or 



or Periagua's, on Pretence of going out a FiHiing, 
or for Pleafure. 

In thefe they came away the next Morning. It 
feems they wanted no Time to get themfelves rea- 
dy j for they had no Baggage, neither Clothes or 
Provifions, or any Thing in the World, but what 
they had on them, and a few Roots to eat, of 
which they ufed to make their Bread. 

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in ^ 
that Time unluckily for them, I had the Occa- 
fion offered for my Efcape, as I mentioned in my 
other Part, and to get off from the Ifland, lea- 
ving three of the moft impudent, hardned, ungo- 
verned, difagreeable Villains behind me, that any 
Man could deli re to meet with, to the poor Spa-r 
niards great Griet and Difappointment, you may 
be fure. 

The only jufl: Thing the Rogues did, was^ 
That when the Spaniards came on Shore, they 
gave my Letter to them, and gave them Provi- 
^ons and other Relief, as I had ordered them to 
do ,* alfo they gave them the long Paper of Di- 
regions which I had left with them, containing 
the particular Methods which I took for manag- 
ing every Part of my Life there j the Way how I 
baked my Bread, bred up tame Goats, and plan- 
ted m.y Corn, how I cur'd my Grapes, made my 
Pots ', and in a Word, every Thing I did. All 
this being written dovvU, they gave to the Sfa- 
niardsy two of whom underftood Englifl) well e- 
nough ; nor did they refufe to accommodate the 
Spaniards with every thing elfe, for they agreed 
very well for fome Time. They gave them an 
equal AdmilTion into the Houfe or Cave ; and they 
began to live very fociably, and the Head Spaniard^ 
who had feen pretty much of my Methods, and 
Fridafs Father together, managed all their Af- 
fairs r 



[44] 

fairs : For, as for the EngUjI) Men, they did no- 
thing but ramble about the Illand, fhoot Parrots, 
and catch Tortoifes, and when they came Home 
at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers 
for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfied with 
this, would the other but have let them alone, 
which, however, they could rot find in their 
Hearts to do long, but like tht Dog in the Man- 
ger, they would not eat themfelves, and would 
not let others eat neither. The Differences, never- 
thelefs, were at firil but trivial, and fuch as are 
not worth relating i but at laft, it broke out in- 
to open War, and it begun with all the Rudenefs 
andlnfolence that can be imagined, without Rea- 
fon, without Provocation, contrary to Nature,.and 
indeed, to common Senfe , and tho' it is true the 
firft Relation ot it came from the Spaniards them- 
felves, whom I may call the Accufers, yet when 
I came to examine the Fellows, they could not 
deny a Word of it. 

But before I come to the Particulars of this 
Part, I muft fupply a Defedc in my former Rela- 
tion, ^nd this was, that I forgot to fet down a- 
mong the reft, thatjuft as we were weighing the 
Anchor to fet Sail, there happened a little Quar- 
rel on board our Ship, which I was afraid once 
would have turned to a fecond Mutiny ; nor was 
it appeafed, till the Captain rouzing up his Cou- 
rage, and taking us all to his Affiftance, parted 
them by Force, and making two of the moll: re- 
fadory Fellows Prifoners, he laid them in Irons ; 
and as they had been adive in the former Difor- 
ders, and let fail fome dangerous ugly Words the 
fecond Time, he threatned to carry them in Irons 
to England^ and have them hanged there for Mu- 
tiny, and running avvay with the Ship. 

This, 



[45] 

This, it feems, tho' the Captain did not intend 
to do it, frighted fome other Men in the Ship, and 
feme ot them had put it into the Heads of the 
reft, that the Captain only gave them good Words 
for the prefent, till they fhould come to fome En- 
^ifh Port, and that then they fhou'd be all put into 
Jayl, and try*d for their Lives. 

The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquain- 
ted us with it ; upon which it was defired, that 
I, who ftill pafs'd for a great Man among them, 
Ihould go down with the Mate, and fatisfy the 
Men, and tell them, that they might be aflured, 
if they behav'd well- the reft of tlie Voyage, all 
they had done for the Time paft fhould be par- 
doned. So I went, and after pafting my Honozirs 
Word to themj they appeared eafy ; and the more 
fo, when 1 caufed the two Men, who were in Irons, 
to be releafed an<i forgiven. 

But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor 
for that Night. ; the Wind alfo falling calm, next 
Morning we found, that our two Men who had 
been laid in Irons, had ftole each of them a Muf- 
ket, and fome other Weapons ; what Powder or 
Shot they had, we know not -, and had taken the 
Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet hafd up, 
and ran away with her to their Companions, in 
Roguery, on Shore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the Long- 
•Boat on Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, 
and away they went to feek the Rogues, but they 
could neicher find them, nor any of the reft j for 
they all fled into the Woods Vv'hen they faw the 
Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was once re- 
folv'd, in Juftice to their Roguery, to have de- 
ftroyed their Plantations, burnt all their Houfhold- 
Stuff and Furniture, and left them to (hift without 
it i but having no Order, he let it a^li alone, \cii 

every 



[ 4<^ ] 

every Thing as they found it, and bringing the 
Pinnace away, came on Board without tiicm. 

Thefe two Men made their Number five, but 
the other three Villains were fo much wickeder 
than thefe, that after they had been two or three 
Days together, they turn'd their two new Comers 
out of Doors to fhifc for themfelves, and would 
have nothing to do with them, nor could they for 
a good while be perfwaded to give them any 
Food ; as for rhe Spaniards they were not yet come. 

When rhe Spaniards came firft on Shore, the Bu- 
iinefs began to go forward \ the Spaniards would 
have perfwaded the three Englijb Brutes to have 
taken in their two Countrymen again, that, as they 
faid, they might be all one Family; but they would 
not hear of it. So the two poor Fellows liv'd by 
themfelves, and finding nothing but Induflry and 
Application would make them live comfortably, 
they pitch'd their Tents on the iVbr?/; Shore of the 
Ifland, but a little more on the Wefiy, to be out of 
the Danger of the Savages, whp always landed 
on the Eaft Parts of the liland. 
■ Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge 
in, and the other to lay up their Magazines and 
Stores in, and the Spaniards having given them 
fome Corn for Seed, and efpecially fome of the 
Peafe which I had left them ; they dug, and plan- 
ted, and enclofed, after the Pattern I had fet for 
them all, and began to live pretty well. Their firft 
Crop of Corn was on the Ground -, and tho' it was 
but a little Bit of Land which they had dug up at 
firft, having had but a little Time, yet it was 
enough to relieve them, and find them with Bread 
and other Eatables ; and one of the Fellows being 
the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was vej-y ready at 
making Soup, Puddings, and other fuch Prepara* 

tion$# 



[47] 

tions, as the Rice, and the Milk, and fuch h'ttic 
Flefh as they got, furniflied him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving Po- 
fture, when the three unnatural Rogues, their own 
Countrymen too, in meet Humour, and to infult 
them, came and bullied them, and told them, 
the Kland was theirs, that the Governor, mean- 
ing me, had given them PofTeilion of it, and no 
Body eife had any Right to it, and damn 'em, 
they /hould build no Houfes upon their Ground, 
unless they would pay them Rent for them. 

The two Men thought they had jefted at firft, 
askM them to ceme in and fit down, and fee what 
iine Houfes they were that they had built, and 
tell them what Rent they demanded i and one of 
them merrily told them,ifth€y were Ground-Land- 
lords, he hoped, if they built Tenements upon 
their Land, and made Improvements, they would, 
according to the Cuftom of Landlords, grant 
them a long Leafe, and bid them go fetch a Scri- 
vener to draw the Writings. One of the three 
4a^ning and raging, told them, they Ihould fee 
they were not in Jeft, and going to a little Place 
at. a Diftance, where the honefi Men had made 
a. Fire to drefs their Viduals, he takes a Fire- 
brand, and claps it to the Out- fide of their Hut, 
and very fairly fet it on Fire, and it would have 
been all burnt down in a few Minutes, i^ one of 
the two had not run to the Fellow, thruft him 
away, and trode the Fire out with his Feet, and 
that not without fome Difficulty too. 
. The Fellow was in fuch a Rage at the honeft 
Mari^S; thrufting him away, that he returned up- 
on him with a Pole he had in his Hand, and had 
not the Man avoided the Blow very nimbly, and 
tun into the Hut, he had ended his Days at once. 
His Gomrade feeing the Danger they were both in, 

run 



[4S] 



run in after him, and immediately they came both' 
out with their Muskets, and the Man that was{ 
firll; (truck at with the Pole, knocked the Fellow 
down that begun the Quarrel, with the Stock 
of his Musket, and that before the other two 
could come to help him, and then feeing the reft 
come at them, they flood together, and prefenting 
the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad them 
Hand oft: 

The other had Fire-Arms with them t6o, but 
one of the two honell Men, bolder than his'Com- 
rade, and made defperate by his Danger, told them^ 
if they offered to move Hand or Foor^ they were 
dead Men, and boldly commanded them to lay 
down their Arms. They did not indeed lay down 
their Arms, but feeing him (o refolute, it brought 
them to a Parley, and they confented to take 
their wounded Man with them, and be gone ; and 
indeed it leems the Fellow was wounded fufEci- 
cntly with the Blow. However, they were much 
in the wrong, fince they had the Advantage, that 
they did not difarm them effedually, as they 
might have done, and have gone immediately to 
the Spaniards, and given them an Account how 
the Rogues had treated them ; for the thre^ Vil- 
lains (tudied nothing but Revenge, and every Day 
gave them fome Intimation that they did fo. 

But not to crowd this Part with an Ac- 
count of the leiVer Part of their Rogueries, fuch aS 
treading down their Corn, fhooting three youn^ 
Kids, and a She-Goat, which the poor Men had 
got to breed up tame for their Store ; and, in a 
word, plaguing them Night and Day in this Mari- 
ner, it forced the two Men to fuch a Defperatiod, 
that they refolv'd to fight them all three the firft 
Time they had a fair Opportunity. In Order to 
thisj they rcfolv'd to go to the Caflle, as they call'd 

it* 



[ 49 ] 

it, that was my old Dwelling, where the thres 
Rogues and the Spaniards aii liv'd together, at 
that Time intending to have a fair Battle, and 
the Spaniards fhould ftand by to fee fair Play ; fo 
they got up in the Morning before Day, and came 
to the Place, and call'd the Englifo Men by their 
Names, telling a Spaniardy that anfwer'd, that 
that they wanted to fpeak with them. 

It happened, that the Day before, two of the 
Spaniards having been m the Woods, had feeii 
one of the two Englijh Men, whom> for Diftinclion^ 
I call the Honeft Men, and he had made a fad Com- 
plaint to the Spaniards, of the barbarous Ufage 
they had met with trom their three Countrymen, 
and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and 
deflroy'd their Corn, that they had laboured fo 
hard to bring forward, and kiifd the Milch-Goat 
and their three Kids, which was all they had pro- 
vided for their Suftenance ; and that if he and his 
Friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not ailill 
them again, they fhould be flarved. When the 
Spaniards came home at Night, and they were 
all at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the 
three Englipo Men, tho' in very gentle and mannerly 
Terms, and ask'd them. How they could be fo 
cruel, they being harmlefs inoffenfive Fellows, 
and that they were only putting themfelves in a 
way to fubiili: by their Labour, and that it had 
coil them a great deal of Pains to bring things to 
fuch Perfedion as they had ? 

One of the Englijjj Men return'd very brisk- 
ly, What had they to do there ? I'^hat they came 
on Shore without Leave, and they ihould not 
plant or build upon the Idand, it was none of 
their Ground. Why, fays the Spaniard very 
calmly, - Seignior Inglefe, they muft not ftarv^. 
The Englip Man reply'd like a true rougirhewn 

Part IL E Tat- 



[ 50 ] 

Tarpaulin, they might flarve and be damn'd, 
they fhould not Plant nor Build. But what 
muil they do then, Seignior, faid the Spaniard ? 
Another of the Brutes returned, do! D— -ii 
*ertr^ they fhould be Servants, and work for them. 
Bat how can you exped that of them, fays the 
Spaniard, that are not bought with your Money ? 
You have no Right to make them Servants. 
The Engljfl) Man anfwer'd, the Illand was theirs, 
the Governour had given it to them, and no 
Man had any thing to do there but themfelves ,* 
and with that fvvore by his Maker, that they 
would go and burn all their new Huts, they 
fhould build none upon their Land. 

Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fanix^ 
Rule we muft be your Servants too? Ah, fays the 
bold Dog, and fo you fhall too, before we have 
done with you, mixing two or three G-dDamme'^ 
in the prope Intervals of his Speech. The Spaniard 
only fmil'd at that, and made him no Anfwer. 
However, this little Difcourfe had heated them, 
and darting up, one (ays to the other, I think 
it was he they call'd Z^-^///. Atki}2.f, Come Jack, let 
us go and have t'other BruQi with them ; we'll 
demolilh their Caftle, Til warrant you, they (hall 
plant no Colony in our Dominions. 

Upon this, I hey went all Trooping away, 
with every Man a Gun, a Piflol, and a Sword, 
and mutter'd fome infolent Things among them- 
felves, of what they would do to the Spaniards 
too, when Opportunity offer'd; b:\tthcSpamards 
it ieems did not fo perkc^ly underftand them, 
as to know all the Particulars ; only, that, in gene- 
ral, they threatncd them hard for taking the two 
Enghjh Mens Part. 

Whether they went, or how they be/low'd 
their Time that Evening, the Spaniards faid, 

they 



[ 51 ] 

they did not know ; but it fcems they wandred 
fiboiit the Country, Part of the Night, and then 
lying down in the Place which 1 ufed to call 
my Bower, they were weary, and over-ilept 
themfelves. The Cafe was this, they had re- 
folv'd to ftay till Mid-night, and (o to take the 
two poor Men when they were afleep, and as 
they acknowledg'd afterwards, intended to fet 
Fire to their Huts while they were in them, and 
either burn them in them, or murder them as they 
came out ; and as Malice feldom fieeps very founds 
it was very flrange they fliould not have been 
kept waking. 

However, as the two Men had alfo a Defign 
upon them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer 
one than that of Burning and Murthering, it hap- 
pen'd, and very luckily for them all, that they 
were up and gone abroad, before the bloody-mind- 
ed Rogues came to their Huts. 

When they came there and found the Men 
gone, Atkins, who it fecms was the forwardeft 
Man, call'd out to his Comrades, ha ! Jacky here's 
the Neil:, but D — n 'em the Birds are flown ; 
they mufed a while to think what iliould be the 
Occafion of their being gone abroad fo foon, 
and fuggefled prefently, that the Spaniards had gi- 
ven them Notice of it, and with that they 
fhook Hands, and fworc to one another that they 
would be revengM of the Spaniards. As foon as 
they had made ihis bloody Bargain, they k\\ to 
work with the poor Mens Habitation ,• they did 
not fet Fire indeed to any thing, but they puU'd 
down both their little Houfes, and pull'd them 
fo Limb from Limb, that they left not the Jeaft 
Stick (landing, or fcarce any Sign on the Ground 
where they ftood : They tore all their lirt'e col- 
lected Houfhold Stuff in Pieces, and threw eve- 

E a ry 



[ 5i ] 

ty Thing about in fuch a manner, that the poor 
Men afterwards found fome of their Things a 
Mile off" their Habitation. 

When tiiey had done this, they pull'd up all 
the young Trees the poor Men had planted, 
puird up an Enclofure they had made to fecure 
their Cattle and their Corn ; and in a Word, fack'd 
and piunder'd every thing, as compleatly as a 
Hoord of Tartars would have done. 

The two Men were at this Jundure gone to find 
them out, and had refolved to fight them where- 
ever they had been, tho' they were but two to 
three : So that had rhey met, there certainly would 
have been Bloodflied among them, for they were 
all very ftout reiblute Fellows, to give them their 
due. 

But Providence took more Care to keep them 
aflunder, than they themfelves could do to meet ; ' 
for, as if they had dogg'd one anocher, when 
the three were gone thiiher, the two were here ; 
and afterwards when the two went back to find 
them, the three were come to the old Habita- 
tion again ', we (hall fee their differing C^ndud 
prefently. When the three came back, like furi- 
ous Creatures, flufh'd with the Rage which the 
Work they had been about had put them into, 
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them 
what they had done, by way of Scoff and Bra- 
vado ; and one of them flepping up to one of 
the Spaniards y as if they had been a Couple of 
Boys at Play, takes hold of his Hat, as it was 
upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about, 
fneering in his Face, fays he to him. And yoUy 
Seignior, Jack Spaniard, jJo all have the fame Sauce^ 
ff you do not mend your Manners : The Spaniard, who 
tho' a quiet civil Man^ was as brave as a Man 

could 



could be dcCnd to be, and withal a ftrong 
well-made Man, lookM fleadily at him for a 
good while, and then having no Weapon in 
his Hand, flept gravely up to him, and with 
one Blow of his Fifl knocked him down, as an 
Ox is feird with a Pole- Axe ; at which one of 
the Rogues, infolent at the firfl, fir'd his Pifiol 
at the Spaniard immediately. He mifs'd his Body 
indeed, for the Bullets went thro' his Hair, but 
one of them touched the tip of his Ear, and he 
bled pretty much. The Biood made the Spa- 
niard believe, he was more hurt then he reaily 
was, and that put him into fome Heat ,* for be- 
fore, he acted all m a perfect Calm ; but now 
refolving to go thro^ with his Work, he floop'd 
to take the Fellow's Musket whom he had kncck'd 
down, and was juft going to ftioot the Man, and 
had fir'd at him, when the reft of the Spaniards^ 
being in the Cave, came out, and calling to him 
not to fhoot, they fept in, fecur^d the other 
two, and took their Arms from them. 

When they were thus difarm'd, and found they 
had .nade all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well 
as their own Countrymen, they began to cooJ, 
and giving the Spaniards better Words, would 
have had their Arms again ,* but the Spaniards 
conlidering the Feud that was between them and 
the other two Engli(Io Men, and that it would 
be the bell; Method they could take, to keep them 
from one another, told them, they would do 
them no Harm, and ii they would live peace- 
ably, they would be very \^i\Vm^ to afliil: and 
fociate with them, as they did before ; but that 
they could not think of giving them their Arms 
again, whle they appear a fo refolv'd to do Mif- 
chiet with them to their own Countrymen, and 

E 3 had 



[ H ] 

had even tlireatned them all, to make them their 
Servants. 

The Rogues were now no more capable to 
hear Reason , than to aft Reafon, and being re- 
fui-Zd their Arms, they went raving av/ay and 
raging Hke mad Men, threatning what they 
would do, tho' they had no Fire- Arms. But 
the Spaniards defpifing their Threatning, told 
them they fliould take Care how they ofier'd a- 
ny Injury to their Plantation or Cattle, for if 
they did, they would flioot them as they would 
do ravenous Beafts, where ever they found them; 
and if they fell into their Hands alive, they 
ihould certainly be hang'd. However, this 
was far from cooling them, but away they went 
raging and fwearing^like Furies of Hell. As foon 
as they were gone, came back the two Men in 
Paffion and Rage enough alfo, the' of another 
Kind ^ for having been at their Plantation, and 
iinditig it alldemolilh'd and deftroy'd, as above, 
it will eafily be fuppos'd they had Provocation e- 
noughj they could fcarcc have Room to tell 
their Tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell 
|:hem theirs ^ and itwasftrange enough to find 
three Men thus bully nineteen^ and receive no 
Punifliment at all. 

^ The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpe- 
cialiy having thus difarm'd them, rpade light of 
all their Threatnings; but the two Englifi Men 
refolv'd to have their Remedy againfi: them, 
what Pain foever it coft to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told 
ihem, that as they had difarm'd them, they could 
not confenr that they (the Two) fhould purftie 
them with Fire-Arrns, and perhaps kill them ^ 
but faid the grave -Spaniard^ who was their Go- 
yernour, v/e will endeavour to make them do

.[ 55 ] 

you Jnftice if you will leave ic to us ; for as there 
is no doubt but they will come to us again when 
their Paffion Is over, being not able to fubhfl: 
without our Affiftance, we proaiife you to make 
no Peace with them, without having a full Satif- 
fa6lion for you ,• upon this Condition we hope 
you will promife to ufe no Violence with them, 
other than in your own Defence. 

The two Englifl:) Men yielded to this very 
awkardly, and with gteat Reluftancc ; but the 
Spaniards protefted, chey did it only to keep 
them from Bloodfiied, and to make all eafy at 
laft ; for faid they, we are not i'o many of us, 
here is Room enough for us all, and it is great 
Pity we fhoLild not be all good Friends ; at length 
they did confent, and waited for the Iflue of the 
Thing, living for feme Days with the Spaniardsy 
for their own Habitation was deflroyed. 

In about five Days Time the three Vagrants, 
tir'd with Wandring, and almoft ftarv'd with 
Hunger, having chiefly liv'd on Tardea Eggs 
all thatv/hile, came back to the Grove, and find- 
ing my Spaniard^ who^ as I have faid, Vv^as the 
Governour, and two more with him walking 
by the Side oF the Creek, they came up in a 
very fubmiffive humble Manner, and begg'd 
to be received again into the Family. The 
Spaniards vS<zd them civilly, but told them, they 
had aded fo unnaturally by their Councrymen, 
and fo very grofsly by them (the Spaniards) 
that they could not come to any Conclufion, 
without confulting the two Engliji? Men and 
the reft ; but however, they would go to 
them and difcourfe about it, and they would 
know in half an Hour. It may be guefs'd, that 
they were very hard put to it ; fur, it feems, as 
they v/ere to wait this half lour for an An- 

E 4 fwer, 



[ 5^ ] 

^er, tliey begged they would fend them out 
fome Bread in the mean Time, which he did, 
and fent them at the fame Time a large Piece of 
Goats Fiefh, and a broiled Parrot, which they 
eat very heartily, for they were hungry enough. 

After Half an Hour's Confultation they were 
caird in, and a long Debate had among them, 
|:heir two Contrymen charging them wiih the 
Ruin of all their Labour, and a Delign to mur- 
der them ; all which they owned beiore, and 
theretore could not deny now. Upon the whole, 
the Spaniard adted the Moderator between them, 
and as they had obliged the two Engliflo Men 
not to hurt the three while they were naked and , 
unarm.ed, fo they now obliged the three to go 
and build their Fellows two Huts, one of the 
fame, and the other of larger Dimenfions, than 
they were before; to fence their Ground again^ 
where they had pulled up the Fences, plant 
Trees in the Room of thofe pulled up, dig up 
the Laud again for planting Corn, where they 
had fpoiied it ^ and in a VVord, to reflore every 
.Thing in the fi-me State they found it, as near 
as they could, for entirely it could not be, thq 
Seafon for the- Corn, and the Growth of the 
Trees and Hedges, not being poiTible to be re- 
covered. 

Well, they fubmitted to all this, and as they 
had Plenty of Provifions given them all the while, 
they grew very orderly, and the whole Society 
began to live pleafancly and agreeably together, 
only ihat thefe three Fellows could never be per- 
fwadcd to v/orK', I mean for themfelves^ except 
now and then a little, juff as they pleasM. Howe- 
ver, the Spaniards told them plainl) , that if they 
would but live fociably and friendly together, and 
fiudy, in the whole the Good of the Plantation, 

they 



[ 57 1 

they would be content to work for them, and let 
them walk iiboiit, and be as idle as they pleased ; 
and thus having lived pretty well together for a 
Month or two, the Spaniards gave them Arms 
again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad with 
them as before. 

It was not above a Week after they had thefe 
Arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful Crea- 
tures began to be iniolent and troublefom as be*' 
fore;, but however, an Accident happening pre- 
fently upon this, v/hich endangered the Safety of 
them ail, they were obliged to lay by all private 
Refentments, and look to the Prefervaiion of their 
^ Lives. 

It happened one Night, that the Spaniard Go- 
vernor, as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard^ 
whole Life I had faved, who was now the Cap- 
tain, or Leader, or Governor of the reft, found 
himfelf very uneafy in the Night, and could by 
no Means get any Sleep ; he was perfectly well 
in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his 
Thoughts tumultuous, his Mind run upon Men 
fighting and killing of one another, but was 
broad awake, and could not by any Means 
get any Sleep. In fliort he lay a great v/hile, but 
growjng more and more uneafy, he refolved to 
rife : As they lay, being fo many of them, upon 
Goats-skins, laid thick upon fuch Couches, and 
Pads, as they made for themfclves, not in Ham* 
mocks and Ship Beds, as I did, who was but 
one, fo they had little to do, when they were 
willing to rife, but to get up upon their Feer, 
and perhaps put on a Coat, fuch as it was, 
and their Pumps, and they were ready for 
going any Way that their Thoughts guided 
them. 



Being 



[ 58 ] ^ 

Being thus gotten up, he look'd out, but being 
dark, he could fee little or nothing ; and bciides, 
the Trees which I had planted, as in my former 
Account is defcribed, and which were now grown 
tall, intercepted his Sight, To that he could on- 
ly look up, and fee that it was a clear Star- 
light Night, and hearing no Noife, he returned 
and laid him down again ; but it was all one, he 
could not fleep, nor could he compofe himfelf 
to any Thing like Reic, but his Thoughts were 
to the laft Degree uneafy, and yet he knew not 
for what. 

FJaving made fome Noife with rifing and 
walking about, going out and coming in, ano- 
ther of them waked, and calling, asked, who 
i; was that was up ? The Governor told liira, 
how it had been with him. Say you fo, fays 
the other Spaniard, luch Thing > are not to be 
flighted, I aflure you ; there is certainly fome 
MifchieF working, fays he, near us ; and prefent- 
ly he asked him. Where are the Englijh Men ? 
They are all in their Huts, fays he, fafe enough. 
It feems, the Spaniards had kept PolTeiriOii of the 
main Apartment, and had made a Place where 
the three EngUfl) Men, fince their lafl: Mutiny al- 
ways quartered by themfelves, and could not come 
at the refl. Well, fays the Spaniard^ there is 
fomething in it, I am perfwaded^from my own 
Experience ; I am fatisfied our Spirits embodied 
have a Converfe with, and receive Intelligence 
from the Spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the 
invifible World, and this friendly Notice Is gi- 
ven for our Advantage, it we know how to 
make Ufe of it. Come, fays he, let us go out 
and look abroad, and if we h'nd nothing at all 
in it to juftify the Trouble, I will tell you a Sto- 
ry 



159 1 

vy to the Purpofe, that lliall convince you of 
the Juftice of my propofing it. 

In a Word, they went out to go to the Top 
of the Hill, where I iifed to go, but they being 
ftrong and in good Company, not alone, as I 
was, ufed none of my Cautions, to go up by the 
Ladder, and then pulling it up after them, to go 
up a fecond Stage to the Top, but were going 
round thro' the Grove unconcerned and unwary, 
when they were furprized with feeing a Light, 
as of Fire, a very little Way off from them, and 
hearing the Voices of Men, not of one, or two, 
but of a great Number. 

In all the Difcoveries I had made of the Sava- 
ges landing on the Ifland, it was my conftant- Care 
to prevent them making the leaft Difcovery of 
there being any Inhabitant upon the Place ; and 
when by any Occafion they came to know it, they 
felt it fo effectually, that they that got away were 
fcarce able to give any Account of it, for we 
difappeared a.: foon as poiTible ; nor did ever any 
that had feen me, efcape to tell any one dk, ex- 
cept it were the three Savages in our lafl: Encoun- 
ter, who jumped into the Boat, of whom I men- 
tioned, that I v/as afraid they Ihould go Home 
and bring more Help. 

Whether it was the Confequence of the E- 
fcape of thofe Men, that fo great a Number 
came now together, or whether they came ig- 
norantly, and by Accident, on their ufual bloody 
Errand, they could not it feems underftand ; 
but whatever it was, it had been their Bufinefs, 
either to have concealed themfelves, as not to 
have feen them at all, much lefs to have let 
the Savages have feen that there were any In- 
habitants in the Place, or to have fallen upon 
them fo effedually, as that not a Man of them 

ftiould 



[ 60 ] 

fhoiild have efcaped, which could only have 
been, by getting in between them and their 
Boats ; but this Prefcncc of Mind was wanting 
to them, which was the Ruin of their Tranquil- 
lity for a great while. 

We need not doubt, but that the Governour 
and the Man with him, furprized with this Sight 
run back imediately, and rais'd their Fellows, 
giving them an Account of the imminent Danger 
they were all in ; and they again as readily took 
the Alarm, but it was impofTible to perfwade 
them to ftay clofe within wijere they were, but 
that they mufl run all out to fee how Things 
ilood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well e- 
nough, and they had Opportunity enough for 
fome Hours to view them by the Light of three 
Fires they liad made at a Didance trom one a- 
nother ; what they were doing they knew not, 
and what to do themfelves they knew not. For, 
firft, the Enemy were too many ; and fecondly, 
they did not keep together, but were divided in- 
to feveral Parties, and were on Shore . in fevera,! 
Places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall Confternation 
at this Sight, and as they found that the Fel- 
lows ran draggling all over the Shore, they 
made no Doubt, but firll: or laft, fome of them 
would chop in upon their Habitation, or upon 
fome other Place, where they would fee tiie 
Token of Inhabitants, and they were in great 
Perplexity alfo for fear of their Flock of Goats, 
wdiich would have been litrlw Icfs than flarving 
them, if they fliouid have been deftroy'd ; fo 
the firil^th.ng they refoiv'd upon, was to dif- 
patch three Men away before it was light, 'vzt^, 
two Spaniards and one EugliJImaUy to drive ali 

the 



[ ^I] 

the Goats away to the great Valley where the 
Cave was, and if Need were, to drive them in- 
to the very Cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the Savages all toge- 
ther in one Body, and at any Diftance from 
their Canoes, they refolv'd, if they had been 
an hundred of them, to have attacked them ; 
but that could not be obtained, for they were 
fomeof them two Miles off from the other, and, 
as it appeared afterwards, were of two ditlerenc 
Nations. 

And alter having mufed a great wliile on the 
Courfe they fhould take, and beaten their Brains 
in conlidering their prefent Circiimflances, they 
refolv'd at laft, while it was dark, to fend 
the old Savage, Friday's Father, out as a Spy, 
to learn, if poffible, fomething concerning them, 
what they came for, and what they intended to 
do ; the old Man readily undertook it, . and 
-ftripping himfelf quite naked, as moft of the 
Savages were, away he went. After he had 
been gone an Hour or two, he brings Word, 
that he had been among them undifcover'd, 
that he found they were two Partie-, and of 
two feverai Nations Vv^ho had War with oue 
another, and had had a great Battle in their 
• own Country, and that both Sides having had 
feverai Prifoners taken in the Fight, they were 
by meer Chance landed all in the fame liland, 
'for the devouring their Prifoners, and making 
merry; but their coming fo by Chance to the 
•fame Place had fpoil'd all their Mirth ; that 
they were in a great Rage at one another, and 
that they were fo near, that he believ'd they 
would fight again, as foon as Day-light began to 
appear; but he ' did not perceive that they had 
'S,uy Notion of any Body's being on the Ifland 

but 



[6i] 

but themfelves. He .had hardly made an End 
of telling his Story, when -^hcy could perceive, 
by the unufual Noife they made, that the two 
little Armies were engag'd in a bloody Fight. 

Fridafs Father uled all the Aigum^-nts he 
could to peifwade our People to lye clofe, and 
not be feen ; he told them their Safety confilkd 
in it, and that they had nothing to do but lye 
llill, and the Savages would kill one another to 
their Hands, and then the reft would go away ; 
and it was fo to a Tittle. But it was impoffible 
to prevail, efpecially upon the Englifimen, their 
Curiolity was fo importunate upon their Pru- 
dentials, that they muft run out and fee the 
Battle: However, they ufed fome Caution too. 
("jiz,.) they did not go openly, juft by their own 
Dwelling, bur went farther into the Woods, and 
plac'd tnemfelves to Advantage, where they 
mi^ht fecureiy fee them manage the Fight, andj 
as they thought, not to be feen by them j but it 
feems the Savages did fee them, as we Ihall iind 
hereafter 

The Battle was very fierce, and if I might 
believe the EngUjhiteny one of them faid, he 
could perceive, that fome of them were Men of 
great Bravery, of invincible Spirits, and of 
great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle, 
they faid, held two Hours, before they could 
ouefs which Party would be beaten -, but then 
tiiat Party which was neareft our People's Habi- 
tation began to appear weakeft, and afrer fome 
Time more, fome of them began to fly ; and this 
put our Men again into a great Confternation, 
left any ot thofe that fled fliould run into the 
Grove, before their Dwelling, for Shelter, and 
thereby involuntarily difcovcr the Place ; and 
that by Confequence the Purfuers fliould do the 

like 



^Hit in Search for them. Upon this they refolv'd 
that they would ftand arm'd within the Wail, 
and whoever came into the Grove, they ihould 
fally out over the Wall and kill them ; (o that, 
if polTible, not one fliould return to give an Ac- 
count ct" it. TheyorderM al/b, that it fliould be 
done with their Swords, or by knocking them dov/n 
with the Stock of the Musket, but not by flioot- 
ingthem, for fear of the Noife. 

As they expected, it fell out; three of the 
routed Army fled for Life, and, croillng ths 
Creek, ran diredly into the Place, not in the lealt 
knowing whether they went, but running as in- 
to a thick Wood for Shelter; the Scout they 
kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this with- 
in, with this Addition, to our Mens great Satif- 
^action (viz,.) That the Conquerors had not pur- 
lued them, or feen which Way they were ^one. 
Upon this, the Spaniard Governour, a Man of 
Humanity, would not fuffer them to kill the 
three Fugitives, but fending three Men out by 
the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go round 
and come in behind them, furprize, and take 
them Prifoners, which was done. Txhe Refidue 
of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes, and 
got off to Sea; the Vigors retir'd, and made no 
Purfuit, or very little, but drav/ing themfelves into 
a Body together, gave two great skreaming 
Shouts, which they fuppos'd was by way of Tri- 
umph, and fo the Fight ended : And the fame 
Day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, they 
alfo march'd to their Canoes ••, and thus the Spatii- 
ards had their liland again free to themfelves, 
their Fright was over, and they faw no Savages 
in feveral Years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards cam- 
out of their Den, and viewing the Field ofBattl.-, 

they 



[ 6^^ 

tlicy found about two and thirty dead Men uporf 
the Spot I foine were killed with great long Ar- 
rows, Tome of which were found flicking in their 
Bodies j but moll of them were killed with their 
great wooden Swords, fixcetn or feventeen of 
which they found in ihe Field of Battle, and as 
many Bows, v^^ith a great many Arrows. Thefe 
Swords werellrange great unweildy Things, and 
they mud be very flrong Men that ufed them. 
Moll of thofe Men that were killed with them, 
had their Heads mafn'd to Pieces as we may fayi 
or as we call it in EngUfiy th^ir Brains knocked 
out, and feveral rheir Arms and Legs broken ; fo 
that 'tis evident they fight with inexprelTible Rage 
and Fury. We found not one wounded Man that 
was not (lone dead ; for either they fcay by their 
Enemy till they have quite kill'd him, or they car- 
ry all the wounded Men, that are not quite deadi 
away with them. 

This Deliverance tam'd our Englifh Men for a 
great while ; the Sight had fiU'd them with Hor- 
ror, and the Confequences appeared terrible to the 
vA Degree, even to them, if ever they Ihould fall 
into the Hands of thofe Creatures, who would not 
only kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, 
as we kill cur Cattle. And they profefs'd to me, 
that the Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef 
or Mutton, tho' it was fuppofed it was not to be 
till they were dead, had fomething in it fo hor- 
rible, that it naulcated their very Stomachs, made 
them fick w^henthey thought of it, and fiU'd their 
Minds with much unufual Terror, that they were 
not themfelves for fome Weeks after. 

This, as I faid, tamed even the three Englifh 
Brutes I have been fpeaking of ; and for a great 
while after they were very tractable, and went 
about the common Bufinefs of their whole Society, 

well 



[<^5 3 

well enough 5 planted, fow'd, reap'd, and begun 
to be all naturalized to the Country. But fome- 
time after this, they fell all into fuch Meafures 
as brought them into a great deal of Trouble. 

They had taken three Prifoners, as I had ob- 
ferved, and thefe three being lufly flout young 
Fellows, they made theiri Servants, and taught 
them tO work for them, and as Slaves they did 
well enough; but they did not take their Mea- 
fures with them as I did by my Man Fryddy, viz.. 
to begin with them upon the Principle of having 
faved their Lives, and then inftrud them in the 
rational Principles of Life, much lefs of Religion,' 
civilizing and reducing them by kind Ufuage and 
affectionate Arguings ; but as they gave them their 
Food every Day, To they gave them their Work 
too, and kept tiiem fully employed in Drudgery 
enough ,• but they failed in this, by it, that they 
never had them to allift them and fight for them, 
as I had my Man Friday^, who was as true to me 
as the very Fiefti upon my Bones. 

But to come to the Family Part, being all now 
good Friends ; for common Danger, as I faid a- 
bove, had effedually reconciled them, they began 
to confider their general Circumftances ,* and the 
firfl Thing that came under their Confideratioa 
was, Whether, feeing the Savages particularly 
haunted that Side of the Ifland, and that there 
were more remote and rerir'd Parts of it equally 
adapted to their Way of Living, and manifeftly 
to their Advantage, they fhould not rather remove 
their Habitation, and plant in fome more proper 
Place for their Safety, and efpecially for the Se- 
curity of their Cattle and Corn ? 

Upon this, after long Debate, it was conclu- 
ded. That they would not remove their Habita- 
tion ; becaufe, that fome Time or other, they 

Pare 11. F thought 



thought they might hear from their Governor ' 
again, meaning me ; and if I fhoiild fend any one 
to leek them, 1 fliould befure to dircd them to 
that Side, where, if they fliould find the Place 
demolifhed, they would conclude the Savages had 
kill'd us all, and we were gone, and fo Our Sup- 
ply would go tooi 

But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the Valey where my Cave was, 
where the Land was as proper for both, and where 
indeed there wa^ Land enough : However up- 
onfecond Thoughts, they altered One Part of that 
Refolution too, andrefolved only to remove Part 
<?f their Cattle thither, and plant Part of theit 
Corn there ; and fo if one Part was dcftroyed, tho^ 
other might be faved. And one Part of Prudence 
they ufed, which it was very well they did, 'viz.:- 
r- That they never trufled thofe three Savages, which 
they had Prifoners, with knowing any Thing of- 
the Plantation they had made in that Valley, or 
of any Cattle they had there ; much lefs of the 
Cave there, which they kept, in Cafe oi Necef- 
{icy, as a fafe Retreat^ and whither they carried 
alfo the two Barrels of Powder, which 1 had Tent 
them at my coming away. 

But however they refolved not to change their 
Habitation, yet they agreed, that as I had care- 
fully covered it firft with a Wall of Fortificaticni 
and then with a Grove of Trees : fo, feeing their 
Safety coniifted entirely in their being concealed, 
of which they were now fully convinced , they fee 
to work to cover and conceal the Place yet moi e 
cfl-eftually than before. To this Purpofe, as I 
had planced Trees, ( or rather thruft in Scakes, 
which in Time all grew up to be Trees ) for fome 
good Diftince before the Entrance into my Apart- 
ment i they went on in the fame Manner, and fil- 
led 



[ ^7 ] 

led up the reft of that whole Space of Groundi 
from the Trees I had fet, quite down to the Side 
of the Creekj where, as I faid. Handed my Floats, 
and even in the very Ooze where the Tide flow'd, 
not fo much as leaving any Place to land, or any 
Sign that there had been any Landing therea- 
bout. Thefe Stakes alfo, being of a Wood very 
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they 
took Care to have generally very much larger 
and taller than thofe which I had planted ,* and 
as they grew apace, fo they planted them fo ve- . 
ry thick and clofe together, that when they had 
been three or four Years grown, '-there was no 
piercing with the Eye any confiderable Way into 
the Plantation. And as for that Part which I 
had pianted, the Trees were grown as thick as a 
Man's Thigh ,* and among them they placed fo/} 
many other fliort ones, and fo thick, that, in a > 
Word, it flood like a Pallifado, a Qiiarierofa 
Mile thick, and it was next to impoffible to pene- 
trate it, but with a little Army to cut it all down; 
for a little Dbg could hatdly get between the; 
Trees, they flood fo clofe. 

But this was not all, for they did the fame byl 
all the Ground to the right Hand, and to then 
Left, and round even to the Top of the Hill 5^ 
leaving no Way, not fo much as for themfeives 
to come out, but by the Ladder placed up to the 
Side of the Hill, and then litied up, and placed 
again from the firft Stage up to the Top ; which 
Ladder, when it was taken down, noching but 
what had Wings or Witchcraft to alTift it, could 
come at them. 

This was excellently well contriv'd ; nor was 

it lefs than what they afterwards found Occa- 

Hon for, which ferv'd to convince me, that at 

human Prudence has the Authority of Provi- 

F 2 denc« 



[68 ] 

dehcc to jullify ft, fo it has, doubtlefs, the Dl- 
redtidn of Providence to fee it to Work j and 
would we lifteii Garefully to the Voice of it, 1 
am ftilly perfwaded we might prevent many of 
the Difaflers, which our Lives are now by our 
own Negligence, fubjeded to. But this by the 
Way. .. , 

I return to the Story. They lived two Years 
after this in perfect Recirement^ and had no 
more Vifics from the Savages : They had, indeed, . 
an Alarm given.them one Morning which put them 
into a. great Gonftematipn ; for fome of the Sfa- 
wArds beiog out early one Morning on the Weft- 
Side, or rather the End of the Ifland, which, by . 
the V/ay, was that End vyhere 1 never went, for 
fear of being difcovered, they were furprized with 
foing^ above tw^atyX:anpes oilridiari, juft coming 
on Shore. .^^ .': : - -,' 

They made .the beft of their Way Home, in. 
Hurry enough ^ and : giving the Alarm to their 
Comrades, they kept clofe all that Day and the 
n^xt, going out only ^t Night, to make Obfer- 
vation : But they had the good Luck to be mi- 
ftaHen-j for, whetever the Savages went, they did 
n^t \md at th^t .Time in the llland, but purfued 
fpme other DQiigtf. ' 

, Anclnow they, had another Broil with the three 
Eng^jjh, Men ; one of which, a mofl turbulent Fel- 
low, being in a Rage atone of the three Slaves, 
which 1 had inentioned they had taken, becaufe 
the Fellow had not done fomething right which 
hb bid him do, and Teemed a little untradable 
in his fiiewing him, drew a Hatcliet out of a 
Frog-Belt, in ^vhich he wrote it by his Side, and 
fell upon the poor Savage, not to corred him, buE 
tQ kill him* One of the Spaniards, who was by, 
feeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut with 

the 



. [ ^9 ] 

the Hatchet, which he aimed at his Head, bu| 
ftriick into his Shoulder, fo that he thougnt hq 
had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran to him, 
and entreated him not to murder the poor Man, 
clapt in between him and the Savage, to prevent- 
the Mifchief. 

The Fellow being enraged the more at this, 
flruck at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and 
fwore he would ferve him as he intended to Terve 
the Savage j which the vS/J^^/^/'/^r^ perceiving, avoi- 
ded the Blow ; and with a Shovel which he had 
in his Hand, (for they were all working in thp 
Field about their Corn-Land ) knocked the Brute 
down. Another of the E-ngliJh Men running at 
the fame Time to help his Comrade, knock'd th^ 
Spaniard down ; and then two Spaniards more came 
in to help their Man, and a third Er^gUJI) Man fell 
in upon them. They had none of them any Fire- 
Arms, or then other Weapons but Hatchets and 
other Tools, except this third Englijh Manj he 
had one of my old rufly Cutlaffes, with which he: 
made at the two laft Spaniards, and wounded them 
both. This Fray fet the whole Family in an Up" 
roar, and more Help coming in, they took the 
three EngUfi Men Prifoners. The next Queftion 
was. What fhould be done with them, they had 
been fo often mutinous, and were fo furious, fo 
defperate, and fo idle withal, that they knew 
not what Courfe to take with them ; for they 
were mifchevous to the highcfl: Degree, and va- 
lued not what Hurt they did to any Man ', fo 
that, in fhort, it was not fafe to live witii them. 

The Spaniard, who was Governor, told them 
in fo many Words, That if they had been of his 
own Country, he would have hang^'d them ', for 
^11 Laws and all Governours were to preferve So- 
ciety ; and thofe who were dangerous to the Sc- 
F 3 ciety.

ciety, ought to be expelled out of it ; but as they 
were EngUjh Men, and that it was to the gene-? 
rous Kindnefs of an EnglifJo Man that they all ow'd 
their Prefervation and Deiiverance, he would ufe 
them with all poffible Lenity, and would leave 
them to the Judgment of the other two Englijh 
Men, who were their Countrymen. 

One of the two honed Englifh Men flood up, 
and (aid, they defir^'d it might not be leir to them ; 
for fays he, 1 am fure we ought to fentence tliem to 
the Gallows j and with that gives an Account how 
7^7//. Atkinsy one of the three, had propofed to 
have all the five Englijh Men join together, and 
murder all the Spaniards when they were m their 
Sleep. 

When the Spaniard Governor heard this, he calls 
to William Atkins ^ How, Seignior Atkins ^ fays he, 
would you murder us all ? What have you to fay 
to that : That hardned Villain was fo far troiri 
denying it, that he faid it was true, and G— d 
d— n him i£ they would not do it ftill before they 
had done with them. Well, but Seignior ^^^/wj, 
fays the Spaniard^ What have we doPie to you, 
that you would kill us? And what would you 
get by killing us ? And what mufl we do to pre- 
vent your killing us? Muft we kill you, or you 
will kill us ? Why will you put us to the Necef- 
fity of this. Seignior Atkins, fays the Spaniard very 
calmly and fmilin:^? 

Seignior Atkins was in fiich a Rage at the Spa- 
niard's makirig a Jeft of it, that had he not been 
he'd by chree Men, and withal had no Weapons 
with hi.Ti, it was thought he would have attemp- 
ted to havekiil'd the Spaniard in the Middle of all 
the Company, 

This hair-brain 'd Carriage obliged them to con- 
fider fcrioufly what was to be dene. The r^vo 



r 71 ] 

EngUJh Men and the Spaniard who fav*d the poor- 
Savage, was of the Opinion, they fhould hang one 
of the three for an Example, to the reft, and that, 
particularly, it Ihoald be he that had twice at- 
tempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet v 
and indeed there was fome Reafon to believe he 
had done it, for the poor Savage was in fuch a 
miferable Condition with the Wound he had re- 
ceived, that it was thought he could not live. 

But the Governor Spaniard ftiil faid No, it was 
an Engltfh Man that had favM all their Lives, and 
he would never confent to put an Englifi Man to 
Death, tho' he had murdered Half of them , nay, 
he faid, if he had been kill'd himfdf by an Engl ip- 
Man, and had time left to fpeak, it fliould be, 
that they would pardon him. 

This was fo poiitively infifted on by the Go- 
vernor Spaniard^ that there was no gainfaying it ; 
and as merciful Counfels are moft apt to picvail. 
where they are fo earneftly prefs^d, {o they all 
came into it ; but then it was to be coniidered, 
what fliould be done to keep them from doing the 
Mifchief they defignM ; for all agreed, Goi-ernor 
and all, that Means were to be ukd for prefer ving 
the Society from Danger ; after a long Debate it 
was agreed, Firft, That they fliould be difarmed, 
and not permitted to have either Gun, or Powder 
or Shot, or Sword, or any Weapon, and fhould 
be turned out of the Society, and left to \iv^ 
where they would, and how they would, by them- 
felves •, but that none of the reft, either Spaniards 
or Engliflo^ fhould converfe with them, fpeak with 
them, or have any Thing to do v^ith them ; that 
they fhould be forbid to come v/ithin a certain 
Diftance of the Place where the reft dwelt ; and 
|:hat if they offered to commit any Diforder, fo as 
to fpoil, burn, kill, or deftroy any of the Corn, 
F 4 Plant- 



[72-3 

Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging 
to the Society, they Ihould dye without Mercy, 
and they would flioOt them wherever they could 
find them. 

The Governour, a Man of great Humanity 
mufing upon the Sentence, confider'd a little up- 
on it, and turning to the two honed EnglijJo Man, 
faid. Hold, you mull: refled, that it will be long 
e'er they can raife Corn aiid Cattle oF their owd, 
and they muft not flarve : We mufl: therefore al- 
ioW them Proviiions; fo he caused to be added. 
That they fhould have a Proportion of Corn gi- 
ven them 10 lafl: them eight Months, ar.d for Seed 
to fow, by which Time they might be fuppos'd 
to raife lome of their own ; that they Oiould have 
fix Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and fix Kids 
given them, as well for prefeni Subflftence, as for 
a Store; and that they fhouid have TooL given 
them for their Work in the Fields ; fuch as, fix 
Hatchets, an Axe, a Saw, and the like : But they 
{hould have none of thefe Tools, or Provifions, 
unlefs they wou d fwear folemnly, that tiiey 
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with 
them, or of their Fellow Engljjh Man 

Thus they difmifs'd them the Society, and 
turn'd them out to fiirft for themfelves. They 
went away fuUen and refraftory, as neither con- 
tented to go away, or to flay ; but, as there was 
no Remedy, they went, pretending, to go and 
chufe a Place where they would fettle themfelves 
to plant and live by themfelves, and fome Provi- 
{ions were given them, but no Weapons. 
' About four or five Days after, they came a- 
rain for fome Viduals, and gave the Governour 
tn /Account where they had pitched their Tents, 
and mark'd themfelves out an Habitation and 
l^lantiitfon ; and it was a very convenient Place 

- * indeed^ 



[7?] 



indeed, on the remoteft Part of the Ifland, N. E, 
much about the Place wiiere I landed in my firfi: 
Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord 
knows whether, in my Attempt to furround the 
Ifland. 

Here they built themfelves two handfome 
Huts, and contriv'd them, in a Manner, Jike my 
firfl: Habitation, being clofe under the Side of a 
Hill, having fome Trees growing already on 
three Sides of it, fo that by planting others it 
would be very eafily cover'd trom the Sigiit, un- 
lefs narrowly fearch'd for ; they defir'd fome dry'd 
Goats-skins for Beds and Covering, which were 
given them ,* and upon giving their Words, that 
they would not difiurb the reft, or injure any of 
their Plantations, they gave them Hatchets and 
what other Tools they could fpare, fome Peas, 
Barley, and Rice, for lowing, and, in a Word, 
any Thing they wanted, but Arms and Ammuni- 
tion. 

They liv'd in thisfeparate Condition about fix 
Months, and had gotten in their Harveft, tho* 
the Quantity was but fmail, the Parcel of Land 
they had planted being but little , for indeed, ha- 
ving all their Plantation to form, they had a 
great deal of Work upon their Hands : And when 
they came to make Boards, and Pots, and fuch 
Things, they were quite out of their Element, 
and could make nothmg of it; and when the rainy 
Seafon came on, for want of a Cave in the Earth, 
they could not keep their Grain dry, and it was 
in great Danger of fpoiling : And this humbled 
them much j fo they came and begg'd the Spmi- 
ards to help them, which they very readily didj 
and in four Days worked a great Hole in the Side 
of the Hill for them, big enough to fecure their 
Command other Things ftom the Rain; but it; 

was 



[74] 

was but a poor Place, at beft, compar'd to mine ; 
and efpecially as mine was then, for the Spaniards 
had greatly enlarged it, and made feveral new- 
Apartments in it. 

About three Qiiarters of a Year after this Sepa- 
ration, a new Frolick took thefe Ro^^ues, which, 
together with the former Villainy they had com- 
mitted, brought Miiciiief enough upon them, and 
had very near been the Ruin of the whole Colo- 
ny : The three new Sociates began, itfeems, to be 
weary of the laborious Life tlicy \Qd^ and that 
without Hope of bettering their Circumftances ; 
and a Whim took them, that they would make 
a Voyaf^e to the Continent from whence the Sa- 
vages came, and would try ii they could not 
feize upon fome Prifoners among the Natives 
there, and bring them Home, fo to make them 
do the laborious Part of their Work for them. 

TiicProjed was not fo prepofterous, i'iX.hQy had 
gone no farther i but they did nothing, and pro- 
posed nothing, but had either Mifchief in the De- 
'fign, or Mifchief in the Event: And if I may give 
my Opinion, they feem'd to be under a Blalt from 
Heaven ; for if we will not allow a vifible Curfe to 
purfue vifible Crimes, how fliall we reconcile the 
Events of Things with the Divine Juflice ? It was 
certainly an apparent Vengeance on their Crime 
of Mutiny and Pyracy, that brought them to the 
State they were in i and as they fhew'd not the 
iealb Remorfe for the Crime, but added new Vil- 
jainies to it, fuch as, particularly, the Piece of 
nionflrous Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave, be- 
caufe he did not, or perhaps could not, under- 
ftand to do what he was direded ; and to wound 
him in fuch a Manner, as, no Qi_ieftion, made 
him a Cripple all his Life ; and in a Place where 
no Surgeon cr Medicine could be liad for his Cure ; 

and 



[75] 

and what was flill worfe, the murderous Intent^ 
or, to do Juflice to the Crime, the intentional 
Murder, for fuch, to be fare it was, as was af- 
terwards the formed Defign they all laid, to mur- 
der the Spaniards in cold Blood, and in their 
Sleep. 

But I leave obferving, and return to the Story. 
The three Fellows come down to the Spaniards 
one Morning, and in very humble Terms defi r'd 
to be admitied to Ijpcak with them ; The Spani" 
(irds very readily heard what they had to fay, 
which was chis, That they were tir'd of living 
in the Manner they did ; that they were not handy 
enough lo make the Neceflaries they wanteds 
and that having no Help, they found they Ihould 
be ihu'v'd : Buc if the Spaniards would give them 
Leave to take one of the Canoes which they came 
over in, and gi\c them Arms and Ammunition, 
proporcion'd for their Defence, they would go 
over to the Main, and leek their Fortune, and fo 
deliver them froni the Trouble of fupplying them 
with any o? her Provifions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them, but yet very iioncftly reprefented to them 
the certain Definition tney were running into ; 
told them they had fnfi-er'd fuch HarJfhips up- 
on that very Spot, that they could, without any 
Spirit of Prophefy, tell them, that they would 
be ll;arv'd, or be murder'd, and bad them confi- 
der of it. 

The Men reply'd audacioufly, they fhould be 
ftarv'd if they flay'd here, for they could not 
work, and v/ould not v^-ork ; and they could bur be 
fiarv'd Abroad; and if they were murder'd, there 
was an End of them, they had no Wives or Chil- 
dren to cry after them ; and in fhort, infiiled im- 
portunately upon their Demand, declaring, that 

they 



C7^] 

they would go, whether they would give them any 
Arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great Kindnefs,' 
that if they were refolv'd to go, they fhould 
not go like naked Men, and be in no Conditi- 
on to defend themfelves ; and that tho"* they could 
ill fpare their Fire-Aims, having not enough for 
themfelves, yet they would let them have two 
Muskets, a Piftol, and a Cutlafs, and each Man 
a Hatchet, which they thought was fufficient for 
them. 

In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having 
baked them Bread enough to ferve them a Month, 
and given them as much Goats-Fiefli as they 
could' eat while it was fweeti, and a great Basket 
full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of trefli Water, 
^nd a young Kid alive to kill, they boldly fet out 
in a Canoe for a Voyage over %hc Sea, where it 
was at leall 40 Miles broad. 

The Boat was incieed a large one, and would 
h^ve very well carry 'd fifteen or twenty Men ; 
and, therefore, v/as rather too big for them to 
manage : But as they had a fair Breeze, and the 
Flood-Tide with them, they did well enough ; 
They had m.ade a Mad of a long Pole, and a Sail 
of four large Goat-Skins dry'd, which they had 
fow'd or lac'd together ; and away they went mer- 
rily enough ; the Spaniards call'd after them, 
J^on Vejap^ ; and no Man ever thought of feeing 
them any more. 

T\\cSpaniardsvjo\Ad often fay to one another,and 
the two honeft Enghjh Men who remain'dbehind<j 
how quietly and comfortably they liv'd now thof<? 
three turbulent Fellows were gone ', as for their 
ever coming again, that was the remotefl Thing 
from their Thoughts that could be imagin'd ; 
when behold, after two and twenty Days Abfence, 

oiiq 



[77] 

one of the EngUfh Men being abroad upon his 
Planting- Work, k'cs three flrange Men coming to- 
wards him at a Diftance, with Guns upon their 
Shoulders. 

Away runs the EngUflo Man, as i^ he was be- 
witched, comes frighted and amaz'd to the Go- 
vernour Sfainard, and tells him they were all un- 
done, for there were Strangers landed upon the I- 
fland, he could not tell who. The Spaniard, pau- 
ling a while, fays he to him. How do you mean, 
you cannot tell who ? They are the Savages to be 
fure. No, no, fays the Engiijh Man, they are Men 
in Clothes, with Arms : Nay, then, fays the Spani^ 
ard, V/hy are you concern'd > If they are noc Sa- 
vages, they muft be Friends, for there is no Chri- 
ftian Nation upon Earth, but will do us Good ra- 
ther than Harm. 

While they were debating thus, comes the 
three Engiijh Men, and landing without the 
Wood, wnich was new planted, halloo'd to them ; 
they prefentiy knew their Voices, and fo all the 
Wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now the Ad- 
miration was turn'd upon another Qiicftion, (viz..) 
What could be the Matter, and what made them 
come back again ? 

It was long before they brought the Men 
in, and enquiring where they had been, and v/hat 
they had been doing, they gave them a full Ac- 
count of tiieir Voyage in a few Words, (viz..) That 
they reached the Land in two Days, or fomething 
lefs, but finding the People alarm'd at their com- 
ing, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to fight 
them, they durfc not go on Shore, but faii'd on to 
the Northward lix or feven Hours, till they came 
to a great Opening, by which they perceived, 
that tne Land they faw from our Iliand was not 
the Main, but an liland ; that entring that Opening- 

of 



[78] 



of the Sea, they faw another KLind on the Righf 
Hand Nor in, and fcverai more Weft ; and being 
refolvM to land fomewhcre, they put over to one 
of the Iflands whicn Jay Weft, and went boldly 
on Shore ; that they found the People very cour- 
teous and friendly to them, and that they gave 
them feveral Roots, and fome dry'd FiQi, and ap- 
pear'd very fociable ; and the Women, as well as 
the Men, were very forward to fupply them with 
any thing they could get for them to eat, and 
brought it to rhfm a great Way upon their Heads. 

They continued here four Days, and enquired, 
as well as they could of them by Signs, what Na- 
tions were this Way and that Way; and were told 
of feveral fierce and terrible People that liv'd al- 
moft every Way, who, as they made Signs to. 
them, ufed to eat Men. But as for themfelves,. 
they faid, that they never eat Men or Women, ex- 
cept only fuch as they took in the W^ars, and then 
they own'd that they made a great Feaft, and eat 
their Prifoners. 

The Englijh Men enquired when they had a Feaft 
of that Kmd, and they told him about two Moons 
ago, pointing to the Moon, and then to two Fin- 
gers ; and that their great King had two hundred^ 
Prifoners now, which he had taken in his War ; 
and they were feeding them to make them fat for 
the next Feaft. The Engiifl? Men feem'd mighty 
defirous to fee thofe Prifoners, but the other mi- 
ftaking them, thought they wxre deftrous to have 
fome of them to carry away for their own eating. 
So they beckon'd to them, pointing to the fetting 
of the Sun, and then to the riling, which was to 
fignify, that the next Morning at Sun-rifing they 
would bring Ibme for them \ and accordingly the 
next Morning they brought down five Women 
a :d eleven Men, and gave them to the EngUJJj Men, 



[79] 

to carry with them on their Voyage, Juft as wc 
would bring fo many Cows and Oxen down to a 
Sea-Port Town, to vi<5cual a Ship. 

As brutifh and barbarous as thefe Fellows were 
at Home, their Stomachs turn a at this Sight, and 
they did not know what to do ; to refufe the Pri- 
foners, would have been the highefl Atfront to 
the favage Gentry that offered them ; and what to 
do with them they knew not. However, upon fome 
Debates, they refolv'd to accept of them, and in Re- 
turn they gave the Savages that brought them one 
of their Hatchers, an old Key, a Knife, and (ix 
or feven of their Bullets, which, tho' they did not 
iinderftand, they feem'd extremely pleased with : 
And then tying the poor Creatures Hands behind 
them, they (the People; dragg'd the poor Prifo*" 
nets into the Boat for our Men, 

The Englijh Men were oblig'd to come away as 
foon as they had them, or elfe they that gave them 
this noble Prefent would certainly have expeded 
that they fhould have gone to work with them, 
have kiird two or three of them the next Morning, 
and perhaps have invited the Donors to Dinner. 

But having taken their Leave with all the Re- 
fpefts and Thanks that could well pafs between 
People, where on either Side they underftood not 
one Word they could fay, they put off with their 
Boat, and came back towards thefiril Ifland, where, 
Wnen they arrived, they fet eight of their Prifo- 
hers at Liberty, there being too many of them for 
their Occafion. 

Li their Voyage, theyendeavour'd tohavefome 
Communication with their Prifoners, but it was 
impOiTible to make them unuerftand any Thing •, 
nothing they couid fay to them, or give them, 
or do for them, but was lookM upon as going a- 
bout to murder them. They firit of all unbound 

them 



[ 8o ] 

them, but the poor Creatures skream'd at that, d- 
fpeciaily the Women, as if they had jiifl felt the 
Knife at their Throats; for they immediately con- 
cluded they were unbound on purpofe to be kili'd. 

If they gave them CLuy Thing to eat, it was the 
fame Thmg ; then they concluded it was for fear 
they ftiould link in Flefli, and fo not be fat enough 
to kill. If they look'd at one of them more parti- 
cularly, the Parry prefently concluded, it was to 
fee whether he or (he was fatteil and fittefl to kill. 
Nay, after they had brought them quite over, 
and began to ufe them kindly, and treat them 
well, ftili they expe(5ted every Day to make a Din- 
ner or Supper for their new Mafters. 

When the three Wanderers had giveh this un-' 
accountable Hiftory, or Journal of their Voyage 
the Spaniard ask'd them, Where their new Family 
was ? And being told that they had brought themi 
on Shore, and put them into one of their Huts, 
and were come up to beg fome Viduals for them ; 
they (the Spaniards) and the other two EngUjh Men 
that is to fay, the who'e Colony, refolv'd to go 
all down to the Piace and fee them, and did fo,and 
Friday's Father with them. 

When they came into the Hut, there they fat all 
bound j for when they had brought them on Shore, 
they bound their Hands that they might not take 
the Boat and make their Efcape. There, I fay^ 
they far, all oF them ftark naked. Firfi, There 
were three Men, hifty comely Fellows, well 
Ihap'd, ftrait and fair Limbs, about thirty to thir- 
ty rive Years of Age ; and five Women, whereof 
two might be from thirty to forty, two more not 
above four or five and twenty, and the fifth, a 
tall comely Maiden about fixteen or feventeen. 
The Women were well favoured agreeable Perfons, 
both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and 



[8i] 



two of them, had they been pcrfed White, would 
have pafsM for very handfome Womerj even in 
London itfelf, having pleafant agreeable Counte- 
nances, and of a very modefl Behaviour, efpecially 
when they came afterwards to be cloth'd, and 
drefs'd, as they call'd it, tho' the Drefs was very 
indifferent, it muft be confefs'd \ of which hereafter. 

The Sight, you may be fare, was fomething 
uncouth to ouv Spaniards, who were (to givQ them 
a juft Charafterj Men of the beli Behaviour, of 
the moft calm, fedate Tempers, and perfed Good- 
humour that ever I met with, and in particular, 
of the mofl Modefly, as will prefently appear : 
I fay, the Sight was very uncoutfi, to fee two na- 
ked Men and five naked Women, all together 
bound, and in the moft miferable Circumftances 
that Human Nature could be fiippos'd to be, viz, 
to be expeding every Moment to be dragged our, 
and have their Brains knock'd out, and then to be 
eaten up like a Calf that is kilfd for a Dainty. 

The firft Thing they did, was to caufetheold 
Indian, Frida/s Father, to go in and feeiiril, if he 
knew any of them, and then-tf4ie underfloodany 
of their Speech. As foon as the old Man came in, 
he look*d ferioufly at them, but knew none of 
them ; neither could any of them underfland a 
Word he faid, or a Sign he could make, except 
one of the Women. 

However, this was enough to anfwer the End,' 
which was, to fatisfy them, that the Men into 
whofe Hands they were fallen, were Chriflians; 
that they abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and 
that they might be fure they would not be kilKd. 
As foon as they were afllir'd of this, they difco- 
vcr'd fuch Joy, and by fuch aukward, and feve- 
ral Ways, as is hard to defcribe ; for it feems 
they were oi fevcral Nations. 

Part II. G Tb€ 



[8i] 



The Vv^omaiij who v/as their Interpreter, wii 
hid in the next Place to ask them, if they were 
willing to be Servants, and to work for the MetJ 
who had brought them away, to fave their Lives; 
at which they all fell a Dancing •, and prefently 
one fell to taking up this, and another that, or any 
Thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders> 
to intimate that they were willing to work. 

The Governoiir, who found, that the having 
Women among them would prefently be attended 
with fome Inconvenience, and might occafion 
fome Strife, and perhaps Blood; ask'd the three 
Men, what they intended to do with thefe Wo- 
men, and how they intended to ufe them ; whe- 
ther as Servants, or as Women ; One of the Eng- 
lijJ) Men anfwer'd very boldly and readily. That 
they would uk them as both. To which the Go* 
pernor faid, I am not going to reflrain you from 
it, you are your own Maflers as to that : But 
this 1 think h but j.ufl:, for avoiding Diforders and 
Quarrels amongfl you; and I defire it of you, for 
that Reafon only, i//z,. That you will all engage, 
that if any of you take any of ihefe Women, as 
a Woman or Wife, that he fhall take but one ; 
and that having taking taken one, none d^Q /hould 
touch her ; for tho^ we cannot marry any of you, 
yet 'tis but reafonable, that while you Itay here, 
the Woman any of you takes, fhould bemaintain'd 
by the Man that takes her, and fliould be his Wife ; 
I mean, fays he, while he continues here, and 
that none elfe fiiall have any Thing to do with 
her: All this appear a fo juft, that every onea- 
greed to it without any DifEculty. 

Then che£;;^/;j/^Mcn ask^'d the Spaniards y if they 
defign'd to take any of them ? But every one of 
them anfwer'd, NO: Some of them faid, they 
h^d Wives in S^aiu, and the otliers did not like 

Womea 



Women that'vuere not Chriftians ; and all toge* 
ther declar'd, that they would not touch one of 
them 'y which was an Inftance of fuch Virtue as I 
have not met w^ith in all my Travels. On the 
other Hand, to be (hort, the five Englijh Men took 
them every one a Wife, that is to fay, a tem- 
porary Wife,- and fo they fee up a new Form of 
Living ; for the Spaniards and Fridays Father 
liv'd in my old Habitation, which they had en- 
larged exceedingly within. The three Servants 
which were taken in the late Battle of the Sava- 
ges, liv'd with them,* and thefe carryM on the 
main Part of the Colony, fupplying all the reft 
with Food, and afTifling them in any Thing as 
they could, or as they found Neceffity re- 
quired. 

But the Wonder of this Story was, how five 
fuch refradory, ill-match'd Fellows fhould agree 
about thefe Women, and that two of them fhould 
not pitch upon the fame Women, efpecially fee- 
ing two or three of them were, without Compa- 
rifoB, more agreeable than the other : But they 
took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling 
among themfelves i for they fet the five Women 
by themfelves in one of their Huts, and they 
went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots among 
them, who fhouldchufe firft. 

He that drew to chufe firft, went away by him- 
felf to the Hut where the poor naked Creatures 
were, and fetched out her he chofe ; and it was 
worth obferving, that he that chofe firft took her 
that was reckoned the homeliefi:, and the oldefl o£ 
the five, which made Mirth enough among the refl ; 
and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it : But the Fel- 
low confider'd better than any of them, that it 
was Application and Bufinefsthat they were to ex- 

G z psft 



[ HI 

ped Afliflance in, as much as any Thing elfe ; arid 
fhe proved the beft Wife of all the Parcel. 

When the poor Women law themfelves fet in 
a Row thus, and fetched out one by one, the Ter- 
rors of their Condirion returned upon them again, 
and they firmly believed- that they were now a go- 
ing to be devoured ; accordingly when the £«^- 
lijh Sailor came in, and fetched out one of them, 
the reft fet up a moft lamentable Cry, and hung a- 
bout her, and took their Leave of her with fuch 
Agonies and fuch Affection, as would have grie- 
ved the hardeft Heart in the World ; nor was k 
poiTible for the Englifi? Men to fatisfy them, than 
they were not to be immediately murdered, 'till 
they fetched the old Mslu, Friday's Father, whoi-m- 
mediatcly let them know that the five Men, who 
had fetched them out one by one, had chofen 'em 
for their Wives. 

When they had done, ?r.d the Fright the Wo- 
men were in u^.s a little over, the Men weat to 
Work, and the Spaniards came and helped them y 
and in a few Hoars they had built ihem everyone 
ane^'V Hut, or rerr, for their Lodging apart j for 
thofe they had already v/ere crowded with their 
Tools, HcuiAold-Stuff and Provifion. The three 
wicked Ones had pitched fartheft off, and the two 
honeft Ones nearer, but both on the North Shore 
of the Uland, fo that they continued feparate as 
before. And thus my liland v.as peopled in three 
Places ; and, as I might fay, three Towns were 
begun to be planted. 

And here 'tis very well worth obferving, That 
as it often happens in the Wor ^^ (what the wife 
Ends of God's Prcvidcnce are in luch aDifpofition 
o^ Things, I cannot fay ) the two honeft Fellows 
had the two worft Wives, and t le three Repro- 
bates, that were fcarce worth hanging, that were 

fit 



C 85 ] 

fit for nothing, neither Teemed born to do them- 
felves Good, or any one elfe, had three clever, di- 
ligent, careful, and ingenious Wives ; not that the 
two firft were ill Wives as to their Temper or 
Humour ; for all the five were mo/l willing, quiet, 
paflive, and fubjeded Creatures, rather like Slaves 
than Wives j but my Meaning isy they were not 
alike capable, ingenious, or induftrious, or alike 
cleanly and neat. 

Another Obfervation I mufl make, to the Ho- 
nour of a diligent Application on one Hand, and 
to the Difgrace of a llothful, negligent, idle Tem- 
per, on the other, that when I came to the Place, 
and viewed the feveral Improvements, Plantings,' 
and Managementof the feveral. little Colonies, the 
two Men had fo far out-gone the three, that there 
was no Comparifon. They had indeed both of 
them as much Ground laid out. for Corn as they 
wanted; and the Reafon wa^, becaufe, according 
to my Rule, Nature didated, that it was to no 
Purpofe to fow more Corn than they wanted, but 
the Dilference of the Cultivation, of the Planting, 
of the Fences, and indeed of every thing elfe was 
eafy to be feen at firft View. 

The two Men had innumerable young Trees 
planted about their Huts, that when you came 
to the Place, nothing was to be feen but a Wood, 
and tho* th.ey had twice had their Plantations de- 
molifh'd, once by their own Countrymen, and 
once by the Enemy, as (hall be (hewn in its Place ; 
yet they had reftored all again, and every Thing 
was thriving and flourishing about them ; they 
had Grapes planted in Order, and managed like 
a Vineyard, tho' they had themfelves never feen 
any thing of that Kind ; and by their good ordc- 
riiig their Vines, their Grapes were as good again 
aiS apy of the others. They had alfo found them- 
G 3 fdve 



[8.5] 

fekcs out a Retreat in the thickefl: Part of the 
Woods, where, though there was not a natural 
Cave, as 1 had found, yet they made one with 
incefl'ant Labour of their Hands, and where when 
the Mifchief which followed happened, they fe- 
cured their Wives and Children, fo as they could 
never be found j they having by flicking innu- 
merable Stakes and Poles of the V/ood, which, as 
I faid, grew fo eafily, made the Wood unpaflable, 
except in fome Places, where they climbed up tp 
get over the out-fide Part, and then went on by 
Ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three Reprobates, as I juflly call 
them, the' they were much civilized by their new 
Settlement, compar'd to what they were before, 
and were not fo quarreifom, having not the fame 
Opportunity ; yet one of the certain Companions 
of a profligate Mind never left them, and that 
was their Idlenefs. It is true, they planted Corn, 
and made Fences ; but Solomon's Words were ne- 
ver better verified than in them. / v^ent by the Vine- 
yard of the Slothful, and it v^as all over-groivjt with 
'Thorm ; for when the Spaniards came to view their 
Crop, they could not fee it in fome Places for 
Weeds. The Hedge had feveral Gaps in it, where 
the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up the 
Corn ; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bufh was 
cramm'd in, to flop them out for the prefent, 
but it was only Ihutting the Stable Door after the 
Stead was floln. Whereas, when they looked on 
the Colony of the other two, there was the ve- 
ry Face of Induflry and Succefs upon all they 
did ; there was not a Weed to be feen in all their 
Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges : And 
they on the other Hand verified Solomons Words iri 
another Place. T'hat the diligent Hand maketh rich ; 
for every Thing grew and thrived, and they had 

Plenty 



[ S7 ] 

Plenty within and without ; they had more tame 
Cattle than the other, more Utenfiis and Nccef- 
•faries within Doors, and yet more Pieafure and 
Diverfion too. 

It is true, the Wives of the three were very 
handy and cleanly within Doors, and having lear- 
ned the EngliJ/^ Ways oi Dreffing and Cooking frona 
one of the other Engltjh M^n, who, as 1 faid, 
was CcokVmate on board the Ship, they drefl'ed 
their Husbands Viduals very nicely and well ,- 
whereas the other could not be brought to under- 
hand it. But then the Husband, who, as I fay, 
. had been Cook^s-mate, did it himfelf i but as for 
the Husbands of the three Wives, they loicer'd a- 
bout, fetch 'd Turtles Eggs, and caught Fifn and 
Birds : In a Word, any thing bat Labour, and 
they far'd accordingly. The Diligent iiv'd well 
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and 
beggarly ^ and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it 
is all over the W^orld. 

But now I come to a Scene diiferent from all 
.that had happened before, either to them, or to 
fne ; and the Original of the Story was this. , 

Early one Morning there came on Shore 
^ve or fix Canoes of Indiaus, or Savages, call 
them which you pleafe j and there is no Room 
to doubt that they came upon the old Errand of 
feeding upon their Slaves : But that Part was 
now fo familiar to the Spaniards, and to our 
Ivlen too, that they did not concern themfelves 
about it, as 1 did ; but having been made fcnCi- 
ble by their Experience, that their only BviCi- 
nefs was to lye concealed, and that if they were 
not feen by any of the Savages, they would go 
off again quietly when their, Bu/inefs was done, 
having as yet not the leaft Notion of there 
G ^ being 



[ 88] 



being any Inhabitants in the Ifland ; I fay, ha- 
ving been made Tenfible of this, they had no- 
thing to do but to givii Notice to all the three 
Plantations, to keep within Doors, and not fhew 
themfelves, only placing a Scout in a proper 
Place, to give Notice when the Boats went to Sea 
again. 

This was without doubt very right ; but a 
Difafter fpoil'd all thefe Meafures, and made it 
known among the Savages, that there were 
Inhabitants there, which was in the End the Dc- 
folation of almoft the whole Colony ; after the 
Canoes with the Savages were gone oft^ the 
Spaniards peep'd abroad again, and fome of them 
had the Curiofity to go to the Place where they 
had been, to fee what they had been doing : Here, 
to their great Surprize, they found three Sa- 
vages left behind, and lying faft afleep upon the 
Ground; it was fuppos'd, they had' either been 
fo gorg'd with their inhuman Fealf, that, like 
Beafts, they were afleep, and would not flir when 
the others went, or they were wander'd into the 
Woods, and did not come back in time to be taken 
in. 

The Spaniards v/ere greatly furpriz'd at this 
Sight, and perfedly at a Lofs what to do. The 
Spaniard Governour, as it happen^'d, was with 
them, and his Advice was ask'd, but he profcfs'd 
he knew not what to do ; as for Slaves, they had 
enough already ; and as to killing them, they 
were none of them inclined to that. The Spaniard 
Governour told me, they could not think of (hed- 
ding innocent Blood, for as to them, the poor 
Creatures had done them no Wrong, invaded 
none of their Property, and they thought they 
had no jufl Quarrel againfl them, to take away 
theirLivest 

And 



C 89] 



And here I mufl, in Juftice to thefe Spaniards, 
obferve, that let the Accounts of Spanijh Cruelty 
in Mexico and Peru^ be what they will, I never 
met with feventeen Men of any Nation whatfo- 
ever, in any foreign Country, who were fo uni- 
verfally Modeft, Temperate, Virtuous, (o very 
Good-humour'd, and fo Courteous as thefe 'S^^- 
niards ', and as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it 
in their very Nature, no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, 
no outrageous Paflions, and yet all of them Men 
of great Courage and Spirit. 

Their Temper and Calmnefs had appear'd 
in their bearing the unfufferable Ufage of the 
three Englijh Men j and their Juftice and Huma- 
nity appear'd now in the Cafe of the Savages, 
as above. After fome Confultation, they re- 
folv'd upon this, that they would lye ftill a 
while longer, 'till, ii pofTible, thefe three Men 
might be gone ; but then the Governour Spaniard 
recollefted, that the three Savages had no Boat, 
and that if they were left to rove about the Ifland, 
they would certainly difcover that there were 
Inhabitants in it, and fo they fhould be undone 
that Way. 

Upon this, they went back again, and there 
lay the Fellows faft afleep flill ; fo they refolv'd 
to waken them, and take them Prifoners, and 
they did fo. The poor Fellows were ftrangely 
frighted when they were feiz'd upon and bound, 
and afraid, like the Women, that they fhould be 
murder'd and eaten ; for it feems thofe People 
think all the World does as they do, eating Mens 
Flefh ; but they were foon made eafy as to that, 
and away they carry 'd them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not 
carry them Home to their Caftle, I mean to my 
Palace under the Hill j but they carry 'd them 

firft 



[90] 

iirft to the Bower, where was the chief of their 
iCountry-work, fuch as the keeping the Goats, 
the planting the Corn, &c, and afterwards, they 
carry'd them to the Habitation of the two En- 
glijh Men. 

Here they were fet to Work, tho* it was not 
much they had for them to do j and whether it 
was by Negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thought the Fellows could not mend themfelves, 
I know not, but one of them run away, and 
taking into the Woods, they could never hear of 
him more. 

They had good Reafon to believe he got Home 
again foon after, in fome other Boats or Canoes 
fii Savages, who came on Shore three or four 
Weeks afterwards,, and who, .carrying on their Re- 
vels as ufual, went off again in two Days time. 
This Thought terrify^ th^m exceedingly ; for 
they conckided, and that not without good 
.Caufe indeed, that if this Fellow came fafe 
Home among his Comrades, he would certainly 
give them an Account, that there were People m 
the Illand, as alfo how few and weak they w^ere ; 
for this Savage, as I obferv'd before, had never 
been told, and it was very iiappy he had not, how 
many there were, or where they \i\''d -, nor had he 
ever feen or heard the Fire of any of their Guns, 
much lefs had they ihewn him any of their other 
retired Places; fuch as the Cave in the Valley, or 
the new Retreat which the two Engltfh Men had 
made, and the like. 

The firft Tefl:imony they had that this Fel- 
low had given Intelligence of them, was, that 
about two Months after this, fix Canoes of Sa- 
vages, with about feven, or eight, or ten Men 
in a Canoe, coming rowing along the North-fide 
of the Illand, where they never ufed to come 

before^ 



1 91 ] 

Ibefore, and landed about an Hour after Sun- 
rife, at a convenient Place, about a Mile from 
the Habitation of the two EngUforMn, where this 
efcap'd Man had been kept. As the Spaniard 
Governour faid, had they been all there, the 
Damage would not have been fo much, for not a 
Man of them would have efcapM ; but the Cafe 
differ'd now very much, for two Men to fifty 
was too much odds : The two Men had the Hapr 
pinefs to difcover them about a League off, fo 
that it was above an Hour before they landed, 
and as they landed a Mile from their Huts, it 
was fome time before they could come at them : 
Now having great Reafon to believe that they 
were betray 'd, the firft Thing they did, was to bind 
the two Slaves which were left, and caufe two 
of the three Men, whom they brought with the 
Women, who it feems proved very faithful to 
them, to lead them with their two Wives, and 
whatever they could carry away with them, to 
their retir'd Place in the Woods? which I have 
fpoken of above, and there to bind the two Fel-; 
lows Hand and Foot 'till they heard farther. 

In the next Place, feeing the Savages were all 
come on Shore, and that they bent their Courfe 
diredly that Way, they opened the Fences where 
their Milch-Goats were kept, and drove them all 
put, leaving their Goats to flraggle into the 
Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Savages- 
might think they were all bred wild ; but the 
Rogue who came with them was too cunning for 
that, and gave them an Account of it all ; for 
they went diredly to the Place. 

When the two poor frighted Men had fecur a 
their Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave 
they had of the three, who came with the Women, 
and who was at their Place by Accident, away to 

the 



[ 90 

the Spaniards, with all Speed, to give them the 
Alarm, and defire fpeedy Help ; and in the meaa 
Time they took their Arms, and what Ammuni- 
tion they had, and retreated towards the Place in 
the Wood, where their ^'wqs were fent, keeping 
at a Diflance, yet fo that they might fee, if pofli- 
ble, which Way the Savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a ri- 
fing Ground, they could fee . the little Army of 
their Enemies come on diredly to their Habita- 
tion, and in a Moment more, could fee all their 
Hurs and Houfhold-Stuff flaming up together, 
to their great Grief and Mortification ; for they 
had a very great Lofs, to them irretrievable, at 
leaii for fome Time. They kept their Station 
for a while, *till they found the Savages, like wild 
Beails, fpread themfelves all-over the Place, rum- 
maging every Way, and every Place they could 
think of, in Search for Prey, and in particular for 
the People, of whom it now plainly appeared they 
had Intelligence. 

The two Englishmen feeing this, thinking them- 
felves not fecure where they flood, becaufe as 
it was likely fome of the wild People might 
come that Way, fo they might come too many 
together, thought it proper to make another Re- 
treat about half a Mile farther, believing as it 
aherwards happen'd, that the farther they flroU'd, 
the fewer would be together. 

The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very 
thick grown Part of the Woods, and where an old 
Trunk of a Tree flood, which was hollow and 
vaftly large j and in this Tree they both took their 
Standing, refolving to fee there what might offer. 
They had not flood there long, but two of the 
Savages appeared running diredly that Way, as if 
they had already had Notice where they flood, 

and 



. [ 93 1 

and were coming up to attack them ; and a little 
Way farther, they fpied three more coming after 
them, and five more beyond them, all coming the 
fame VVayj befides which, they faw kvcn or eight 
more at a Diftance, running another Way ; for ia 
a Word, they ran every Way like Sportfmen beat- 
ing for their Game. 

The poor Men were now in great Perplexity,' 
whether they fhould ftand and keep their Pofture, 
or fly : But after a very Ihort Debate with them- 
felves, they conddered, that if the Savages ranged 
the Country thus before HeJp came, they might 
perhaps find out their Retreat in the Woods, then 
all would be loft j fo they refolved to ftand them 
there : And if they were too many to deal with, 
then they would get up to the Top of the Tree, 
from whence they doubted not to defend them- 
felves. Fire exceptedy as long as their Ammunition 
lafted, tho'all the Savages that were landed, which 
was near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having refolved upon this, they next confidered 
whether they ftiould fire at the firft two, or wait 
for the three, and fo take the middle Party, by 
which the two and the five that followed would be 
feparated ; and they -refolv'd to let the two firft 
pafs by, unlefs they ftiould fpy them in the Tree, 
and come to attack them. The two firft Savages 
alfo confirmed them in this Regulation, by turning 
a Lttle from them towards another Part of the 
Wood ; but the three, and the five after them, 
came forwards directly to the Tree, as if they had 
known the Englifi Men were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftrair towards them, they 
refolved to take them in a Line, as they came ; 
and as they refolved to fire but one at a time, 
perhaps the firft Shot might hit them all three. 
To which Purpofe, the Man who was to fire, put 

three 



[94] 

three or four Bullets into his Piece, and having 
a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken Hole 
in the Tree, he took a fure Aim, without being 
feen, waicii^g till they were within about thirty 
Yards of the Tree, fo that he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and the Sava- 
ges came on, they plainly faw, that one of the 
three was the Run-away Savage that had efcap'd 
from them, and they both knew him diftindtlyj 
and refolv'd that if polTible, he fhould not efcape^ 
tho' they fhould both fire ,* fo the other flood rea- 
dy with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the 
firfl Shot, he fhould be fure to have a fecond. 

But the firfl was too good a Markfman to mifs 
his Aim ; for as the Savages kept near one ano- 
ther, a little behind in a Line, in a Word he iir*d 
and hit two of them diredly : The foremofl was 
kili'd outright, being £hot in the Head: The fe- 
cond, which was the Run-away Indian^ waslhot 
thro' the Body, and fell, but was not quite dead : And 
the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, per- 
haps by the fame Ball that went thro' the Body of 
the fecond, and being dreadfully frighted, tho 
not much hurt, fat down upon the Ground, skream- 
ing and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with 
the Noife than fenfible of the Danger, flood flill 
at firfl i for the V/oods made the found a thoufand 
Times bigger than it really was j the Echo's rat- 
tling from one Side to another, and the Fowls 
riling from all Parts, skreaming and making, 
every Sort, a feveral Kind of Noife, according to 
their Kind, )uft as it was when I fir'd the firfl 
Gun that perhaps was ever fhoc off in that Place 
iince it was an Ifland. 

However, all being filent again, and they not 
knowing what the Matter was, came on uncon- 

cern'd^ 



[95] 

cern'd, *cill they came to the Place where their 
Companions lay in a Condition miferable enough : 
And here the poor ignorant Creatures, not feniibk 
that they were within Reach of the fame Mif- 
chief, flood all of a Huddle over the wounded 
Man, talking, and, as may be fuppos'd, enquiring 
of him, how he came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis 
very rational to believe, told them, that a Flafii of 
Fire firfl:, and immediately after that. Thunder from 
their Gods, had killed two and wounded him :This, 
I fay, is rational ; for nothing is more certain than 
that, as they faw no Men near them, fo they had 
never heard a Gun in all their Lives, or fo much 
as heard of a Gun ; neither knew any Thing of 
killing or wounding, ataDiftance, with Fire and 
Bullets; if they had, one might reafonably be- 
lieve, they would not have flood fo unconcern 'd 
in viewing the Fate of their Fellows, without fome 
Apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two Men, tho^ as they confefs'd to me, it 
griev'd them to be obliged to kill fo many poor 
Creatures, who, at the fame Time had no Notion 
of their Danger; yet having them all thus in 
their Power, and the firfl having loaded his P/ece 
again, refolv d to let fly both together among 
them ; and Angling out, by Agreement, which to 
aim at,theyfhoc together, andkili'd, or very much 
wounded four of them ; the fifth frighted even 
to Death, tho' not hurt, fell with the reft : So that 
our Men feeing them all fall together, thought 
they had kill'd them all. 

The Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made 
our two Men come boldly out from the Tree be- 
fore they had charged their Guns again, which 
was a wrong Step ; and they were under fome 
Surprize when they came to the Place, and found 
no lefs than four of the Men alive, and of them 

two 



C 9^ ] 

two very little hurt, and one not at al] : This o- 
blig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of 
their Muskets ,* and firft they made fure of the 
Run-away Savage, that had been the Caufe of all 
the Mifchief, and of another that was hurt in 
his Knee, and put them out of their Pain ; then 
the Man that was not hurt at all, came and 
kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands 
held up, and made piteous Moans to them by 
Geftures and Signs, for his Life^ but could not 
fay one Word to them that they could under- 
fland. 

However, they fign'd to him to fit down at the 
Foot of a Tree thereby ,* andone of the Englijh 
Men, with a Piece of Rope-Tvvine which he 
had, by great Chance, in his Pocket, ty'd his 
two Feet faft together, and his two Hands be- 
hind him, and there they left-him ; and, with what 
Speed they could, made after the other two, which 
were gone before j fearing they, or any more of 
them, (hould find the Way to their covered Place 
in the Woods, where their Wives, and the few 
Goods they had left, lay. They came once in Sight 
of the two Men, but it was at a great Diftance ; 
however, they had the Satisfaction to fee them 
crofs over a Valley tov/ards the Sea, the quite con- 
trary Way from that which led to their Retreat, 
which they were afraid of; and being fatisfy'd 
with that, they went back to the Tree, where 
they left their Prifoner, who, as they fuppos'd, 
was delivered by his Comrades ; for he was gone, 
and the two Pieces of Rope-Yarn, with which 
they bound him, lay juil at the Foot of the 
Tree. 

They were now in as great Concern as before, 
not knowing what Courfe to take, or how near 
the Bnemy might be, or in what Numbers ; fo they 

rcfolv'd 



r 97 ] 

fcfolv'd to go away to the Place wliere thefr Wives 
were, to fee if all was well there, and to make 
them eafy, who were in Fright enough to befure; 
for tho' the Savages were their own Country Folic, 
yet they were more terribly afraid or them, and 
perhaps the more, for the Knowledge they had 
of them. 

When they came there, they found the Savages 
had been in the Wood, and very near that Place, 
but had not found it ; for it was indeed inacceffi- 
ble, by the Trees ftanding fo thick, as hejore, had 
ilot the Perfons feeking it been direded by thofe 
that knew it, which thefe did not; they found 
therefore every Thing very f'^i^-y only the Women 
in a terrible Fright. While they were here, they 
had the Comfort to have feven of the Spaniards 
come to their AiTiflance ; the other ten, with their 
Servants, and old Friday^ I mean Friday's Father, 
were gone in a Body to defend their Bower, and 
the Corn, and Cattle that v/as kept there, in 
Cafe the Savages fhould have rov'd over to that 
Side of the Cduntry ; but they did not fpread fo 
far. With the fevcn Spaniards came one of tlie 
three Savages, who^ as I faid, wer^ their Prifo- 
ners formerly; and with them alfo came the Sa- 
vage, whom the Englillo Men had left bound Hand 
and Foot at the Tree; for it feems they came that 
Way, faw the Slaughter of the feven Men, and 
unbound the eighth, and brought him along with 
them ; where, however, they were obliged to bind 
him again, as they had the two others, who were 
left when the third run away^ 

The Priibners began now to be a Burden to 
them ; and they were fo afraid of their efcaping, 
that they Were once refolving to kill them all, be- 
lieving they were under an abfolute Neceifity to 
do fo, for their own Prefervation. Hov/ever, the

Spaniard Governour would not confcnt to it, but 
order 'd for the prefcnt, that they (hould be fent 
out of the Way to my old Cave in the Valley, and 
be kept there with two Spaniards to guard them, 
and give them Food for their Sublillenee, which 
was done ; and they were bound there Hand and 
Foot for that Night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two English Men 
were fo encouraged, that they could not fatisfy 
themfelves to I'tay any longer there ; but taking 
five of the Spaniards, and themfelves, witli four 
Muskets and aPiftol among them, and two ftout 
Quarter-Staves, away they went in Qiieil: of the 
Savages. And Hrfl theycame to the Tree where the 
Men lay that had been kiil'd \ but it was eafy to 
{ee, that fomemore of the Savages had been there; 
for they had attempted to carry their dead Men 
away, and had dragg'd two of them a good Way, 
but had given it over. From whence they advanced 
to the firlt rifing Ground, where they ftood, and faw 
their Camp dcftroy'd, and where they had the 
Mortification Hill to fee fome of the Smoke ; but 
neither could they here fee any of the Savages. 
They then refolv'd, tho' with all poflible Caution, 
to go forwards towards their ruin'd Plantation. 
But a little before they came thither, coming in 
Sight of theSeaShore, they faw plainly the Sava- 
ges all embarking agam in their Canoes, in order 
to be gone. 

They, (eem'd forry at firfl ; and there was no 
Way to come at them, to give them a parting 
Blow: B'jtupon the wholcj were very well fatif- 
fy'd to be rid of them. 

The poor Eagliih Men being now twice ruin'd, 
and all their improvement deftroy'd, the reft all 
agree to come and help them to rebuild, and to 
kiiift tiiem with needful Supplies. Their three 

Country- 



C 99 1 

Coiinrrymcn, who were not yet noted for having 
the ieaft Inclination to any Good, yet as foon as 
they heard of it (for they living remote Eaftward, 
knew nothing of the Matter 'till all was over) came 
and offer'd their Help and AlTiftance, and did very 
friendly work for feveral Days, to reflore their 
Habitation, and make Neceaaries for them: And 
thus, in a little Time, they were fet upon their 
Legs again. 

About two-Days after this, they had the far- 
ther Satisfaction of feeing three of the Savages 
Canoes come driving on Shore, and at fome I>i- 
ftance from them, two drown'd Men ; by which 
they had Reafon to believe, that they had met 
with a Storm at Sea, and had overfet fome of 
them ; for it had blown very hard the very Night 
after they went off. 

However, as fome might mifcarry, fo on the 
other Hand, enough of them efcap'd to inform the 
reft, as well of what they had done, as of what 
had happened to them ; and to whet them on to a- 
nother Enterprize of the fame Kature, which they, 
iz feems, refolv'd to attempt, with fufHcient Force 
to carry all before them; for except what the firft 
Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could fay 
little to it of their own Knowledge ; for they ne- 
ver faw one Man, and the Fellow being kill'd 
that had affirm'd it, they had no other Witncfs to 
confirm it to them. 

It was five or fix Months after this, before they 
heard any more of the Savages; in which Time 
our Men were in Hopes they had either forgot 
their former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes 
of better ; when on a fudden they were invaded 
v/ith the mod: formidable Fleet, of no lefs than 
eight and twenty Canoes full of Savages, arm'd 
with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden 

H 2 Swords^ 



. . [ 100 ] 

Swords, and fuch Jike Engines of War ; and 
they brought fixh Numbers with them, that in 
fhort, it put all our People into the utmoft Con- 
flernation. 

As they came on Shore In the Evening, and at 
the Eafter-moft Side of the Ifland, our Men had 
that Night to confult and confider what to do ; 
and, in the- firfl Place, knowing that their being 
entirely concealed, was their only Safety before, 
and wouid much more be fo now, while the Num- 
ber of their Enemies was fo great, they therefore 
refolvcd firfl of all to take down the Huts which 
were built for the two Englijh Men, and drii^e 
away their Goats to the old Cave ; becaufe they 
fuppos'd the Savaj^es would go diredly thither, as 
foon as it was Day, to play the old Game over 
again, tho' they did not now land within two* 
Leagues of it. 

In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock 
of Goats they had at the old Bower, as I cali'd it^ 
which belonged to the Spaniards i and in (hort,lefc 
as little Appearance of Inhabitants any where as 
was poifible ; and the next Morning early they 
polled themfelves with all their Force at the Plan- 
tation of the two Men, waiting for their Coming, 
As they guefs'd, fo it happened : Thefe new Inva- 
ders leaving their Canoes at the Eaft End of the 
Ifland, came ranging along the Shore diredcly to- 
w^ards the Place, to the Number of two hundred 
and fifty, as near as our Men could judge. Our 
Army was but fmall indeed -, but that which was 
worfe, they had not Arms for all their Number 
neither. The whole Account, it feems, flood 
thus. Fiifl, as to the Men. 

17 Spaniards. 
5 Englijh Men. 

1 Old 



[ .01 ] 

1 Pld Friday, or Friday's Father. 

3 The three Slaves tak^n .with the VVomen^" 

pr^v'd very faichFuJ. .. 
3 Other Slaves who iiv'cl with the Spaniards.: 

To arm thef^y they had^ 

J I Mtiskets. 
5 Piftols. 

3 Fowling Pieces. 

5 Muskets or Fowling Pieces, which were 
taken by me from the mutinous Seamen, 
whom I reduced. 

2 Swords, 3 old Halberds. 

To their Slaves they did not give either Muf- 
:k;etor Fuzee, but they had every one a Haiberd, 
or a long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a great 
Spike of Iron faftned into each End of it, and 
by his Side a Hatchet j alfo every one of our Mea 
had Hatchets. Two of the Women could not be' 
prevailed upon but they would come into the 
Fight ; -and they had Bows and Arrows, which 
the Spaniards had taken from the Savages, when 
the firfl Adion happened, which I have fpoken of, 
where the Indians fought with one another, and 
the Women had Hatchets too. 

The Spaniard Governor, whom I have ^iefcrib'd 
fo often, commanded the whole ; and William At- 
kins, who, though .a dreadful Fellow for Wicked- 
nefs, was a mod daring bold Fellow ; compianded 
under him. The Savages came forward like Li-^ 
ons, and .our Men which was the worfl of their 
Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation ; on- 
ly that William Atkins, who now proved a mofc 
licful Fellow, with C\x Men was planted juil be- 
hind a fmall Thicket of Bufhes, as an advanced 
H 3 Guard^ 



[ lOi ] 

Guard, with Orders to let the firfl of them 
pafs by, and then fire in the Middle of them; 
and as Toon as he had fired, to ma^Ite his Re- 
treat as nimble as he could, round a Part of 
the Wood, and fo come in behind the Spaniards 
where they flood, • having a Thicket of Trees all 
before them. 

When the Savages came on, they run ftrag- 
ling about every VVay in Heaps, out of all man- 
ner oF Order, and IV/iliam Atkins let about fifty of 
them pafs by hims then feeing the reft come in a 
very thick Throng, he orders three of his Men to 
fire, having loaded their Muskets with fix or fe- 
ven Bullets a piece, about zs big as large Piflol 
Bullets. How many they kiil'd or wounded they 
kne\^ not, but the Confternation and Surprize 
wasinexpreiiSble among the Savages ^ they were 
frighted to the laft Degree, to hear fuch a dread- 
ful Noife,-' and fee their Men killed, and others 
hurt, bdr fee no Body that did it ; when in 
the Middle of their Fright, William Atkins and 
his other three, let fly again among the thickeft 
of them,* and in lefs than a Minute the firft 
three,' being loaded again, gave them a third 
Volley."' 

Hud William Atkins and his Men retired im- 
mediately, as foon as they had fir'd, as they were 
ordered to do ; or had the reft of the Body been 
at Hand to have poured in their Shot continually, 
the Savages had been effeftually routed ; for the 
Terror that was among them, came principally 
from this, (viz..) That they were killed by the 
Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and could fee 
no Body that hurt them ,• but William Atkins flay- 
ing to load again, difcovered the Cheat. Some of 
the Savages, who were at a Diirance, {'^'j\^'\g them, 
came upon them behind, and though Atkins and 

his 



C 103 ] 

his Men fir'd at them alfo, two or three Times, 
and killed above twenty, retiring as fail as they 
could, yet they wounded Atkins himfelf, and kil- 
led one of his Fellow Engltjh Men with their Ar- 
rows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard^ and 
one of the Indian Slaves who came with the Wo- 
men. This Slave was a moft gallant Fellow, and 
fought mod defperately, killed five of them with 
his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of the 
arm'd Staves, and a Hatchet. 

Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins woun- 
ded, and two other Men killed, retreated to a 
riiing Ground in the Wood i and the Spaniards, 
after firing three Vollies upon them, retreated al-^ 
fo ; for their Number was fo great, and they 
were fo defperate, that though above fifty of therii 
were killed, and more than {o many wounded, 
yet they came on in the Teeth of our Men, fear- 
lefs of Danger, and fliot their Arrows like a 
Cloud ; and it was obferved, that their woun- 
ded Men, who were not quite difabled, were made 
outrageous by their Wounds, and fought like Mad- 
men. 

When our Men retreated»> they left the Spaniard 
and the Engliflr Man that was Liiled behind them ; 
and the Savages, when they came up to them, 
killed them, over again in a wretched Manner, 
breaking their Arms, Legs and Heads, with their 
Clubs and wooden Swords, like true Savages : But 
finding our Men were gone, they did not feem to 
purfue them, but drew themfelves up in a Kind 
of a Ring, which is, it feems, their Cuflom, and 
fliouted twice in Token of their Vi<5tory. After 
which, they had the Mortification to fee feveral 
of their wounded Men fall, dying with the meer 
Lofs of Blood. 

H 4 The 



[ 104 ] 

The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little 
Body up together upon a riimg Ground, Atkim^ 
though he was wounded, would have had him 
marched, and charged them again altogether at 
once : But the Spaniard reply'd, Seignior Atkins^ 
you fee how their wounded Men fight, let them 
alone till Morning ; ail thefe wounded Men will 
be fl iff and fore with their Wounds, and faint with 
the Lofs of Blood j and fo we fliall have the few- 
er to engage. 

' The Advice was good : But William Atkins re- 
plied merr.'ly. That's true, Stignior, and fo fhaJI 
I too ; and that's the Reafon I would go on 
•while I am warm. Well, Seignior Atkins^ (ays the 
Spaniard^ you have behaved gullantly, and dcrie 
your Part , we will fight for you, if you cannot 
come on ; but I think it bell to fray 'till Morning.: 
So they waited. , 

But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and 
they found the Savages in great Diforder about 
their dead and wounded Men, and a great Hur- 
ry and Noife among them where they lay, they 
afterwards refolved to fall upon them in the Nigh^, 
efpecially if they could come to give them but one 
Volley before they were difcovered, w;hich they 
had a fair Opportunity to do ; for one of the two 
Englijh Men, in whofe Quarter it was where 
the Fight began, led them round between the 
Wood?, and Sea-fide V/eftward, and then turning 
fhort South, they came fo near where the thickefi: 
of them lay, that before they were ieen of heard, 
eight of them fir'd in anaong chem, and did dread- 
ful Execution upon them. In Half a Minute 
more, eight others fired after them, pouring in 
tb^ic Small Shot in fuch a Q^iaritity, that Abun- 
dance were killed and wounded i and all thisv/hile 

they 



[ 105 ] 

they were not able to fee who hurt them, or 
.which Way to fly.. 

; The Spaniards charged again with the utmoft 
Expedition, and then divided themfelves into three 
Bodies, and refolved to fall in among them alto- 
gether. They had in each Body eight Perfons, that 
is to fay, 24, whereof were 22 Men, and the two 
Women, who by the Way fought defperately. 

They divided the Fire- Arms equally in each 
Party, and fo of the Halberds and Staves. They 
would have had the W^oraen keep back, but they 
faid, they were refolv'd to cMq with their Husbands. 
Having thus formed their little Army, they march'd 
out from among the Trees, and they came up to 
the Teeth of the Enemy, flicuting and hallooing as 
loud, as they could. .The Savages flood all toge- 
ther, but were in the utmoft Confufion, hearing 
the Noife Oi our Men ihouting from three Qiiar- 
ters together ; they would have fought if they had 
feen us. And as foon as we came near enough to 
be feen, fome Arrows were fhot^ and poor old 
Friday w^s wounded, tho' not dangeroufly. But 
our Men gave them no Time ; but running up 
to them, fired among them three Ways, and then 
fell in with the But-ends of their Muskets, their 
Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets, and laid a- 
bout them fo well, that in a Word, they fet up a 
difmal Skreaming and Howling, flying tofave their 
Lives, which Way foever they could. 
. Our Men were tired with the Execution ; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, 
about 180 of them j the reft, being frighted out 
of their Wits, fcour'd through the Woods, and 
over the Hills, with all the Speed and Fear that 
nimble Feet could help them, to do ,* and as we 
did not trouble our fcWcs much to purfue them, 
;liey got altogether to the Sea Side, where they 
,. landed. 



[ 106] 



landed, and where their Canoes lay. But thciv- 
Difafler was not at an End yet; for it blew a ter- 
rible Storm of- Wind that Evening trom the 
Seav/ard, fo that it was impoffible for them to go 
off,* nay, the Storm continuing all Night, when 
the Tide came up, their Canoes were moft ot them 
driven by the Surge of the Sea fo high upon the 
Shore, that it required infinite Toil to get them 
off; and feme of them were even dafh'd to Pieces 
againil: the Beach, or againft one another. 

Our Men, tho' glad of their Victory, yer got 
little Reft riiar Night ; but having refredi'd themg 
felves as well as they could, they refolv'd to march 
to that Part of the IHand where the Savages were 
fled, and fee what Pofture they were in. This 
neceflarily led them over the Place where the 
Fight had been, and where they found feveral of 
the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet paft re- 
covering Life,- a Sight difagreeable enough to 
generous Minds ; for a truly great Man, tho' ob- 
licred by the Law of Battle to deftroy his Enemy, 
takes no Delight in his Mifery. - 

However, there was no Need to glv^ any Or- 
ders in this Cafe ; for their own Savages, who 
were their Servants, difiiatchM thofe poor Crea- 
tures wath their Hatche.s. 

At length they came in View of the Place 
where the more miferable Remains of the Savages. 
Army lay, where there appeared about an hundred 
ftill ; their Pollurc was generally iitting upon thq 
Ground, with their Knees up towards their Mouth, 
and the Head pu^between the two Hands, leaning 
down upon the Knees. 

When our Men came wichin two Musket Shot 
of them, the .Sp/zw/W Governor order'd two Muf- 
kets to be fir^d without Ball, to alarm them ; 
this he did, chat by rheir Countenance he might 

know 



[ 107 ] 

know what to exped, "viz.. Whether they were 
ftill in Heart to fight, or were (o heartily beaten, 
as to be difpirited and difcourag'd, and fo he might 
manage accordingly. 

This Stratagem took ; for, as foon as the Sava- 
ges heard the firft Gun, and faw the Flalh of 
the fecond, they ftarted up from their Feet in the 
greateft Confternation imaginable ; and as our 
Men advanced fwiftly towards them, they all ran 
skreaming and yawling away, with a kind of a 
howling Noife, which our Men did not under- 
ftand, and had never heard before ; and thus they 
ran up the Hills into the Country. 

At firft, our Men had much rather the Weather 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to 
Sea : But they did not then confider that this 
might probably have been the Occafion of their 
coming again in fuch Multitudes, as not to be 
refiftedj or, at leaft, to come fo many, and fo of- 
ten, as would quite defolate thelfland, and ftarve 
them. Will. Atkins therefore, who, notv/ithftand- 
ing his Wound, kept always with them, prov'd 
the beft Counfellor in this Cafe : His Advice was, 
to take- the Advantage that offer'd, and clap in 
between them and their BoatSj and fo deprive 
them of the Capacity of ever returning any more 
to plague the liland. 

They confulted long about this, and fome were 
againft it, for fear of making the Wretches fly 
to the Woods, and live there defperate ; and fo 
they fhould have them to hunt like wild Beafts, 
be afraid to ftir out about their Bufinefs, and have 
their Plantations continually rifled, all their tame 
Goats dcilroy'd, and, in fliort, be reduced to a 
Life of continual Diftrefs. 

Will. Atkins told them, they had better have 
to do with a hundred Men, than with a hundred 



[ loS ] 

J^Tations : That as they muft deflroy their Boats, 
fo they muft deflroy the Men, or be all of them 
deflroy a themfelves. In a Word, hefhew'd them 
t1ie Necsflity of it fo plainly, that they all 
came into it ; fo they went to work immediate- 
ly with the Boats, and getting feme dry Wood 
together from a dead Tree, they try*d to fet 
Ipme on them on Fire, but they were fo wet, that 
they would not burn ; however, the Fire fo burn'd 
the upper Part, that it foon made them ur.ht for 
fwiniming in the Sea as Boats. VVhen the Indians 
faw what they were about, feme of them came 
rbhning out of the Woods, and coming as near as 
they could to our Men, kneefd down, and cry'd, 
Oay Oa, IVaramoka, and (ome other Words of 
their 'Language, which none of the orhers under- 
flood any thing of,- but as they made pinfui Ge- 
iiures, and firange Noifes, it was eafy to under- 
fland, they ' begg'd to have their Boats fpar'd, 
and that Iphey would be gone, and never come 
there again./ . ' ' ' 

. But our Men were now fatisfy^d, that they 
had no Way to preferve themJelves, or to fave 
their Colony, but effe(^tually to prevent any of 
thefe People from ever 'go'm^ flome again ,• de- 
pending upon this, that if ever fo much as one 
of them got back into their "Country to tell the 
Storj^, the Colony was undone ; \o that letting 
them know that they fliould not have any^ Mer- 
cy, they fell to work with ihcir' Canoes, and de- 
flroy^'d them every one, that the S.oim had act 
deftroy'd before,' at the Sight of whiqh, • the Sa- 
vages rais'd a hideous Cry jn tiiC Woods, -wliic'h 
our People heard plain er.oiigh j aficr which, they 
ran about the Ifland like diltradted Men -, [o that, 
in a Word, our Men did. not really know at liiil 
what to ilo with them. 

Nor 



[ 109 ] 

Kor did the Spaniards, with all their Pru- 
dence, confider, that while they made thofd 
People thus defperate, they ought to have. 
kept good Guard at the fame Time upon theiif 
Plantations ; for tho' it is true, they had driven 
away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find 
out their maifi Retreat, I rnean my old Caftle 
at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Valley, yet 
they found out my Plantation at the Bower, 
and puii'd it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and 
Planting about it ; trOd ail the Corn under 
Foot i tore up the Vines and Grapes, being jud: 
then alfnoft ripe, and did to our Men an ine- 
flimable Damage, tho' to themfelves not One Far- 
thing-worth ot* Service. 

Tho' our Men were able to fight them upon 
all Occafions, yet they we^e in no Condition to 
purfue them, or hunt them up or down ; for as 
they were too nimble of Foot for our Men, when 
they found them fingle, fo our Men durft not 
go about finglCj for fear of being furroimded with 
their Numbers. The beft was, th^y had no 
Weapons ; for tho' they had Bows, they had no 
Arrows left, nor any Materials to make any, nor 
Had they any edg'd To-ol or Weapon among 
theiti. 

The Extremity and Diflrefs they Vv'cre reduced 
t6 was great, and indeed deplorable j but at the 
fame Time, onr Men were alfo brought to very 
bad Circumdances by them ,• for tho' their Re- 
treats were prefcrv'd, yet their Provifion was 
deilroy'd, and their Barveft fpoil'd, and what to 
do, or which Way to turn themfelves, they knew 
not : The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock 
ot Cattle they had in the Valiey by the Cave, 
and fome little Corn which grew there i and the 
Plantation of the thiec Englijlmun, William At- 

kins 



[ no ] 

khis and his Comrades, who were now reduced 
to two, one of them being klll'd by an Arrow^ 
which flruck him on the Side of" his Head, 
juft under the Temple, fo that he never fpoke 
more ; and it was very remarkable, that this 
was the fame barbarous Fellow who cut the 
poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and w^ho 
afterwards intended to have murder'd all the 
Spaniards, 

I lookM upon this Cafe to have been worfe 
at this Time, than mine was at any Time, after 
I firft difcover'd the Grains of Barley and Rice, 
and got into the Manner of planting and railing 
my Corn, and my tame Cattle ; for now they 
had, as I may fay, a hundred Wolves upon the 
liland, which would devour every Thing they 
could come at, yet could very hardly be come at 
themfelves. 

The firfl: Thing they concluded, when they faw 
what their Circumflances were, was that they 
would, if poflible drive them up to the farther 
Part of the Kland, South- Weft, that if any more 
Savages came on Shore, they might not find one 
another. Then, that they would daily hunt and 
harrafs them, and kill as many of them as they 
could come at, till they had reduc'd their Num- 
ber ; and if they could at laft tame them, and 
bring them to any Thing, they would give them 
Corn, and teach them how to plant and live up-^ 
on their daily Labour. 

In order to this, they fo follow'd them^ and fo 
terrify 'd them with their Guns, that in a fev/ 
Days, if any of them fir'd a Gun at an Mian, if 
he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for 
Fear; and fo dreadfully frighted they were, that 
they kept out of Sight farther and farther, till at 

laft 



[ III ] 

laft our Men following them, and every Day ai- 
med: killing and wounding fome of them, they 
kept up in the Woods and hollow Places fo much, 
that it rednc'd them to the utmoft Mifery for 
Want of Food, and many were afterwards found 
dead in the Woods, without any Hurt, but meer- 
ly flarv'd to Death. 

When our Men found this, it made their 
tiearts relent, and Pity mov'd them ; efpecially 
the Spaniard Governour, who was the moft gentle- 
manly generous-minded Man that ever I met with 
in my Life ; and he proposed, it poffible, to take 
one of them alive, and bring him to underfiand 
what they m.eanr, fo far as to be able to ad: as 
Interpreter, and to go among them, and fee if 
they might be brought to fome Conditions, that 
might be depended upon, tofave their Lives, and 
to do us no Spoil. 

It was fome while before any of them could 
be taken ; but being weak and half ffarv'd, one 
of them was at lalt furpriz'd and made a Prifo- 
ncr : He was fullen at firif, and would neither 
eat or drink ; but Ending himfelf kindly ufed, 
and Viduals ^ivca him, and no Violence ofFer^'d 
him, he at lail: grew tractable, and came to 
himfelf. 

- They bro'jght old Friday to him, who talk'd 
often with him, and cold him how kind the other 
would be to them all ; that they would not only 
fave their Lives, but would give them a Part of 
the Illand to live m, provided they would give 
Satisfaction that they would keep in their own 
Bounds, and not come beyond it, to injure oc 
prejudice others, and that they fhould have Corn 
given them, to plant and make it grow for their 
Bread, and fome Bread given them for their pre- 
fcnt Sub/idence i and old -KV^^j bad the Fellow 



go and talk with the reft of his Coiintryrnena 
and fee what they faid to it, afliiring them, that 
if they did not agree imniediateJy, they fhould 
be all deftroy^d. 

The poor Wretches, thoroughly humbled, and 
reduced in Number to about thirty feven, closed 
with the Propofal at the firft Offer, and begg'd 
to have fome Food given them ,• upon which, 
twelve Spaniards and two Englifl) Men well arm'd, 
with t\\^Q^ Indian Slaves, and old Friday, marchM 
to the Place where they were ; the three Indian 
Slaves carry 'd them a large Qiiantity of Bread ; 
fome Rice boil'd up to Cakes, and dry'd ivi the 
Sun, and three live Goats ; and they were or- 
dered to go to the Side oF a Hill, where they 
fat down, eat the Provifions very thankfully^ 
and were the moft faithful Fellows to their Words 
that could be thought of j for except when they 
came to beg Viduals and Diredions, they never 
came out of their Bounds ; and there they liv'd 
when I came to the Kland, and I went to fee 
them. 

They had taught thein both to plant Corn, 
make Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them ; 
they wanted nothing but Wives, and they focn 
would have been a Nation. They were con- 
fin'dto a Neck of Land, furrounded vvath high 
Rocks behind them, and lying plain towards t\\Q 
Sea before them, on the South- Eafl Corner of 
the Ifland : They had Land enough, and it was 
very good and fruitful -, they had a Piece of 
Land about a Mile and half broad, and three or 
four Mile in Length. 

Our Men taught them to make wooden 
Spades^ fuch as I made for myfelf, and gave . 
them among them twelve Hatchets, and three 
dr four Knives; and there thev li\'d the moft 

(lib-. 



[■■5] 

bb/eded innocent Creatures that ever were 
heard of. 

After this, the Colony enjoy 'd a perfed Tran- 
quilJity with Refped: to the Savages, till I came 
to revifit them, which was above two Years : 
Not, but that now and then fome Canoes of Sa- 
vages came on Shore for their triumphal unnatu- 
ral Feaftsi bat as they were of feveral Nations, 
iand perhaps had never heard of thofe that came 
before, or the Reafon of it, they did not make 
iany Search or Enquiry afrer their Countrymen ; 
and if they had, it would have been very hard to 
have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full Account 
of all that happened to them> to my Return, at 
leaft that was worth Notice. The Indians or Sa- 
vages were wonderfully civilized by them, and 
they frequently went among them, but forbid, 
on Pain of Death, any of the Indians coming 
to them, becaufe they would not have their Set- 
tlement betrayM them. 

One Thing was very remarkable, vizj, that 
they taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, 
br Baskets ; but they foon outdid their Mafters ; 
for they made Abundance of moft ingenious 
Things m Wicker-work ,• particularlyi all Sorts - 
of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, &c, 
as alfo Chairs to fit on. Stools, Beds, Couches, 
and Abundance of other Things, being very in- . 
genious at fuch Work, when they were once put 
in the Way of it. 

My coming was a particular Relief to thefe 
People, becaufe we furnifh'd them with Knives, 
Scirfars, Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and all Things 
of that Kind which they could want 

With the Help of thefe Tools |hey were fo 

very handy, that they came at laft to build 

Part IL I up 



[114] 

up their Huts, or our Hoiifes, very handfornely ; 

raddling or working it up like Basket-work 
all the way round, which was a very extraor- 
dinary Piece oF Ingenuity, and look'd very odd,- 
but was an exceeding good Fence, as well againft 
Heat, as againft all Sorts of Vermin ; and 
our Men were fo taken with it, that they got 
the wild Savages to eome and do the like for 
them ; fo that when I came to fee the two Erig- 
lijlj Mens Colonies, they look'd, at a Diftancc^ 
as it they liv'd ah like I3ecs in a Hive. And as 
for Will. Atkins, who was now become a very in- 
duftrioiis,necefl'ary, and fcber Fellow, he had made 
himfeiffuch a Tent of Basket-work as 1 believe 
was never feen ^ it was 120 Paces round in the 
Out-fide, as I meafur'd by my Steps r the Walls 
were as clofe Avork'^d a^ a Basket in Pannels, or 
Squares, of 32 in Number, and very ftrong, 
{landing about feven Foot high. In the Middle 
was another not above 22 Paces round, but 
built ftronger, being Eight-fquare in its Form ,* 
and in the eight Corners flood eight very ftrong 
Pofts, round the Top of which he laid flrong 
Pieces pinnM together with wooden Pins, from 
which he raised a Pyramid for the Roof, of eight 
Rafters, very handfome, I affure you, and join'd 
together very well, tho' he had no Nails, and 
only a few Iron Spikes, which he made him- 
felf too, out of the old Iron that I had left 
there ; and indeed this Fellow fliew^d Abundance 
oF Ingenuity in feveral Things, which he had 
no Knowledge of. He made him a Forge, with 
a Pair oF wooden Bellows to blow the Fire ,• he 
made himfelf Charcoal for his Work, and he 
form'd out of one of the Iron Crows a middling 
good ^.nvQ\ to hammer upon ; in this Manner 
he made many Things, but efpecially Hooks, 

Staples, 



C 115 ] 

Staples, and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges. But to re- 
turn to the Hoiife ; afcer he had pitched the Roof 
of his innermof]: Tent, he work'd it up be- 
tween the Rafters with Basket-work, fo iirm, 
and thatchy that over again fo ingenioufly 
with Rice-ftraw, and over that a large Leaf of ■ 
a Tree, which covered the Top, that his Houfe 
was as dry as if it had been tii^d or flated. In- ■ 
deed he own'd that the Savages made the Basket- 
work for him. 

The outer jCircuir was cover^'d, as a Lean-to, 
all round this inner Apartment, and long Rafters 
lay kom the two and thirty Angles to the top 
Pofls of the inner Houfe, being about twenty Foot 
Diftance ^ fo that there was a Space like a Walk 
within the outer Wicker-wall, and without the in- 
ner, near twenty Foot wide. 

The inner Place he partition^ off with the 
fame Wicker-work, but much fairer, and di- 
vided it into fix Apartments, fo that he had 
fix Rooms on a Floors and out of every one of 
the{e there was a Door, firft into the Entry or 
Coming into the main Tent, and another Door 
into the Space or Walk that was round it; fo 
that Walk was alfo divided into fix equal Parts, 
which ferv'd not only for Retreat, but to fiore 
up any Neceifaries which the Family had Oc- 
calion for. Tnefe fix Spaces not taking up the 
whole Circumference, what other Apartments 
the outer Circle had, were thus order'd. As foon 
as you were in at the Door of the outer Circle, 
you had a fhort Paflage firait before you to 
the Door of the inner Houfe, but on either 
Side was a Wicker Partition, and a Door in it, 
by which you went, firfi, into a large Room 
or Store ^hcufe, twenty Foot wide, and about thir- 
ty Foot long, and thro' that into another not 

I 2 quite 



[ ii6 ] 

quite fo long ; fo that in the outer Circle Was 
ten handfome Rooms,, lix ot which were on- 
ly to be come at thro' the Apartments of the 
inner Tent, and fcivM as Clofets or retiring 
Rooms to the refpedive Chambers of the inner 
Circle ; and four large VVare-houfes or Barns^ or 
■what you plcafe to call them, which went in 
thro' one another, two on either Hand of the 
■Padage, that led thro' the outer Door to the in- 
ner Tent. 

Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was 
never feen in the VVorld, nor a Houfc, or Tent, 
fo neatly contriv'd, much h(sy (o built. In this 
great Bee- hive liv'd the three Families, that 
is to fay, fV^li. Atkins and his Companion ; the 
third was kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with 
three Children ; for (lie was, it feems, big with 
Child when he dy'd, and the other two were not 
at all backward to ^i\Q the Widow her full Share 
of every Thing, I mean, as to their Corn, Milky 
Grapes, &c. and when they kill'd a Kid, or 
found a Turtle on the Shore ,* fo that they all 
liv'd well enough, tho' it was true, they were 
not fo induftrious as the other two, as has been 
obfervM already. 

- One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz,. 
That is for Religion, I don't know that there 
was any Thing ot' that Kind among them ; they 
pretty often indeed put one another in Mind that 
there was a God, by the very common Method 
of Seamen, i/zx.. Swearing by his Name : Nor 
were their poor ignorant Savage Wives much the 
better for having been marry 'd to Chriftians, as 
we mufl call them ; for as they knew very little 
of God themfelves, io they were utterly uncapa- 
bie of entering into any Difcourfe with their Wives 

about 



about a God, or to talk any thing to them con- 
cerning Religion. 

The utmoil: of all the Improvement which I 
can fay the Wives had made from them, was, 
that they had taught them to fpeak Englijh prec- 
ty well, and all the Children they had, which 
were near 20 in all, were caught, to fpeak EngUfly 
too, from their firfl: learning to fpeak, tho' they 
at Hrfl: fpoke it in a very broken Manner, like 
their Mothers. There were none of thefe Chil- 
dren above fix Years old when I came thither, for 
it was not much above feven Years that they had 
fetch^'d thefe five Savage Ladies over, but they had 
all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Children, 
raoreorlefs: I think the Cook's Mate's '^Hq was 
big of her fixth Child ; and the Mothers were all 
a good Sortofwell-govern'd, quiet, laborious Wo- 
men, modefland decent, helpful to one another; 
mighty obfervant and fubjed to their Mailers, I 
cannot call them Husbands ; and wanted nothing 
but to be well intruded in the Chriftian Reli- 
gion, and to be legally marry 'd ; both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, 
or, atieafl, in Confequence of my coming among 
fhem. 

Having thus given an Account of the Colony 
in genera', and pretty much of my five Runagate 
Englijh Men, I muft fay fomething of the Spaniards^ 
who were the main Body of the Family; andiri 
whofe Story there are fome Incidents alfo remark^ 
able enough. 

I had a great many Difcourfes with them about 
their Circumftances when they were among the 
Savages : They told me readily, that they had 
no Inflances to Q.iVQ of their Application or Inge- 
nuity in that Country; that they were a poor 

I I mifc: 



[ ii8 ] 

miferablc dcjefted Handful of People •, that If 
Means had been put into their Hands, they had 
yet Co abandon'd chemfelves to Dcfpair, and io 
funk under the Weight of their Misfortunes, 
that they thought of nothing but Starving: One 
of them, a grave and very fenlible Man, toJd 
me, he viras convinc'd they were in the Wrong ; 
that it was net the Part of wife Men to give up 
themfelves to their Mlfery, but always to take 
Hold of the Helps which Reafon ofTcr'd^as well 
for prefent Support, as for future Deliverance. 
He told me, that Grief was the moft fenlelcls 
in/ignificant Pafiion in the V/orld ♦, for that it 
regarded only Things paif, which were gene- 
rally impofhble to be recail'd, or to be remedy'd, 
but had no View to Things- to come, and bad no 
Share in any Thing that look'd like Delive- 
rance, but rather added to the AiHidion, than 
proposed a Remedy : And upon this, he repeated 
2iSpani{lo Proverb; which tho' I cannot repeat 
■in jufr the fame Words that he (poke in, yet 1 re- 
member I made it into an Englijh Proverb of my 
own, thus: 

In Trotible to he tror-ihN, 

Is to have your "Trouble dcubl\L 

He ran on then in Remarks upon all the little 
Improvements 1 had made in my Solitude ^ my 
nnweary'd Application, as he calTd it, and how 
I had made a Condition, v/hich, in its Circum- 
ftances, was at firft much worfe than theirs a 
thoufand Times, more happy than theirs was, 
even now, when ihcy were all together. He 
told me, ic was remarkable, that Erigli/Jj Men 
had a greater Prefence of Mind in their Dittrefs; 
than any People that ever he met withi that 

I heir 



C 119 ] 

their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguefi^ werjg 
the worft Men in the World to ftruggle wichi 
Misfortunes; for their firflScep in Dangers, af- 
ter the common Efforts are over, was always to 
defpair, h'e down under \i^ and die, without 
roufing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies 
for Efcape, 

I told him, their Cafe and mine differed exceed- 
ingly, that they were calf upon the Shore with- 
out Neceifaries, without Supply of Food, or of 
prefent Suftcnance, till they could provide: 
That it is true, I had this Diladvantage and Dif- 
comforr, that I was alone \ but then the Supplies 
I had providentially thrown into my Hands^ 
by the unexpected driving of the Ship on Shore^, 
was fuch a Help, as would have encourag'd any 
Creature in the World to have applied himfelf 
as I had done. Seignior, fays the Spaniard^ had 
we poor Spaniards been m your Cafe, we fhould 
never have gotten half thofc Things out of the 
Ship, as you did: Nay, fays he, we ftiou Id ne- 
ver have found Means to have gotten a Raft to 
carry them, or to have gotten the Raft on Shore 
without Boat or Sail \ and how much lefs (hould 
we have done, faid he, if any of us had been a^ 
lone? Well, Idefired him to abate his Compli- 
ment, and goon with the Hiftory of iheir com- 
ing on Shore, where they landed : He told me, 
they unhappily landed at a Place where there 
were People without Provllions; wherea?^, had 
they had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea 
again, and gone to another liland a little farther, 
they had found Provilions, tho' without People; 
tliere being an Ifland that Way, as they have been 
told, where there was Provilions, tho* no Peo- 
ple-, that is to fay, Th^tthz Spaniards o^ Trinidad 
had frequently been there . and had fill'd the 
I 4 Ifland 



Iflatid with Goats and Hogs at fevcral Times ^ 
where they have bred in fuch Muhitudcs, and 
where Turtle and Sea-Fowls were in fnch Plenty, 
that they could ha' been in no Want of FJefh^ thp' 
they had found no Bread; whereas here, they 
were only fuftain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, 
which they underilood not, and which had no 
Subftance in them, and which the Inhabitants 
gave them fparicgiy enough, and who could 
treat them no better, unlefs they would turn Ca- 
nibals, and eat Mens Fleih, which was the great 
Dainty of their Country. 

They gave me an Account how many Ways 
they ftrove to civilize the Savages they were with, 
and to teach them rational Cuftoms in the ordi- 
nary Way of Living, but in vain ; and how rhey 
retorted it upon them, as unjurt, that they who 
came there for Afliiiance and Support, Ihould at- 
tempt to fet up for lnftru(5lors of thofc that gave 
them Bread •, intimating, it feems, that none 
fhould fet up for the ln{i:ru6lors of others, buf 
thofe who could live without them. 

They gavemedifmal Accounts of the Extre^- 
mitfes they were driven to; how fometimes they 
were many Ways without any Food at all-, the 
Ifland they were upon being inhabited by a Sore 
of Savages that lived more indolent, and for that 
Reafon were kfs fuppiied with the Neceflaries of 
Life, than they had Reafon to believe others 
were in the fame Part of the World; and yet 
they found, that rhefeSavnges were Icfs ravenous 
and voracious, than thofe who had better Sup- 
plies of Food. 

Alfo they added, Thar they could not but fee 
with what Demon (irarions of Wifdom and Good- 
nefs the governing Providence of God direfts the 
^vcnts of Things in the World j which they faid. 



[ HI ] 

appcat'd in their Ci rcum (lances i for if prefs'4 
by the Hard lliips they were under, and the Bar- 
rennefs of the Country where they were, they 
had fearched after a better PJace to five in ; they 
had then been out of the Way of the Belief that 
happened to them by my Means. 

Then they gave me an Account, how the Sa- 
vages, whom they liv'd among, expelled them to 
go out with them into their Wars : And it was 
true, that, as they had Fire- Arms with them, 
had they not had the Difafter to lofe their Am- 
munition, they fhould not have been ferviceable 
only to cheir Friends, but have made themfelves 
terrible both to Friends and Enemies > but being 
without Powder and Shot, and yet in a Condi- 
tion, that they could not in Reafon deny to go 
out with their Landlords to their Wars ; when 
they came into the Field of Battle, they were in 
a worfe Condition than the Savages themfelves; 
for they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could 
theyufcthofe the Savages gave them^ fo that 
they could do nothing but ftand ftill, and be 
wounded with Arrows, till they came up to the 
Teeth of their Enemy -, and then indeed the 
three Halbardsthcy had, were of life to them y 
and they would often drive a whole little Ar- 
my before them with fhofe Halbards and (har- 
pen'd Sticks put into the Muzzles of their Muf- 
kets : But that for all this, they were fome- 
times furrounded with Multitudes, and in great 
Danger from their A.rrows, till at laft they 
found the Way to make themfelves large Tar- 
gets of Wood, which they cover'd with Skins 
of wild Beafts, whofe Names they knew not ; 
and thcfe cover'd them from the Arrows of 
the Savages; that notwithftanding thefe, they 
were fometimes in great Danger, and were once 
^ r • five 



[ 122. ] 

five of them knock'd down together with the Clubs 
of the Savages, which was the Time when one of 
them was taken Prifoner ; that is to Tay, the Spa- 
niardy whom I had relieved, that at firft they 
thought had been killed : But when afterwards 
they heard he was taken Prifoner, they were under 
the greateft Grief imaginable, and would willing- 
ly have ventured their Lives to have refcued him. 

They told me, That when they were fo knocked 
down, the reft of their Company refcued them, 
and flood over them, fighting till they were come 
to themfelves, all but him who they thought had 
been dead ; and then they made their Way with 
their Halberds and Pieces, ftanding cloie toge- 
ther in a Line, thro' a- Body of above a thoufand 
Savages, beating down all that came in their Way, 
got the Vi(5tory over their Enemies, but to their 
great Sorrow, becaufe ir was with the Lofs of their 
Friend ,• whom, the other Party finding him alive, 
carried off with feme others, as I gave an Ac- 
count in my former. 

They defcribed moft afteftionately, how they 
were furprized with Joy at the Return of their 
Friend andCompanion inMifery,whothey thought 
had been devoured by wild Beads of the worft 
liind, (viz,.) by wild Men ; and yet how more 
and more they were furprized with the Account 
he gave them of his Errand, and that there was not 
a Chriftian in any Place near, much more one that 
was able, and had Humanity enough to contri- 
bute to their Deliverance. 

They defcribed how tl.ey vere aflonifhed at the 
Sight of the Relief I feiit them, and and at the 
Appearance of Loaves of Bread, Things they had 
not feen fince their coming to that miferable Place. 
How often they crofs'd ir, and blefs'd it, as Bread 
fent from Heaven y and what a reviving Cordial 

it 



C 1^3 1 

it was to their Spirits to tafte it ,* as alfo of the 
other Things I had Tent for their Supply. And 
afcer all, they would have told me fomething of 
the Joy they were in, at the Sight of a Boat and 
Pilots to carry them away to the Perfon and Place 
from whence all thefe new Comforts came ; but 
they told me it was impoffible to exprefs it by 
Words, for their exceilive Joy, naturally driving 
them to unbecoming Extravagances, they had no 
way to defcribe them, but by telling me that they 
bordered upon Lunacy, having no way to give 
Vent to their Paffion, fuitable to the Senfe that 
v/as upon them ,* that in fome it worked one Way, 
and in fome another ,* and that fome of them, thro* 
a Surprize of Joy, would burft out into Tears ; 
others ftark mad, and others immediately faint. 
This Difcourfe extremely affeded me, and call'd to 
my Mind Friday's Extafy, when he met his Father, 
and the poor People's Extafy, when I took them 
up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire ; the Mate 
of the Ship's Joy, when he found himfelf deliver'd 
in the Place where he expeded to perifii ; and my 
own Joy, when after 28 Years Captivity, I found 
a good Ship ready to carry me to my own Coun- 
try. All thefe Things made me more fenfible of 
the Relation of thofe poor Men, and more affeded 
with it.. 

Having thus given a View of the State of 
Things, as I found them, I mufl relate the Heads 
of what 1 did for thefe People, and the Condition 
in which I left them. It was their Opinion and 
mine too, that they would be troubled no more 
with the Savages,' or that if they were, they would 
be able to cut them ofi-, ii they were twice as ma- 
ny as before ,* fo they had no Concern about that. 
Tl»en I entred into a ferious Difcourfe with the 
Spaniard, v/hom I call Governor, about their Stay, 

in 



[ 124 ] 

in the Ifland ; for as I was not come to carry any 
of them off, fo it would not be juft to carry off 
fome, and leave others, who perhaps would be un- 
willing to flay, i^ their Strength was diminifhed. 

On the other Hand, I told them, I came to efta- 
blifh them there, not to remove them ; and then I 
kt them know, that I had brought with me Relief 
offundry Kinds for them ; that I had been at a 
great Charge to fiipply them with all Things necef- 
(ary, as well for their Convenience, as their JDefence i 
and that I had fuch and fuch particular Perfons with 
me, as well to encreafe and recruit their Number, 
as by the particular necedary Emploj'ments which 
they were bred to, being Artificers, toaiTiil them in 
thofe things, in which, at prefent, they were tofeek. 

They v^^cre altogether when 1 talk'd thus to 
them, and before I delivered to them the Stores I 
has brought, ask'd them one by one, If they had 
entirely forgot, and buried the firft Animofities 
that had been among them, and would fhake Hands 
with one another, and engage in a. flrid Friendfhip 
and Union of Intereft, that fo there might be no 
more Mifunderftanding or Jealoufies. 

Wtlliam Atkins, with Abundance of Franknefs 
and good Humour, faid, They had met with Af- 
fliaions enough to make them ail fober, and Ene- 
mies enough to make them all Friends ; that for 
his Part, he would live and diQ with them ; and 
was fo far from defigning any th;ng againft the 
Spaniards ; that he owned they had done nothing 
to him, but what his own mad Humour made 
ncceiTary, and what he would have done, and per- 
haps much worfe in their Cafe ; and that he would 
ask them Pardon, if I ddired ic, for the foohlh 
and brutifh Things he had done to them ; and 
was very willing and defirous of living in Terms 
of entire Friendfhip and Union with chem ; and 

would 



C 12.5 ] 

^ould do any thing that lay in his Power to 
convince them of it; and as tor going to England, 
he cared not if he did not go rhiciier thefe twenty 
Years. 

The Spaniards faid, They had indeed at lirfl 
di farmed and excluded M/ilham Atkins and his two 
Countrymen for their ill Condud, as they had 
let me know ; and they appealed to me, for the 
NecefTiry they were under to do fo : But that Wtl^ 
Ham Atkins had behaved himfelf fo bravely in the 
great Fight they had with the Savages, and oa 
feveral Occa(ions (ince ; and had fhewn himlelf fo 
faithful to, and concerned for the general Interefl 
of them all, that they had forgotten all that was 
paft, and thought he merited as much to be truft- 
ed with Arms, and to be fupply'd wich NeceiTa- 
ries as any of them ; and that they had teHified 
their Satisfadion in him, by committing the Com- 
mand to him, next to the Governor himfelf. 
And as they had an entire Confidence in him 
and all his Countrymen, fo they acknowledged 
they had merited that Confidence by all the Me- 
thods that honefl Men could merit to be valued 
and truftcd ; and they mod heartily embraced the 
Occa(ion of giving me this Aflurance, that they 
would never have any Intereff feparate from one 
aiiother. 

Upon thefe frank and open Declarations of 
Friendiliip, we appointed the next Day to dine 
all together ; and indeed we made a fplcndid Feafl : 
I caufed the Ship's Cook and his Mate to come 
on Shore, and drefs our Dinner ; and the old 
Cook's Mate we had on Shore, ailiiled. We brought 
on Shore iix Pieces ofc^ood Beef, and four Pieces 
of Pork out of the Ship's Provi(ion> with our Punch- 
Bowl, and Materials to hll it ;|and in particular, 
gave them ten Bottles of Ecnch Claret, and ten 

Boc- 



r 116 ] 

Bottles ot Englifl) Beer ,* Things that neither the 
Spaniards, or the EnglifJo Men had taftcd for many 
Years ; and which, it may be fuppofed, they were 
exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Fealf five whole 
Kids, which the Cooks roafled ; and three of them 
were fent cover'd up clofc on Board the Ship, to 
the Seamen, that they might feaft on frefii Meat 
from on Shore, as we did with their Salr Meat 
from on Board. 

Afcer this Feafl, at which we were very inno- 
cently merry, I brought out my Carj^o of Goods, 
wherein, that there might be no Difpute about 
dividing, I lliew'd them that there was fufficient 
for them ail ; and defir'd that they might all take 
an equal Qiiantity ot the Goods that were for 
wearing ; that is to fay, equal when made up; as 
firft, I diftributed Linnen fufficient to make every 
one of them four Shirts ; and at the Spaniards 
Requefl afterwards, made them up fix ; thefe 
were exceeding comfortable to them, having 
been what, as I may fay, they had long fince 
forgot the Ufe of, or what it was to wear 
them. 

I allotted the thin Engliflo Stuffs, which I men- 
tioned before, to make every one alight Coat, like 
a Frock, which I judged fitteft for the Heat of 
the Seafon ; cool and loofe, and order'd, that when- 
ever they decayed, they fliould make more, as they 
thought fit : The like for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings 
and Hats, &c, 

I cannot exprefs what Pleafure, what Satis- 
faction, fat upon the Countenances of all thefe 
poor Men, when they faw the Care I had ta- 
ken of them, and how well I had furni(h'd 
them ; they told me, I was a Father to them, 
and that having fuch a Correfpondent as I was. 



in 



[ 1^7 ] 

in fo remote a Part of the World, ft would 
make them forget that they were left in a de- 
folate Place ; and they all voluntarily engag'd 
to me not to leave the Place without my Con- 
ient. 

Then I prefented to them the People I had 
brought with me, particularly the Taylor, the 
Smith, and the two Carpenters, all of them 
mod neeeifary People j but above all, my ge- 
neral Artificer, than whom they could not 
name any thing that was more ufeful to them. 
And the Taylor, to fhew his Concern for them; 
went to v/ork immediately, and, with my Leave, 
made them every one a Shirt the firll: Thing 
he did ; and which was flill more, he taught 
the Women, not only how to fow and flitch, 
and ufe the Needle, but made them aflift to make 
the Shirts for their Husbands, and for ail the 
refl. 

As to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention 
how ufeful they were, for they took in Pieces all 
my clumfy unhandy Things, and made them clever 
convenient Tables, Stools, Bed-fteads, Cup-boards, 
Lockers, Shelves, and every thing they wanted 
of that Kind. 

But to let them fee how Nature made Arti- 
ficers at firft, I carried the Carpenters to fee WUL 
Atkins's Basket-houfe, as 1 call'd it, and they both 
own'd they never faw an Lnflance of fuch natural 
Ligenuity before ; nor any thing fo regular, and 
{o handily built, at lead of its Kind : And one oi 
them, when he faw it, after mufing a good while, 
turning about to me, I am fure, fays he, that Man 
has no need of u-, you need do nothing but give 
him Tools. 

Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, 
and gave every Man a Digging- Spade, a Shovel, 

and 



t liS ] 

and a Rake, for we had no Harrotvs or Plows > 
and to every feparate Place, a Pick-axe, Crow* 
a broad Axe, and a Saw ; always appointing^ 
that as often as any were broken, 6r worn Out> 
they fhouid be fupply'd without grudging, out of 
the general Stores that 1 1 eft behind. 

NailsjStaplesjHingeSjHan^mersjChiflelSjKnives, 
Scifl'ars, and all fores of Tools, and ilron-work, 
they had without Tale, as they required, for no 
Man would care to take more than they wanted, 
and he mufl be a Fool that would wade br fpoil 
them, on any Account whatever ; and for the Ufe 
of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron 
for a Supply. 

My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I 
brought them, was fuch, even to Profufion, that 
they could not>but rejoice at them ; for now they 
could march as I us^d to do, with a Musket upon 
each Shoulder, if there was Occafion, and were 
able to fight a thoufand Savages, if they had but 
fome little Advantages of Situation, which aifo 
they could not mifs of, if they had Occafion. 

1 carry 'd on Shore with me the young Man, 
whofe Mother was flarv^'d to Death, and the 
Maid alfo ; (he was a fober, well educated^ reli- 
gious young Woman, and behav'd fo inoffenfive- 
ly, that every one gave her a good Word ; fhe 
had indeed an unhappy Life with us, there being no 
Woman in the Ship but herfelf ; but fhe bore it with 
Patience. After a while feeing Things fo well or- 
der'd, and in fo fine a way of thriving upon my 
Ifland, and confidering that they had neither Biifi- 
nefsor Acquaintance in the Eajl-Indles^ orReafon 
for taking folonga Voyage : I fay, confidering ali 
this, both of them came to me, and defir'd I wouid ; 
give them leave to remain on the Ifland^ and be en- 
tered among my Family, as they call'd it. 

I agreed 



[ 1^9 ] 

^ t agreed to it readily, and they had a little 
Plat ot Ground allotted to them, where they had 
three Tents or Houfes fet up, liirrounded with 
a Basket-work, PahTado'd like Atkins' Sy adjoining 
to his Plantation : Their Tents were contriv'd 
fo, that they had each oF them a Room apart to 
lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store- 
houfe to lay all their Goods in, and to eat and 
drink in. And now the other two Ryighfl) Men re- 
moved their Habitation to the fame Place, and fo 
the Ifland was ^\viA^(\ into three Colonies^andno 
more, viz,, the Spaniards with old Friday^ and the 
firft Servants, at my old Habitation under the 
Hill ; which was, in a Word, the capital Gity ; 
and where they had fo enlarged and extended their 
Works, as well under, as on the Out-lide of the 
Hill, that they liv^'d, tho' perfedly conceal'd, 
yet full at large. Never was their fuch a little Ci- 
ty in a Wood, and fo hid, 1 believe, \\\ any Part 
of the World; for I verily believe, a thotifand 
Men might haverang'd the Ifland a Month, and 
if they had not known there was fuch a Thing, and 
lookM on purpofe for it, thisy would not have found 
if, for the Trees ftood fo thick, and fo clofe, and 
grew fo fail matted into one another, that no- 
thing but cutting them down firjR: could difcovet: 
the Place; except the only two narrow Entrances, 
where they w^nt in and out, could be found, which 
was not very eafy. One of them v/as juft down 
at the Wa:er-£dge of the Creek, and it was 
afterwards above two hundred Yards to the Place ; 
and the other was up the Ladder at twice, as 
I have already formerly defcrib'd it \ and they 
had a large Wood thick planted, alfo, on the 
Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an 
Acre, which grew apace, and covcr'd the Place 
from all Difcovery there, with only one narrow 
Part a it Plat© 



\ 



[ 1^0 1 

Place between two Trees, noteafy to be difebverMi 
to enter on that Side. 

The other Colony v/as that of /^//. Atkins, 
where there were four Families of Englifi Men, 
I mean thofe I had left there, with their Wives 
and Children; three Savages that were Slaves ^ 
the Widow and Children of the EnglifJ) Man that 
was kiird, the young Man and the Maid; and 
by the way, we made a Wife of her alfo, before 
'we went away : There were alfo the two Carpen- 
ters and the Taylor, whom i brought with me for 
them ; alfo the Smith, who was a very neceffary 
Man to them, efpecially as a Gunfmich, to take 
care of their Arms ; and my other Man, whom I 
called, Jack of all Tirades, who was in himfelf as 
good, almoft, as 20 Men ; for he was not only a 
very ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, 
and before I went away, we married him to the 
honeft Maid that came with the Youth in the Ship 
I mention^ before. 

And now I fpeak of Marrying, it brings me na- 
turally to fay fomething of the French Ecclefiaflick 
that I had brought with me out of the Ship's 
Crew whom I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man 
ivas a Roman^ and perhaps it may give Oftence to 
fome hereafter, if 1 leave any Thing extraordina- 
ry upon Record, of a Man, whom, before I begin, 
1 muft, (to fer him out in juft Colours) reprefenc 
in Terms very much to his Difad vantage, in the 
Account of Proteftants; zsfiyft, that he was a Pa- 
pifi; fecomlly, a Popifh Prieft; and thirdly, diFrench 
Popifh Prieft. 

But Juftice demands of me to give him a due 
Character ; and I muft fay, he was a grave, fober, 
pious, and moft religious Perfon ,- exad in his 
Life, extcnfive in his Charity, and exemplar in al-- 
moft every thing he did. What then can any one 

fay> 



i - 

[ 131 ] 

fay againft my being very fenfible of the Value of 
fuch a Man, notvvichftanding his Profeflion? The* 
it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the 
Opinion of others, who fhall read this, that he 
was miftaken. 

The firft Hour that I began to converfe with 
him, after he had agreed to go with me to the 
Eaft'Indies, I found Reafon to delight exceedingly 
in his Converfacion ; and he iirft began with me 
about Religion, in themoft obliging Manner ima- 
ginable. 

Sir, fays he, yoii have not only, under God, 
(and at that he crofs'd his Breaft) fav'd my 
Life, but you have admitted me to go this Voyage 
in your Ship, and by your obliging Civility have 
taken me into your Family, giving me an Op- 
portunity of free Converfation. Now Sir, fays 
he, you fee by my Habit what my Profeflion is, 
and I guefs by your Nation what yours is : I 
may think it is my Duty, and doubtlefs it is fo, 
to ufemyutmoft Endeavours, on all Occafions, to 
bring ail the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the 
Truth, and to embrace the Catholick Dodrine ; 
but as I am here under your Permiflion, and in 
your Family, I am bound in Juftlce to yourKind- 
nefs, as well as in Decency and good Manners, to 
be under your Government ; and therefore I fhall 
not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates 
on the Point of Religion, in which we may not 
agree farther than you fhall give me Leave. 

I told him, his Carriage was fo modefl, that I 
could not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, 
we were fuch People as they call'd Hereticks ; but 
that he was not the firft Catholick that I had con- 
versed with, without falling into any Inconvcnien- 
cies, or carrying the Queflions to any Height in 
K 2 Debate; 



[ 13^ 1 

Debate : That he ftioiild not find hlmfelf rHe 
Work ufcd tor being of a different Opinion from 
us, and if we did not converfe without any Dif- 
likc on cither Side upon that Seore, it fhould bb 
his Fault, not ours. 

He r.piy'd, That he thought all our Conver- 
fation migiit be cahly (eps rated from Difputps: 
That ft was not his Bulincls tocap I'rindpk: with 
every Man he difcours'd \^ich ; and that he ra- 
ther delir'd me to converfe with him as a Gen- 
tleman, than as a ReUgieufe\ that if 1 would 
give him Leave at .my 1 ime to difcourfc upon 
reh'gious Subjects, he would readily comply with 
it; and that then, he did not doubt but 1 would 
allow him alfo to defend his own Opinions, as 
well as he could; but that without my Leave he 
woijld not break in upon me with any fuch 
Thing, 

He told mc farther, That he would not cenfe 
to do all that became him in his Office, as a 
Prieft, as well as a private Chriflian, to procure 
the Good of the Ship, and the Safety of all 
that was \n her; and tho' perhaps wc would not 
join with him, and he could not pray voith us,- 
he hop'd he might pray /or us, which he would 
do upon all Occalions. In this Manner we con- 
vers'di and as he was of a moil obliging Gcntle- 
man-iike Behaviour, To he was, if i may be al- 
lowed to fay fo, a Man of good Senfe, and as 1 
believe, of great Learn'ng, 

He gave mc a moft diverting Account of his 
Life, and of the many extraordinary Events of it s 
of many Adventures which had befallen h;m in 
the few Years that he had been abroad \r) the 
World ; and particularly, this was very remar- 
kable, Qvi2,..) That in the Voyage he was now en- 
gaged, he had had the Misfortune to be five Times 

Ihipp'd 



[ 15? ] 

fliipp'd andiin(hipp'd,aiidnevcrtogotothe Place 
whither any of the Ships, he was in, were ac 
jfirft defign'd : That his fir It Intent was to have 
gone to MartinicOy and that he went on board a 
Ship bound thither, at St. M^/o ; but being forced 
into Lishfi by bad Weather, the Ship received' 
fome Damage by running aground la the Moutli 
of the River T"^^;^/, and wa<? obh'gcd to unloa(| 
her Cargo there: That finding a Portugiiefe Ship 
there bound to the Aladeras, and ready to faii^ 
and fuppofing he Ihouid ealily meet wich a Vct- 
fel there bound to Maninko ; he went on board, 
in Order to fail to the Maderas. Bur the Maffer 
of the Ponuguefe Ship being but an indifferent Ma- 
riner, had been out in his Reckoning, and fhcy 
drove ioFial\ whete, however, he happened io 
find a very goad Market for his Cargo, whicli 
was Corn, and therefore refolved not to go to 
the Maderas^ but to load Salt ac the JfleofMay^ 
and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no Re- 
medy in this Exigence, but to go with the Ship, 
and had a pretty good Voyage as far as the Banks^ 
fo they call the Place where they catch the Filh, 
where meeting wich a F/^/rc^ Shij>, bound from 
France to (^lebeck in the River of Canada^ and frorn 
thence to Martinico, to carry Provisions, he thought 
he (hould have an Opportunity to compleat his 
firfl: Defign : But when he came to Qucbeck, tht 
MaRer ofthe Ship dy'd, and the Ship proceeded 
no farther; fo the next Voyage he fhipp'd him^ 
felf tor France^ in the Ship that was burnt, when 
v/e took them up at Sea, and then fhipp'd with us 
for the Eaft Indies, as 1 have already (aid. Thus 
he had been difappointed in five Voyages, all, 
as I may call itj in one Voyage, befides what 1 fliall 
have Occafion to mention farchct of the fame 
Pcifon. 

K 5 Bur. 



[ 134 ] 

But, I (hall not make Digrefiions into other 
Mens StorieSj which have no P.elation to my 
own. I return to what concerns our Affair in the 
idand : He came to me one Morning, for he 
lodged among us all the while we were upon the 
Ifland \ and k happcn'd to be jufl: when 1 was go- 
ing to vifit the EngUfJ:^ Mens Colony at the far- 
theft Part of the llland ; 1 fay, he came to me, 
and told me, wich a very grave Countenance, 
That he had for two or three Days delir'd an 
Opportunity of fomc Difconife with me, which 
he nop*d would not bediiplcafing to me, becaufe 
he thought it might in fome Meaiure correfpond 
with my general De/ign, which was the Pro- 
fpericy of my new Colony, and perhaps might 
put it, at leaft more than he yet thought it was, 
in the Way of God's Blefling. 

Ilook'd a little furpriz*d ac the laft Part of his 
Difcourfe, and turning a Vxi\t iliort, How Sir, 
faid I, can it befaid^ that we are not in the Way 
of God's Blefling, after fuch ijiji^k Jffiftances Siud 
wcnderful Deliver ames^ as we have {ten here^ and 
pfiuhkh I have given you a large Account ? 

If you had pleas'd Str, fatd he^ with a world of 
Modejiy, and jet with great ^eadinejs, to have heard 
me, you would have found no room to have 
been difpleas'd, much lefs to think fo hard of me, 
that I fhould fuggefl, that ycu have not had won- 
derful i^fliftances and Deliverances-, and I hope, 
on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's 
Blefling, and your Dciignb exceeding good, and 
will profper : But, Sir, tho' k were more fo, 
than is even pofl^ible to you, vet there may be 
forrie among you that are not equally right in 
their A6fions: And you know, that in the Story 
of the Children otJJrael, one Jchau in the Camp, 
remov'd God's Blefling from them, and turned 

his 



r 155 ] 

bis Hand fo sgainft them, that fix and thirty of 
them, rho' not concerned in the Crime, were 
the Objeft of Divine Vengeance, and bore the 
Weight of that PuniQiment. 

Iwasfeniibly touched with his Difcourfe, and 
rold him^ his Inference was fojiifl, and the whole 
Defign feem'd fo (incere, and was really fo reli- 
gious in its own Nature, that I was^ very forry I 
had interrupted him, and begg'd him to goon^ 
and in the mean Time, becaufe it (ecm'd, that 
what we had both to fay might take up fome 
Time, 1 told him, I was going ro the Fjtg/ifi Mens 
Plantations, and ask'd him to go with mc, and 
we might difcourfe of it by the Way : He told 
me, he would more willingly wait on me thither, 
becaufe there partly the Thing was afted, which 
he dcfir'd to fpcak to me about ; fo we walk'd 
on ; and I prcfs'd him to be free and plam with 
me in what he had to fay. 

Why then, Sir, fays he, be pleafed to give me 
Leave to lay down a few Propofitions as the Foun- 
dation of what I have to fay, that we may not 
differ m the general Principles, tho' we may be 
of fome differing Opinions in the Praftice of Par- 
ticulars. Firft, Sir, tho' we differ in fome of 
the dodrinal Articles of Religion ; and it is very 
unhappy that ic is fo, efpecially in the Cafe be- 
fore us, as I fhall fhew afterwards : Yet rhere 
are fome general Principles in which we both a- 
gree, (viz..) firfl, That there is a God; and that 
this God havinggiven us fome dated general Rules 
for our Serv ice and Obedience, we ought not wil- 
lingly and knowingly to offend him ^ either by ne- 
gleding to do what he has commanded, or by do- 
ing what he hasexprefsly forbidden : And let our 
d;iTerent Reh'gions be what they will, this g- neral 
Principle is readily own*d by us all, That theBlef- 
iing of God does not ordinarily follow a prefum- 
K 4 ptuous 



[ 13^1 

ptuous sinning againft his Command ; and every 
good Chr.ftian will be affedionately concerned to 
prevent i»ny that are under his Care, living in a total 
Negled of God and his Commands. It is not your 
Men being Prote[lants,.>}vhatever my Opinion may 
be of fuch, that difcharges me from being con- 
f:ern'd for their Souls, and from end-avouring, if 
it lies before me, that they fhould live in as little 
Diflance from an Enmity with their Maker, as 
pofTible, efi^ccially if you give me Leave to med- 
dle (c far in your Circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he a.m'd at, and 
told him, I granted all he had faid, and thank'd 
him, that he would fo far concern himfelf for us ; 
and begg'd he would explain the Particulars of 
what he had obferv'd, that, like Joflniay to. take 
his own Parable, I might put away the accurfed 
Thing from us. 

Why then. Sir, fays he, I will take the Liber- 
ty ypu give me ; and there are three Things, 
which, it I am right, muft ftand in the Way of 
God's BkfTing upon your Endeavours here, and 
which I fliould rejoice for your fake, and their 
own, to fee remov'd. And, Sir, fays he, I pro- 
mife myfdfy that you will fully agree with me in 
them all, as foon as I name them ; efpecialJy be- 
Caufe I Ihall convince you^ that every one of them 
ma} , with great Eafe, and very much to your Sa- 
tisfaction, bw remedy 'd. 

He gave me no Leave to put in any more Ci- 
vilities, but went on. Firft, Sir, fays he, you 
have here tour Er??J^fi Men, who have tetch'd Wo- 
men from among the Savages, and have taken 
them as theii- Wives, and have had many Chil- 
dren by them all, aiid yet are not marry 'd to them 
after any ftatcd legal Manner, as the Laws of 
God and Man require , and therefore are yet, in 

the 



[ 137] 

the Senfe of both, no lefs than Adulterers, and li- 
ving in Adultery. To this. Sir, fays he, I know 
you will obje^, That there was no Clergyman 
or Priefc of any Kind, or of any ProfelTion, to 
perform the Ceremony j nor any Pen and Ink, or 
Paper, to write down a Contrad of Marriage, 
ai:d have it lign'd between them. And I know 
alfo. Sir, what the Spaniard Governour has told 
you ; I mean of the Agreement that he oblig'd 
them to make, wh^n they took thefe Women (viz,.) 
That they fliould chufe them out by Confent, and 
keep feparately to them i which, by the way, is 
nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the 
Women, as Wives, but only an Agreement among 
themfelves, to keep them from Quarrelling. 

Bur, Sir, the Eflfence of th^ Sacrament of Ma- 
trimony (fo he call'd it, being a, Roman) co^fills 
not only in the mutual Confent of the Parties to 
take one another, as Man and Wife, but in the 
formal and legal Obligation, that there is ih the 
Contract, to compel the Man and Woman at alif 
Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obli- 
ging the Men to abftain from all other Women, to 
engage in no other Contrad while thefe fubfill ; 
and on all Occafions, as Ability allows, to pro- 
vide honeflly for them and their Children, and to 
oblige the Woman to the fame, or like Conditions, 
mutatis mutandis^ on their Side. 

Now, Sir, fays he, thefe Men may, when they 
pleafe, or when Occalion prefents, abandon thefe 
Women, difown their Children, leave them to pe- 
rifh, and take other Women, and marry them 
whilfl: thefe are living. And here he added, with 
fome Warmth, How, Sir, is God honoured in this 
unlawful Liberty ? And how fhall a Bleffing fuc- 
cced your Endeavours in this Place ? However good 
in tbemjclves, an4 hovjcver Jincere in your Defign^ 

while 



C 158 ] 

while thefe Men, who at prefent are your Suh- 
jeds, under your abfolute Government and Do- 
minion, are allowed by you to Ii_ve in open A- 
dultery ? 

I confefs, I was flruck at the Thing itfelf, but 
much more with the convincing Arguments he 
fupportcd it with ; for it was certainly true, that 
tho' they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a 
formal Contract on both Sides, made before Wit- 
tefles, and confirm'd by any Token, which they had 
all agreed to' be bound by, tho' it iiad been but 
breaking a Stick between thpm, engaging the Men 
to own. thefe Women for their Wives, upon all 
Occafions, and never to abandon them or theic 
Children, and the Women to the fame with their 
Husbands, had been an effectual lawful Marriage 
in the Sight of God i and it was a great Neglect 
that it was not don?. 

But I thought to have gotten off v/ith my young 
Prieft, by telling him, that all that Part was done 
when I was not here, and they had liv'd fo many 
Years with them nov/, that if it was an Adultery, 
it was pafl Remedy, they could do nothing in ic 
now. 

Sir, fa}s he, aski'/ig your Pardon for fuch Freedom^ 
you are right in this, that it being done in your 
Abfence, you could not be charged with that Part 
of the Crime : But I befeech you, flatter notyour- 
felf, that you are not therefore under an Obliga- 
tion to do your utmoft now to put an End to it. 
How can yon think, but that, let the Time paft 
Jye on whom it will, all the Guilt, for the future, 
will lye entirely upon you ? Becaufe it is certainly 
in your Power now to put an End to it, and in no 
Body's Power but yours. 

I was (o dull flil], that I did not take him right ; 
but I imagined, that by putting an End to it, he 

meant; 



C 139 ] 

meant that I (hould part them, and not fuffer them 
to live together any longer: And Ifaidto hiniyl 
could not do this by any Means, for that it would 
put the whole Ifland into ConFufion. He feem^d 
furprized, that I (hould fo far miftake him. No, 
Sir, fays be, I do not mean, that you fhould now 
feparate them, but legally and eifedually marry 
them now ; and as. Sir, my Way of marrying them 
pi ay not be fo eafy to reconcile them to, tho' it 
will be as effectual, even by your own Laws, fo 
your Way may be as well before God, and as va-. 
lid among Men ; I mean, by a written Contrad, 
figned by both Man and Woman, and by all the 
Witnelfes prefent, which all the Laws of Europe 
would decree to be valid. 

I was amazed to fee fo much true Piety, and fo 
much Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unufual Impar- 
tiality in his Difcourfe, as to his own Party or 
Church, and fuch true Warmth for the preferving 
People that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation 
to ; I fay, for preferving them from tranfgreffing 
the Laws of God i the like of which 1 had in- 
deed not met with any where. But recolleding 
what he had faid, of marrying them by a written 
Contraft, which I knew would fland too ; I re- 
turned it back upon him, and told him, I granted 
all that he had faid to be juft, and on his Pare 
very kind, that I would difcourfe with the Men 
upon the Point now, when I came to them. And 
I knew no Reafon why they fhould fcruple to let 
him marry them all, which I knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentick and valid in. 
England, as it tliey were married by one of our 
own Clergymen. What was afterwards done in 
this Matter, I fhall fpeak of by itfelf. 

I then prefs'd him to tell me what was the Second 
Complaint v/hich he had to make, acknowledging, 

that 



[ HO ] 

that 1\v3lS very much his Debtor for the Fiyfiy and 
thanked him heartily for it. He told me, he would 
life the fame Freedom and Plainnefs in the Second, 
and hoped I would take it as well. And this was. 
That iiOtwiLhltanding the ft Engl :fl Subject s oi mine y 
as he called them, had lived with thofe Women for 
almoif ftveu Years, had taught them to fpeak Erig- 
ii{l?, and even to read it ; and that they were, as 
he perceived, Women of tolerable Undcrflanding, 
?.nd capable of Initriiction ; yet they had not to 
this Hour taught them any thing of the Chrifrian 
Religion, no, not fo much as to know that there 
was a God, or a Worfliip, or in what Manner 
God was to be fetved, or that their own Idolatry, 
and worfhipping they knew not whom, was falfe 
snd abfurd. 

This, he faid, was an unaccountable Negled, 
and what God would certainly call them to Ac- 
count for, and perhaps at laft take the Work out 
of their Hands. He fpoke this very aftedtionately 
;ind warmly. I am perfwaded, jays he, had thofc 
Men lived in the Savage Country, whence their 
Wives came, the Savages would have taken more 
Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, and 
to worfhip the Devil, than any of thefe Men, fo 
j'oY as he could fee, had taken with them to teach 
them the Knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir, 
/aid he, tho' I do not acknowledge your Religion, 
or you mine, yet we fl:ould be glad to fee the De- 
vil's Servants, and the Subjeccs of his Kingdom, 
taught to know the general Principles of the Chri- 
ftian Religion'; that they might, at leafl, hear of 
God, and era Pvcdeemer, and of the Refurrection, 
and of a future State, Things which we all be- 
lieve ; they had at leaf! been fo much nearer com-* 
in^ into the Bofom of thetruc Church, than they 

^r& 



[ m 1 

are !io\^ in the publick ProkfTion of Idolatry and 
Devil-Worfiiip. 

1 could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, 
and embraced him with an Excefs oi PafTion. How 
far, fatd I to him^ have 1 been from underftanding 
the mod e{{ential Part of a Chriftian ( wz>.) ro 
love the Intereft ot the Chriftian Church, and the 
good of other Mens Sou is. I fcarce have known 
what belongs to being a Chriflian. O, Sir, do 
not fay fo, reply' d he^ this Thing is not your Fault- 
'^Oyfays /, but why did I never lay it ro Heart as 
v/ell as you ? 'Tis not too late y^x^faid he^ be not 
too forward to condemn your feif. But what can be 
done now, /aid ly you fee I am going away ? VViii 
you give me Leave, faidhe, to talk with thefepoor 
Men about it ? Yes, with all my Heart, faid /, 
and I will oblige them to give Heed to what you 
fay too. As to that, /aid he, we muft leave them 
to the Mercy of Chrift j but it is our Bufinefs to 
aiTiil: them, encourage them, and inilruci: them ; 
and if you will give me Leave, and GodhisBlef- 
fine, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant Souls 
(hall be brought Home into the great Circle of 
Chriftianity, into the particular Faith that we 
all embrace, and that even v/lnle you ilay here. 
Upon this, IJaidy Iftiall not only give you Leate, 
but give you a thoufand Thanks for it. What fol- 
lowed on this Account, I (hall mention alfo again 
in its Place. 

I now prefs'd him for the T'bh-d Article, in which 
we were to blame. Why reaij}', fays hey it is of 
the fame Nature ,* and I will proceed, asking yozir' 
Leave, with the fame Plainnefs as before. It is a- 
bout your poor Savages, who arc, as I may fay,' 
your conquered Subjedts. It is a Maxim, Sir, that 
is or ought to be received among all Chriftians of 
what Church or pretended Church foever, (viz..) 

The 



[ Hi ] 

T'be Chriflian Knotjcledge ought to be propagated ly aU 
pcffibk Means y and on allpojpble Occafwns. 'Tis on 
this Principle that our Church fends Miflionaries 
into Perjia^ India, and China, and that our Clergy, 
even ot the fuperior Sort, willingly engage in the 
mod: hazardous Voyages, and the moft dangerous 
Refidence among Murderers and Barbarians, to 
teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and 
to bring them over to embrace the Chriftian Faith. 
Now, Sir, you have fuch an Opportunity here, 
to have fix or feven and thirty poor Savages 
brought over from Idolatry to the Knowledge of 
God their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder 
how you can pafs fuch an Occafion of doing 
Good, which is really worth the Expence of a 
Man's whole Life. 

I was now ftruck dumb indeed, and had not 
one Word to fay. I had here a Spirit of true 
Chriftian Zeal for God and Religion before me, 
let his particular Principles be of what Kind fo- 
ever. As for me, I had not fo much as entertai- 
ned a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I 
believe fhould not have thought of it ; for I looked 
upon thefe Savages as Slaves, and People, whom^ 
had \VQ had any Work for them to do, we would 
ha* ufed as Tuch, or would ha' been glad to have 
tranfported them to any other Part of the World j 
tor our Bufinefs was to get rid of them, and we 
would all have been fatisfied, ii they had been 
fent to any Country, fo they had never feen their 
own. But to the Cafe. I fay, I was confounded at 
his Difcourfe, and knew not what Anfwer to make 
him. He looked earneftly at me, feeing me in 
fome Diforder. Sir, fays he, I jQiall be very forr}'', 
if what I have faid gives you any Offence. No, 
no, fays /, I am offended with no Body but my 
felf: But I am perfectly confounded, not only to 

think 



l H3l 

think that I fiiould never take any Notice of this 
before, but with refleding what Notice I am able 
to take of it now. You know. Sir, Jaid J, what 
Circumftances I am in ; I am bound to the Eajh 
hdiesy in a Ship freigfited by Merchants, and to 
whom it would be an unfufterable Piece of Inju- 
ftice to detain their Ship here, the Men Jying all 
this while at Viduals and Wages upon the Own- 
ers Account, It is true, I agreed to be allowed 
twelve Days here, and if I flay more, 1 muft pay 
5 /. Stirling per Diem Dcmorage, nor can I ftay up- 
on Demorage above eight Days more, and I have 
been here thirteen Days already, fo that I am per- 
fedly unable to engage in this Work, unlefs I would 
fufter my felf to be left behind here again, in which 
Cafe, i( this fingle Ship fhould itiifcarry in any 
Part of her Voyage, I lliould be juft in the fame 
Condition that I was left: in here at iirO:, and from 
which I have been fo wonderfully delivered. 

He owned the Cafe was very hard upon me, as 
to my Voyage, but laid it Home upon my Con- 
fcience, whether the Bleffing of faving feven and 
thirty Souls, was not worth my venturing all I had 
in the VV^orld for? I was notfo fenfible of ihd.tas 
he ivas. I returned upon him thus. Why, Sir, it 
is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Inftrument 
in God's Hand to Convert feven and thirty Hea- 
thens to the Knowledge of Chrifl, but as you are 
an EcclefiaPiick, and are given overS:o the VVork, fo 
that it feems fo naturally to fall into the Way of 
your Profeffion ; how is it, that you do not rather 
offer your felf to undertake it, than prefs me to it'? 

Upon this he fac'd about, juft before me, as 
we v^^alk'd along, and putting me to a full Stop, 
made me a very low Bow. I mod heartily thank 
God and you, Sir, fays he, for giving me fo evi- 
dent a Call to fo biefied a Work,- and if you think 

your 



[ 144 ] 

jToitr felf difcharg d from it, and dcfire me to un- 
dertake it, I will mofl readily doit, and think it 
a happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficul- 
ties oi fuch a broken difappointed Voyage as I 
have met with, that I may be dropt at laft into 
£o glorious a Work. 

1 difcover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while 
hefpoke th sto me, his £)^es fparklM like Fire, his 
Face glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as 
if he had been falling into Fits. In a Word, lie was 
fir'd with the Joy of being embark 'd in fuch a 
Work. 1 paus^a a confiderable while before I could 
tell what to fay to him, for I was really furpriz'd 
to find a Man of fuch Sincerity and Zeal, and car- 
ry 'd out in his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of 
Men, not of his ProfeiTion only, but even of any Pro- 
feflion whatfoever. But after I had conlider'd it 
a-while, I askM hh.. fe^iouDy i( he was in earneft, 
and that he wo'ild venture on the iingle Confidera- 
tionofary Attempt on Jiofe poor People, to be 
lock'd up in an unplanted Ifland for, perhaps, his 
Life, and ac laft might not know whether he fhould 
be able to do them any Good, or not? 

He turnM fhort upon me, and ask'd me what I 
call'd a Venture? Pray, Sir, /aid he, what do 
you think I confented to go in your Ship to the 
Eafi- Indies for} Nay, /aid I, that I know not, 
unlefs it was to preach to the Indians: Doubt- 
lefs it was, faid he; and do you think, if 1 
can convert thefe feven and thirty Men to the 
Faith of Chrift, it is not worth my Time^ tho' I 
ftiould never be ferch'd off the Ifland again,- 
nay, is it not infinitely of more Worth to fave fo 
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twen- 
ty more of the fame Profefiion ? Yes, Sir, Jays he^ 
I would giveChrill and the bleflfed Virgin Thanks 
all my Days, if I could be made the ieaft happy 

lnftr«- 



t H5 ] 

Inftrurtient bffaving the Souls of thefe poor Men, 
tho' I was never to fet my Foot off of this Ifland, 
or fee my native Country any mote. But iince 
yon will honour me, fays he, with putting me into 
this Work, for ubtch I will pray for you all the Days of 
my Life ; I have one humble Petition to you, faili 
he, befides. What is that, faid I ? Why, [^Lys 
he, ic is, that you will leaveyour Man Friday with 
me, to I be my Interpreter to them, and to afllft 
me j tor without fome Help I cannot fpeak to them, 
or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requeftjng Friday^ 
becanfe I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many Reafons ; he had been the Compa- 
nion of my Travels ; he was not only faithful to 
me, but fincerely affcdionate to the laft Degree, 
and I had refolv'd to do fomething coniiderablefor 
him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable he 
would. Then I knew that, as I had bvcd Friday 
np to be a Proteflant, it would quite confound him 
to bring him to embrace another Profeffion , and 
he would never, while his Eyes were open, be- 
lieve that his oldMafler was a Heretick, and would 
be damn'd ; and this might in the End ruin the 
poor Fellow's Principles, and fo turn him to his 
iirft Idolatry. 

However, a fudden Thought reliev'd me hi 
this Strait, and it v/as this ; I told him, I could 
not fay that I was willing to part with Friday on 
any Account whatever, tho' a Work that to him 
was of more Value than his Life, ought to be tp 
me of much lefs Value than the keeping or parting 
with a Servant. But on the other hand, I was per- 
fwaded, that Friday wou'd by no Means confent to 
part with me, and I could not force him to it 
without his Confent, without manifeil Injuftice, be- 
Part JL L caufe 



caiifel had promised and engag'd him to me, that 
%^ wonid never leave me, un.cls I pur him away. 
' He TeemM very hiuch concerned at it, for he had 
ro r&pnal Accefs to thefc poor People, feeing he 
«i.'d n^undcrftand one Word of their Language, 
^ipr they one Word of b.is. To remove this Diffi- 
culty, I told him, Prrda/s Father had learn 'd Spa- 
tiijlpy which 1 found he alio iinderliood, and he 
ilioiildf^rve him for an Interpreter ; fo he was much 
l:)etter fatisfied, and nothing could perfvvade him, 
l3Ut he would Aay to endeavour to convert them ; 
but Providence gave another, and very happy 
iTurn to all tiiis. 

*" I come back now to the flril: Part of his Ob- 
Jedions. When we came to tiie EngU(J) Men, I 
fent for them all together, and after feme Ac- 
tount given them of what I had done for them, 
wiz.. whzt neceflary Things I had provided for 
them, and how they were diflributed, which 
they were very fenfible of, and very thankful 
for; 1 began to talk to them of the fcandalous 
Life they led, and'gave them a full Account of the 
Notice the Ciergyman had already taken of ir> 
and arguing how unchriftian and irreligious a 
Life it was. Ilirli askM them if they were mar- 
ried Men or Bacchelors ? They foon explain'd 
their Condition to me, and fliew'd me that tv/o 
of them were W^idowcrs, and the oth^r three wei'C 
iTngle Men or Bacchelors. I ask^'d them with what 
Confcicnces they could take thefe Women and lye 
Vvith them, as they had done, call them their 
Wives, and have (o many Children by them, and 
*>e)t be marry 'd lawfully to them. 

They all gave me the Anfvt^er that I expeded, 
i}iz^~ tliat there ^vas no Body to marry them j that 
t1iey agreed before the Governor ,to keep them as 
'licit Wivc^; aiid to keep them and own them as 
^ " ' ^ *"^ 'their 



[ 147 1 

tiTfeir Wives ; and they thought, as Things flood 
with them, tliey were as legally married as if they 
had been married by a Paribn, and with all the 
Formalities in the World. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married 
in the Sight of God, and were bound in Confci'- 
ence to keep them as their Wives, but that the 
Laws ot Men being otherwife, they might pre- 
tend they were not married, and Co defert the poor 
Women and Children hereafter ; and that their 
Wives being poor defolace Women, friendlefs and 
moneylefs, would have no way to help themfelveSi 
I therefore told them, that unlefs I was aiTurM of 
their honell: Intent, I could do nothing for them ; 
but would take Care that what I did fhould be for 
the Women and their Children without them ; and 
that unlefs they would give fome Ailurances that 
they'would marry the Women, I could not think 
it was convenient they ihould continue together as 
Man and Wife, for that it was both fcandalous to 
Men, and offenfivc to God, who they could not 
think would blefs them, if they went on thus- 

All this went on as I expected, and they told 
me, efpecially WilL Atkins^ who feem'd now to 
fpeak for the reft, that they lov'd their S}Ji\Qs as 
well, as iC they had been born m their own Na- 
tive Country, and would not leave thein upon 
any Account whatever ; and they did very believe 
their Wives were as virtuous and as modeft, 
and did, to the utmofl: of their Skill, as much for 
them, and for their Children, as any Women 
could poffibly do^ and they would not part with 
them on any Account. And TViIl. Atkins for his 
own Particular added> i^ any Man would take 
him away, and offer to carry him Home to Eng- 
land, and make him Captain of the beft Man of 
War in the Navy, he would not go with him. 
La ' if 



[ 148 ] 

if he might not cdrry hisWiFc and Children with 
him ; and iF there was a Clergyman in the Ship, 
he would be married to her now with all his 
Heart. 

This was jiift as I would ])ave it ; the Pried: 
was rot with me at that Moment, but was i.ct 
•far oft : So to ny him farther, J told him 1 had 
a Clergjman with me, and iF he was lincere, I 
would have him married iliC next Morning, and 
bid him confider of it, and talk with the reft. 
He faid, as for himfelf*, he need not confiderof it 
at all, for lie was very ready to do ir, and was 
^lad I had a Minifter with me, and he belicv'd 
ihey would be all willing alfo. 1 then told him 
that my Friend the Minifter was a Eencb Man, 
and could not fpenk EngliJ}), but that I would ad 
the Clerk between tliem : [Je never fo much as 
ask'd me whether ht was Papift or Protcflant, 
wiiich was indeed what 1 was afraid of: But, I 
fay, they never cnquir'd about it. So we part- 
ed, I went back to mv Clergyman, and Will. At- 
kins went in to talk with his Companions. I de- 
fir'd the French Gentleman not to fay any thing to 
them, till the Buiinefs was thorough ripe, and I 
cold him what Aiifwer the Men had given me. 

Before I went from their Quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me, they had been confidering 
what I had faid i that they were very glad to hear 
I had a Clergyman xw my Company, and they 
were very willing to 2X\'t me the Satisfadcion I de- 
fir'd, and to be formally Married as foon as I 
pleased s fof they were tar from defiring to part 
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but 
what was very honeft wh'«n they chofe them : So I 
appointed them to meet me the next Mornin^^ and 
that in the mean time they lliould let their Wives 
kaovv the meaning of the Marriage-Law , and that 

it 



[ H9 ] 

it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but alfo 
to oblige them, that they ihould not forfake then[i, 
whatever might happen. 

The Women v^^ere eafily made fenfibleof the 
Meaning oF the Thing, and were very well fatis- 
fied with it, as, indeed, ihey had Realon to be; io 
they fail'd not to attend all together at my Apart- 
ment the next Morning, where I brought out my 
Clergyman ; and tho^ he had not on a Miniiler's 
Gown, after the Manner of England^ or the Ha- 
bit of a Prieft, after the Manner of France ; yet 
having a black Vert fomerhing like a CalTock, with 
a Safh round ft, he did not look very unlike a Mi- 
nifter j and as for his Language, 1 was his Inter- 
prcter. 

But the Serioufnefs of his Behaviour to them, 
and the Scrup:es he made of marrying the V/or- 
men, becaufe they were not baptfz'd, and pro^ 
fefs'd Chriftiansy gave them -an exceeding Reve- 
rence for his Perfon ; and there was no need afrei: 
that, to enquire whether he was a Qergymah or 
no. 

Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have 
been carry 'd fo far, as that he would not have 
marry 'd them at all ; nay, notwithflanding all I 
was able to fay to him, he refilled me, though 
modeftly, yet very fteadily, and at laflrefufed ab- 
foluteiy to marry them, unlefs he had firfl talk'd 
wich the Men, and the Women too; and though 
at firfl I was a little backward to [z, yet at laft I 
agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the Sin- 
cerity or his Defign. 

When he came to them, he let them know, 
that I had acquainted him with their Circum- 
ftances, and with the prefent Defign : That he 
was very willing to perform that Part of his Fun- 
d;ion, and marry them as I had delii'd i but that 
L z before 



[ 150 ] 

before he could do ir, he mufl take the Liberty 
to talk with them. He told them, That in the 
Sight of all inditfcrent Men, and in the Senfe o£ 
the Laws of Society, they had iiv'd all this 
while in an open Adultery ; and that it was true^, 
that nothing but the Confencing to marry, or ef- 
fedually feparating them from one another now, 
could pi^t an End to it ; but there was a Difficul- 
ty in it too, with refpcct to the Laws ot: Chri- 
flian Matrimony, which he was not tully fatisfy'd 
about, T72:,. That of marrying one that is a pro- 
fefs'd Chrifiian, to a Savage, an Idolater, and a 
Heathen, one that is not baptized ; and yet that 
he did Eo: fee that there was Time left for it 
to endeavour to perfwade the Women to be bap- 
;tiz'd, or. to profefs the Name ot Chrift^ whom they 
had, he doubted, heard nothing ot, and without 
which they could not be baptized. 

He told them. He doubted they were but in- 
different Chriftians themfelves i that they had but 
iittle Knowledge of God, or of his Ways j and 
therefore he could not expert that they had faid 
much to their ^>^^ivts on:that Head yet j but that 
unlefs they would promife him to ufe tiieir Endea- 
vour with their Wives, to perfwade them to become 
Chrifdans, and would as, well as they could inftrud: 
them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that 
made them, and to worfhip Jefus Chrift that re* 
deem'd them, he could not marry them ; for he 
would hare no Hand in joir.ing Chnitians with 
Savages j nor was it confiitent with ti:e Principles 
of the Chriilian Religion i and was indeed ex- 
prefsly forbidden in. God's Law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I de- 
liver'd it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, 
as near his own Words as I could, only fome- 
times adding fomething of my own to convince 

them. 



[ 151 ] 

them how juft it was, and ho\') I was of his Mind ; 
and 1 always very faithfully dii\ nguiflied becweea 
what I {^id for 'my fclf, and what were the Cler- 
gyman's Words. They told me, it vas very true, 
what the Gencleman had faid, that they were but 
very indifferent Cbriflians diemfclves, and that they 
never talk'd to their Wives about Religion. Lord, 
Sir i fays IVili. Atkins, how fnould we reach them 
Religion ? Why, we know nothing our felves i 
and belides. Sir, faid hey lliouid we go to talk 
to them of G^^<i, and J ef as Cbnfl, and ILaven and 
Hdl, 'twould be to make them laugh at us. ancl 
ask us. What we' believe our feives ? And if we 
lliould tell them .we believe all the Things that 
we fpeak of to them ; (vxh as of good People 
going to HeaveUy and wieked People to the De^ 
vil, they would ask us, Where we intend to go 
cur feives, that believe all this, and are fuch wick- 
ed Fellows, as we indeed are ? Why, Sir, 'tisr 
enough to give them a Surfeit of Rehgioa ac firft 
Hearing. Folks muft have fome Religion them- 
felves, before they pretend to teach orher People. 
l-Vill. Atkins, faid I to him, tho' I am afraid what 
you fay has too much Truth in it,' yet can you 
not tell your Wife that Hii^'s in the wrong ? That 
there is a God, and a Religion better than her 
own ; That her Gods are Idols, that they .can 
neither hear nor fpeak; That there is a great Be- 
ing tiiat made all Things, and that can deftroy all 
thai he had made ; That he rewards the Good, 
and punishes the Bad : And, that we are to be 
judged by him at lad for all we do here. You 
are no: fo ignorant, but even Nature it felf will 
teach you that all this is true, and I am fatisfi- 
ed you know it all to be true, and believe it 
your ielf. 

L 4 That's 



[ 152 ] 

That's true, Sir, /aid Atkins ; but with what 
Face can 1 fay any Thing to my Wife of all this, 
when 111? vyill tell me immediately it cannot be 
true? 

Not true, /aid I ! What do you mean by that ? 
Why, Sir, /aid he, flie will tell me it cannot be 
true, that this God I fhall tell her of can be juft, 
orcanpunifh, or reward, fince I am not punifh'd, 
and fent to the Devil, that have been fuch a 
wicked Creature as (he knows I have been, even 
to her, and to every Body elfe ; and that 1 fhould 
be fuffered to live, that have been always ading 
fo contrary to what I mufl tell her is Good, and 
to what I ought to have done ? 

Why, truly, Atkim, .hid /, I am afraid thou 
fpeakefl too much Truth : Ar^d with that I let the 
Clergyman know what Atkins had (aid, for he was 
impatient to know. O ! /aid the Priejh tell him 
there is one Thing will make him the bed Minifter 
jn the World to his Wife, and that isy Repentance; 
for none teach Repentance like true Penitents. He 
wants noriiing but to repent, and then he will be 
fo much the tetter qualified to inflrud his Wife. 
He will then be ab'e to tell rier, that there is not 
only a God, and that he is the juft Rewarder of 
Good and Evil ; but that he is a merciful Being, 
and witii infinite Goodnefs and Long- fuffering for- 
bears to punifh thofe that cfend, waiting to be 
gracious, ^^nd willing not the Death of a Sinner, 
but rather that he Ihould return and live: That 
oftentimes fuffers wicked Men to go on a long 
Time, and even referves Damnation to the gene- 
ral Day of Recribi:tion. Thau it is a clear Evi- 
dence of God, and of a future State, that righteous 
Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men 
their Punifhment, until tlicy come into another 
V/orld i ^nd this will lead him to teach his Wife 

the 



tlieDoftrineofthe Refurrcdion, and of the lafl: 
Judgrrient » let him but repent for himfelfj he 
wiJl be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to 
his Wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkimy who look'd very 
fcrioiis all the while, and who^ we could eafily 
perceive, was more than ordinat ily affe6l<;d with 
it : When being eager, and hardly fufferfng me 
to make an End, I know all this, Mafiery fays he, 
and a great deal more-, bnc I han't the Impudence 
to talk thus to my Wife, when God, and my 
own Confcience knows, and my Wife will be an 
undeniable Evidence againft me, that I have JiV'd, 
as I had never heard of a God, or future State, 
or any Thing; about it : /\nd to talk of my re- 
penting, ALAS! And mth that he jetdod a deep 
Sigh ; and 1 could fee, that Tears flood in his 
Eyes : *Tis paft all that with me. Paft it ! A T- 
KlNS,/z/V//, What do'ft thou mean by that? 
1 know WTJI enough what I mean, fays he, I mean 
'tis too late, and that is too true. 

1 cold my Clergyman Word for Word what he 
faid. The poor zealous Prieft(I muft call him fo ; 
for, be his Opinion what it will, he had certainly 
a moft lingular AfFedion for the Good of other 
Mens Souls-, and it would be hard to think he had 
not the like for his own) i fay, this zealous, affe- 
ctionate Man could nor refrain Tears alfo; But, 
recovering himfclf, he faid to me, Ask him but 
one Queftion, Is he eafy that it is too late, or is 
he troubled, and wifhes it were not fo? I put the 
Que/lion fairly w Atkinsy and he anfwered with 
a great deal of Paffion, How could any Man be 
eafy m a Condition that certainly muft end in e- 
tcrnal Dertru6lion ? That he was far from being 
eafy, but that, on the contrarv, he believed ic 
would one Time or other ruin him. 

What 



C 154 ] 

what do you mean by that ? fald I. Why, he 
faid he beh'evcd he fliould, one Time or other, 
cue his Throat to put an End to the Terror of 
it. 

The Clergyman (hook his Head with a great 
Concern in his Face, when 1 told him all this: 
But turning quick to me upon ic, fays he^ If that 
be his Cafe, you may affure him, it is not too late \ 
Cbrift will give him Repentance : But pray^/r/j'j 
he^ explain this to him. That as no Man is fav'd 
butbyChrift and the Merits of his Paffion, pro- 
curing fXWmz Mercy for him, how can \x. be too 
late tor any Man to receive Mercy? Docs he 
think he is able to /in beyond the Power or Reach 
of divine Mercy ? Pray tell him, there may be 
a Time when provoked Mercy will no longer 
ft rive, and when God n)ay refufc ta hear, but 
that 'tis never too late tor Men to ask Mercy ^ 
and we that are Chriit's Servants arc command- 
ed u f reach Mercy at all Times, in the Name oj Je- 
fm Chnfiy to all thofe that Jtmerely refent ; ia thaC 
'lis never too late ro repent. 

1 told Atkins all this and he heard me with 
great Earneftnels \ but it fccm'd as if he turn'doff 
the Difcourle to the reic ^ for he faid to me he 
would go and have feme Talk wich his Wife-, (q 
he went our a while, and we talk'd to the red. 
1 perceiv"d tliev were all flupidly ignorant as to 
Matters of Religion, much as I was when ! went 
rambling av/ay from my Father •, and yet that 
there wcrv^ none of them backward to hear what 
had been laid •, and ail of them ferioully promised 
that tiiey wo\jid talk with their Wives about ir, 
and do their Endeavour tope fwadc them to turn 
Chriftians. 

The Cler^,vman fmil'd upon me, when I repor- 
ted what Anfvver they gave^ but faid noching a

gpqd while ; but, at laft^ {baking his Head, We that 
■are Chrift's Servants, fays hey can go no further 
than to exhort and inilrucc ;and when Men comply, 
fubmit to the Reproof, and promife what we ask, 
'tis all we can do : We are bound to accept their 
good Words. But believe me. Sir, faid he^ what- 
ever you may have known of the Life of thai Man 
you call Will.Atkinsy I believe he i^ the only lincere 
Convert among them ; 1 take that Man to be a 
true Penitent ; 1 won't defpare of the refl j but that 
Man is apparently ftruck with the Senfe of hispaft 
Life ', and I doubt not, but when he comes to 
talk Religion to his Wife, he will talk himfelf ef- ' 
fedlually into it ; for attempting to teach others, is 
fometimes the beft way of teaching our felves. I 
knew a Man, who having nothing but a fummary 
Notion ot Religion himfelf, and being wicked and 
profligate to the laft Degree in hi. Life, made a 
thorough Reformation in himfelf, by labouring to 
convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins but once 
to talk ferioufly of Jefus Chrifl: to his Wife, my 
Lite for it, he talks himfelf into a thorough Con- 
vert, makes himfelf a Penitent : And who knows 
what may follow ? 

Upon this Difcourfe however, and their pro- 
mifing, as obove, to endeavour to perfwade their 
Wives to embrace Chriflianity, he marry 'd the 
other three Couple ; but IViU. Atkins and his Wife 
were not yet come in. After this, my Clergyman, 
waiting a while, was curious to know where At" 
kins was gone j and, turning to me, /?}'/ he, I en^ 
treat you, Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth 
here, and look i I dare fay, we fhall find this poor 
Man fomewhcre or other talking feriouily to his 
Wife, and teaching her already (bmething of Re- 
ligion. I began to be of the fame Mind ; fo we 
v/ent out together, and I carry 'd him a Way 

which 



which none but knew myfelf, and where the Trees 
were fo thick fet, as that it was not eafy to fee 
thro' the Thicket of Leaves, and far harder to 7^^ 
/«, than to fee out ; when, coming to the Edge of 
the Wood, I faw Atkins and his tawny Savage 
Wife fitting under the Shade of a Bufh, very eager 
in Difcourfe. I flopped fhort till my Clergyman 
came up to me ; and then having fhew' him 
where they were, we flood and look'd very fteadi- 
at them a good while. 

We obferv'd him very earnefl: with her, point- 
ing up to the Sun, and to every Qiiarter of the Hea- 
vens, then down to the Earth, then out to the 
Sea, then to himfelf, then to her, to the Woods, 
to the Trees. Now, fays my Clergyman, you fee 
my Words are made good, the Man preaches to 
her ; mark him now,^ he is telling her, that our 
God has made Jn'm, and her, and the Heavens, 
the Earth, the Sea, the Woods, the Trees, &c. I 
believe he is, p/i/; immediately we perceiv'd^/7/. 
Jtkms Hart up upon his Feet, fall down on his 
Knees, and life up both his Hands : We fuppofe 
he faid fomething, but we could not hear him, it 
was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling 
half a Mmute, but comes and fits down again by 
his Wife, and talks to her again. We perceiv a 
then the Woman very attentive, but whether (lie 
faid any thing or no we could not tell ; while the 
poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could fee the 
Tears run plentifully down myClergyman's Cheeks, 
and I could hardly forbear my felf ; but it was a 
great AfHiftion to us both that we were not near 
enough to hear any thing that pafs'd between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for 
fear of diffurbing them, fo we refolv'd to fee an 
End of this Piece of y?///C^'^^^^':^^^o«, and it {|:>oke 
loud enough tons without the Help of Voice. He 

fat 



[ t57] 



fat down again, as I have faid, clofe by her, and 
talked again earneftly to her, and two or three 
times we could fee him embrace her mofl: paf- 
lionately : Another time we faw him take out his 
Handkerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then kifs 
her again with a kind of Tranfport very unufual ; 
and after feveral of thefe Things we fee him, on a 
fudden, jump up again, and lend her his Hand to 
help her up, when immediately, leading her by 
the Hand a Step or two, they both kneel'd down 
together, and convinu'dfo about two Minutes. 

My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out 
aloud, St. PAUL St. PAUL! behold he prayeth ; 
I was afraid Atk'ms would hear him, therefore I 
entreated him to withhold himfelf awhile, that 
we might fee an End of the Scene, which to me, I 
muff confefs, was the moft af^eding, and yet the 
tnoft agreeable that ever I faw in my Life. Well, 
he drove with himfelf, and Gontain'd himfelf for a 
while, but was in fuch Raptures of Joy, to think 
that the poor Heathen Woman was become a 
Chriflian, that he was not able to contain himfelf. 
He wept feveral times, then throwing up his Hands 
andcroffing his Bread, faid over feveral Things 
Ejaculatory, and by way of giving God Thanks 
for fo miraculous a Teitimony of the Succefs of 
our^Endeavours. Some he fpoke fofdy, and I could 
not well hear, others audibly, fome in Latin^ fome 
in Ficnch ; then two or three times the Tears 
of Joy would interrupt him, that he could not 
fpcak at all : But I begg'd that he would com- 
pofe himfelf, and let us more narrowly and fully 
obferve what was before us, which he did for ^ 
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; 
for after the poor Man and his Wife were rifen 
again from their Knees, we obferv'd he flood talk- 
ing flill eagerly to her j and we obferv'd by her 

Moci- 



[ 158 ] 

Motion, that fhe was greatly afFcded with what 
he faid, by her frequent hfting up her Hands, lay- 
ing her Hand to her Breafl:, and fuch other Po- 
ilures, as ufually exprefs the greateft Serioufners 
and Attention. This continued about haii' a Quar- 
ter of an Hour, and then they walk'd away too ; 
fo that we could fee no more of them in tnat Si- 
tuation. 

I took this Interval to talk with' my Clergyman : 
And firfl:, I told him, I was glad to lee the Parti- 
culars we had both been Witnefies to ; that tho, I 
was hard enough ot Belief in fuch Cafes, yet 
that I began to think it was all very fincere here^ 
both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant 
they might both be ; and I hop'd fuch a Beginning 
would have a yet more happy End : And who 
hnowSyfaid /, but thefe two may in Time, by In- 
jftrudion and Example, work upon fome of the 
others ? Some of them ! faid he, turning quick upon 
mey ay, upon all of them ; depend upon it, if tho(e 
two Savages, for he has b-ten but little better, as 
you relate it, fliould embrace Jefus Chrift, they 
will never leave 'till they work upon all the refi ; 
for true Religion is naturally communicative, 
and he that is once made a Chriflian, will never 
leave a Pagan behind him, ii^ he can help it. 1 
own'd it was a mofl Chriftian Principle to think 
fo, and a Tedimony of a true Zeal, as well as a 
generous Heart in him : But, my Friend, faid I, 
will you give me Leave to ftart one DifEculty here ? 
1 cannot tell how to object the lead Thing againft 
that affedionate Concern, which you fliew for the 
turning the poor People from their Paganifm to 
the Chriftian Religion : But how does this com- 
fort you, while thefe People are in your Account 
out of the Pale oi the Catholick Church, without 
which vou believe there is no Salvation; fo that 

you 



[ ^59] 

you eftcem tliefe but Hereticks, and for other PvCa- 
ions, as eftedually loft as the Pagans ihemfclves. 

To this he anfwer'd wirh abundance of Can- 
dor and Chriihan Charity thus : Su*, I am a Ca- 
tholick oUhe Roman Church, and a Prieil: of the 
Order of St. BenediB, and I embrace all the Prin- 
ciples of the Ro77jan Faith : But yet if you will 
believe me, and that I do not f peak in Comphment to 
you, or in refieEi to my Orcumfiances and your Cwilities ; 
1 fay, neverthelefs, I do not look upon you, who 
call your felves Rcform'd, without fome Charity : 
I dare not fay, tho^ Jkmzi) it is our O^^inion in general \ 
i fay, 1 dare not fay, that you cannot be fav'd • 
I will by no means Umit the Mercy of Chrifl fo 
far, as to think that he cannot receive you into 
the Bofom of hi^ Church in a Manner to us unper- 
ceivable, and which it is impoffible for us to know, 
and I hope you have the fame Charity for us. 
1 pray daily for your being all reRar'd to 
Chrilf's Church, by whatfoever Methods he, who 
is All-ivifej is pleas 'd to direct: In the mean time, 
fure you will allow it to confift with me, as a Rc" 
man, to diftinguifh far between a Proteftant and a 
Pagan ,• between one that calls on J^fas Chrift, 
tho^ in a Way which I do not think is according 
to the true Faith, and a Sava<^e, a Barbarian, that 
knows no God, no Chrift, no Redeemer; and if 
you are not within the Pale of tlie Catholick 
Church, vv^e hope you are nearer being rellor'd to 
it than thoie that knew nothing o^ God or his 
Church : And I rejoice therefore when I fee this 
poor Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, 
and almoft a Murderer, kneel down and pray 
to Jefus Chrift, as we fuppofe he did, tho' not 
fully enlighten'd ; believing that God, from whom 
every fuch Work proceeds, will fenfibly touch his 
Hearty and brini^ him to the further Knowledge 

of 



[ i^o ] 

of that Truth in his own Time; and if God (hall 
influence this poor Man to convert and inflruc^t 
the poor ignorant Savage his Wife, I can never 
believe that he fhall be cait away himfelf. And 
have I not Reafon then to rejoyce, the nearer any 
are brought to the Knowledge ofChrifl, tho'they 
may not be brouglu- quite home into the Bofom oF 
the Catholick Church, juft in the Time when I 
may defire it ? leaving it to the Goodnefs of Chrift 
to perfect his Work in his own Time, and his own 
Way. Certainly I would rejoyce if all the Sava- 
ges in America were brought like this poor Woman 
to pray to God, tho' they were to be all Prote- 
flants at firft, rather than they (hould continue Pa- 
gans and Heathens; firmly believing, that he that 
had bellowed the firft Light to them, would fur- 
ther illuminate them with a Beam of his heavenly 
Grace, and bring them into the Pale of his Church 
when he fhould fee good. 

I was aftonifhed at the Sincerity and Temper 
of this truly pious Papiil:, as much as I was op- 
prefs'd by the Power of his Reafoning ; and it 
prefently occurred to my Thoughts, that if fuch 
a Temper v/as univerfal, we might be all Catho- 
lick ChriiHans, whatever Church or particular Pro- 
felTion we joined to, or joined in ; that a Spirit of 
Charity would foon work us all up into right 
Principles. And in a Word, as he thought, that 
the like Charity would make us all Catholicks ; 
fo I told him, I believed, had all the Members 
of his Church the like Moderation, they would 
foon be all Proteftants. And there we left that 
Part, for we never di fputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another Way, and 
taking him by the Hand, My Friend, fays I, i wifh 
all the Clergy of the RomijQ) Church were blefl with 
fuch Moderation, and had an equal Share of your 

Cha- 



[ i6i ] 

Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion -, but I 
mud tell you, that [^ you fhould preach fuch Do- 
drine in Spain or Italyy they would put you into 
the InqtiJfition. 

It may be fo, faid he, I know not what they 
might do in Spain or Italy, but I will not fay they 
would be the better Chriftians for that Severity, 
for I am fure there is no Herefy in too much Cha- 
rity. 

, Well, as Will. Atkins and his Wife were gone, 
our Bufinefs there was over : So we went back 
our own Way ; and when we came back, we found 
them waiting to be called in ; obferving this, I 
ask'd my Clergyman, If we (hould difcover to him 
that wehad feen him under the Bufh, or no? And 
it was his Opinion we fhould not; but that we 
would talk to him firft, and hear what he would 
fay to us. So. we called him in alone ,* no Body 
being in the Place but our felves : And I began 
with him thus. 

WtU, Atkins, faid /, prithee what Education had 
you? What was your Father ? 

IV. A. A better Man than ever 1 fhall be. Sir, 
my Father was a Ckygyman. 

R. C. What Education did he give you ? 

TV. A. He would have taught me well, Sir ; 
but I defpifed all Education, Inflrudion, or Cor- 
redion, like a Beaft as I was. 

R. C. Its true, Solomon fays. He that defpifes Re- 
proof is bruti(lo. 

XV. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifh, indeed, I mur- 
dered my Father : For God's Sake, Sir, talk no 
more about that, Sir ; I murdered my poor Father. 

Pr. Ha 1 a Murderer ! * 

* Here the Prieflflarted ( for I interpreted every 

Word as he fpoke it ) and look'd pale. It

fecms he believed that Will, had really kiUdd 
his 01V f I Father, 

R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not underftand him fo. 
H'^ilJ. Atkinsy explain your k)L You did not kill 
your Father, did you, with yonr own Hand? 

W, A. Noj Sir, I did not cut his Throat, but 
I cut the Thread of his Comforts, and fhort- 
ned his Days ; I broke his Heart by the moft un- 
grateful, unnatural Return, fot the mod tenderjaf- 
tedionate Treatment that ever Father gave, or 
Child could receive. 

R, C. Well, I did not ask you about ybui Fa- 
ther, to extort this ConfeiTion j I pray God give 
you Repentance for it, and forgive you that, and 
all your other Sins ', but I asked you, becaufe I 
fee, that tho^ you have not much Learning, yet 
you are not fo ignorant as fome are in Things that 
ire Good ; that you have known more of Religion 
SL great deal than you have pradifed. 
\j:^W^ A. Tho' you. Sir, did not extort the Con- 
feiTion that I made about my Father, Confciencc 
does; and whenever we come to look back upon 
our Lives, the Sins againft our indulgent Parents 
are certainly the firft that touch us^y the Wounds 
they make lye the deepeft^ the Weight they leave 
will lye heaviefl upon the Mind, of all the Sins wc 
can commit. 

jR. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfibly for me 
Atkins j I cannot bear it. 

^. A. You bear it, Mafter! I dare fay you know 
nothing of ir. 

R, C. YeS; Atkins^ every Shore, every Hill, nay, 
I may fay, every Tree in this Ifland is Witnefs to 
the Anguifh of my Soul, for my Ingratitude and 
bafe Uiage of a good tender Father ; ^ Father 
much like yours, by your Defcription i and I mur- 
dered 



[ I<^? 1 

dered my Father as well as you. Will* Atkins ; 
but I think, for aJl that, my Repentance is fhdrt 
of your.^ too * by a great deal. 

* I "coould have f aid morey if I could have re^ 
firained my Pajjions \ but I thought this poor 
Mans Repentance in as fo much fincerer than 
mine^ that I was gding to leave off the Dif- 
courfe and retire, for I was furpriz/d with 
'what hd faid \ and thought^ that inflead of 
my going about to teach and inflruEi hiiH^ the 
Man was a "teacher and Inflrucler to me^ in 
a mofi furprix^itig and unespeHed Manner, 

I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who 
was greatly affeded with it, and faid to me, Did 
I not fay. Sir, that when this Man was converted, 
he would preach to us all ? I tell you, Sir, if this 
one Man be made a true Penitent, here will be no 
need of me, he will make Chriftians of all in the 
Ifland. But having a little compofed my felf, I 
renewed my Difcourfe with Will. Atkins, 

But, Will faid /, ho\V cdmes the Senfc of this 
Matter to touch you jull novv- ? 

W. A. Sir, you have fet me about a Work that 
has ftruck a Dart tho' my very Soul. I have been 
talking about God and Religion to my Wife, in 
Order, as you dire6!ed me, to make a ChriiHan 
df her, arid fhe has preatched fuch a Serriion to me, 
as I fhall never forget while I lir^. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach 'd 
to you J but when you were moving religious Ar- 
guments to her, Confcience has flung them back 
ttpon you. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, wicK fuch a Force as is not to 
be refifted: 

k 2 R. C, Pray 



[164] 

R. C. Pray IVilL let us know what pafs'd be- 
tween you and your Wife, tor I know fomething 
of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it h impoffibleto ^\vq. you a full Ac- 
count of it ,• I am too full to hold it, and yet have 
no Tongue to exprefs ; it but let her have faid 
what (he will, and tho' I cannot give you an Ac- 
count of it, this I can tell you of it, that I refolve 
to amend and reform my Life. 

jR. C. But tell us fome of ir. How did you be- 
gin, Will ? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, 
that's certain. She has prcach'd a Sermon, indeed, 
if fhe has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I firft .told her the Nature of our 
Laws about Marriage, and what the Reafons were, 
that Men and Women were oblig'd to enter into 
fuch Compads, as it was neither in the Power of 
one or other to break; that otherwife. Order and 
JuRice could not be maintained, iand Men would 
run from their ^'vjcs, and abandon their Chil- 
dren, mix confufedly with one another, and nei- 
ther Families be kept intire, or Inheritances be fet- 
tled by legal Defcent. 

R. C. You talk like a Civilian, U^iU. could you 
make her underftand what you meant by Liherirance 
and Families ? They know no fuch Thing among 
the Savages, but marry any how, without Regard 
to Relation, Confanguinity, or Family, Brother 
and Sifter ; nay, as I have been told, even the Fa- 
ther and Daughter, and the Son and Mother. 

W.A. I believe. Sir, you are mifinform'd, and my 
Wife affures me the contrary, and that they abhor 
it ; perhaps, for any farther Relations they may not 
be fo exad as we are : But fhe tells me they ne- 
ver touch one another in the near Relations you 
fpeak of 

R, C Well, what did file fay, to what you told 
her.> IV, A. 



[ 1^5] 

W. A, She faid, fhe Iik*d it very well, and it 
was much better than in her Country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was ? 

IV. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I 
askd her if fhe would be marry 'd to me our Way? 
She ask'd me what Way that was ? I told her Mar- 
riage was appointed by God \ and here we had a 
flrange Talk together, indeed, as ever Man and 
Wife had, I believe. 

N. B. T/;/j Dialogue between W. Atkins and bis 
IVife, as I took it down in Writings jufi after 
he told it me, was as follows, 
H/ife* Appointed by your God ! Why, have you 
a God in your Country ? 

IV, A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country. 
IVije. No, you God la my Country i my Coun- 
try have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to fhew you who 
God is. God is iw Heaven, and made the Heavea 
and the Earth, the Sea, and ail that in them \s. 

Wife. No, makee de Earth ,• no you God make 
all Earth, no make my Country. ^ 

^ W. k, laughed a little at her Expreffion, of God 
not making her Country. 

Wife, No laugh, why laugh me } This no 
Thing to laugh. * 

* He was juflly reproved by his IVife^ for fie was 
moreferious than he at firfl, 
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any 
more my Dear. 

Wife, Why you fay, you God make all. 
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole 
World and you, and me, and all Things; for he 
IS the only true God. There is no God but him ; 
he lives for ever in Heaven. 

M 3 Wife. 



tVife. Why you no tell mc long ago? 

W- A. That's true indeed, but I have been ^ 
Wicked Wretch^ and have not only forgotten to 
acquaint thcc wlih any Thing before, but have 
lived v/ithouf God in the World my felf. ^ 

T4/ije. What have you de great God in you 
. Country, you no kno' him ? No fav O to him? 
No do ^ood Thing for him? That no pof- 
fibic ! 

W> A- It is too true •, tho' for all that, we Hvc 
as U there was no God in Heaven, or that he had 
no Power on Earth. 

M^^ije But why, God let you do fo ? Why he 
no makee you good live ? 

TV' A, It is all cur own Fault. 

PVijc, But you lay me, he is Great, much 
Greatj have much great Power-, can makee kill, 
when he will; why he no makce kill when you 
no ferve him ? No fay O to him ? No be good 
Mans. 

IV. A, That is true-, he might f^rike mc 
dead, and I ought to cxpeft k \ for I have been 
a wicked Wretch, that is true-, but Cod is 
merciful, and does not deal with us as we de- 
ferve, 

'■ Wife. But then, do not ypu tell God T^nkee 
for that too ? 

W' A, No, indeed, 1 have not thank'd God 
for his Mercy, any more than I have fear*d God 
for his Power. 

"Wife. Then you God no God; mc no think, 
believe, he be fuch one, great much Power, 
ftrong^ no makee kill you tho' you makee him 
much angry. 

IV. A, What! will my v/icked Life hinder 
you from believing in God? What a dreadful 
Creature am U and what a fad Truth Is- k^ 

that 



[ I'Sy] 

that the horrid Lives of Chn'ftians hinders the 
Converfion of Heathens? 

j/[/ife. How me tink you have great much 
God * up there, and yet no do well, no do 
good Thing? Can he tell ? ilure he no tell what 
you do. 

* She points tip to Heaven* 

W.A, Ycsj yes^ he knows and fees all Things » 
he hears us fpeak, fees what we do^ knows what 
we think, tho' we do not fpeak. 

Wife. What! he no hear you fwcar, airfc, 
fpeak the great Damn. 
' W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife, Where be then the muchce great Power 
flropg. 

W. A. He IS merciful, that's all we can fay 
for it s and this proves him to be the true God ; 
he is God and not Man i and therefore wc are not 
t'onfum'd. * 

^ HereWiW^ -Atkins told us he was firuck with 
Horrory to think how he could tell his Wife fo 
clearly that God feeSy and hears, and knows 
thefecrct Thoughts of the Heart, and all that 
we do ,• and yet that he had dard to do all the 
vile Ihings he had done. 

Wife, Merciful! what you call that? 

W^ A, He is our Father and Maker, and he 
pities and fpares us. 

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never an- 
gry when you do wicked j then he no good him- 
iclF, or no great able. 

W. A. Tesyyes, my Dear^ he is infinitely good, 
sad infinitely great, and able to puniih too, and 

M 4 fomc- 



[ I^H 1 

fometimes to fiiew his Juftice and Vengeance, he 
lets fly his Anger to deflroy Sinners, and make 
Examples ; many are cut off in their Sins. 

Wy'e. But no make kill you yet, than he tell 
you may be that he no make you kill, fo you make 
de Bargain with him> you do bad Thing, he no 
be angry at you, when he be angry at other 
Mans. 

IV. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Prefumpti- 
ens upon his Goodnefs ; and he would be inii- 
nitely juft if he deflroy'dme as he has done other 
Men. 

IVije. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you 
dead, what you fay to him for that, you no tell 
him Tankee for all that too ? 

W. A- I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, 
that's true. 

Wtfe. Why? He no makee you much good 
better, you fay he makee you. 

W^A. He made me as he made sIJ the World ; 
'tis I have deformed my felf, and abus'd his Good- 
nefs, and made my felf an abominable Wretch. 

Wife. I wifh you makee God know me, I no 
makee him angry, I no do bad wicked Thing. 

Here Will. Atkins [aid his Heart funk within 
himy to hear a poor untaught Creature de- 
fire to he taught to know God, and he fuch 
a wicked Wretch, that he could not fay one 
Word to her about God, but what the Re- 
proach of his own Carriage would make mrfi 
irrational to her to believe ; nay, that al- 
ready (he had told him, that fie could mt he- 
lienje in God, becaufe he that wc0 fo wicked 
was not defro/d, 

W. 4. 



[ i<^9 1 

JV. A. My Dear, you mean, you wlfii I could 
teach you to know God, not God to know you \ 
for he knows you already, and every Thought in 
your Heart. 

Wife. Why then he know what I fay to you 
now? He know me wifii to know him i how fhail 
me know who makee me? 

W. J» Poor Creature, he mud teach thee, I 
cannot teach thee ; Til pray to him to teach thee 
to know him, and to forgive me that I am un- 
worthy to teach thee. 

T'he poor Felloiv v^as in fuch an Agony at hsr 
deftring him to make her know God, and h:r 
"duifiing to know him^ thai^ he faid, he fell 
down on his Knees before her, and frayd to 
God to enlighten her Mind with the faving 
Knowledge of Jefm Chrifl^ and to pardon his 
Sins, and accept of his being the unworthy In- 
flrument of inftrulling her in the Principles of 
Religion y after which, he fat down by her a- 
gain, and their Dialogue went on. N. B. 
This was the Time when we faw him 
kneel down, and lift up his Hands. 

Wife. What you put down the Knee for? What 
you hold up the Ha^d for ? What you fay ? Who 
you fpeak to? What is all that? 

W. A, My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of 
my Submiflion to him that made me ', I faid O to 
him, as you call it, and as you fay, your old Men 
do to their Idol Benamukee -, that is, I pray'd to 
him. 

Wife. What you fay O to him for ? 

W.A.I pray'd to him to open your Eyes, and 
your Underftanding, that you may know him, and 
be accepted by him. 
: .. / . Wife. 



[ 170 } 

fVife. Call he do that too/* 

JV. A, Yes, he can, he can do all Things. 

Wije. But now he hear what you fay ? 

W. A, Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and pro- 
mised toiiearus. 

IVrfe. Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How 
he bid you? What ! you hear him fpeak ? 

iV.A. No, we do not hcarhini fpeak, but he 
has revealed himielf many Ways to us/ 

Here he ivas at a great Lofs to make her under- 
(land, that God has revealed himfelj to us hy 
his IVord^ and what his Word wad : But at 
lafl he told n her thus, 

W' A, God has fpoken to fome good Men in 
former Days, even trom Heaven, by plain Words; 
and God has infpir'd good Men by his Spirit ; 
and they have written all his Laws dpwn in a 
Book. 

U/lfe. Me no uncierftand that, wher^isBook? 

/■//. A. Alas, my poor Creature, I have nor this 
Book ; but 1 hope 1 (hall one Time or other get 
jt for you, and help you to read it. 

Here he embraced her with great AJfeciion ; 
but with inespreffible Griefs that he had 
nut a Bible. 

JVife. Bur how yoi\ makee me know, that God 
teachee them to write that Book ? 

W. A. By the fame Rule that we know him to 
be God. 

IVije. What Rule, v/hat Way you know him? 

W. A, Becaufe he teaches and commands no- 
thing but what is good, righteous, and holy ; 
and tends to make us perfectly good, as well as 

per- 



[ 17" ] 

perfedly happy ; and becaufe he forbids and 
commands us to avoid all that is wicked, that 
is evil in it felf, or evil in its Confequence^. 

IVife. That me would underftand, that me fain 
fee ,* if he teachee all good Thing, forbid all wick- 
ed Thing, he re^!vard all good Thing, punifli all 
wicked Thing, he make all Thing, he give all 
Thing, he hear me when I fay O to him, as you go 
do juft now ; he makee kill me, if I wifh be good, 
he {pare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good ; 
all this you fay he do, yet he be great God; qic 
take, think, believe him be gr^at God ^ me fay 
O to him too with you my Dear. 

Here the poor Man could forbear no longer ; 
but raifing her up, made her kneel by hijn, and 
he pray'd to God aloud to infcrud her in the 
Knowledge of himfelf by his Spirit, and that by 
fome good Providence, if poflible, (he might 
fometime or other come to have a Bible, that 
ihe might read the Word of God, and be taught 
by it to know him. 

This was the Time that we faw him lift her 
up by the Hand, and faw him kne^l down by 
her, as above. 

They had feveral other Difcourfes, it feems, 
after this, too long to fet down here ,* and parti- 
cularly fhe piade him promife, that fince he con- 
feft his own Life had been a wicked abominable 
Courfe pf Provocation againft God, that he 
would reform it, and not make God angry any 
more, left he fhould make him dead, as flie call a 
it, and then fhe fhould be left alone, and never be 
taught to know this God better; and left he 
fliould be miferable, as he had told her wicked 
Men fti.ould be after Death. 

This was a ftrange Account, and very affeding 
vo U5 both, but particularly to the young Clergy- 
man 5 



man ; he was indeed wonderfully furpriz'd with 
it, but under the greateft Affliftion imaginable:^ 
that he could not talk to her, that he could not 
fpeak Englifh to make her underftand him j and 
as fhe fpoke but very broken Englifh, he could 
not underftand her. However, he turn'd himfelf 
to me, and told me, that he believed there muft be 
more to do with this Woman than to marry her • 
I did not underftand him at firft, but at length he 
explain^ himfelf, viz. that fte ought to be 
Baptized. 

I agreed with him in that Part readily, and 
■was for going about it prefently : No, no, hold 
Sir, /aid he, tho^ I would have her be Baptiz'd by 
all Means, yet I mufl: obferve, that Witt. Atkins^ 
her Husband, has indeed brought her in a won- 
derful Manner to be Vvilling to embrace a reli- 
gious Lite, and has given her /uft Ideas of the 
Being of a God, of his Power, Juflice, Mercy ; 
yet I defire to know of him, if he had faid any 
Thing to her of Jefus Chri/1, and of the Salva- 
tion of Sinners, ot the Nature oi Faith in him, 
and Redemption by him, of the Holy Spirit, the 
Refurrection, the laft Judgment, and a future 
State. 

I call'd Will' Atkins again, and ask'd him ; but 
the poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and 
told us he had faid fomething to her of all thofe 
things, but that he was himfelf fo wicked a Crea- 
ture, and his own Confcience fo reproach'd him 
with his horrid ungodly Life, that he trembled at 
the Apprehenfions, that her Knowledge of him 
Ihould IcfTen the Attention fhe fhould give to thofe 
Things, and make her rather contemn Religion 
than receive it : But he was alliir*d, he faid, that 
her Mind was fo difpos'd to receive due Im- 
preiTions of all thofe Things, that it 1 would 

but 



t i7n 



but difcOLirfe with her, fhe would make it ap^ 
pear to my Satisfadion, that my Labour would 
not be loll upon her. 

Accordingly I calfd her in, and placing my felf 
as Interpreter between my religious Prieft and the 
Woman, I entreated him to begin with her; but 
fure fuch a Sermon was never preach'd by a Popifli 
Prieft in thefe latter Ages of the World; and, as 
Itoldhim^ I thought he had ail the Zeal, all the 
Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chriftian, 
without the Error of a Romaii Catholick ; and that 
I took him to be fuch a Clergy-man, as the Ro" 
man Bifhops were before the Church of Rome af- 
ftim'd fpiricual Sovereignty over the Confciences 
of Men. 

In a Word, he brought the poor Woman to em- 
brace the Knowledge of Chrift, and of Redemp- 
tion by him, not with Wonder and Afloniftiment 
only, as (he did the firfl Notions of a God, but 
with Joy and Faith, wiih an Affedion and a fur-^ 
prizing Degree of Underftanding, fcarce to be 
imagin'd, much lefs to be exprefsM ; and at her 
own Requeft flie was Baptized. 

When he was preparing to Baptize her, I en- 
treated him, that he would perform that Office 
with fome Caution, that the Man might not per- 
ceive he was of the Roman Church, if poflible, 
becaufe of other ill Confequences which might 
attend a Difference among us in that very Reli- 
gion, which we were inftrudting the other in. 
He told me, that as he had no confecrat'ed Cha- 
pel, no proper Things for the Office, I fhould fee 
he would do it in a Manner that I fhouid not know 
by it, that he was a Roman Catholick my felf, if I 
had not known it before : And fo he did ; for 
faying only fome Words over to himfelf in Latiny 
which I could not underfland, he pour'd a whole 

Dilh- 



C 174 ] 



Difhful of Water upon the Woman's Head,. pro- 
nouncing in Frenchy very loud, MARY, ijjhkh was 
the Name her Hush and deftrd me to give her ,* jor I 
ivas her Godfather, I Baptize thee in the Name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghoft ; (o that none could know any Thing by it, 
what Religion he was of: He gave the Benedidi- 
on afterwards in Latin ; but either 1^01. Atkins 
did not know but it was in French, or elfe did 
not take Notice of it at that time. 

As foon as this was over, we martied them ; 
and after the Marriage was over, he turn'd hlm- 
felf to Will. Atkins, and in a very affedionatc 
Manner exhorted him, not only to pf'efevere id 
that good Difpofition he was in, but to fupport 
the Convidions thac were upon him by a Refo- 
lution to reform his Life ; told him it was in vain 
to fay he repented, i( he did not forfake his 
Crimes : Reprefented to him, hovv God had ho- 
noured him with being the Ihrtrument of bring- 
ing his Wife to the Knowledge of tlie Chriilian 
Religion, and that he ftiould be careful he did 
not difhonour the Grace of God, and that if 
he did, he would fee the Heathen a better 
Chriflian thanhimfelf, the Savage converted, and 
the Inftrument cafl away. 

He faid a great many good Things to therai 
both, a:nd then recommending them m a few 
Words to God's Goodnefs, gave them the Bene-' 
diction again, I repeating every Thing to them 
in Englijh, and thus ended the Ceremony. I 
think it was the moil pleafant, agreeable Day 
tome, that ever I pafl'ed in my whole Life. 

But my Clergyman had not done yet ; his 
Thoughts hung continually upon the Coaverfion 
o^ the fevcn and thirty Savages, and fain he 
would have fUv'd upon the Illand to' have un- 

d^r-^' 



1 175 ] 

derraken It ; but I convinc'd him, firfti that his 
Undertaking was impradicable in itfelf ; and fe- 
condly, that perhaps I would put it into a Way 
ot being done in his Abfence to his Satisfadion ; 
ot which by and by. 

Having thus brought the Affair of the Ifland 
to a narrow Compafs, I was preparing to go oa 
board the Ship, when the young Man, whom I had 
taken out of the famifh'd Ship's Company, came 
to mc, and told me, he underliood I had a Cler- 
gyman with me, and that I caufed the Englifh 
Men to be married to the Savages, whom they 
called Wives; that he had a Match too, which 
he defir'd might be finifli'd before I went, between 
two Chriftians, which he hop'd would not be 
difagreeable to me. 

I knew this mufi be the young Woman who 
>vas his Mother^s Servant, for there was no other 
Chriftian Woman on the IQand ; fo I began to 
perfwade him not to do any Thing of that Kind 
rafhly, or becaiife he found himfelf in this foli- 
tary Circumftance. I reprefctitcd to him, that he 
-had forae confiderable Subftance in the World, and 
good Friends, as I underdood by himfelf, and by 
ins Maid alfo ; that his Maid was not only poor, 
and a Servant, but was unequal to him, Ihe be- 
ing fix oi* itvtn and twenty Years old, and he 
not above feventeen or eighteen ; that he might 
very probably ^ with my Aifiilancei make a Remove 
from this Wildttneis, and come into his own 
Country again, and that then it would be a 
thbufand to one but he would repent his Choice ; 
and the Dillike of that Circumftance might be 
difadvantagcous to both. I was going to fay 
more, but he interrupted me, fmilir.g, and told 
mfe, with a area-- deal oF Modeflyj tlut I miftook 
m my Gueflesj that he had nothing of that Kind 

in 



[ ^7^ ] 

^n his Thoughts, his prefeiit Circumftance being 
melancholly and difconfolate enough; and he was 
very glad to hear that I had Thoughts of put- 
ting them in a Way to fee their Country again, 
and nothing fhould have put him upon flaying 
there, but that the Voyage I was going was fo 
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry 
him quite out of the Reach of all his Friends ,* 
that he had nothing to dedre of me, but that I 
would fettle him in fome little Property in the 
Ifland where he was, give him a Servant or two 
and fome few Neceffaries, and he would fettle 
himfelf here like a Planter, waiting the good 
Time, when, if ever I return'd to En^Iand^lwould 
redeem him, and hop'd I would not be unmind- 
ful of him when I came into England ; that he 
would give me fome Letters to his Friends in 
London, to let them know how good I had been 
to him, and in what Part of the World, and 
what Circumftance I had left him in ; that he 
promifed me, that whenever I redeemed him, 
the Plantation, and all the Improvement he had 
made upon it, let the Value be what it would, 
fhould be wholly mine. 

His Difcourfe was very prettily deliver'd, con- 
fidering his Youth, and was the more agreeable 
to me, becaufe he told me pofitively the Match 
was not for himfelf: 1 gave him all polTible Af- 
furances, that if I liv'd to come fafe to England, 
I would deliver his Letter, and do his Bii(inefs 
effedually, and that he might depend I would 
never forget the Circumftance I had kk him in -, 
but ftill I was impatient to know who were the 
Perfons to be married, upon which he told me, it 
was my Jack of aii Trades, and his Maid Sufan. 

I was moft agreeably furpriz'd, when he 
nam'd the Match, for indeed I thought it very 

fuita- 



[ 177 ] 

fuitable^ the Charader of that Man I have 
given already j and as for the Maid, fhe was a 
very honeft, modefl, fober and reh"gious young 
V/omarij had a very good Share of Senfe, was a- 
greeable enough in her Perfcn, fpoke very hand- 
fomely, and to the Purpofe, always with Decen- 
cy and good Manners, and not backward to 
fpeak when any Thing required it, or imperti- 
nently forward to fpeak when it was not her Bn- 
finefs ; very handy and houfewifely in any Thing 
that was before her ; an excellent Manager, and 
fit indeed to have been Governefs to the whole 
Ifland ; fhe knew very well how to behave to all 
kind of Folks fhe had about her, and to better, 
if fhe had found any there. 

The Match being propofed in this Manner, 
We married them the fame Day, and as I was 
Father at the Altar, as I may fay, and gave her 
away, fo Igave her a Portion; for I appointed 
her and her Husband a handfome large Space of 
Ground for their Plantation. And indeed this 
Match, and the Propofal the young Gentleman 
made to give him a fmall Property in the Ifland, 
put me upon parcelling it out amongft them, 
that they might not quarrel afterwards about 
their Situation. 

This Sharing out the Land to them, I left to 
Will. Atkmsy who indeed was now grown a moft 
fober, grave, managing Fellow, perfedly reformed, 
exceedmg pious and religious, and as far as I 
may be allow'd to fpeak pofitively in. fuch a 
Cafe, I verily believe, was a true fincere Penitent. 

He divided Things fo juilly, and fo much to 
every one's Satisfaction, that they only defired 
one general Writing under my Hand for the 
whole, which I caufed to be drawn up and lign'd 
and feal'd to them, fetting out the Bounds and 

Part 11. N Situ- 



[ 178 } 

Situation of every Man's P'antation, and teftify- 
ing that I gave them thereby fevcrally a Right 
to the whole Pod'eflion and Inheritance oF the 
refpedive Plantations or Farms, with their Im- 
provements to them and their Heirs, referving 
all the reft of the Ifland as my own Property, 
and a certain Rent for every parLicuJar Planta- 
tion after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, 
"or m my Name, came to demand it, producing 
an attefted Copy of the fame Writing. 

As to the Government and Laws among them, 
I told them I was not capable of giving them 
better Rules, than they were able to givQ them- 
felves, only made them proraife me to live in. 
Love and good Neighbourhood with one ano- 
tlier ; and fo I prepared to leave them. 
• One Thing I mufl; not omit, and this, is, that 
being now fettled in a Kind of Common-Wealth 
among themfelves, and having much Bufinefs 
in Hand, it was but odd to have feven and thir- 
ty Indians live in a Nook of the Ifland inde- 
pendent, and indeed unemployed ; for except- 
ing the providing themfelves Food, which they 
had Difficulty enough in too , fometimes , 
they had no manner of Bufinefs or Property to 
manage. 1 proposed therefore to the Governour 
Spaniard^ that he fliould goto them with Friday's 
Father, and propofe to them to remove, and 
either plant for themfelves, or take them into their 
feveral Families as Servants to be maintained 
for their Labour, but without being abfolute 
Slaves ; for I would nor admit them to make 
them Slaves by Force, by any Mean^> becaufe 
they had their Liberty given them by Capitulati- 
on, and as it were. Articles of Surrender, which 
they ought not to break. 

They 



1 179 ], 

They moft willingly embrac'd the Propofal, 
and came all very chearfully along with him ; 
(o we alloted them Land and Plantations, which 
three or four accepted of, but all -the reft 
chofe to be employed as Servants in the feveral 
Families we had fettled ; and thus my Colony 
was in a Manner iettled, as follows. The Spa- 
niards poffefs^d my original Habitation, which 
was the Capital City, and extended their Plan- 
tations all along the Side of the Brook, which 
made the Creek that I have fo often defcrib^'d, 
as far as my Bower ; and as they increas'd their 
Culture, it went always Eaftward. The Englifi 
liv^d in the North-Eaft Parr, where IVilL Atkins^ 
and his Comrades began, and came on South- 
ward, and South-Weft, towards the back Pare 
of th.e Spaniards, and every Plantation had a great 
Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occa- 
fion, fo that they need not juftle one another foe 
want of Room. 

All the Eaft End of the Ifland was left uninha- 
bited, that if any of the Savages fhould come on 
Shore there, only for their ufual cuftomary Bar- 
barities, they might come and go, if they diflurb'd 
no Body, no Body would diflurb them ; and no 
doubt but they were often afliore, and went away 
again ,* for I never heard that the Planters were 
attacked or diflurb'd any more. 

It now came into my Thoughts, that I had 
hinted to my Friend the Clergyman, that the 
V/ork of Converting the Savages, might perhaps 
be fet on Foot in his Abfence, to his Satisfadion ; 
and I told him, that now I thought it was put 
in a fair Way ; for the Savages being thus divi- 
ded among the Chriftians, if they would but 
every one of them do their Pate with thofe 
N z which 



[ i8o] 

which came under their Hands, I hop'd it mighc- 
have a very good Etfc6t. 

He agreed prefencly in that, i^, /aid he, they 
>viil do tlieir Part ; but how, fays he, (liall we 
obtain that of them? I told him, we would 
call them togc:her, and leave it in Charge with 
them, or 2,0 to them one by one, which he 
thought bell:, fo we divided it ; he to fpeak to 
the Spaniards, who were all Papifis, and I to the 
EnglijJj, who were all Proteftants; and we re- 
commended it carneftly to them, and made them 
promife, that they never would make any Di- 
iHndion of Papift or Proreftant, in their ex- 
horting the Savages to turn Chriftians; but teach 
them the general Knowledge of the true God, 
and of their Saviour Jefus Chrid ,• and they like- 
wife promised us, that they would never have 
any Differences or DIfputes one with another a- 
bout Religion. 

When I came to Will. Atkins's Houfe, I may caH 
it fo, for fuch a Houfe, or fuch a Piece of Basket- 
Work, I believe, was not (landing in the World 
again ; 1 fay, when I came there, I found the 
young Woman I have mentioned above, and IVdi. 
Atkins's Wife, were become Intimates,- and this 
prudent religious young Woman, had perfeded 
the Work William Atkins had begun ', and though 
it was not above four Days after what I have re- 
lated, yet the new baptized Savage Woman was 
made fuch a Chriflian, as I have feldom heard of 
aiy.like her in all my Obfervation, or Converfa- 
tion, in the World. 

It came next into my Mind in the Morning 
before I went to them, that amongif all the 
needful Things I had to leave with them, I had 
not left them a Bible, in which, I Ihew^d my 
ioii \ds confidering for them, than my good 

Friend 



[ ISI ] 

Friend the Widow was For me, when (lie lent 
me the Cargo of an hundred Pounds from Lis' 
bon, where fhe packed up 3 Bibles, and a Prayer- 
book : However, the good Woman^s Charity had 
a greater Extent than ever flic iraagin'd ', for they 
were refer vM for the Comfort and Inflruction of 
thofe, that made much better Ufe of them than I 
had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and 
when I came to IVili. Atkins's Tent or Houfe, and 
found the young Woman, and Atkins's baptized 
Wife, had been difcourfing of Religion together; 
for PFill Atkins, told it me, with a great deal of 
"Joy : I ask'd ii: they were together now, and he 
laidj yes ,* To I went into the Houfe, and he with 
me, and we found them together very earneft in 
Difcourfe. O Sir! fa,y s Will Atkins , when God 
has Sinners to reconcile to himfelf, and Aliens to 
bring Home, he never wants a Mcflenger j my 
Wife has got a new InHrudor ! I knew I was un- 
worthy, as I was uncapable of that Work ! That 
young Woman has been fent hicher from Heaven ,* 
ihe is enough to convert a whole Ifland of Savages I 
The young Woman blufli'd, and rofe uptogoavvay, 
but I defu'd her to fit fli!) ; I told her, fhe had a 
good Work upon her Hands, and I hop'd God 
would blefs her in it. 

We taik'd a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any Book among them, though I did not ask ; 
but I put my Hand in my Pocket, and puU'd oun 
my Bible ; here, fays /, 10 Atkins, I have broughc 
you an Afliftant that perhaps you had not before. 
The Man was fo confounded, that he was not able 
to fpeak for fome Time ; but recovering himfelf, 
he takes it with both his Hands, and turning to 
his Wife, here, my Dear, fays he ; did not I tell 
ycu, our God, tbo' he lives above, could hear 
N 3 what 



[ i8^- 1 

what we faid ? Here's the Book 1 pray'd for, when 
you and I kneel'd down under the Bufh ; now God 
has heard us, and Tent it; when he had faid fo, 
the Man fell into fuch Tranfports of a pafTionatc 
Joy, that between the Joy of having it, and giv- 
ing God thanks for it, the Tears run down his 
Face like a Child that was crying. 

The Woman was furprized, and was like to 
have run into a Miftake, that none of us were 
aware of; for fhe firmly bcliev'd God had fent 
the Book upon her Husband's Petition : It is true, 
that providentially it was fo, and might be ta- 
ken fo in a confequent Senfe ; but I belie v'd it 
would have been no difficult Matter at that Time, 
to have perfwaded the poor Woman to have be- 
lie v'd, that an exprefs Meflenger came from Hea- 
ven, on purpofe to bring that individual Book ; 
but it was too ferious a Matter, to fuffer any De- 
lufion to take Place ; fo I turn'd to the young Wo- 
man, and told her we did not defire to impofe 
upon the new Convert, in her firft, and more ig- 
norant Underftanding of Things j and begg'd her 
to explain to her, that God may be very properly 
faid to anfwer our Petitions, when in the Courfe 
of his Providence, fuch things are in a particular 
Manner brought to pafs, as we petition 'd for ; but 
we do not expert Returns from Heaven, in a mira- 
culous and particular Manner, and that it is our 
Mercy, that it is not fo. 

This the young Woman did afterwards efte- 
dually ; fo that there was, I afiure you, no PriclV 
craft ufed here ; and I fliould have thought it 
one of the moft unjuflifiable Frauds in the 
World, to have had it fo. But the Surprize of 
Joy upon //>///. Atkms, is really not to be expref- 
fed ; and there we may be fure, there was no 
Delufion : Sure, no Man was ever more thank- 
ful 



ful in the World for any Thing of its Kind, than 
he was for his Bible j nor I believe, never any 
Man was glad of a Bible from a better Principle : 
And tho' he had been a moil profligate Creature, 
defperate, headflrong, outrageous, furious, and 
wicked to a great Degree ; yet this Man is a (lan- 
ding Rule to us all, for the well inftruding Chil- 
dren, (viz.,) that Parents fliould never givQ over 
to teach and inftrud, or ever defpair of the Sue- 
cefs of their Endeavours, let the Children be e- 
ver fo obftinate, refradory, or to Appearance, in- 
fenfible of Inftrudion ; for if ever God in his Pro- 
vidence touches the Confciences of fuch, the 
Force of their Education returns upon them, 
and the early Inftruftion of Parents is not loft ; 
tho' it may have been many Years laid afleep ; 
but fome Time or other they may find the Benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor Man, however ig- 
norant he was, or divefted of Religion and Chri- 
flian Knowledge ', he found he had fome to do 
with now, more ignorant than himfelf j and that 
the lead Part of the Inftrudion of his good Fa- 
ther that could now come to his Mind, was of 
Ufe to him. 

Among the reft it occurred to him, he faid, 
how his Father us'd to infift much upon the in- 
exprelHble Value of the Bible, the Privilege and 
Blefling of it to Nations, Families, and Perfons; 
but he never entertained the leaft Notion of the 
Worth of it, till now; when being to talk to 
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted 
the Help of the written Oracle for his Alli- 
ftance. 

The young Woman was very glad of it alfo 
for the prefent Occafion, tho' (he had one, and 
fo had the Youfh on board our Ship among 

N 4 their 



[ i84 ] 

their Goods, which were not yet brought on Shore ; 
and now having faid Co many Things oF this young 
Woman, I cannot omit telling one Story mort 
oFher, and my felf, which has fomething in it ve- 
ry informing and remarkable. 

I have related, to what Extremity the poor 
young Woman was reduced; how her Millrefs 
was ftarved to Death, and did dk on board 
that unhappy Ship we met at Sea ; and how the 
whole Ship's Company being reduced to th^ 
laft Extremity; the Gentlewoman, and her Son, 
and this Maid, were firfl hardly ufed as to Pro- 
vilions, and at lafi totally negledtedand ftarved ; 
that is to fay, brought to the lafl Extremity of 
Hunger. . . . ' 

One Day being difcourfing with her upon the 
Extremities they Tuffercd, I ask'd her if flie could 
defcribe by wliat fhe had felt, what it was to 
torve, and how it appeared; (he told me, ilie 
believed Ihe could,- and Ihe told her Tale very di- 
{linaiythus: . . 

" Firil, Sir, faid flie, we had for fomeDays far'd 
*' exceeding hard, and fi^ifer'd very great Hunger.; 
^' but now at laft, we were wholly without Food 
•' of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, 
" and a little Water. The firfl: Day, after I had 
*' receiv'd no Food at aU, I found my felf towards 
" Evening, firfl empty, and fickifli at my Stomach, 
" and nearer Night mightily inclined to yawn- 
^' ing, and fleepy. I laid down on a Couch in the 
** great Cabin to fleep, a\]d flept about three 
^* Hours, andawak'd a little refrefli'd ; having 
" taken aGlafsofWine when I lay down; after 
" being about three Hours awake, it being ar 
" bout five a Clock in the Morning, I found my 
•' fclferpprv, and my Stomach ficidfb, and lay 
- - . . *' down 



[ i85 ] 

^- down again, but could not deep at all, bekig 
" very faint, and ill ; and thus I continued all the 
" fccond Day, with a flrange Variety, firll hun- 
*' gry, then (ick again, with Reachings to vomit. 
" The fecond Night being obliged to go to Bed 
*' again, without any Food, more than a Draught 
" ot fair Water, and being aileep, I dream 'd I 
*^ was at Berbadoes^ and that the Market was 
*' mightily fiock'd with Provifions j that I bought 
" fome for my Miftrefs, and went and din'd very 
" heartily. ; 

" 1 thought my Stomach was as full after this 
*' as any would have been after, or at a good 
" Dinner ; but when I wak'd, I was exceedingly 
" funk in my Spirits, to find my felf in the Ex- 
*^ tremity of Famine: The laftGlafs of Wine we 
" had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, becaufe of 
" its having fome Spirit to fupply Nourifliment ; 
*^ but there being no Subftance in the Stomach 
" for the digefting Office to work uppn, I found 
" the only Effe(5]: of the Wine was, to raife dif^ 
" agreeable Fumes from the Stomach, into the 
" Head ; and I lay, as they told me, ftupid, and 
*' fenfelefs, as one drunk for fome Time. 

" The third Day in the Morning, after a 
" Night of flrange and confus'd inconfiftent 
" Dreams, and rather dozing than fleeping, I 
'' wak'd, ravenous and furious with Hunger j 
*^ and I queflion, had not my Underftanding re- 
" turn'd andconquer'd itj I fay, I queflion whe- 
" ther, if I had been a Mother, and had had a lit- 
*^ tie Chi.'d with me, its Life would have been 
^' fafe or not > 

" This lafted about three Hours ; during v/hich 
" Time I was twice raging mad as any Creature 
*' in Bedlam, as my young Mailer told me, and as 
" he can now inform you. 



[ i8<5 ] 

■^ In one ofthefe Fits of Lunacy or Diflraflions 
*' whether by the Motion of the Ship, or fomq 
*' Slip of my Foot, I know not ; I feil down, and 
" ftruck my Face againft the Corner of a Palat 
" Bed, in which my Miilrefs lay; and withthq 
" Blow the Blood gufh'd out of my Nofe ; and 
" the Cabin Boy bringing me a little Bafon, I 
" fat down and bled into it a great deal; and as 
'* the Blood run from me, I came to my felf ; an4 
*' the Violence of the Flame or the Fever, I was 
" in, abated, and fo did the ravenous Part of the 
*' Hunger. 

" Then I grew fick, and reach'd to vomit, but 
" could not; fori had nothing in my Stomach to 
*' bring up: After I had bled fome Time, I 
" fvvoon'd, and they ail believ'd I was dead ; but 
*' I came to my felf foon after, and then had a moft 
*' dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not to be defcri- 
*' bed ; not like the Cholick, but a gnawing ea- 
*^ ger Pain for Food : And towards Night it went 
*' off with a kind of earneft Wifhing or Longing 
" for Food; fomething like, as I fuppofe, the 
*^ Longing of a Woman with Child. 1 tookano- 
'' ther Draught of Water with Sugar in it, but 
** my Stomach loathed the Sugar, and brought, 
*^ it all up again ; then I took a Draught of Wa- 
" ter without Sugar, and that flay'd with me; 
*^ and I laid me down 'upon the Bed, praying 
*' moil heartily, that it would pleafe God to 
*' rake me away ; and compofing my Mind in 
*' Hopes of it, I flumbcr'd a while, and then 
" waking, thought my felf dying, being light with 
'*' Vapours from an empty Stomach. 1 recom- 
" mended my Soul then to^ God, and earneAly 
*' wifii'd that fome Body would throw me into the 
'' Sea.

" All this while my Miftrefs lay by me, jull, a^ 
*' I thought, expiring, but bore it with much more 
** Patience than I, and gave the laft Bit of Bread 
*' fhe had left to her Child, my young Mafter, who 
** would not have taken it, but ILe obliged him to 
" eat it; and I believe itfav'd his Life. 

" Towards the Morning I flept again, and firft 
" when I awaked, I fell into a violent Paffionof 
" Crying, and after that had a fecond Fit of vio- 
*' lent Hunger. I got up ravenous, and in a mofl 
*' dreadful Condition. HadmyMiftrefs been dead, 
*' as much as I loved her, I am certain, I fhould 
" have eaten a Piece of her Flefh, with as much 
" Relifh, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the 
*' Flefti oi any Creature appointed for Food ; and 
*' once or twice I was going to bite my own Arm. 
** At laft, I faw the Bafon in which was the Blood 
" I had bled at my Nofe the Day before. I ran to 
" it, and fwallowed it with fuch Hafle, and fuch 
** a greedy Appetite, as if I had wondred noBo- 
" dy had taken it before, and afraid it would be 
*' taken from me now. 

" Tho' after it was down, the Thoughts of it 
*' fill'd me with Horror, yet it checkM the Fit of 
*' Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair Water, 
" and was composed and refrefh'd for fome Hours 
" after it. This was the 4th Day, and thus I 
^' held it, 'till towards Night, when within the 
" Compafs of three Hours, I had all thefe (everal 
" Circumftances over again, one after another, 
*' ( 'viz... ) fick, fleepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the 
" Stomach, then ravenous again, then fick again, 
" then lunatick, then crying, then ravenous again ; 
" and fo every Qt^arter of an Hour, and my Strength 
" wail:cd exceedingly. At Night I laid me down, 
'' having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I 
^^ lliould die before Morning. 

'' All 



[ i88 ] 

" All this Night I had no Sleep. But the Hun- 
5' ger was now curnedinto a Difeafe ; and I had a 
,*' terrible Cholick and Griping, by Wind, inftead 
f ot Food, having Found its Way into the Bowels. 
" And in this Condition I lay ''till Morning, when 
'' was furprized a little with the Cries and La- 
^^ mentations of my young Mafter, who called out 
" to me that his Mother was dead. I lifted up 
'^ my felf a lictle^ for I had not Strength to rife, 
" but found fhe was not dead, though flie was 
*' able to give very little Signs of Life. 

*' I had then fuch Convullions in my Stomach, 
^^ for want of fomp Suftenance, that I cannot de- 
" fcribe, with fuch frequent Throws and Pangs 
*' of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of 
*' Death can imitate : And in this Condition I 
" was, when I heard the Seamen above cry out, 
" A Sail, a Sail, and halloo and jump about, as 
" if they were dif];ra(9:ed. 

*' I was not able to get off from the Bed, and 
*' my MiPireis riiuch lefs ; and my young Malfer 
'' was fo lick, tl^at I thought he had been expi- 
^^ ring; fo we could ngt open the Cabin Door, 
" or get any Account u^hat it was that occafioned 
*^ fuch a Combalbon, nor had we had any Con- 
*' verfation with tlie Ship's Company for two 
" Days ; they having told us, that they had not 
" a Mouthful of any Thing to eat in the Ship ,♦ 
" and they told us afterwards, they thought we 
" had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful Condition we were in 
*' when you were fent to fave our Lives , and how 
" you found us. Sir, you ki.iOw as well as I, and 
" better too. 

This was her own Relation, and is fuch a di- 
flin6: Accoiut of Starving'to Death, as I confcft, 

I ne- 



[ i89 ] 

. 1 net'er met wlrh, and was exceeding entertat'n- 
ing to mc. I am the rather apt to bel.'eve it to 
be a true Account, becaule the Youth gave me 
an Account ot" a good Part of it ,* though I muft 
own, not To diftind and (o feelingly as his Maid ; 
and the rather, becaufe it feems his Mother fed 
him at the Price Oi' her own Lite: But rhe poor 
Maid, tho' her Conllitution being flronger than 
that of her Miftrefs, who was in Years, and a 
weakly Woman too, ilie might flruggle harder with 
it. 1 fay, the poor Maid might be fuppofed to feel 
the Extremity fomething fconer than her Miflrefs, 
Avho might be allowed to keep the lad Bit fome- 
thing longer than fhe parted with any to relieve the 
Maid. No Queihon, as the Cafe is here related, 
if our Ship, or fome other, had not fo providen- 
tially met them, a k\v Days more would have 
ended all their Lives, unlefs they had prevented it 
by eating one another ; and even that, as their Cafe 
ftood, would have ferved them but a little while, 
they being 500 Leagues from any Land, or any 
Pollibility of Relief, other than in the miraculous 
Manner it happened : But this is by the Way. 
J return to my Difpofition of Things among the 
People. 

A^nd, Firfi^ It is to be cbferv'd here. That for 
many Reaions I did not think fit to let them 
know any Thing of the Sloop I had framed, and 
which 1 thought of fetting up among them, for I 
found, at leaft at my firfi comings fuch Seeds of Divi- 
fions among them, that I faw it plainly, had I 
fet up the Sloop, and left it among them, they 
would upon every light Difgufl have feparated, and 
gone away from one another, or perhaps have tur- 
ned Pyrates, and fo made the Illand a Den of 
Thieves, inftead of a Plantation of (ober and re- 
ligious People, fo as I intended it. Nor did I leave 

the 



[ 190 ] 

the two Pieces oF Brafs Cannon that I had on 
Board, or the two Qtiarter-Deck Guns, that my 
'Nephew took extraordinarily, for the fame Rea- 
fon. I thought it was enough to qualify them for 
a defenlive War againfl: any that fhouid invade 
them ; but not to fet them up for an offenfive War, 
or to encourage them to go Abroad to attack o- 
thers, which in the End would only bring Ruin 
and Deftrudion upon themfelves and all their Un- 
dertaking. I referved the Sloop therefore, and the 
Guns, for their Service another Way, as I {hall 
obferve in its Place. 

I have now done with the Wand. I left them 
all in good Circumftances, and in a flourifhing 
Condition, and went on board my Ship again 
the of y having been five 

and twenty Days among them. And as they were 
all refolved to ftay upon the Kland 'till I came to 
remove them, I pr .mifed to fend fome farther Re- 
lief from the Brafils^ if I could poflibly Rnd an Op- 
portunity : And particularly, I promifed to fend 
them fome Cattle^ fuch as Sheep, Hogs and Cows. 
For as to the two Cows and Calves which I brought 
from Englandy we had been obliged by the Length 
of our Voyage to kill them at Sea, for want of 
Hay to feed them. 

The next Day, giving them a Salute of five 
Guns at Parting, we fet Sail, and arrived at the 
Bay of All-Saints in the Brafils in about 22 Days j 
meeting nothing remarkable in our Paflage, but 
this. That about three Days after we faifd, being 
becalm'd, and the Current fetting flrong to the 
E.N.E. running, as it were, into a Bay orGulph 
on the Land Side, we were driven fomethingout 
of our Courfe, and once or twice our Men cry'd 
Land to the Eaftward i but whether it was the 

Coa~ 



[i9i] 



Cohtinent or Wands, we could not tell by any 
Means. 

But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea 
fmooth, and the Weather calm, we Taw the Sea, 
as it were covered towards the Land with fome- 
thing very black, not being able to discover what 
it was, 'till after fome Time, our chiet* Alate go- 
ing up the main Shrowds a little Way, and look- 
ing at them with a Perfpcctive, cry'd out it was 
an Army. I could not imagine what he meant 
by an Army, and fpoke a little haftily, calling the 
Fellow a tool, or fome fuch Word : Nay, Sir, 
fays.hey don't be angry, for 'tis an Army and a 
Fleet too; fori believe there are a thouiand Ca- 
noes, and you may fee them paddle along, and 
they are coming towards us too, apace. 

1 was a little fiirpriz'd then indeed, and fo was 
my Nephew, the Captain ; for he had heard fuch 
terrible Stories of them in the Ifland, and having 
never been in thofe Seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but faid two or three 
Times, we fhould all be devour'd. I muft confefs, 
coniidering we were becalm'd, and the Current 
fet ftrong towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worfe : 
However, I bad him not be afraid, but bring 
the Ship to an Anchor, as foon as we came fo 
near to know that we mufl engage them. 

The Weather continu'd calm, and they came 
on apace towards us; fo I gave Order to come 
to an Anchor, and furl all our Sails : As for the 
Savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but 
Fire ,* and therefore they fliould get their Boats out, 
and fallen them, one clofe by the Head, and the 
other by the Stern, and Man them both well, and 
wait the IiTue in that Poifure. This I did, that 
the Men in the Boats might be ready with Skeets 
and Buckets to put out any Fire thefe Savages 

might 



[ 19^ 1 , 

might ehdeavbur ro fix to the Outfide of thi 
Ship. 

In this Pofture we lay by for them, and in a lit- 
tle while they came up with us ; but never was 
fuch a horrid Sight feen by Chriflians : My Mate 
was much miflaken in his Calculation of their 
Number, I mean of a thoufand Canoc:; ,* the mofl: 
we could make of them when they came up, be- 
ing about a hundred and fix and twenty ; and a 
great many of them too j for fome of them had 
iixteen or feventeen Men in them, and fome more; 
and the leaft fix or feven. 

When they came nearer to us, they feem'd to 
be ftruck with Wonder and AIl:orli(hment, as at a 
Sight which they had doubtlefs never feen before ; 
nor could they at firfl, as we afterwards under- 
ftood, know what to make of us. They came 
boldly up, however, very near to us, and feem'd 
to go about to row round us ; but vve call'd to our 
Men in the Boats, not to let them come too 
near them. 

This very Order brought us to an Engage- 
ment with them, without our defigning it ; for 
five or fix of their large Canoes came fo near our 
Long-Boat, that our Men beckon'd with their 
Hands to them to keep back ; which they under- 
llood very well, and went back ; but at their Re- 
treat, about 50 Arrows came on board us from 
thofe Boats ; and one of our Men in the Long^ 
Boat was very much wounded. 

However, I call'd to them not to fire by any 
Means; but we handed down fome Deal-Boards 
into the Boat, and the Carpenters prefently fet 
up a kind of a Fence, like wafte Boards, to cover 
them from the Arrows of the Savages, if they 
fhould flioot again. 

About 



[ m 1 

About half an Hour afterwards thty came all 
bp in a Body a-ftern of us, and pretty near us, (6 
near that we could eauly difcern what they were, 
tho' we could not tell rheir Defign : And 1 eafily 
found they were fome of my old Friend.s the fame 
Sort of Savages that I had been ufcd to engage 
with j and in a little Time more they row'd a lit- 
tle farther ; out to Sea, 'till they came dircdly 
Broad-fide with us, and then row'd down flrait 
upon us, 'till they came ib near, that they cpuld 
hear us fpeak. Upon this I ordered all my Men 
to keep clofe, left they fhould dioat any more 
Arrows, and made all our Guns ready; but be- 
ing fo near as to be within hearing, I ma.dc Friday 
go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them 
in his Language to know what they meant, which, 
accordingly he did ; whether they underilood him 
or not, that I knew not : But as foon as he had 
cairdtothem, fix of them, who were in the fore- 
moft or nighefl: Boat to us, turn*d their Canoes 
from us, and flooping down, fnew'd us their na- 
ked Backfides, jull: as if in Englijh^ faving your 
l^refence, they had bid us kijs— — . Whether this 
was a Defiance or Challenge, we know not; or 
whether it was done in meer Contempt, or as a 
Signal to the reft ,• but immediately Friday cry'd 
out they were going to fhoor, and unhappily for 
him poor Fellow ; they let fly about 300 of their 
Arrows, and, to my inexprcllible Grief, kill'd 
poor Friday^ no other Man being in their Sight. 
. The poor Fellow was fliot with no lefs than three 
Arrows, and about three more fell very near him ; 
fuch unlucky Markfmen they were. 

I was fo enrag'd with the Lofs of iny old Set" 
vant, the Companion of all my Sorrows and Soli- 
tudes, that I immediately ordered five Guns to be 
loaded with foiaU Shot, and four with great, and 
Part II. O gave 



[ i94 ] 

gare them fv.ch a Broad-fide, as they had never 
Ireard in their Lives before, to be fnre. 
' They were nbt above half a Cable Length off 
•when we fir'd ; and our Gunners took their Aim 
fe wellj that three or four of their Canoes were 
cverfet, as we had reafon to believe, by one Shot- 
only, 

The ill Manners of turning up theifbare Back- 
fidcs to us, gave lis no great Oftbnce ; neither did 
1 know for certain, whether that which would pafs 
for the greatcft- Contempt among u^rmlght be 
iindcrftood fo by them, or not ; therefore in Re- 
turn, I had only refolv'd to Irave fir'dfoiir or five 
Guns at them with Powder only, which L knew 
■^'OiM fright them fufficiently : But when they 
iiiot at us diredly with all the Fury they were 
capable of, and efpecially as they had kill'd my 
poor Friday, whom I fo entirely lov'd and valu'dy 
and who indeed fo well deferv'd it ; 'I not onl/ 
hdd been juflify'd before God and Man, but 
would have been very glad, if I could, to have 
overfet every Canoe 'there, and drown'd every 
Cne of them.. 

' I can neither tell howm any v/e 'kilfd, or how 
many we wounded ac this Broad-fide ,* but fure 
fuch a Fright and Hurry never was feeh among 
fuch a Multitude; there were 13 or 14 of their 
Canoes fplit and overfet in all, and the Men all fet 
^ fwimming ; the refi: frighted out of their Wits, 
fcour'd away as fad as they could, taking but little 
Care to fave tliofe whofe Boats were fplit or fpoi- 
led with our Shot. So I fuppofe, that they were 
many of them Jofl. And our Men took one poor 
Fellow fwimming for his Life, above an Hour 
after they were all gone. 

^ Our fmaJ Shot from our Cannon mufi: needs 
kill and wound a great many : But in Ihort, we 

neve 



[ 195] 

hever knew any Thing liow it went with them ; 
for they iled To faft, that in three Hours or there- 
abouts, we could not fee above three or four drag- 
gling Canoes ^ nor did we ever fee the reft any 
more ,* for a Breeze of Wind fpringing up the 
fame Fvening, we weighed and fet Sail for the 
Erajih. 

We had a Prifoner indeed ,* but the Creature 
was fo fullen, that he would neither eat or fpeak ;; 
and we all fancy 'd he would flarve himfelf to 
Death : But I took a V/ay to cure him j for I 
made them take him and turn him into the Long- 
boat, and made him believe they would tofs him 
into the Sea again, and fo leave him where they 
found him, if he would not fpeak : Nor would 
that do i but they really did throw him into the 
Sea, and came away from him -, and then he 
follov/'d them ; for he fwam like a Cork, and 
call'd to them in his Tongue, tho* they knew not 
one Word of what he faid : However, at laft they ' 
took him in again, and then he began to be more 
tradable -, nor did I ever deiign they fhould drown 
him. 

We were now under Sail again ; but I was the moft 
difconfolate Creature alive, for want of my Man 
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the Ifland, to have taken one of the refl 
from thence for my Occafion, but it could not 
be ; fo we went on. We had one Prifoner, as I 
have faid *, and 'twas a long while before we could 
make him underfland any thing : But, in time, 
our Men taught him fome Englifl), and he began 
to be a little tradable ; afterwards we enquired 
what Country he came from, but could make no- 
thing of what he faid ; for 1 is Speech was fo odd, 
all Gutturals, and fpoke in the Throat in fuch an 
hollow odd Manner, that we could never form a 
O a Word 



[ 196 1 

Word from him; and we were all of OpinloH?* 
that they might fpeak that Language as well, i^ 
they were gagg'd, as othervvife: Nor could we 
perceive that they l:ad any Occalion, either foif 
Teeth, Tongiie, Lips or Falat ; bur form'd their 
Words, juft as a hunting Horn forms a Tune with' 
an open Throat. He told us however, fome time 
after^ when we taught him to fpeak a little Englijh^ 
that they were going with their Kings to hght d^ 
great Battle. Whenhefaid Kings, we ask'd him 
3io\v ma'ny Kings } He faid, they were FIVE' 
INATION, we could not make him iinderiland" 
the Plural S. and that they all;oin^d to go againft 
*]kiio' Nation, We ask'd him, what made them 
comenp to us ? He faid, to inakee to great Wonder 
look : Where it is to be obferv'd, That all thofe 
iNatives, as alfo thofe of Africa^ when they learn' 
E.nghfl)i they always add two E's at the End of 
the Words where we ufe one, and make the Ac- 
cent upon them, as 77? ake e takc4, and the like j and' 
we could not break them of it; nay, I could hard- 
ly make Friday leave it oif, tho' at lafthedid. 

And now I name the poor Fellow once more/ 
I muft take my lafl: Leave of him ; poor honefi 
Friday! We buried him with all the Decency and' 
So!em;jitj' poflible, by putting him into a Coffin, 
and throwing him into the Sea : And I caus'd ^em 
to fire eleven Guns fdv him ; and fo- elided the 
Life of the mofl grateful, (-aithful, honei^, aiidmoft 
aft'ectionate Servant that ever Man had. 

We wQut now away with a fair Wind for Bra- 
fily and in about twelve Days Time we made Land 
in the Latitude of five Degrees South of the Line,- 
beingthe North Eaftermolt Land of all that Part 
of America. We kept onS. by E. in Sight of the 
Shore four Days, when we made Cape St> Augu- 
ftineyznd in tliree Days came to an Anchor ell' of 
Li^ - - the 



C ^91 ] 

he Bay of All Saints^ the old Place of my DeliVe^ 
ance, from whence came both my good and evil 
Fate. 

Never Ship came to this Part that had lefsBii- 
finefs than I had \ and yet it was with great Diffi- 
culty that we were admitted to hold the leaft 
Correfpondence on Shore, not my Planter himfelf, 
who was alivcj and made a great Figure among 
them j not ray two Merchants Truftees, not the 
Fame of my wonderful Prefcrvation in that liland, 
could obtain me that Favour : But my Partner re- 
membring, that I had given 500 Moidores to the 
Prior of the Monaftery of the Augnflines^2cc\6. 272 
to the Poor, went to the Monaftery, and obliged 
the Prior that then was, to go to the Governor, 
and get Leave for me perfonally, with the Captain 
and one more, belides eight Seamen, to come on 
Shore, and no more ; and this upon Condition 
abfolutely capitulated for, that we fliould not of- 
fer to land any Goods out of the Ship^ or to carry 
any Perfon away without Licence. 

They were fo flrid with us, as to landing any 
Goods, that it was with extream Difficulty that 
I got on Shore three Bales of Enghjh Goods, inch 
as, fine broad Cloaths, Stufts, and fome Linnen, 
which I had brought for a Prefent to my Partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted Man, 
tho' like me, became from little at firfh and tho* 
he knew not that I had the leafl Defign of giving 
him any Thing, he fent me on Board a Prefent of 
frefii Provifioiis, VVine, and Sweat-meats, worth 
above 30 Moidores, including fome Tobacco^ 
and three or four fine Medals in Gold : But I was 
even v/ith iiim in my Prefent, which, as I have 
faid, confided ot fine broad Cl^ath, EngUjh Stuffs, 
Lace, and fine Hollands. Alfo I delivered him 
about the Value of 100 lib. Ster-k in the (lime

Goods, for other Ufes ; and I oblig'd him to fee 
up the Sloop which I had brought with me from 
Engliindy as I have faiu, for the \]^q. of my Colo- 
ny, in order to fend the Refrefliments I intended 
to my Plantation. 

Accordingly, he got Hands, and finifli'd the 
Sloop in a very few Days, for Ihe was ready framed 
and 1 gave the Mailer of her (uch Inftrudions, 
as he could not mifs the Place, nor did hemifs them, 
as I had an Account from my Partner afterirards, 
I got him foon loaded with the fmall Cargo I 
fent them ; and one of our Seamen that had been 
on Shore with me there, otfer'd to go with the 
Sloop, and fettle there upon my Letter to the 
Governour Sfaniard^to allot him a fiifficient Quan- 
tity of Land for a Plantation j and giving him 
fome Clothes, and Tools for his Planting- V\^ork, 
which he faid he underllood, having been an old 
Planter at Maryland, and a Buccaneer into the 
Bargain. 

I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he 
defired j and as an Addition, I gave him the Sa- 
vage, which we had taken Prifoner of War, to 
be his Slave, and order'd the Governour Spaniard 
to give him his Share of every thing he wanted, 
with the rtff. 

When we came to fit this Man out, my old Part- 
ner told me, there was a certain very honed Fel- 
low, a Brafil Planter of his Acquaintance, who 
had fallen into the Difpleafure ot the Church ; I 
know not whar the Matter is with him, fnys he; 
but on my Confcience, I think he is a, Heretick 
in his Heart, and he has been obliged to conceal 
himfelf for fear of the Inquidtion ; that he would 
be very glad of fuch an Opportunity to make his 
Efcape, with his Wite and two Daughters ; and if 
I would let them go to the liland, and allot them 

a Plaiii-

a Plantation, he would give them a fmall Stock to 
be^in with ; for the Officers oF ihc Inqniiition had 
feiz'd all his Etfeds and Eflate, and he had no- 
thing left but a little Hon (hold- Stuff, and two 
Slaves. And, adds he, Tho' 1 hate his Principles, 
yet I would not have him fall into their Hands ; tor 
he would aiJuredly be burnt alive, it he docs. 

I granted this prefently, and join'd my Englifb 
Man with them, and we concealed the Man, and 
his Wife and Daughters on board our Ship, till 
the Sloop put out to go to Sea ; and then (having 
put ail their Goods on board the Sloop, fome 
time before) we put them on board the Sloop, 
after he was got out oi the Bay. 

Our Seaman was mightily pleas'd with this new- 
Partner; and their Stock indeed was much alike 
rich in Tools, in Preparations, and a Farm, but 
nothing to begin with, but as above : However,. 
they carried over with them, which was worth all 
the reft, fome Materials for planting Sugar-Canes, 
with fome Plants of Canes; which he, I meant, 
the Portugal Man, underftocd very well. 

Among the red of the Supplies fent my Tenants 
in the Ifland, I fent them by their Sloop, three 
Milch Cows, and five Calves, about 22 Hogs a- 
mong em, three Sows big wich Pig, two Mares, 
and aStone-Horfe. 

For my Spaniards^ according to my Promife, I 
engag'd three Portugal Women to go, and recom- 
mended ic to them to marry them, and ufe them 
kindly. 1 could have procured more Women, but 
I remembered, that the poor perfecuted Man^ had 
two; Daughters, and 'there was but five ot the 
Spaniards that wanted -, the reft had Wives of their 
own, tho' in another Country. 

Atl this Cargo arriv'd fate, and as you may 
eafily fnppofe, very welcome to my old Inhabi-

ants, who were now, with this Addition, between 
.{ixtyand fev^nty People, bcfides little Children ; 
of which, there was a great many. I found Let- 
ters at London from them all by the Way of Lisboi^y 
when I came b^ick to England ; qf which I fhall 
alfo take fome Notice immediately. 

I have now done with my Ifland, and all Man- 
'ner of Difcourfc about it -, and whoever reads the 
.reft of ray M^^^oraiidumsy would dp well to turn 
his Thoughts entirely from it, and exped to read 
oi the Follies of an old Man, not warnM by his 
own Harms, much lefs by thofc oi other Men, to 
beware of the like; net cool'd by al mo ft forty 
Years Mifery and Difappointments, not fatisfy a

I had no more Btiiinefs to go to the Eafl- Indies^ 
than a Man at full Liberty, and having committed 
no Crime, has to go to the Turn-key ;it JSleivgate.y 
and delirehim to lock him up among the Prifoners 
there, and ftarve him. Had I taken a fm^U Vef- 
fel horn England, andvvent directly to the Ifland i 
■had I loaded her, as I did the other VclTel, with 
all the Neceilaries fpr the Plantation, and fpr my 
People took a Patent from the Govcrnour here, 
to have fecnr'd ray Property, in Subjection only 
to that of England ; had I carried over Cannon anj 
Ammunition, Servants and People, to plant, and 
taking PoiTclIion of the Place, fortified and ftreng- 
then'd it in the Name o^ Engl and y and increased it 
with People, as I might eadly have done j had I 
then fettrd my fcif there, and fent the Ship back,

in fix Months timC) and order'd niy Friends to 
have ii-ted her out again for our Supply; had I 
done this, andffaid there my feif, I had, at leaft,

fefl with a wandring Spirit, fcorn'd all Advanta- 
ges; 1 pleafed my felt witii being the Patron df 
thofe People I placed there, and doing for them in 
^ Kind of haughty majeftick Way, like an old Pa- 
triarchal Monarch ; providing for them^ as if I 
had been Father of the whole Family, as well as 
of the Plantation. But I never fo much as preteri- 
jded to plant in the Name of any Government 
or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince, or to 
call my People Subjeds to any one Nation more 
than another ; nay, I never fo much as gave the 
Place a Name, but left it as I found it, belonging 
to no Man ; and the People under no Difcipline 
or Government but my own ; who, though I had 
Influence over them as Father and Benefador, had 
no Authority or Power, to ad or command one 
way or other, farther than voluntarily Confent mo- 
ved them to comply. Yet even this, had I flay'd 
there, would have done well enough ; but as I 
rambled from them, and came there no more, the 
lafl Letters I had from any of them, was by my 
Partner's Means ; who afterwards fent another 
Sloop to the Place, and who fent me V/ord, tho' 
I had not the Letter till five Years after it wa5 
written, that th^y went on but poorly, were male- 
content with their long Stay there. That ]/Fili* 
Atkins was dead : That five of the Spaniards were 
come away, and that tho^ they had not been much 
molcfled by the Savages, yet they had fome Skirr 
millies with them ', that they begged of him to 
write to me, to think of the Promife I had made, 
to fetch them away, that they might fee their 
own Country again before they dy'd. 

But I was gone a WHd-Goofe Chafe indeed ', and 
they that will have any more of me^ muft be con- 
tcni to follow me thro' a new Variety of Follies, 

Hard- 



[ 201 ] 

Harddifps, and wild Ad venters ,* wherein the Ju- 
ftice ot Providence may be duly obferved, and we 
may fee how easily Heaven can gorge us with our 
own Delires, make the Itrongeft of our Wifhes be 
our Affiidion, and punifh us moft fev^TcJy with 
thofe very Things which we think, it wpuld be 
our utmoft Happinefs to be allowed in. 

Let no wife Man flatter himfelf with the 
Strength of his own Judgment, as if he was able 
to chufe any particular Station of Life for himfelf. 
Man is a fliort-iighted Creature, {qcs but a very 
little Way before him; and as his Paflions are none 
of his bed Friends, fo his particular Affcdions 
are generally his worft Counfellors. 

I fay this with Refped to the impetuous Defire 
I had from a Youth, to wander into the World ; 
and how evident it now was, that this Principle 
was preferv'd in me for my Punifhment. How it 
came on, the Manner, the Circumftance, and the 
Conclufion of it, it is ealie to give you Hilbrical- 
ly, and with its utmoft Variety of Particulars, 
But thefecret Ends of Divine Power, in thus per- 
mitting us, to be hurried down the Stream of 
our ov/n Defires, is only to be underflood of thofe 
who can liften to the Voice of Providence, and 
draw religious Confequences from God's Juflice, 
and their own Miflakesi 

Be it, I had Bnlinefs, or no Bufinefs, away I 
went. 'Tis no Time now to enlarge any farther 
upon the Reafons, or Abfurdity of my own Con- 
duct. But to come to the Hiftory. I was em- 
barked for the Voyage, and the Voyage I went. 

I fliculd only add here, that my honeft and triiy 
pious Clergyman left me here ; a Ship being ready 
to go to LisboHy he ask'd me Leave to go thither, bfe- 
ingfliil, as he obferved, bound never to finifii any 
Voyage he began. How happy had it been I'or m.e, 
if I had gone with him 1 But 



[ ^03 ] 

But it was too late now. All things Hcaveii 
appoints are beft. Had I gone with him, I had 
never had fo many Things to be thankhil for, 
and you had never heard of the Second Part of 
the Travels and Adventures oi Robinfon Cnifoe . So 
I muft leave here the fruitlefs exclaiming at my 
felf, and go on with my Voyage. 

From the Braftls^ wc made direftly away over 
the Atlantick Sea^ to the Cape de Ion Efperance, or 
as we call it, T^he Cape of Good Hope ; and had a 
tolerable good Voyage, our Courfe generally -Sb?///?- 
Eaft ] now and then a Storm, and fome contrary 
Wmds, but my Difafters at Sea were at an End ; 
my future Rubs and crofs Events were to befal 
me on Shore ; that it might appear the Land was 
as well prepared to be our Scourge, as the Sea, 
when Heaven, who dircds the Circumflances of 
Things, pleafes to appoint it to be fo. 

Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had 
a Supra Cargo on board, who was to dired all her 
Motions after fhe arrived at the Cape; only being 
limied to certain Numbers of Days, for Stay, by 
Charter-party, at the feveral Ports fhe was to go 
to. This was none of my Bulinefs, neither did I 
meddle with it at all. My Nephew, the Captain, 
and the Supra-Cargo adjufting all thofe things be- 
tween them, as they thought fit. 

We made no Stay at the Cape longer than was 
needful, to take in frefh Water, but made the befl 
of our Way for the CoafI: of Coromandel. We were 
indeed informed, that a Frencb}s^id.n of War of fif- 
ty Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were 
goi.e tor the Indies, and as I knew we were at War 
with France, 1 had fome Apprehenfions of them; 
But they went their Way, and we heard no more 
of them. 

I ftall 



[ Z04 ] 

i fliall not pe/ler my Account, or the Readei:* 
with Defcriptions of Places, Joumais of our Voya- 
ges, Variations of Compafs, Latitudes, Meridian- 
DiRances, Trade- Winds, Situation of Ports, and 
|:he like ; fuch as almoft all the Hiflories of long 
^Navigation are full of, and makes the Reading 
tirefome enough, and are perfe6tly unprofitable to 
all that read it, except only to thofe who are to 
go to ti.ofc Places themfelves. 

It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which 
we touch'd at, and what occurred to us upon our 
paffing from one to another. We touch'd hrfl: at 
the Ifland pf Madagafcar ; where, tho' the People 
are fierce and treacherous, and in particular, very 
well armed with Lances and Bows, which they 
life with inconceivable Dexterity ; yet we fared ve- 
ry well with them a while, they treated us very ci- 
vily ; and for fome TriHes which we gave them, 
fuch as Knives, Scitlars, &c. they 'brought us ele- 
ven good fat Bullocks, middling in Size, but very 
good in Fiefli ; which we took in partly for frefh 
Provifions for our prefent Speqdipg, and the reft, 
1:0 §alc for the Ship's life, 

We were obliged to flay here fome Time after 
we had furnifli'd our felves with Provifions ; and 
3, that was always too curious, to look into every 
Nook of the World wherever I came, was for 
going on Shore as faft as I could. It was on the 
Eafi Side of the Ifiand that we went on Shore onq 
Evening ; and the People, who by the Way are 
very numerous, came thronging about us, and 
Hood gazing at us at a Diitance ,* but as we had 
traded freely with them, and had been kindly 
wfed, we thought our fclves in no Danger : But 
whenwefaw the People, we cut three Boughs out 
of a Tree, and Truck tiiem up at a Diftauce from* 
us, which ir fecms, is a Mark in die Country, not 

onlv 



[ 105 ] 

6nly of Truce and Fricndfhip, but when it Is ac=- 
^epted, the other Side fet up three Poles orBoughs^ 
Which is a Signal, that they accept the Truce too; 
burthen, this is a known Condition cf the Truce, 
that you are not to pafs between their three Poles 
towards them, nor they to come pail your three 
Poles or Boughs, towards you ,* fo that you are 
perie<5tly fecure within the three Poles, and all the 
Space between your Poles and theirs, is allow'd 
like a Market, for hee Converfe, Traffick, and. 
Commerce. When you go th^re, you muil: not 
carry your Weapons with you ; and if they come 
into that Space, they (lick up their Javelins and 
Launces, all at the firil Poles, and come on un- 
arm'd ; but it any Violence is offer'd them, and 
the Truce thereby broken, away they run to the 
Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons, and then 
the Truce is at an End. 

It happen'd one Evening when we went on 
Shore, that a greater Number of their People 
came down than u(ual, but ail was very friendly 
and civil, and they brought in feveral Kinds of 
Provifions, for which we fatisfied them, withfucii 
Toys as we had , their Women alfo brought us- 
Milk, and Roots, and feveral Things very ac- 
ceptable to us, and all .was quiet; and we made 
irs a little Tent or Hur, of feme Boughs of Trees, 
and lay on Shore ail Night. 

I knew not what was the Occafion, but I was 
not fo well fatisfied to lye on Shore as the reft ; 
and the Boat lying at an Anch.or, about a Stone- 
caft from the Land, with two Men in her to take 
Care af her, Im^dcone of th.niicome on Shore, 
and getting fome Boughs of Trees to cover us alfo 
in the Boat, I fpread the Sail on the Bottom 
of the Boat, and lay under the Co' er of the Bran- 
ches of Trees all Njght in the Bear. 

About 



[206] 

About two a-clock in the Morning, wc heard 
one ot" our Men make a terrible Noife on the 
Shore, calling out for God's Sake, to bring the 
Boat in, and come and help them, for they were 
ail like to be murther'd ; at the fame Time I heard 
the firing of five Muskets, which was the Number 
of the Guns they had, and that, three Times 
over; for itfeems, the Natives here were not fo 
calily frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in 
America^ where I had to do with them. 

All this while, I knew not what was the Mat- 
ter; but rouzing immediately from Sleep with 
the Noife, I caus'd the Boat to be thrufl m, and 
refolved, with three Fuzees we had on board, to 
land and alTift our Men. 

We got the Boat foon to the Shore, but our 
Men werem too much Hafte ; for being come to 
the Shore, they plunged into the Water to get 
to the Boat with all the Expedition they could, 
being purfued by between three and four hundred 
Men. Our Men were but nine in all, and only 
five of them had Fuzees with them ; the reft had 
indeed Piftols and Swords, but they were of fmall 
Ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our Men, and with Dif- 
ficulty enough too, three of them being very ill 
wounded; and that which w^as ftill worfe, was 
that while we ftood m the Boat to take our Men 
in, we were in as much Danger as they were in 
on Shore; for they pour'd their Arrows m upon 
us fo thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side 
of the Boat up with the Benches, and two or 
three loofe Boards, which to our great Satisfa- 
(5tion we had by mere Accident or Providence in 
the Boat. 

And yet, had it been Day-light, they are it 
feems fuch exa6t Marks- men, that if they could 

have 



[ 107 1. 

^'Zvc feen but the lead Piirt of any of us, they 
would have been fare of us. We had by the Light 
of the Moon a little Sight of them, as they flood 
pelting us from the Shore with Darts and Ar- 
rowy j and having got ready our Fire-Arms, we 
gave them a Volley, that we could hear by the 
Cries of fome of uhem, that we had wounded feve- 
ral ; however, they ftood thus in Battle Array on 
the Shore till ' Break of Day, which, vjc fuppofe 
Was, that they might fee the better, to take their 
Aim at US. ,: fbuo; 

In this Conditon we lay, and cbirld not tell 
how to weigh our Anchor, or fet up our Sail, be- 
caufe we muf: needs ftand up in the Boat, and they 
were as fure to hit us, as wc were to hit a Bird in 
a Tree with fmal) Shot. We made S.gnals of Di- 
ftrefs to the Ship, whichj tho' Ave road a League 
off, yet my Nephew, the Captain, hearing our 
tiring, and by Glafies perceiving the Pofture 
we lay in, and that we Br'd towards the Shore, 
pretty well underflood us ^ and weighing Anchor, 
with all Speed, he flood as near the Shore as he 
durfl with the Ship, and then fent another Boat 
with ten Hands in her to a/Fill us; but we call'd 
to them not to come too near, telh'ng them what 
Condition we were in : Hovv^ever, they flood in 
nearer to us ; and one of the Men taking the 
End of a Tow- Line in his Hand, and keeping 
our Boat between him and the Enemy, fo that 
they could not perfectly fee him, iwam on board 
us, and made fafl the Line to the Boat ,* upon 
which we flipp'd our little Cable, and leaving our 
Anchor behind, they tow'd us out of Reach of 
the Arrows, we all the while lying clofe behind 
the Barricado we had made. 

As Toon as we were got from between the Ship 
and the Shore, that (lie could lay her Side to the 

Shore, 



[ 2l8 ] 



Shore, (he run along jufl by them, and we poured 
in a Broad-fide among them Joaden with Pieces 
of Iron and Lead, fmall Bullets, and fuch Stuff, 
beiides the great Shot, which made a terrible Ha- 
vcck aniongfi: them. 

When we were got on board, and out of Dan- 
ger, we had Time to examine into the Occafion 
of this Fray; and indeed our Supra-Cargo who 
had been otten in thofe Parts, put me upon it ; 
for he faid, he was fure the Inhabitants would 
not have touched us after we had made a Truce, if 
we had not done fomething to provoke them to 
it. At length it came out, (viz..) that an old 
Woman who had come to fell us fbme Milk, had 
brought it within our Poles, with a young Wo- 
man with her, who alfo brought fome Roots 
or Herbs; and while the old Woman, whether 
fhe was Mother to the young Woman or no, 
they could not tell, was felling us the Milk, one 
of our Men offered fbme Rudenefs to the WencH 
that was with her, at which the old Woman made 
a great Noife. However, the Seaman would not 
quit his Prize, but carry ^d her out of the old Wo- 
man's Sight among the Trees, it being almofl 
dark. The old Woman went away without her, 
and as we fuppofe, made an Out-cry among the 
f eoplc fhe came from ; who upon Notice, rais'd 
this great Army upon us in three or four Hours ; 
and it was great Odds, but we had been all de- 
flroy'd. 

One of our Men was kill'd with a Launce 
thrown at him juft at the Beginning of the At- 
tack, as he fally'd out of the Tent they had made ; 
the refl came off free, all but the Fellow who was 
the Occafion of all the Mifchief, who paid dear 
enough for his black Miflrefs ; for we could not 
hear what became of him a great while. We lay 

iipoii 



[ 209 ] 

upon the Shore two Days after, tho' the Wind pre- 
fented, and made Signals for him ; made our Boat 
fail up Shore and down Shore, (evera! Leagues, 
but in vain ; fo we were obliged to give him o- 
ver, and i^ he alone had fuffer'd for it, the Lofs 
had been the icfs. 

I could not fatisfie my iclf, however, without 
venturing on Shore once more, to try if I could 
learn any Thing of him or them ; it was the 
third Night after the Adion, that I had a great 
Mind to learn, if I could by anvMeans, what Mif- 
chief we had done, and how the Game flood on 
the Indians Side : I was careful to do it in the 
Dark, left we fhould be attacked again ,* but I 
ought indeed to have been fure, that the Men I 
went with had been under my Command, be- 
fore I engaged in a Thing fo hazardous and mif- 
chievous as I was brought into by it, without my 
Knowledge or Defign. 

We took twenty ftout Fellows with us as any 
in the Ship, belides the Supra-Cargo and my felf, 
and we landed two Hours before Midnight, at the 
fame Place where the Indians flood drawn up the 
Evening before. I landed here, becaufe my De- 
lign, as I have faid, was chiefly to fee if they had 
quitted the Field, and if they had left any Marks 
behind them of the Mifchief we had done them; 
and I thought, if we could farprize one or two of 
them, perhaps we might ^ct our Man again hj 
Way of Exchange. 

We landed without any Noife, and divided our 
Men into two Bodies, whereof the Boatfwain 
commanded one, and I the other ,* we neither 
faw or heard any Body ftir when wc landed, and 
we march'd up o:.e Body at a Diftance from the 
other, to the Place, but at firft could fee nothing, 
it being very dark ; till by and by, our Boatfwain 

Part II. P that 



[ 2IO ] 

^hat led the firft Party, ftumbled, and fell ovtt a 
dead Boy. This made them halt a while, for 
iaiovving by the Circumftances that they were at 
the Place, where the Indians had flood, they wait- 
ed for my coming up. Here we concluded to halt 
till the Moon began to rife, which we knew 
would be in lefs than an Hour, when we could ea- 
fily difcern the Havock we had made among them v 
we told two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground, 
whereof two were not quite dead : Some had an 
Arm, and fome a Leg flioc oft^ and one his Head « 
thole that were woiuided we fuppos'd they had 
carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full Difco- 
very of all we could come at the Knowledge 
of, I was refolv'd for going on Board \ but the 
Boatfwain and his Party fent me Word, that 
they were refolv'd to make a Vifit to the Indian 
Town, where thefe Dogs, as they call'd them, 
dwelt, and ask*d me to go along with them 3 
and if they could find them, as flill they^ fan- 
cied they fliould, they did not doubt getting a 
good Booty, and it might be, they might find 
77;o. Jsffery there, that 'a;^j the Man's Name rce had 
lojl. 

Had they fent to ask my Leave to gOy I knew 
well enough what Anfwer to have g\\xn them \ 
for I would have commanded them inflantly on 
Board, knowing it was not a Hazard fit for us 
to run, who had a Ship, and Ship-loading in our 
Charge, and a Voyage to make, which depend- 
ed very much upon the Lives of the Men s but 
as they fent me V/ord they v/ere refolved to go, 
and only ask^d me and my Company to go along 
with them, I pofitively refus'd it, and rofe up^ 
for I loas fitting on the Groirndy in Order to go to the 
Boat* One or two of the Men began to impor- 
tune 



till] 

tune me to go, and when I refused po/itiVelyi 
began to grumble, and fay they were not under 
my Command, and they would go : Come Jack^ 
fays one of the Men, will you go with me ? Til go 
for one ; Jack hid I>e would, and another fol- 
lowed, and then another : And in a Word, they 
all left me but one, whom I perfwaded to flay, 
and a Boy left in tjie Boat j [o the Supra-Cargo 
and I, with the third Man, went back to the 
Boat, where we told them we would ftay for 
them, and take Care to take in as many of 
them as fhould be left ; for I told them it was 
a mad Thing they were going about, and fup- 
pofed moil of them would run the Fate of T^o- 
mas Jeffery. 

They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it 
they would come off again, and they would take 
Care, &s. So away they went : I entreated 'em to 
confider the Ship and Voyage ,• that their Lives 
were not their own, and that they were entruftcd 
with the Voyage in fome Meafure, that if they 
mifcarry'd, the Ship might be loft for want of 
their Help, and that they could not anfwer it to 
God or Man. I faid a great deal more to 'em on 
that Head, but I might as well have talk'd to 
the Main Maft of the Ship j they were mad upon 
their Journey, only they gave me good Words, 
and begg'd I would not be angry : That they 
would be very cautious, and they did not doubt 
but they would be back again in an about Hour 
at fartheft ,* for the Indian Town, they faid, was 
not above half a Mile off, though they found it a- 
bove two Miles before they got to it. 

Wei], they all went away, as above -, and tho' 

the Attempt was defperate, and fuch, as none 

but mad Men would have gone about, yet to 

give them their due, they went about it as warily 

Pa as

as boldly : They were gallantly armed, tliat^'s 
true ; tor they had every *Man a Fuzec or Mul- 
ket, a Bayonet, every Maii a PiAol ; fome of 
them had broad CutialTes, Tome of them Hangers, 
and the Boatfwain and Two more, had Pole- 
Axes : Befides all which, they had among them 
thirteen Hand-Grenadoes. Bolder Fellows, and 
better provided, never went about any wicked 
iWork in the World. 

When they ^vent out, their chief Defign was 
PUinder, and they were in mighty hopes of iind- 
ing Gold there ; but a Circumflance which none 
of them were aware of, fet them on Fire with 
Revenge, and made Devils of them all. When 
they came to the few Indian Houfes which they 
thought had been the Tovv^n, which was not a- 
bove half a Mile off; they were under a great 
Difappointment ; for there were rot above 12 
or 13 Hoiifes •, and w^here the Town was, or 
bow big, they knew nor: They conful ted there- 
fore what to do, and were feme time before they 
could refolve : For if they fell upon thefe, they 
muft cut all their Throats, and it was ten to one 
but feme of them might efcape, it being in the 
l^ight, tho"* the Moon was upi and ii^ one efca- 
pccl, he would runaway, and raife all the Town, 
fo they lliould have a whole Army upon them : 
Again, on the other hand, it they went away, 
and left thofe untouched (for the People were all 
adeepj they could not tell which VVay to lock 
for the Town. 

However, uhe lad was tlie bell Advice ; fo 
they refolved to leave them, and look for the 
Town as well as they coi.ld. They went on a 
little Way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree ; 
this they prefently concluded, would be a good 
Guide to them ; for they faid, the Cow certain- 



[ iI5 ] 

ly beiong'd to the Town before them, or the 
Town behind them ; and if they untied her, they 
fhoiiid fee which Way fhe went ; i^ flie went 
back they had nothing to fay to her ; but 11 (ho 
went forward, they had nothing to do biit to 
follow her: So they cut the Cord, wiiich was 
made of twided Flags, and the Cow went on be- 
fore them-, in a Word, the Cow led them d.- 
redly to the Town, which as they repoa, con- 
fined of above 200 Houfcs, or Huts ) and in fomq 
of thefe, they found fcveral Families living toge- 
ther. 

Here they found all in Silence, as profoundly 
fecure, as Sleep, and a Country that iiad never 
feen an Euem} of thar Kind could make them ; 
and firft, they call'd another Council, to cond- 
der what they had to do , a id in a Word, they 
refolv'd to divide themfdvc^ into tniee Bodies, 
and to fet three Houfcs on Fire in three Parrs of 
the Town ; and as the Men came our, to fe'ze 
them and bind them ; if any refilled, they need 
not be ask'd what to do then, and fo to fearch 
the red of the Houfcs for Plunder; but they re- 
fQlv'd to m.arch filently frft, thro^ the Town, 
and fee what Dimenficns it was of, and if they 
might venture upon it or no. 

They did fo, and defperately refolv'd that they 
v/ould venture upon them; but while they were 
animating one another to the Work, three of 
them that were a liZiVc before the reft, call'd out 
aloud to them, and told them they had found 
T^pm. Jeffery ; they all run up to the Place, and 
fo it was indeed; for there they found the poor 
Fdlo'vv hang'd up naked by one Arm, and his 
Thro:.tci:t: tliere was an Indian Houfe jufl by 
the Tiee, wl.ere they found fixtcen or feventeea 
of the prlnci, al Indians who had been co'ncern'd fa 

P 3 the 



[ ii4] 

the Fray with us before ; and two or three of them 
wounded with our Shot ; and our Men found they 
were awake, and talking one to another in that 
Houfe, but knew not their Number. 

The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade fo 
enragM 'em, as before, that they fwore to one 
another they would be rcveng'd, and that not an 
Jndian who came into their Hands fhould have 
Quarter, and to Work they went immediately ; 
and yet notfo madly as by the Rage and Fury they 
were in might be expcded. Their firft Care was 
to get fomething that would foon take Fire ; but 
after a little Search, they found that would be 
to no Purpofe ; bur molt of the Houfes were 
low, and thatch'd with Flags or Rufhes, of which 
the Country is full ; fo they prefently made fome 
wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Pow- 
der in the Palms of their hands, and in a Quarter 
of an Hour they fet the Town on fire in four or 
five Places ,* and particularly that Hoife where 
the Indians were not gone to Bed. As foon as the 
Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures 
began to rufh out to fave their Lives j but met 
with their Fate in the Attempt, and efpecially at 
the Door, where they drove ^em back, the Boat- 
fwain himfelf killing one or two with his Pole-Axe. 
TheHoufc being large, and many in it, he did not 
care to go in, but call'd for a Hand-Grcnado, and 
threw it among 'em, which at firfl frighted 'em j 
but when ic biirfl:, made flich Havock among 'em, 
that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In fhort, moll; of the Indians who were in the 
open Part of the Houfe, were killed or hurt with 
the Grcnado, except two or three more who 
prefs'd to the Door, which the Boatfwain and two 
^ore kept v/ith their Bayonets in the Muzzles of 

their 



[115] 

Itheir Pieces, and difpatch'd all who came tha.^ 
V/2Ly. But there was another Apartmer't in -h^ 
Houfe where the Prince or King, or whatever he 
was, andfeveral other were, and thefe they kt'pt m 
till the Houle, which was by this time all of a iigbt 
iFlame, fell in upon them, and they were fmo.her'd 
or burnt together. 

All this while they fir'd not a Gun, becaufe 
they would not waken the People fafler than r.iey 
could mafler them ; but the Fire began lo waken 
them fafl: enough, and our Fellows were glad to 
keep a little together in Bodies ; for the Fire 
grew To raging, ail the Houfes being made of xight 
combuftible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the 
Street between them, and their Bafinefs was to 
follow the Fire for the furer Execution. As faft as 
the Fire either forc'd the People out of thcfe 
Houfes which were burning, or frighted them out 
of others, our People were ready at their Doors to 
knock them on the Head, ftill calling and halloo-^ 
i ig to one another, to remember Tlom. Jefery. 

While this was doing, Imuft confefs I was very 
unealie, and efpecially when I faw the Flames of 
the Town, which, it being Night, feem'd to be 
jufi: by me. 

My Nephew, the Captain, who was rouz'd by 
his Men too, feeing fuch a Fire, v/as very uneafie, 
not knowing what the Matter was, or what Dan- 
ger I was in ; efpecially hearing the Guns too ; 
for by this time they began toufc their Fire-Arms ; 
athoufand Thoughts opprefl his Mind concern- 
ing me and the Supra-Cargo what fliould become 
of us : And at lafr, tho' he could ill fpare any more 
Men, yet not knowing v/hat Exigence we might 
be i'n, he takes another Boat, and with ij Men 
and himfelf, come on Shore to me. 

P4 He 



[zi6] 

He was furprlz'd to fee me and tlie Supra-Cargo 
in the Boat with no more than two Men ; andtho' 
he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the 
fame Impatience with us to know what was doing ; 
for the Noifw continued, and the Flame encreas*d : 
In fhorc it was next to an ImpoiTibility for any 
Men in the World, to refirain their Curiofity, to 
know what had happen'd,or their Concern for the 
Safety of the Men : In a Word, the Captain told 
me, he would go and he^p hi5 Men, let what 
would come. I argu'd with him, as I did before 
with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, the Danger 
of the Voyage, thelntercft of the Owners and 
Merchants, &c. and told him, I would go, 2nd the 
two Men, and only fee if we could at a Diftance 
learn wha: was like to be the Event, and come 
back and tell him. 

It was ail one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was 
to talk to the reft before; he would go, he faid, 
and he only wifh'd he had left but ten Men in 
the Ship ; for he could not think of having his 
Men loll for want of Help, he had rather lofe the 
Ship, the Voyage, and his Life and all i and a- 
way went he. 

In a Word, I was no more able to ftay behind 
now, than I was to perfwade them not to go; fo 
in (hort, the Captain order^'d two Men to row 
back the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more, 
leaving the Long-Boat at an Anchor, and that 
when they came back, fix Men fiiould keep the 
two Boats, and fix more come after us ; fo that 
he left only 16 Men in the Ship j for the whole 
Ship^s Company ccnfifted of ^5 Men, where- 
of two were loft in the laft Qiiarrel, which brought 
this Mifchief on. . 

Bein^ now on the March, you maybe furewc 
fc!t little of the Ground we trode on j and being 

guided 



. [ ^17 1 

guided by tlie Fire, we kept no Path, but went 
diredly to the Place of the Flame. If the Noife 
of the Guns was furprizing to us before, the 
Cries of the poor People were now of quite another 
Nature, and fill'd us with Horror. I mufi; confefs, 
I never was at the Sacking a City, or at the Ta- 
king a Town by Sncrm. I had heard of Oli^/er 
Crornvjell's, taking Drogheda in Irelandy and killing 
Man, Woman, and Child. And I had read of Count 
T'tUfs. facking of the City oiMagdehurgh^ and cut- 
ting the Throats of 22000 of all Sexes. But I ne- 
ver had an Idea of the Thing \t felf before, nor 
is ix. poiTibie to defcribe it, or the Horror which 
was upon our Minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to 
the Town, tho"* there was no cutting the Streets of 
it for the Fire. The firfl Objed we met with, was 
the Ruins of a Hut or Houfe, or rather the Afhes 
of it, for the Houfe was confumed ; and jufl be- 
fore it, plain now to be feen by the Light of the 
Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill'd s and 
as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap 
among the Fire. In fhort, there were fuch In/lan- 
ces of a Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fu- 
ry, fomething beyond what was human, that we 
thought it impoffible our Men could be guilty of 
it, or if they were the Authors of it, we thought 
they ought to be every one of them put to the 
\yorfl of Deaths. But this was not all, we faw 
the Fire encreas'd forward, and the Cry went on 
jufi: as the Fire went on ; fo that we were in the 
utmoll Confufion. We advanced a little Way far- 
ther, and behqld, to our Aftonifiinient, three Wo- 
men naked, and crying in a mofl dreadful Man- 
ner, come flying, as if they had indeed had Wings, 
and after them (ixteen or feventeen Men, Natives, 
in the fame Terror and Condernaiion, with three 

of 



C 2i8 ] 

pf our Englijh Butchers, for I can call them no bet- 
ter, in their Rear, who, when they could not 
overtake them, fired in among them, and one that 
was killed by their Shot, fell down in our Sight. 
When the rell: faw us, believing us to be their 
Enemies, and that we would murder them as 
well as thofe that purfued them, they fet up a 
moft dreadful Shriek, efpecially the Women i and 
two of them fell down as if already dead with the 
Fright. 

My very Soul fhrunk within me, and my Blood 
run chill in my Veins, when I faw this ; and I be- 
lieve, had the three EngUJh Sailors that purfued 
them come on, I had made our Men kill them all. 
However, we took fome Ways to let the poor fly- 
ing Creatures know, that we would not hurt them, 
and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling 
down, with their Hands lifted up, made piteous 
Lamentation to us to fave them, which we let 
them know we would : Whereupon they crept 
altogether in a Huddle clofe behind us, as for Pro- 
tedion. I left my Men drawn up together, and 
charg'd them to hurt no Body, but if poUible to 
get at fome of our Peop'e, and fee what Devil it 
was poliefs'd them, and v/hat they intended to do ,* 
and in a Word, to command them ofFj aduring 
them, that if they flay'd till Day-light, they 
would have an hundred thcufand Men about their 
Ears. I fay, I left them, and went among thofe 
flying People, taking only two of our Men with 
me j and there was indeed a piteous Spectacle a- 
mong them. Some of them had their Feet terri- 
bly burnt with trampling and running thro' the 
Fire, others their Hands burnt y one of the Women 
had fallen down in the Fire, and was very much 
burnt before fhe could get out again ,* and two or 
three of the Men had Cuts" in their Backs and 

Thigh 



[ ^19 ] 



Thighs from our Men purfuing ; and another was 
fhot thro' the Body, and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the Occafion 
of all this was, but I could not underftand one 
Word they faid ,* tho' by Signs I perceived that 
fome of them knew not what v/as the Occafion 
themfelves. I was fo terrified in my Thoughts at 
this outrageous Attempt, that I could not ftay 
there, but went back to my own Men, and refol- 
ved to go into the Middle of the Town thro' the 
Fire, or w^hatever might be in the Way, and put 
^n End to it, coft what it would. Accordingly, 
as foon as I came back to my Men, I told them my 
Refolution, and commanded them to follow me, 
when in the very Moment came four of our Men 
with the Boatfwain at their Head, roving over 
the Heaps of Bodies they had killed, all covered 
with Blood and Duft, as if they wanted more Peo- 
ple to Mafl'acre, when our Men halloo'd to them 
as loud as they could halloo, and with much ado 
one of them made them hear ,* fo that they knew 
who we were, and came up to us. 

As foon as the Boatfwain faw us, he fet up a 
Halloo like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as 
he thought, more Help come, and without bea- 
ring to hear me. Captain, fays he, noble Captain, 
I am glad you are come ! We have not half done 
yet, villainous Hell-hound Dogs! TUkiil as many 
of them as poor I'om. has Hairs upon his Head. 
We have fworn to fpare none of them, we'll root 
out the very Nation of 'em from the Earth. And 
thus he run on, out of Breath too with A(5tion, 
and would not give us Leave to fpeak a Word. 
, At laft, raifing my Voice, that I might filence 
him a little. Barbarous Dog, faid I, what are you 
doing ? I won't have one Creature touched more, 
upon Pain of Death, I charge you upon your 

Life 



[ 220 ] 

Life, to flop your Hands, and fland flill here, or 
you are a dead Man this Minute. 

Why, Sir, fays he, do you know what you do, 
or what they have done ? It you want a Reafon 
for what we hare done, come hither. And with 
that he fliewed me the poor Fellow hanging with 
his Tnroat cu^ 

I confefs, 1 was urged then my felf, and at ano- 
ther Time would have been forward enough ; but 
I thought they had carried their Rage too far, 
and I thought of Jacch's Words to his Sons Simeon 
and Levi. Curjed he their Anger, for it was Fierce ; 
and their IVrathfor it was Cruel. But 1 had now 
a new Task upon my Hands ; Tor when the Men I 
carried with me faw the Sight, as I had done, I 
had as much to do to reflrain them, as I fliould 
have had with the other. Nay, my Nephew him- 
felt fell in with them, and told me in their Hea- 
ring, that he was only concerned for Fear of rhe 
Men being overpowered i for as to the People, he 
thought not one of ^em ought to live j for they 
had all glutted themfeives with the Murder of the 
poor Man, and that they ought to be ufed iike Mur- 
derers. Upon rhefe Words, away run eight of my 
Men with the Boatfwain and his Crew, to com- 
plete their bloody Work; and I Iceing it c]uite out 
of my Power toredrain them, came away penfive 
and fad ; for 1 could not bear the Sight, much lefs 
the horiible Noilc and Cne; of the poor Wretches 
that fell into their Hands. 

I got no Body to come back with me but the 
Supra-Cargo and two M^n -, and with thefe I 
walk'd back to the Boats. It was a very great 
Piece of Folly in me, I confefs, to venture back, 
as it were alone ; for as it began now to be al- 
moft Day, and the Alarm had riin over the Coun- 
tx)3 there ftood above forty Men armed with Lan- 
ces 



[ iii 1 



fees and Bows at the little Place where the 1 2 or 1 3 
Houfes flood mencion'd before ; but by Accident 
I mifs'd the Pbce, and came diredly to the Sea- 
iide ; and by the Time I got to the Sea-iide it was 
broad Day. Immediately 1 took the Pinnace, and 
went aboard, and fent her back to alTiil the Men 
in what might happen. 

I obferv'd about the Time that I came to the 
Boat-iide, that the Fire was pretty well out, and 
the Noife abated j but in about halt an Hour af- 
ter I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Mens 
Fiie-Arms, and faw a great Smoke ; this, as lun- 
derftood afterwards, was our Men falling^ upon 
the Men, who, as 1 faid, flood at the few Houfes 
on the Way, of whom they kiil'd lixteen or fcven- 
teen, and fet ail thole Houfes on Fire, but did not 
meddle with the VV^omen or Children. 

By that Time tiie Men got to the Shore again 
with the Pinnace, our Men began to appear; 
they came dropphig in, fome and feme, not in 
two Bodies, and in Form as they went, but all in 
Heaps, flragglinf^ here and there in fuch a Man- 
ner, that a fmall Force of refolute Men might have 
cut them all off. 

But the Dread of them was upon the whole 
Country; and the Men were amaz'd and flirpriz'd, 
and fo frighted, that 1 believe a hundred of them 
would have fled at the Sight of but five of pur 
Men. Nor in all this terrible Adion was there a 
Man who made any confiderable Defence, they 
were fo furpriz'd between the Terror of the Fire, 
and the fudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, 
that they knew not which Way to turn them- 
felves ; for if they had fled one Way, they were 
met by one Party ,* if back again, by another; fo 
that they were every where knock'd down : Nor 
did any of our Men receive the leafl Hurt, except 

one. 



[ 221 ] 

One, who ftrained his Foot, and another had one 
of his Hands very much burnt. 

1 was very angry with my Nephew the Cap- 
tain, and indeed with all the Men, in my Mind, 
but with him in particular, as well for his ading 
fo out of his Duty, as Commander of the Ship, and 
having the Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in 
his prompting rather than cooling the Rage of 
his Men in fo bloody and cruel an Enterprize. My 
Nephew anfwerM me very refpedfully ; but told 
me. That when he faw the Body of the poor Sea- 
man v/hom they had murder'd in fuch a cruel and 
barbarous Manner, he was not Mafter of himfelf, 
neither could he govern his Paffion. He own^d^ 
he fhould not have done fo, as he v/as Comman- 
der of the Ship ; but as he was a Man, and Na- 
ture mov'd him, he could not bear it. As for the 
reft of the Men, they were not fubjed to me at 
all, and they knew it well enough ; fo they took 
no Notice of my Diflike. 

The next Day we fet Sail, fo we never heard 
any more of it : Our Men difter'd in the Account 
ot the Number they kill'd : Some faid one Thing, 
fome another ,* but according to the beft of their 
Accounts put altogether, they kill'd or deftroy'd 
about 150 People, Men, Women, and Children, 
and left not a Houle ftanding in the Town. 

As for the poor Fellow T/;o. Jeffery, as he was 
quite dead, for his Throat was fo cut, that his 
Head was half off, it would do him no Service to 
bring him away, fo they left him where they 
found him, only took him down from the Tree 
v;here he was hangM by one Hand. 

However juft our Men thought this A<5t:ion, I 
wasagainft them in it; and I always, after that 
Time told them, God would blaft the Voyage ; 
ior 1 look'd upon all the Blood they fhed that Night 

to 



[ 113 ] 

to be Murther in them : For tho' it is true that 
they had kiil'd "tho. Jefery, yet it was as true, 
that Jeffery was the AggrefTor, had broken the 
Truce, and had violated or debauch'd a young 
Woman of theirs who came down to them inno- 
cently, and on the Faith of their publick Capi- 
tulation. 

The Boatfwain defended this Quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board : He faid, it is true, 
that we feem'd to break the Truce, but really had 
not, and that the War was begun the Night 
before by the Natives themfelves, who had fhot 
at us, and kill'd one of our Men without any juft 
Provocation; fo that as we were in a Capacity to 
fight them now, we might alfo be in a Capacity 
to do our felves Juftice upon them in an extraor- 
dinary Manner, that tho' the poor Man had taken 
a little Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have 
been murther'd, and that in fuch a villainous Man- 
ner ; and that tlley did nothing but what was juft, 
and what the Laws of God allow'd to be done to 
Murderers. 

One would think this fhould have been enough 
to have warn'd us againft going on Shore among 
Heathens and Barbarians : But it is impoflible to 
make Mankind wife, but at their own Experience ; 
and their Experience feems to be always of moil 
Ufe to them, when it is dearefl bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulph of PerJtayZnd. 
from thence to the CoaO: of Corornandel, only to 
touch at Sun at \ But the Chief of the Supra-Car- 
go's Defign lay at the Bay of Bengaky where if he 
mifs'd or his Bufinefs outward bound, he was to go 
up to China^ and return to the Coaft as he came 
Home. 

The firft Difafler that befel us, was in the 
Gulph of Perfiuy where five of our Men venturing 

on 



[ 214 ] 



oil Shore on the Arabian Side of the Gulph, werd 
{urroLindcd by the Arabians, and eicher alJ kiU'dor 
carry'd away into Slavery ; the refl of the Boat^s 
Crew were not able to refcne them, and had but 
jiift Time to get off their Boat I began to up- 
braid them with the juft Retribution of Heaven iri 
this Cafe : But the Boatfwain very warmly told 
me, he thought I went farther in my Ctnfures 
than I could (hew any Warrant for in Scripture, 
and referred to the 1 3 St. Liikey Verfe 4th. where our 
Saviour intimates, that tiiofe Men, on whom the 
Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above all 
the Galileans : Bat that which indeed put me to 
Silence in the Cafe, was, That not one of thefe 
five Men, who were now loft, were of the Num- 
ber of thofe who went on Shore to the Malfacre 
of Madagafcar ; (fo I always calfd it, tbf our Men 
could not bear the Word MaiTacre %uith any Patience:) 
And indeed, this lad Circumftance, as 1 have faid, 
put me to Silence for the prefent. 

But my frequent Preaching to them on this 
Subjed had worfe Confequences than I expect ed ; 
and tiie Boatfwain, who had been the Head of 
the Attempt, came up boldly to me one Time, 
and told me, he found, that 1 continually brought 
that Affair upon the Srage, that I made unjuft Re- 
flections upon it, and had ufed the Men very ill on 
that Account, and himfelf in particular; that as 
I was but a Pail'enger, and had no Command in 
the Ship, or Concern in the Voyage, they were 
not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know, 
but I might have fome ill Defign in my Head, 
and perhaps to call them to Account for it, when 
they came to England; and thac therefore, unlefs 
I would refolve to have done with it; and alfo, 
not to concern my felf any farther with him, or 
any of his Affairs^ he would leave the Ship ; for 

he 



C ^15 1 

he did not think it was fafe to fail with me among 
them. 

I heard him patiently enough 'till he had donlj, 
and then told him, that I did confefs I had all a- 
long oppDs'd the Majfacreof Madngafcar, for fuch I 
would always call it ; and that I had on all Occa- 
ifions fpoken my Mind freely about it, though not 
more upon him than any of the reft : That as to 
my having no Command in the Ship, that was 
true ; nor did I exercife any A^uthority, only took 
my Liberty of fpeaking my Mind in Things which 
publickly concern^ us all ; and what Concern I 
had in the Voyage was none of his Bufinefs ; that 
I was a confiderable Owner of the Ship ; and in 
that Claim I conceived I had a Right to fpeak e- 
ven farther than I had yet done, and would not be 
accountable to him or any one cKc, and begun to 
be a little warm with him. He made but little 
Reply to me at that Time, and I thought that 
Affair had been over. We were at this Time irt 
the Road at Bengal, and being willing to fee the 
place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in 
the Ship's Boat, to divert myfelfi and towards E- 
vening was preparing to go on Board, when one 
of the Men came to me, and told me, he would 
tiot have me trouble my felf to come down to the 
Boat, for they had Orders not to carry mc on 
Board any more. Any one may guefs what a Sur- 
prize I was in at fo infolent a Mefl'age ,• and I ask'd 
the Man, who bad him deliver that Errand to 
me ? He told me, the Coekfwain. I faid no more 
to the Fellow, but bad him let them know he had 
deliver'd his Meflage, and that I had given him 
no Anfwer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the Supfa- 
Cargo, and told him the Story, adding what I 
prefently forefaw, (viz,.) That there would cer-

tainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and entreated him 
to go imnaediately on Board the Ship in an Indian 
Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it : But I might 
h^' fpar'dthis InteUigence ; for before I had fpoken 
to him on Shore, the Matter was efFeded on Board. 
The Boatfwain, the Gunner, the Carpenter j and 
in a Word, ^.11 the inferior Officers, as foon as I 
was gone off in the Boat, came up to the Quar- 
ter-Deck, and defir'd to fpeak with the Captain, 
and there the Boatfwain making a long Harangue, 
for the Fellow talk'd very well, and repeating all 
he had faid to m.e, told the Captain in few Words, 
That as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they 
were loath to ufe any Violence with me ; which, 
if I had not gone on Shore, they would otherwife 
have done, to oblige me to have gone : They there- 
fore thought fit to tell him, That as they fhipp'd 
themfelves to ferve in the Ship under his Com- 
mand, they would perform it well and faithfully : 
But if I v/ould not quit the Ship, or the Captain 
oblige me to quit it, they would ail leave the 
Ship, and f:iil no farther with him ; and at that 
Word, ALL, he turn'd his Face about towards 
the Main-maft, which was it feems the Signal a- 
greed on between them i at which, all the Sea- 
men being got together, they cry'd out. One and 
ALL, One and ALL. 

^ My Ne{>hew, the Captain, was a Man of Spi- 
rit, and of great Prefence of Mind j and tho' he 
was^ Au'priz'd, tjou may befure, at the Thing, yet 
lie told theni calmly, that he would confider of 
the Thing, but that he could do nothing in it 'till 
he had fpoken to me about it. He us'd fome Ar- 
gnments with them, to fnew them the Unreafon- 
ableriefs and hijuflice of the Thing : But it was all 
ill vain, they f^vore and fhook Hands round before 
his Face, th^t they wQuJd go all on Shoce, unl/sfs'

tie would engage to them, not to fuffer me to come 
any more on Board the Ship. ' 

This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his 
Obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; fo he began to talk cavalierly to them, told 
them that I was a very confiderable Owner of the 
Ship, and that in Juflice he could not put me out 
of my own Houfe ; that this was next Door to 
ferving me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done, 
who made the Mutiny in a Ship, fet the Captain 
on Shore in an uninhabited iGand, and run away 
with the Ship ,• that let them go into what Ship 
they would, i£ ever they came to England again, 
it would cofl them dear ; that the Ship was mine, 
and that he could not put me out of it ; and that 
he would rather lofe the Ship and the Voyage too, 
than difoblige me fo much ; fo they might do as 
they pleasM : However^ he would go on Shore, 
and talk with me on Shore, and incited the Boat- 
fwain to go with him, and perhaps they might acr 
commodate the Matter with me. 

But they all rejededthe PropofaU and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, nei- 
ther on Boardj or on Shore ; and if I came on Board, 
they would all go on Shore. Well, faid the Cap- 
tain, if you are all of this Mind, let me go 
on Shore and talk with him ,* fo away he came 
to me with this Account, a little after the Mef- 
fage had been brought to me from the Cock- 
fwain. 

I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I muft con- 
fefs ; for I was not without Apprehenfions, that 
they would confine him by Violence, fet Sail, and 
run away with the Ship^ and then I had been 
ftripp'd naked in a remote Country, and nothing 
to help myfelf : In fhort, I had been in a worfe 
Cafe, than when I was all alone in the Ifland. ' 

CI 2 But 



["83 

But they had not come that lengthy it feems, t^i 
my great Satisfaction ; and when my Nephew 
told me what they had faid to him, and how they 
had fworn, and fhook Hands, that they would one 
and all leave the Ship, if I was fufterM to come on 
Board, I told Jiim, he ihould not be concerned at 
it at all, for 1 would flay on Shore. I only defir'd 
he would take Care and fend me all my neceflary 
TThings on Shore, and leave me a fufficient Sum of 
Money, and I would find my Way to England, as 
;well as I could. 

This was a heavy Piece of News to my Ne- 
phew ; but there was no Way to help it, but to 
comply with it : So, in fhort, he went on Board 
the Ship again, and fatisfy'd the Men, that his 
Uncle had yielded to their Importunity, and had 
fent for his Goods from on Board the Ship ; fo 
that Matter was over in a very few Hours, the 
Men returnM to their Duty, and I began to confi- 
der what Courfe I (hould fteer. 

I was now alone in the remoteft Part of the 
World, as I think I may call it ; for I was near thre6 
thoufand Leagues by Sea farther off from England, 
than I was at my Ifland ; only it is true, I might 
travel here by Land over the Great Mogufsi 
Country to Surratte, might go from thence to Ba- 
fora by Sea, up the Gulph of Perjia, and front 
thence might take the Way of the Carravans over 
the DcCsLnof Arabia to Aleppo 2ind Scanderoon ; from 
thence by Sea again to Italy^ and fo over Land in- 
to France y and this put together might be, at leaft, 
a full Diameter of the Globe ; but if it were to be 
meafur'd, Ifuppofe it would appear to be a great 
deal more. 

I had another Way before me, which was to 
wait for fome EngUpo Ships, which were coming 
to Bengal from Achin on the Ifland of Sumatra, 

and 



[ i^9 ] 

and get Paffage on Board them for England: But 
as I came hither without any Concern with the 
fingUfi Eafl'Jndia Companyj fo it would be diffi- 
cult to go from hence without their Licence, unlefs 
with great Favour of the Gaptaijis of the Ships, 
or of the Company's Fadors, and to both I was 
an utter Stranger. 

Here I had the particular Plea fu re, fpeaking by 
Contraries, to fee the Ship fail without me, a 
Treatment I think a Man m my Circumftances; 
fcarce ever met with, except from Pirates run-- 
ning away with a Ship, and fetting thofe thac 
would not agree with their Villainy, on ShoreJ 
Indeed this was next Door toit, both Ways. How-' 
ever, my Nephew left me two Servants, or ra- 
ther one Companion, and one Servant ,• the firft was 
Clark to the Purfer, whom he cngag'd to go with 
me, and the other was his own Servant. I 
took mc alfo a good Lodging in the Houfe of 
an EngUjh Woman, where feveral Merchants 
lodg'd; fomc French^ vno Italians, or rather ^^^xu/J 
and one EngUjh Man : Here I was handfomely, 
enough entertained ; and that I might not be faidt 
to run raflily upon any Thing, I ftay'd here above 
nine Months, confidering what Courfe to take, 
and how to manage myfelf I had fome English 
Goods with me of Value, and a confiderable Sumi 
of Money, my Nephew furnifhing me >^ith a 
thoufand Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of Cre- 
dit for more, if I had Occafion, that I might not 
be ftraiten'd whatever might happen. 

I quickly difpos*d of my Goods, and to Advan- 
tage too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought 
here feme very good Diamonds, which, of ^11 
other Things, was the moft proper for me in my 
pref».nt Circumftances, becaufe I might always- 
carry my whole Eftate about me.

[; iP ] 

After a long Stay here, and many Propofals 
made for my Return to England, but none falling 
put to my Mind, the Englijh Merchant who lodg- 
ed wich me, and with wnom I had contracted an 
intimate Acquaintance, came to me one Mor- 
ning: Gountry-man, fays he, I have a Projedl to 
comnfiunicate to you, which, as it fuits with my 
Thoughts, may, for ought 1 know, fuit with yours 
alfo, when you Ihall have throughly confider d 
It. -^^^-' 

-Here we are ^o^^d, fays he, you by Accident, 
and I by my own Choice, in a Part of the World 
very remote from our own Country \ but it is in a 
Country, where, by us who underftand Trade 
and Bufinefs, a great deal of Money is to be got : 
It* you will put a thoufand Pound to my thoufand 
Pound, we will hire a Ship here, the firll we can 
got to our Minds -, you jfhall be Captain, I'll be 
Merchanp, and we will go a Trading Voyage to 
China-, for what fhould we ftand flill for? The 
whole World is in Motiouj rouling round and 
round ', all the Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies 
and earthly are bufy and diligent. Why fhould we 
be ii\Q ? There arc no Drones in the World but 
Men, Why fhould' we be of that Number? 
•T lik'd his Proppfal very well, and the more, 
becaufe it fcemM to be exprefs'd with fo much 
good Will, and in fo friendly a Manner: I 
will; 'not fay, but ,that I might by my loofe and 
linhing'd Circumftahces be the fitter to embrace 
a Propofal for Trade , or indeed for any Thing 
elfe ; whereas, orhervvife. Trade was none of my 
Eleir^cn^: However, I might perhaps fay with 
feme Truth, that if Trade was not my Element^ 
Rambling was, and no Propofal .for feeing any 
Part of the World which I never had feen before, 
doiild p'oiTibly cohie amif^ to rac. 



[ ^31 ] 

It was however, fome Time before we could 
get a Ship to our Minds ; and when we had g6t 
a VefleJ, it was not eafy to get Enghp Saildrs ; 
that is to fay, fo many as were neceflary to go- 
vern the Voyage^ and manage the Sailors which 
we fhouid pick up there. After fome Time we 
got a Mate, a Boatfwain, and a Gunner En'gljjfi} 
a Dutch Carpenter, and three Ponuguex>e Fore- 
maft Men; with thefe we found, we could do 
well enough, \\d.vmg Indian Sea- men, fuchasi;hey 
are, to make up. ,' , 

There are many Travellers, who have wrote 
the Hiftory of their Voyages and Travels this 
Way, that it would be very little Diverfion to 
any Body, to %iVQ. a long Account of the Places 
we went to, and the People who inhabit there ; 
thofe Things I leave to others, and refer the 
Reader to thofe Journals and Travels of Engllp 
Men, of which, many I find are publifii'd, and 
more promised every Day ; 'tis enough to me to 
tell you, That I made this Voyage to Achln^ in 
the Ifland Sumatra^ and from thence to Siam^ 
where we exchang'd fome of our Wares for Opi- 
um, and fome Arrack, the firfl, a Commodity 
which' bears a great Price among the Chmefe, and 
which at that Time, v/as very much wanted 
there. In a Word, we went up to Stiskan^ made 
a very great Voyage, were eight Months out, 
and returnM to Bengal, and I was very well 
fatisfyM with my Adventure. I obferve, that 
our People in England, often admire how the 
OiEcers which the Company fend into IndiUy 
and the Merchants generally ftay there, get fuch 
very great Eftates as they do, and fometimes 
come Home worth 60,- to 70 100 thoufand Pound 
at a Time. 

But it is no Wonder, or at lead we fhall fee 

fo much farther into it, when v/e confider the 

0.4 ^i^- 



innumerable Ports and Places where they have 
a free Commerce ; that it will then be no Wonder ; 
and much lefs will it be fo, when we confider, 
at all thofe Places and Ports where the 
Englifh Ships come, there is fo much, and fuch 
conilant Demand for the Growth of all other 
Countries, that there is a certain Vent for the Re- 
turns, as well as a Market abroad, for the Goods 
carried out. 

In fhort, we made a very good Voyage, and 
I got fo much Money by the firft Adventure, and 
fuch aninfight into the Method of getting more^ 
that had I been twenty Years younger, 1 fhould 
have been tempted to have ftaid here, and fought 
no farther, for making my Fortune ; but what 
was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of 
threefcore, that was rich enough, and came a- 
broad, more in Obedience to a r.ftlefs Defire of 
feeing the World, than a covetous Defire of get- 
ting in it I and indeed I think, \\s with great Ju- 
fiice, that I now call it a reftlefs Defire, for it 
was fo. When I was at Home, I was refllefs to 
go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was reftlefs 
to be at Home : I fay, what Gain was (his to 
jpe? I was rich enough, nor had I any uneafie 
Defires about getting more Money ; and therefore 
the Profits of the Voyage to me, were Things of 
no great Force, for the prompting me forward 
to farther Undertakings j and I thought that by 
this Voyage^^ I had made no Progrefs at all, be- 
caufe I was come back, as I might call it, to the 
Place from whence I came, as to a Home ; where- 
as, my Eye, which like that , which Solomon fpeaks 
of, ixias uever fatisfied vjith Seeing 5 was flill more 
defirous of Wandringand Seeing. I was come 
into a Part of the World, whicli I was never in 
before ; and that Part in particular, which! had 

heard 



[ i3n 

heard much of, and was refolvM to fee as much 
of as I could, and then I thought, I might fay, 
I had feen all the World, that was worth fee- 
ing. 

But my Fellow-Traveller and I had different 
Notions i I do not name this, to infift upon my 
own ; for I acknowledge his were the moft juft, 
and the moft fuited to the End of a Merchant's 
Life ; who, when he is abroad upon Adven- 
tures, \is his Wifdom to flick to that as the befl 
Thing for him*, which he is like to get the moft 
Money by. My new Friend kept himfelfto the 
Nature of the Thing, and would have been con- 
tent to have gone like a Carrier's Horfe, always 
to the fame Inn, backward and forward, provi-^ 
ded he could, as he call'd it, find his Account in it: 
On the other hand, mine was the Notion of a 
mad rambling Boy, that never cares to fee a Thing 
twice over. 

But this was not all : I had a Kind o f Impati- 
ence upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the 
moft unfettled Refolution imaginable which Way 
to go. In the Interval of thefe Confukations, my 
Friend, who was always upon the Search for 
Bufinefs, proposed another Voyage to me among 
the Spice Iflands, and to bring Home a Loading 
of Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; Pla- 
ces where indeed the Dutch do trade, but Iflands, 
belonging partly to the Spaniards ; tho' we went 
not fo far, but to feme other, where they have 
n6t the whole Power, as they have at Batavia, 
Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing for this 
Voyage ; the chief Difficulty was in bringing me 
to come into it : However, nothing elfe offering, 
and finding that really Stirring about, and Trading, 
the Profit being fo great, and, as I may fay, cer- 
tain, had more Pleafure in it, and more Satisfa- 

dion 



[ ^34 ] 

B.ion to the Mind, than fitting flilJ, which to mc 
efpecially was the unhappiefl Part of Life ; I re- 
folved on his Voyage too, which we made very 
fiiccefsfuUy, touching at Borneo, and feveral 
iQands, whofe Names I do not remember, and 
came Home in about five Months. We fold our 
Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and fome Nut- 
megs, to the Per /tan M^rcniLnts, who carry 'd them 
away for theGulph; and making near five of one, 
we really got a great deal of Money. 

My Friend, when we made up this Account, 
fmil'd at me s Well now, faid he, with a Sort of 
agreeable infultmg my indolent Temper,* Is not 
this better than walking about here, like a Man 
(f nothing to doy and fpendiiig our Time in flaring 
at the Nonfenfe and Ignorance of tliePagan^? Why 
truly, fays I, my Friend, I think it is, and I be- 
gin to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchan- 
dizing : But I mufl tell you, faid I, by the Way, 
you do not know what I am a doing; for ii once 
I conquer my Backwardnefs, and embark hear- 
tily, as old as I am, I fliail harrafs you up and 
doivn the World, till I tire you ; for I fhall pur- 
fue it fo eagerly, I fhall never let you lye fliJL 

But to be (liort with my Speculations, a little 
while after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from 
Batavia » fhe was a Coafter, not an European Tra- 
der, and of about two hundred Ton Burtiien : 
The Men, as they pretended, having been foiick- 
ly, tha^ the Captain had noc Men enough to go 
to Sea with- He lay by at Bengal, and having 
it feems. goi Money enough, or being willing for 
other Reafons, to go for Erirope, he gave pub- 
lick Notice, that he would fell his Ship : This 
came to my Ears bjetore my new Partner heard of 
it j ar.d I had a great Mind to buy it, fo I goes 
Home CO him, and cold him of it. He confidcred 

a while. 



[ i35 ] 

a while, for he was no rafii Man neither ; but 
muling feme Time, he reply'd, She is a little too 
big i but however, we will have her : According- 
ly we bought the Ship, and agreeing with the 
Maikr, we paid for her, and took Pofleffioni 
when we had done fo, we refolved to entertain 
the Men, if we could, to join them with thofe we 
had, for the purfuing our Bufinefsj but on a did" 
den, they having received not their Wages, but 
their Share of the Money, not one of them was to 
be found. We enquir'd much about them, and 
at length were told, that they were all gone to- 
gether by Land to Agra, the great City of the 
Mogul's Refidence,- and from thence were to 
travel to Surattey and fo by Sea, to the Gulph 
of Per pa. 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good 
while, as that I mifs'd the Opportunity of going 
with them 3 for fuch a Ramble I thought, and 
in fuch Company, as would both have guarded 
me, and diverted me, would have fuited mighti- 
ly with my great Defign j and I fliould both have 
feenthe World, and gone homewards tooj but 
I was much better fatisfied a few Days after, when 
I came to know what Sort of Fellows they were i 
for in fhort, their Hiflory was, that this Man 
they caird Captain, was the Gunner only, not the 
Commander j that they had been a trading Voy- 
age, in which they were attackM on Shore by 
fome of the Maikyansy who had kill'dthe Captain, 
and three of his Men ; and that after the Captain 
was killM, thefeMen, eleven in Number, had re- 
folved to run way with the Ship, which they did ; 
and brought her in at the Bay of Beyigaly leaving 
the Mate and hvc Men more on Shore, of whom 
v/e fliall hear further. 

Well, 



Well, let them come by the Ship how they 
would, we came honeftly by her, as ive thought^ 
tho' we did nor, Iconfefs, examine into Things fo 
exad'tly as we ought, for we never enquired any 
Tiling of the Seamen ,• who, if we had examined, 
would cercainJy have faulter'd in their Account, 
contradicted one another, and perhaps contradi- 
ded themfelves, or one how or other, we fhould 
have feen Reafon to have fufpefted them. But the 
Man fiiew'd us a Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one 
Emanuel Cloflerfhoven^ or fome fuch Name ; for I 
fuppofe it was ail a Forgery, and call'd himfelf by 
that Name, and we could not contradid him ; and 
being withal a little too unwary, or atleaft, ha- 
ving no Sufpicion of the Thing, we went thro* 
with our Bargain. 

We pick'd up fome more EngUfi Seamen here 
after this, and fome Dutch ; and now we refol- 
ved for a fecond Voyage, to the South Eaft for 
Cloves, &Q, that is to (2iyy among the Philippine 
and MiUucco Ifles : And in (horr, not to fill this Pare 
of my Story with Trifles, when what is yet to 
come, is fo remarkable ; I fpent from firfl to laft 
iix Years in this Country, trading from Port to 
Port, backward and forward^ and with very good 
Succefs ; and was now the lait Year with my new 
Partner, going in the Ship above-mention 'd, on 
a Voyage to China ^ but deiigning firft to Siam^ to 
buy Rice. 

In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds ob- 
lig'd to beat up and down a great while \n the 
Straits of Mollucco^ and among the Iflands ; we 
were no fooner got clear of thofe difficult 
Seas, but we found our Ship had fprung a 
Leak, and we were not able by all our Indultry 
to find it out where it was : This forcM us ta 
make for feme Port, and my Partner^ who knew 

the 



[ ^37 1 

tiie Country better than I did, directed the Cap- 
tain to put into the River q\ Cambodia y jor I had 
made the Englifh Matey one Mr. Thompfon, Caftain^ 
mt heing willing to take the Charge of two Ships upon my 
felf. This River lyes on the North Side of the 
great Bay or Gulf, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Shott 
JFor Refrefliment, there comes to me one Day an 
£nglijh Man, and he was, it feems, a Gunner's 
Mate, on board an Englijh Eafl- India Ship, which 
rode in the fame River, up at, or near the City of 
Cambodia ; what brought him hither, we know 
not : But he comes up to me, and fpeaking mEng- 
iijhy Sir, fays he, you are a Stranger to me, and I 
to you ; but I have fomething to tell you, that ve- 
ry nearly concerns you. 

I looked fleadily at him a good while, and 
thought at firif 1 had known him, but I did not. 
if it very nearly concerns me, /aid /, and not your 
felf, what moves you to tell it me ? I am moved, 
fays he, by the imminent Danger you are in, and for 
ought 1 fee, you have no Knowledge of it. I know 
no Danger I am in, faid I, but that my Ship is 
leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I purpofe to 
lay her a-Ground to Morrow, to fee if I can find 
it. But Sir, fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, 
or not find it, you will be wifer than to lay your 
Ship on Shore to Morrow, when you hear what I 
have to fay to you. Do you know Sir, faid he, 
the Town o[ Cambodia lyes about fifteen Leagues 
up this River ? And there are two large Englijh 
Ships about five Leagues on this Side, and three 
Dutch, Well, faid /, and what is that to me ? 
Why, Sir, faid he, is it for a Man that is upon 
fu'ch Adventures as you are upon, to come into a 
Port, and not examine firfl what Ships there are 

there. 



[ ^38 ] 

there, and whether he is able to deal with them? 
I fuppofe yoLi do not think you are a Match for 
them. I wasamufed very much at his Difcourfe, 
but not amazed at it, for I could not conceive 
what he meant. I turn'd fhort upon him, and 
faid, Sir, I wifli you would explain your felf. I 
cannot imagine what Reafon I have to be afraid 
of any Company of Ships, or Dutch Ships. I am 
no Interloper, what can they have to fay to me ? 

He looked like a Man half angry, half pleas'd, 
and paufing a while, but fmiling. Well, Sir, faid 
hey if you think your felf fecure, you muft take 
your Chance. I am forry your Fate fliould blind 
you againfl good Advice : But afTure your felf, 
if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will 
the very next Tide be attackM by five Long-Boats 
full of Men, and perhaps if you are taken, you'll 
be hang'd foi a Pirate, and the Particulars be ex- 
am ned afterwards. I thought Sir, added he^ I 
Ihould have met with a better Reception than 
this, for doing you a Piece of Service of fuch Im- 
portance. I can never be ungrateful, faid /, for 
any Service, or to any Man that offers me any 
Kindnefs \ but it is paft my ComprehenfionT^/^ /, 
what they fhould have fuch a Defign upon me for. 
\io^z\xVyJtnce you fay, there is no Time to be loft, 
and that there is fome villainous Defign in Hand 
againft me, I'll go on board this Minute, and put 
to Sea immediately, if my Men can ftop the Leak, 
or if we can fwim without flopping it. But Sir, 
faid /, fhall I go away ignorant of the Reafon 
of all this ? Can you gi\t me no farther Light 
into it? 

I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, fays 
he, but I have a Dutch Seaman here with me, and 
I believe I could perfwade him to tell you the reft j 
but there is fcarce Time for it. But the Short of 

the 



[>39] 

the Story is this. The firft Part of which, I fup- 
pofe, you know well enough, ( 'viz.. ) That you 
was with the Ship at Sumatra^ that there your 
Captain was murdered by the Mallayans^ with 
three of his Men, and that you or fome of thofe 
who were on board with you ran away with the 
Ship, and are fince turn'd Pirates, This is the 
Sum of the Story, and you will be all feiz'd as 
Pirates I can affure you, and executed, with very 
little Ceremony ; for you know. Merchants Ships 
Ihew but little Law to Pirates, if they get ^em in- 
to their Power. 

Now you fpeak plain Euglijhy /aid /, and I thank 
you j and tho' I know nothing that we have done, 
like what you talk of, but am fure we came honeft- 
ly and fairly by the Ship ; yet feeing fuch Work is 
a-doing as you fay, and that you feem to mean ho- 
neftly. Til be upon my Guard. Nay, SiVyfays 
he, do not talk of being upon your Guard ; the 
befl; Defence is, to be out of Danger, if you 
have any Regard to your Life, and the Lives of all 
your Men, put out to Sea without fail at High- 
Water ; and as you have a whole Tide before you, 
you will be gone too far out before they can come 
down, for they come away at High- Water ; and 
as they have twenty Miles to come, you get near 
two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide, 
not reckoning the Length of the Way. Befides, as 
they are only Boats, and not Ships, they will not 
venture to follow you far out to Sea, efpecially 
if it blows. 

Well, fays I, you have been very kind fn this, 
what (hall I do for you, to make you Amends ? 
Sir, fays he, you may not be fo willing to make 
me any Amends, becaufe you may not be convin- 
ced of the Truth of it. Til make an Oif^r to you. 
I have nineteen Months Pay due to me on board

in, and the Dutch Man that is with ine, has feveii 
Months Pay due to him ,• if you will make good 
our Pay to us, we will go along with you j and 
if you find no more in it, we will dcfire no more ; 
But if we do convince you, that we have faved 
your Lives, and the Ship, and the Lives of all 
the Men in her, we will leave the reft to you. 

I confented to this readily, and went imme- 
diately on board, and the two Men with me. As 
foon as I came to the Ship Side, my Partner, who 
was on Board, came out on the Quarter- Deck, and 
called to me with a great deal of Joy, ho^ O 
ho ! 'ive have flopped the L^ak ! we have flop fed the 
Leak! Say you fo, faid /, thank God; but weigh 
the Anchor immediately. Weigh ! fays he, what 
do you mean by that ? What is the Matter, fays 
he ? Ask no Queftions, fays /, but all Hands to 
work, and wcighy without lofing a Minute. He 
ivas furprized ,* but however, he called the Cap- 
tain, and he immediately ordered the Anchor to 
be got up : And tho' the Tide was not quite 
done, yet a little Land Breeze blowing, we ftood 
out to Sea. Then I called him into the Cabin, and 
told him the Story at large ; and we called in the 
Men, and they told us the reft of it. But as it 
took us up a great deal of Time, fo before we had 
done, a Seaman comes to the Cabin Door, and 
calls out to us, that the Captain bad him tell us^ 
we v/ere chasM. Chas'd, faid I, by whom, and 
by what ? By five Sloops or Boats, fays the Fel- 
lowy full of Men. Very well, faid I, then it is 
apparent there is fomething in it. In the next 
Place I ordered all our Men to be called up, and 
and told them, that there was a Defign to feize 
the Ship, and to take us for Pirates; and asked 
them. If they would ftand by us, and by one ano- 
ther ? 



[241 ] 

ther ; the Men anfwer'd chearfully, that one and 
all, they would live and die with us: Then 1 
asked the Captain, what V/ay he thought bed 
for us to manage the Fight with them ; for refift 
them I was refolved we would, and that, to the 
laft Drop ; he faid readily. That the Way was to 
keep them off with our great Shot, as long as we 
could, and then to iire at them with our fmall 
Arms as long as we could ; but when neither of 
thefe would do any longer, we fliould retire to 
our clofe Quarters ; perhaps they Jiad not Mate- 
rials to break open our Bulk-Heads, or get in 
upon us. 

The Gunner had, in the mean Time, Order 
to bring two Guns to bear fore and aft out of 
the Steerage, to clear the Deck, and load them 
with Mufquet- Bullets and fmall Pieces of old Iron, 
and what next came to Hand, and thus we made 
ready for Fight ; but all this while we kept 
out to Sea, with Wind enough, and could 
fee ihe Boats at a Diftance, being five large Lot^g- 
Boats-, following us with all the fail they could 
make. 

Two of thofe Boats, which by our Glaffes we 
could fee were Engliflo^ out-failed the reft and were 
near two Leagues a-Head of them, and gam'd 
upon us confiderably j fo that. we found they 
would come up with ust Upon which, we fired 
a Gun without Ball, to intimate, that they fhould 
bring too, and we put out a Flag of Truce, as 
a Signal for Parley, but they kept crowding after 
us, till they came within Shor, when we took in 
our White Flag, they having made no Anfwer to 
ic, hung out a red Flag, and fired at them with 
a Shor. Nocwithftanding this, they came on, 
till they were rear enough to call to them with 
a fpeaking Trumpet, which we had on Board; 

Part IL R fo 



[ ^4^ 1 

fj \vc cail'd to -them, and b"d them keep off at 
their Peril. 

It was ali one, they crowded after us, and en- 
deavoured to come under our Stern, io to board 
us on our Q^jarter ,• upon which, feeing they were 
lefolute for Mifch e!-, and depended upon the 
Strei^grh that followed them, 1 ordered to bring 
the Ship to, io that they lay upon our Broad-lide, 
when immediately we Ei''d five Guns at them ; 
one of wiiich, had been levelitd fo true_, as to carry 
away the Stern of the hindermoft Boat, and bring 
them to the Necefiicy of taking down their Sail, 
and running all to the Head of the Boat to keep her 
from linking i fo fhe lay by, and had enough 
of it ; but feeing the foremoft Boat crowd 
on afrer us, we made ready to hre at her in par- 
ticular. 

While this was doing, one of the three Boats 
that was behind, being forwarder than the other 
two, made up to the Boat which we had difab'ed, 
to relieve lier, and we could afterwards fee her 
takeout the Men; we caH'd again to the fore- 
ir.oft Boat, and cffer'd a Truce to parley again, 
and to know what was her Bufincfs wirh us i but 
had no Anfwer, only fhe crowded clofe under 
our Srern. Upon this ojr Gunner, who was a ve- 
ry dexterous F'eliow, run out his two Chafe-Guns, 
and fired again at i^er ; but the Shot milling, the 
Men in the Boat fhouted, wav'cl their Caps, and 
came on : But the Gunner getting quickly ready 
again, firM among tliem the fecond Time ; 
one Shot of whicn, tho' it mifs'd the Boat it 
fe'f, yer fell in among the Men, and we could 
cafily fee, had done a great deal of Mifchief 
among themj but we taking no Notice of 
that, war'd the Ship again, and brought our 
Qtiartef to bear upon them, and firing three 

Gutis 



[ H3 ] 

Guns more, we found the Boat was fplit almofi 
to Pieces ; in particular, her Rudder, and a Piece 
of her Stern was' (hot quite away, fo they handed 
their Sail immediately, and were in great Dif- 
order; But to compleat their Misfortune, our 
Gunner let fly two Guns at them again,* where 
he hit them we could not tell, but we found the 
Boat was finking, and fome of the Men already 
in the Water. Upon this, I immediately Mann'd 
out our Pinnace, which we had kept clofe by 
our Side, with Orders to pick up Ibme of the 
Men if they could, and fave them from drown- 
ing, and immediately to come on board with them ; 
becaufe we faw the reft of the Boats began to come 
up. Our Men in the Pinnace followed their Or- 
ders, and took up three Men ; one of which was 
juft drowning, and it was a good while before we 
could recover him. As foon as they were on 
Board, we crowded all the Sail we could make, 
and flood farther out to Sea, and we found that 
when the other three Boats came up to the firfl: 
two, they gave over their Chafe. 

Being thus delivered from a Danger, which 
tho' I knew not the Reafon of it, yet feem'd to be 
much greater than 1 apprehended ; I took Care 
that we would change our Courfe, and not let any 
one imagine whither we were going,* fo we ftood 
out to Sea Eaftward, quite out of the Courfe of 
all European Ships, whether they were bound to 
Chifi/i, or any where elfe, within the Commerce of 
the European Nations, 

When we were now at Sea, we began to coii- 
fult with the two Seamen, and enquire firfl whai; 
the Meaning of all this (hould be, and the Dutch 
Man let us into the Secret of it at once ; telling us, 
that the Fellow that fold us the Ship, as ive /aid, 
was no more than a Thief, that had run away 

R 2 with 



[ 244 ] 

with her : Then he told us, how the Captain, 
whofe Name too he told us, tho"* I do not remem- 
ber, was treacherouily murdered by the Na- 
tives on the Coaft of Mai/acca, with three of his 
Men ; and that he, this Dutch Man, and four 
more, got into the Woods, where they wandered 
about a great while ; till at length, he in particu- 
lar, in a miraculous Manner made his Efcape, and 
fwamoff to a Dutch Ship, which failing near the 
Shore, in its Way from China, had fent their Boat 
on Shore for frefh Water > that he durfl not come 
to that Part of the Shore where the Boat was, but 
Ihifc in the Night, to take the Water farther off, 
and the Ship's Boat took him up. 

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the Sea-men belonging to the Ship arriv*d, 
having deferred the refl in their Travels, and 
gave an Account, that the Fellow who had run 
away with the Ship, fold her at Bengal, to a Set 
of Pirates, which were gone a Cruiiing in her ; 
and that they had already taken an Englijh Ship, 
and two Dutch Ships very richly laden. 

This latter Part we found to concern us dired- 
4y, and tho' we knew it to be falfe ', yet as my Part- 
ner faid very well, if we had fallen into their 
Hands, and they had had fuch a PrepoffefTion 
againftus before-hand, it had been in vain for us to 
have defended our felves, or to hope for any good 
Qiiarter at their Hands ; and efpecially confidering 
Xhat our Accufers had been our Judges, and that 
we could have expeded nothing from them, but 
-what Rage would have diftated, and an ungo- 
verned Paifion have executed : And therefore it was 
his Opinion, v/e (houid go directly back to Bengal^ 
from whence we came, without putting in at any 
Port whatever ; becaufe there, we could give a 
good Account of our felvcs, could prove where 

Vfe 



[ M5 ] 

We were when the Ship put in, whom we bought 
her of, and the like ; and which Was more than 
all the reft, if We were put to the Neceffity of 
bringing it before the proper Judges, we fhould 
befure to have feme Juftice, and not be hang'd 
firll, and judg'd afterwards. 

I was fometime of my Partner's Opinion ; but 
after a little more ferious thinking, I told him, 1 
thought it was a very great Hazard for us to at- 
tempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on 
the wrong Side of the Straits o[ Malacca ; and that 
if the Alarm was given, we fhould be fure to be 
Way-laid on every Side, as well by the Duuh of 
Batavia, as the Englljh elfe where; that i^ we 
fhould be taken, as it were running aWay, we 
fhould even condemn our felves, and there would 
want no more Evidence to deftroy us. I alfo asked 
the Englijl) Sailor's Opinion, who faid, he was of 
my Mmd, and that we fhould certainly betaken. 
This Danger, a little ilartled my Partner and 
all the Ship's Company; and we immediately re- 
folved to go away to the Coaft of Tonquin, and 
foonto the Coaft of China, and purfuing the firft" 
Defign as to Trade, find fome Way or other to 
difpofe of the Ship, and come back in feme of 
the Veflels of the Country, fuch as we could get. 
This Was approved of as the beft Method for our 
Security ; and accordingly we fleered away N. 
N. E. keeping above fifty Leagues off from the 
ufual Courfe to the Eafiward. 

This however put us to fomc Inconveniences ^ 
for firfl the Winds, when we came to the Diflance 
from the Shore, feem'd to be more fteadily againfl • 
us, blowing almoft Trade, as v:e call it, from the 
Eaft, and E. N. E. fo that we were a long while 
I'lponour Voyage, and we were but ill provided 
with Vi(5i:uals for fo long a Voyage j and which 

R 3 was 



[ H^] 

was ftiU worfe, there was fomci Danger that tliofe 
Engliflj and Dutch Ships, whofe Boats purfucd us, 
whereof fome were bound that Way, might be got 
in before us, and if not, (ome other Ship, bound to 
China, might have Information of us from them, 
and purfue us with the fame Vigour. 

I muft confefs, I was now very uneafy, and 
thought my felf, including the late Efcape from 
the Long-Boats, to have been in the moil: dange- 
rous Condition that ever I was in thro* all my pafl 
Life; for whatever ill Circumflances I had been 
in, I was never purfued for a Thief before ; nor 
had I ever done any Thing that merited the Name 
of Difhoneft or Fraudulent, much kfs Thievifh. 
I had chiefly been my own Enemy, or as I may 
rightly fay, I had been no Body^s Enemy but my 
own : But now I was embarrafs'd in the worft Con- 
dition imaginable i for tho' I was perfedly inno- 
cent, I was in no Condition to make that Inno- 
cence appear: And if I had been taken, it had 
been under a fuppofed Guilt of the word: Kind,* 
at leaft, a Crime efleemed fo among the People I 
had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an Efcape, 
tho', which Way to do it, I knew not, or what 
Port or Place we Ihould go to : My Partner feeing 
me thus dejeded, tho' he was the moft concerned 
at firlf, began to encourage me; and defcribing 
to me the feveral Ports of that Coafi, told me he 
would put in on the Coafl of Chochinchina, or the 
Bay of To/iquiriy intending to go afterwards to 
MiicaOy a Town once in the PoflelTion of the Por- 
tuguejb, and where fliil a great many European Fa- 
milies refided, and particularly the Milfionary 
Priefts ufualiy went thither, in Order to their go- 
ing forward to China, 

Hither 



[ H7 ] 

Hither then we refolv'd to go ; and sccording- 
ly, tho' after a tedious and irregular Courf., dad 
very much flraitned for Provilions, we came \\'nh- 
in Sight of the Coall: very ear y in the Morning; 
and upon Rtfljdion upon the pail Circuuillances 
we were in, and the Danger it we had not e- 
fcaped, we refolv'd to put into a fmall River, 
which however had a Depth enough of Water 
for Us, and to fee if we could, either over Land, 
or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know what 
Ships were in any Port thereabouts. This happy 
Step, was indeed our Deliverance; for tho' wc 
did not immediarely f^e any European Ships in the 
Bay of Toficfuin, yet the next Morning there came 
into the Bay two D-uch Siiips, and a third with- 
out any Colours Ipred out, but whic'i we beJiev'd 
to be a Dutch Man, pafs'd by ac abouttwo LeagiiG^ 
Diftance, fleer ng for the Coaft of Chrna; and -in 
the Afternoon went by two Englijl) Ships fleering 
the fame Coiirfe ; and thus, we thought, we faw 
our felves befet with Enemies, boch one Vv^ay or 
other. The Place we were in was wild and bar- 
barous, the People Thieves, even by Occupation 
or ProfeiHoni and tho' it is true we had not much 
to feekofthem, and except getting a few Provi- 
fions, car'd not how. little we hdd to do with 
them, yet ix. was with much D.lHculty that we 
kept our felves from being infulted by them feve- 
ral Ways. 

We v^^ere in a fmall River of this Country, with- 
in a few Leagues of iis utmoft Limits North- 
ward ,* and by our Bo*tt we coafted North-Eaft ro 
the Point of- Land, which opens tiie great Bay 
oiTunquin \ and it was in this beating up along 
the Siiore, that we difcover'd, as above, that i^a 
a Word, we were furrounded v/irh Enemies. The 
People wc were among, were the mod barbarous 
R 4 tf 



[248 



of all the Inhabitants of the Coaft ; having no Cor- 
refpondence with any other Nation, and dealing 
only in Fifh, and Oil, and fuch grofs Commodi- 
ties ,* and it may be particularly feen, thau they 
are, as I /aid, the moil barbarous of any of the 
Inhabitants, (viz..) that among other Cuilomsthey 
have this as one, (viz.) That if any Veflcl have 
the Misfortune to be fhipwreck'd upon the Coaft, 
they prefently make their Men all Prifoners or 
Slaves ; and it was not long before we found a 
Spice of their Kindnefs this Way^ on the Occafion 
following. 

I have obferved above, that our Ship fpriing 
a Leak at Sea, and that we could not iind it out ; 
and however it happen'd, that, as I have fr.id, it 
was ftoppM unexpededjy in the happy Min- ic of 
our being to be feiz'd by the Dutch and EngUflo 
Ships in the Bay o'tSiam; yet as we did not find 
the Ship fo perfedly fit and found as we defir'd, 
we refolved, while we were in this Place, to lay 
"her on Shore, takeout what heavy Things we had 
on Board, which ^vere not many, and to wafh and 
clean her Bottom, and, i'i poflible, to find out 
where the Leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the Ship, and 
bronght all our Guns and other moveable Things 
'to one Side, we try'd to bring her down, that we 
might come at her Bottom ; but on fecond Thoughts 
we did not care to lay her dry on Ground, neither 
could we find out a proper Place for it. 

The Inhabitants v^ho had never been acquain- 
ted with fuch a Sight, came wondering down to 
the Shore, to look at us ; and feeing the Ship lye 
down on one Side in fuch a Manner, and heeling 
in towards the Shore, and not feeing our Men 
who were at Work on her Bottom, with Stages, 
aiid with their Boats on the Oft-fide, they prefent- 
ly 



[ H9 ] 

ly concluded, that the Ship was caft away, and 
fo lay faft on the Ground. 

On this Suppofition they came all about us in 
two or three Hours time, with ten or twelve 
large Boats, having fome of them eight, fome 
ten Men in a Boat, intending, no doubt, to have 
come on Board, and plundered the Ship j and if 
they had found us there, to have carryM us away 
for Slaves to their King, or whatever they call 
him ; for we knew nothing who was their Go- 
vern our. 

/ When they came up to the Ship, and began to 
row round her, they difcover'd us all hard at 
Work on the Out-fide of the Snipe's Bottom and 
Side, wafliing, and graving, and Itopping as eve- 
ry Sea-faring Man knows how. 

They flood for a while gazing at us, and we, 
who were a little furprizM, could not imagine 
what their Defign was ; but, being ivilli'rig to be 
fure^ we took this Opportunity to get fome of us 
into the Ship, and others to hand down Arms 
and Ammunition to rhofe that were at Work, to 
defend themfelves with, if there fhould be Occa- 
fion ,* and it was no more than Need ,• for in lefs 
than a quarter of an Hour^s Coiifultation, they 
agreed, it feems, that the Ship was really a Wreck, 
that we were all at Work, endeavouring to (ave 
her, or to fave our Lives by the Help of our Boats ; 
and when we handed our Arms into the Boats, 
they concluded, by that Motion, that we were 
endeavouring to fave fome of our Goods. Upon 
this they took it for granted we all belonged to 
them 'y and away they came down upon our Men, 
as if it had been in a Line of Battle. 

Our Men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted j for we lay but in an ill Pofture to fight, 
^nd cry'd out to us to know what they fhould do : 

lim- 



[ i5o ] 

I immediately call'd to the Men who work'd upon 
the Stage, to flip them down, and get up the Side 
into the Ship ,• and bad thofe in the Boat to row 
round and come on board : And thofe few of us, 
who were on board, worked with all the Strength 
and Hands wc had, to bring the Ship to Rights. 
But however, neither the Men upon the Stage, 
or thofe in the Boats, could do as they were 
ordered, before the Ccchinchlnefcs were upon them, 
and two of their Boats boarded our Long-Boat, 
and began to lay hold of the Men as their Pri- 
foners. 

The firft Man they laid hold of was an Engli(l> 
Seaman j a flout ftrong Fellow, who having a 
Musket in his Hand, never offered to fire it, but 
laid it down in the Boat, like a Fooly as Ithought, 
But he underflood \\\^ Bufinefs better than I could 
teach him ; for he grappled the Pagan, and drag- 
ged him by main Force, oat of their own Boat 
into ours ; where taking him by the two Ears, he 
beat his Head fo againil the Boat's Gunnel, that 
the Fellow died infbntly in his Hands ,• and in 
the mean time, a Dut:h Man, who flood next, 
took up the Musket, and with the But-end of it, 
fo laid about him, that he knocked down five of 
them, who attempted to enter the Boat. But this 
was doing little towards refifting thirty or forty 
Men, who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their Dan- 
ger, began to throw themfelves mto the Long- 
Boat, where we had but five Men, in all, to de- 
fend it. But one Accident gave our Men a com- 
plete Victory, which deferv'd our Laughter rather 
than any Thing elfe. And that was this. 

Our Carpenter being preparing to grave the 
Out-fide of the Ship, as well as to pay the S^amf, 
where he had caulk'd her to Uop the Leakes, had 
got two Kettles iuft let down mto the Boat ; one 

fiii'd 



[^51 ] 

fiird With boiling Pitch, and the other with Ro- 
fin, Tallow, and Oil, and fuch Stuff; as the Ship- 
Wrights Life for that Work. And the Man that at- 
tended the Carpenter, had a great Iron Ladle in 
his Hand, wich which he fupplied the Men that 
were at Work, with that hot Stuff". Two of the 
Enemy's Men entred the Boat juft where chis Fel- 
low flood, being in the Fore-ftieets ; he immedi- 
ately faluted them with a Ladle full of the Stuff^, 
boiling hot, which fo burnt and fcalded them, 
being half naked, that they roared out like two 
Bulls, and enraged with the Fire, leaped both in- 
to the Sea. The Carpenter faw it, and cried out. 
Well done, Jack, give them fome more of it : And 
flepping forward himfelf, takes one of their Mops, 
and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he, and his Man 
threw it among them fo plentifully, tiiat in fnort, 
of all the Men in the three Boats, there was not 
one that was not fcalded, and burnt with it in a 
moft frightful and pitiful Manner, and made fuch a 
howling and crying, that I never heard a worfe 
Noife, and indeed nothing like it ; for it is worth 
obferving, That though Pain naturally makes all 
People cry out ; yet every Nation has a particu- 
lar Way of Exclamation, and making Noifes as 
different from one another, as their Speech. I 
cannot give the Noife thefe Creatures made, a 
better Name than Howling, nor a Name mere 
proper to the Tone of it^ for I never heard any 
Thing more like the Noife of the Wolves, which 
as I have faid, 1 heard howl in the ForeR on the 
Frontiers of Languedoc, 

I was never pleas'd with a Vidory better in my 

Life ; not only as it was a perfed Surprize to me, 

, and that our Danger was imminent before j but 

as we got this Vidory without any Blood flied, 

except of that Man, the Fellow killed with his 

naked 



[252] 

naked Hands, and which I was very much con- 
cerned at ,• for I was fick of killing fuch poor fa- 
vage Wretches, even tho' it was in my own De- 
fence, knowing they came on Errands which they 
thought JLifl:, and knew no better. And that tho' 
it may be a jufl: Thing, becaufe neceflfary, for there 
is no neceflary Wickednefs in Nature, yet I thought 
it was a fad Life, in which wc muftbe always obli- 
ged to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to prefervc 
.our own ; and indeed I think fo iiiil; and I would 
even now fuffer a great deal, rather than I would 
take away the Life, even of the Perfon injuring 
me. And I believe, all confidering People, who 
know the Value of Lifcy would be of my Opi- 
nion ; at leafl, they would, i!^ they entred ferioufiy 
into the Confideration of it. 

But to return to my Story. All the while this 
was doing, my Partner and I, who managed the 
reft ot the Men on board, had with great Dex- 
terity brought the Ship almoft to Rights ; and ha- 
ving gotten the Guns into their Places again, the 
Gunner call'd to me, to bid our Boat get out of the 
Way, for he would let fly among them. I called 
back again to him, and bid him not ofter to fire, 
for the Carpenter would do the Work without him, 
but bad him heat another Pitch-Kettle, which 
our Cook, who was on Board, took Care of. But 
the Enemy were fo terrified with what they had 
met with in their firft Attack, that they would 
not come on again. And fome of them that 
were farthei]; off, feeing the Ship fwim, as it were 
upright, begun, as we fuppofed, to fee their Mi- 
iiake, and give over the Enterprize, finding it was 
not as they expected. Thus v/e got clear of this 
merry Fight ,* and having gotten fome Rice, and 
fome Rootf, and Bread, With about lixteen good 
big Hogs on Board, two Days before, we re- 

folv'd 



[ ^53 ] 

folvM to flay here no longer, but go forward 
whatever came of it ; for we made no Doubt but 
we fhould be furrounded the next Day with 
Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch- 
Kettle would difpofe of for us. 

We therefore got all our Things on Board the 
fame Evening, and the next Morning were ready to 
fail. In the mean time, lying at an Anchor at fome 
Diftance, we were not fo much concerned, being 
now in a fighting Poilure, as well as in a failiug 
Poflure, if any Enemy had prefented. The next 
Day having finifh'd our Work within Board, and 
finding our Ship was perfedly healM of all her 
Leaks, we fet Sail. We would have gone into the 
Bay o^Tonquin ; for we wanted to inform our felves 
of what was to be known concerning the Dutch 
Ships that had been there -, but we durfl not fland 
in there, becaufe we had feen feveral Ships go in, 
as we fuppos'd, but a little before ; fo we kept 
on N. E. towards the It'le of Formofa, as 
much afraid of being feen by a Dutch or EngUfi 
Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or Englijh Merchant 
Ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine Man of 
War. 

When we were thus got to Sea, we kept out N. E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philip- 
pine Iflands ; and this we did, that we might not 
fall into the Way of any of our European Ships ,* 
and then we fleer'd North 'till we came to the La- 
titude of 2 2 Degrees, 30 Min. by which Means 
we made the Ifland Formofa diredly, where we 
came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and 
frefh Provifions, which the People there, who are 
very courteous and civil in their Manners, fupply'd 
us with willingly^ and dealt very fairly and pundu- 
ally with us in all their Agreements and Bar- 
gains i which is what we did not find among 

other 



C 254 1 



Other People ; and may be owing to the Re- 
mains of Chriflianity* wliich was once planted 
here by a Dutch MiiTionary or ProteilantSj and 
is a Teilimony of what 1 have often obferv'd, 
viz>. That the Chrillian Reh'gion always civili- 
zes the People, and reforms their Manners, 
where it is received, whether it v/orLs iaving 
Effects upon them or no. 

From hence we fail'd flill North, keeping tha 
Coalt of China at an equal Diflance, till we knew 
we were beyond all the Ports oi Chiaay where 
our European Ships ufually come ; being refolv'd, 
li pofTib'e, not to f.all Into an} of their Hands, 
efpecially in this Country, where, as our Circum- 
jfirances were, we could not fail of being entirely 
ruined ; nay, fo great was my Fear in particular, 
as to my being taken by them, that I believe firm- 
ly, I would much rather have cliofen to fail into 
the Hands of the Spanijh Inquifiticn. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, 
we refolv'd to put into the firfl trading Port we 
fhould come at; and fl:anding| in for the Shore, a 
Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old 
Poniiguefe Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be 
an Eurcfean Ship, came to ofler his Service, which 
indeed we were very glad of, and took him on 
Board i upon which, without asking us whither 
we would go, he difmifs*d t-he Boat he came in, 
and fent them back. 

I thought it was now fo much in our Choice, 
to make the old Man carry us whither we would ; 
that 1 began to talk with him about carrying us 
to the Gi^lph of Nanqnin, which is the mofl 
Northern Part of the Coaft of China : The old 
Man faia he knew the Gulph of Nanquin very 
weij y but fmiiing, ask'd us what we N^ould do 
there > 

I told 



[ ^55 ] 

! told him, we would fell oar Cargo, and pur*- 
chafe Chi }2 a -Wares, Caliicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, 
Wroughc-Sillvs, &c. and fo would return by the 
fame Courfe we came. He told us our beft Port 
had been to have put in at Macao, where we could 
not have fail d of a Market for our Opium, to 
our Satisfadion, and might for our Money have 
purchas'd all Sorts of China-GoodSy as cheap as 
v/e could at Nanquin, 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his 
Talk, of which he was very opiniated or conceit- 
ed, 1 told him we were Gentlemen, as well as 
Merchants, and that we had a Mind to go and 
fee the great City of Pecking, and the famous 
Court of the Monarch of China. Why then, fays 
the old Man, you fhould go to Ningpo, where 
by the River which runs into the Sea there, 
you may go up within five Leagues of the 
Great Canal. This Canal is a navigable River, 
which goes thorough the Heart of that vafl Empire 
of Chinay crolTes ail the Rivers, paiTes fome con- 
fiderable Hills by the Help of Sluices and Gates, 
and goes up to the City of Pecking, being m 
Length near 270 Leagues. 

VVcll, faid I, Seignior PortugHefe, but that is nor 
our Bufincfs now : The great Qucih'on is. If you 
can carry us up to the City of Nancntin, from 
whence we can travel to Pecking afterwards ? Yes, 
he faid, he could do fo very well, and that there 
was a great Dtitih Ship gone by that Way juft 
before. This gave me a little Shock -, and a Dutch 
Ship was now our Terror^ and we had much ra- 
ther have met the Devil, at lead, if he had not 
come iw too frightful a Figure i and we depend- 
ed upon it, that a Dutch Ship would be our Dc- 
flrufrion, for we were i\\ no Condition to fight 
thenii all the Ships thsy trade with into thofc 

Parts 



[ ^56 ] 

Parts being of great Burthen, and of much great- 
er Force than we were. 

The old Man found me a little tonfus'd, and 
under fome Concern, when he nam'd a Dutch 
Ship, and faid to me, ^ir, you need be under no 
Apprchenfionsof the Dutch, I fuppofe they are 
not now at War with your Nation : No, fays I, 
that's true i but 1 know not what Libertie:^ Men 
may take when they are out of the Reach of the 
Law: Why, fays he, you are no Pirates^ what 
need you fear ? They will not meddle with peace- 
able Merchants fure. 

If I had any Blood in my Body that did not 
fly up into my Face at that Word, it was hin- 
der'd by fome Stop in the Veffels. appointed by 
Nature to prevent it •, for it put me into thegrea- 
teftDiforder and Confufion imaginable: Nor was 
It pofiible for me to conceal it fo, but that ^ 
old Man eafily perceiv'd it. 

Sir, fays he, I find you are in fome Piforder in 
your Thoughts at my Talk, pray be pleas'd to 
go which Way you think fit, and depend upon it, 
rll do you all the Service lean. Why, Seignior, 
laid I, it is true I am a little unfettled in my Refo- 
lution at this Time whither to go in particular', 
and I am fomething more fo, for what you faid 
about Pirates y I hope there are no Pirates in thefe 
Seas i wc are but in an ill Condition to meet 
with them, for you fee we have but a fmall 
Force, and but very weakly Mann'd. 

O Sir, fays he, do not be concerned, I do not 
know that there has been any Pirates in thefe Seas 
thefe fitreen Years, except one which was fecn, as 
1 hear, in the Bay of Siam^ about a Month fince; 
but you may be aiTurcd ftie is gone to the South- 
ward-, nor was (he a Ship of any great Force, or 
fit for the Work ; (he was not built for a Pri- 
vateer, 



[ 2157 ] 

vateer, biit was run away with by a reprobate 
Crew that were on Board, after the Captain and 
fome of his Men had been murdered by the Ma- 
layansy at, or near the Ifland of Suynatra. 

What ! jaid /, (Jeemlng to know nothing of the Mat- 
ter) did they murder the Captain ? ^ofaid he, I 
do not underll:.;nd that they murdered him; but as 
they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is ge- 
nerally believed they betrayed him into the Hands 
of the Malayans, who did murder him, and per- 
haps they procured them to do it. Why then, 
faid I, they deferve Death as much as if they had 
done it themfelves. Nay, fays the old M/;?, they 
do deferve it, and they will certainly have it^^if 
they light upon any Engliff} or Dutch Ship s for 
they have all agreed together, that if they meet 
that Rogue, they will give him no Qiiarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the Pirate is gone 
out of thofe Seas. How can they meet with him ; 
Why, that is true, fays he, they do fay fo ^ but he 
was, as I tell you; in the Bay of Siam^ in the Ri- 
ver Cambodia, and was difcovered there by fome 
Dutch Men who belonged to the Ship, and who 
were left on Shore when they run away with her: 
And fome EngUfi and Dutch Traders being in the 
River, they were within a little of taking him. 
Nay, faid he, if the foremofl Boats had been well 
feconded by the rell, they had certainly taken him; 
but he finding only two Boats within Reach of 
him, tacked about, and fired at thefe two, and 
difabled them before the other came up, and then 
fending off to Sea, the other were not able to 
follow him, and fo he got away. But they have 
all fo exa(5i: a Defcription of the Ship, that they 
will be furs to know him ; and wherever they 
find him, they have vowed to give no Quarter, to 

Part II. "" S either 



[ i58 ] 

Sither the Captain, or the Seamen, but to hafig 
them all up at the Yard-Arm. 

What ! Jays /, will they execute them right ot 
wrong ; hang them firR, and judge them after- 
ward ? O Sir ! fays the old Piloty there's no Need 
to make a formal Bufinefs of it with fuch Rogues 
as thofe, let them tie them Back to Back, and fet 
them a driving. It is no more than they richly 
deferve. 

I knew I had my old Man faft aboard, and that 
he could do me no Harm, fo that I turned fhort 
upon him ; Well now. Seignior, Said /, and this 
is the very Reafon, why 1 would have you carry 
us up to Nanqiiin, and not to put back to Macoa^ 
or to any other Part of the Country, where the 
EnglifJy or Dutch Ships come : For be ic known 
to you Seignior, thofe Captains of the EngUflo and 
Dutch Ships, are a Parcel of rafb, proud, infolent 
Fellows, that neither know what belongs to Ju- 
ftice, nor how to behave themfelves, as the Laws 
of God and Nature dired ,* but being proud of 
their Offices, and not underftanding their Power, 
they would ad the Murderers to punifti Rob- 
bers ; would take upon them to infult Men falfly 
accufed, and determine them guilty without due 
Enquiry ; and perhaps I may live to call fome of 
them to an Account for it, where they may be 
taught how Juflice is to be executed, and that no 
Man ought to be treated as a Criminal, 'till fome 
Evidence may be had of the Crime, and that he 
is the Man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very 
Ship they attacked, and gave him a full Account 
of the Skirmifh we had with their Boats, and how 
foolifhly and Coward-like they behaved. I told 
him all the Story of our buying the Ship, and how 
the Dutch Men ferved us. I told him the Reafons 

I had 



C ^59 ] 

I had to believe that this Story of killing the Ma^ 
jfter by the Malayans was true ,* as alfo the running 
away with the Ship : But that it was ail a Fidion 
of their own, to fuggeil that the Men were turn^'d 
Pirates ; and they ought to have been fure it was 
fo, before they had ventured to attack us by Sur- 
prize, and oblige us to refill: them ; adding that 
they would have the Blood of thofe Men, whom 
we kiird there in our juft Defence, to anfwer for. 

The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and 
told us, we were very much in the Right to go 
away to the Norths and that if he might advife us, 
it fhould be to fell the Ship in Chma^ which we 
might very well do, and buy or build another in 
the Country ; and faid he, though you will not 
get fo good a Ship, yet you may get one able 
enough to carry you and all your Goods back 
again to Bengal, or any where eife. 

I told him, I would take his Advice, when I 
came to any Port where I could find a Ship for 
my Turn, or get any Cuflomer to buy this. He 
reply 'd, I fhould m.eet with Cuftomers enough for 
the Ship atNanquin, and that a C/jinefeJonk would 
ferve me very well to go back again ; and that he 
would procure me People, both to buy one and 
fell the other. 

Well, but Seignior,y^j'j /, as you fay they know 
the Ship fo well, I may perhaps, if I follow your 
Meafures, be inftrumental to bring fome honeft 
innocent Man into a terrible Broil, and perhaps 
to be murdered in cold Blood ,• for wherever they 
find the Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the 
Men, by proving this Vv^as the Ship, and fo inno- 
cent Men may probably be over-powered and 
murdered. Why, fays the old Man, I will find out 
a Way to prevent that alfo ; for as I know all 
thofe Commanders you fpeak of, very weL', and 
S a Ihali 



[ i6o 1 

ihall fee them all as they pafs by, I will be fure to 
fet them to Rights in the Thing, and let them 
know that they had been fo much in the Wrong ; 
that tho' the People, who were on board ac firfl:, 
might run away with the Ship, yet it was not 
true that they had turned Pirates i and that in par- 
ticular, thefe wxre not the Men that firfl: went off 
with the Ship, but innocently bought her for their 
'trade ; and I am perfwaded they will fo far be- 
lieve me, as at leaft to ad more cautioufly for the 
Time to come. Well, fays I, And will you deliver 
one Meflage to them from me ? Yes, I will, fays 
hey if you will g\w^ it under your Hand in Wricmg, 
that I may be able to prove, that it came from 
you, and not out of my own Head. I anfwered. 
That I would readily give it him under my Hand ; 
fo I took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at 
large the Story of alfaultiiig me with the Long- 
Boats, &'c, the pretended Reafon of it, and the 
nnjuft cruel Dclign of it ; and concluded to the 
Commanders, that they had done what they not 
only fhould ha* been afham'd of, but alfo, that 
if ever they came to England, and I liv'd to fee 
them there, they fhould all pay dearly for it, if 
x^Q. Laws of my Country were not grown out 
of Ufe before 1 arrived there. 

My old Pilot read this over and over again, 
and ask'd me feveral Times if I would ftand to it ? 
lanfwered, I would ftand to it as long as I had 
any Thing left in the World, being fenfible that I 
fnould one Time or other find an Opportunity 
to put It home to them : But we had no Occafi- 
on ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter,* for he 
never went back again. Whie thofe Things 
were paflinp between us, by Way of Difcourfe, 
we went forward, dirc6tly for Nanqnin, and 
in about thirteen Days Sail came to an An- 
chor 



[2(51 ] 

chor at the South-Weft Point of the great Gulph 
of NanquiUy where, by the Way, I came by Ac- 
cident to underftand, that two Dutch Ships were 
gone the Length before me, and that I fhould cer- 
tainly fall into their Hands. I confiilted my Part- 
ner again in tliis Exigency, and he was as much at 
a Lofs as I was, and would very gladly have been 
fafe on Shore almoft any where. Plowever, I was 
not in fuch Perplexity neither,- but 1 ask'd the old 
Pilot, if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I 
might put into, and purfue my Bufinefs with the 
Chinefe privately, and be in no Danger of the Ene- 
my .^ He told me. If I would fail to the South- 
ward about two and forty Leagues, there was a 
little Port calfd Quinchay^g^ where the Fathers of 
the Mifllon ufually landed from Macao, on their 
Progrefs to teach the Chriflian Religion to the 
Chinefes, and where no European Ships ever put in ; 
andifl thought to put in there, 1 might confider 
what farther Courfe to take when I was afhore. 
He confefs'd, he faid, it was not a Place for Mer- 
chants, except that at fome certain Times they 
had a Kind of a Fair there, when the Merchants 
from Japan came over to buy the Chinefe Mer- 
chandizes. 

We all agreed-to go back to this Place ; the 
Name of the Port, as he callM it, I may perhaps 
fpell wrong ; for I do not particularly remem- 
ber it, havng loft this, together with the Names 
of many other Places, fet down in a little Pociket- 
Book, which was fpoil'd by the Water, on an 
Accident, which I fhall relate in its Order ; bur 
this I remember, that the Chmefd or Japonefe 
Merchants we correfponded with, call'd it by a. 
differing Name from that which our Portuguefe 
Pilot gave it,' and pronounced it, as above, 
Owfic han^^ 

S 3 As 



[ z6i ] 

As wc were unanimous in our Refolutions to 
go to this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, ha- 
ving only gone twice afliorc, where we were to 
get frefti Water i on both which Occafions, the 
People of the Country were very civil to us, and 
brought us Abundance of Things to fell to us ; J 
mean, ofProvifionsy Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and 
fome Fowls -, but nothing without Money. 

We came to the other Port, (the Wind being 
contrary) not till five Days, but it was very much 
to our Satisfaction ,* and I was joyful, and I may 
fay, thankful, when 1 fet my Foot fafe on Shore ; 
refolving, and my Partner too, that if it was 
poffible to difpofe of our felves and EfFeds, any 
other Way, tho' not every Way to our Satisfa- 
ftion, v/e would never fet one Foot on board 
that unhappy Veflel more ; and indeed I muft 
acknowledge, that of all the Circumdances of 
Life, that ever I had any Experience of, nothing 
makes Mankind fo compleatly miferable, as that, 
of being in conftant Fear. Well does the Scrip- 
ture fay, T^he Fear of Man hrjngs a Snare i it is a 
Life of Death, and the Mind is fo intirely fup- 
prefs'd by it, that it is capable of no Relief^ the 
animal Spirits fink, and all the Vigour ofS^a- 
ture, which ufually fupports Men under other 
Afflidions, and is prefent to them in the greatefi 
Exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of its ufual Operations upon 
the Fancy, by heightening every Danger, repre- 
fcnting the Englifi and Dutch Captains, to be 
Men uncapabic of hearing Reafon, or of diltin.- 
guifliing between honeft Men and Rogues ; or 
between a Story calculated for our own Turn, 
made out of nothing, on Purpofe to dtc^iv^y 
and a true genuine Account of our whole Voy-* 
^ge, Progrcfs, and D^fign ,* for v/e might many 

Way 5 



[ ^^3 ] 

Ways have convinc'd -any reafonable Creature, 
that we were not Pirates ; the Goods we had on 
board, the Courfe we fteer'd, our Frankly fhew- 
ing our felves, and entering into fuch and fuch 
forts j and even our very Manner, the Force we 
had, the Number of Men, the few Arms, little 
Ammunition, fhort Provifions ; ail thefe would 
have fervM to convince any Men, that we were 
no Pirates ; the Opium, and other Goods we 
had on board, would make it appear, the Ship 
liad been at JBef2g.il ; the Dutch Men, who it was 
faid, had the Names of all the Men that were in 
the Ship, might eafily fee that we were a Mixture 
of Engl/fi, Portugnefey and Indians, and but two 
Dutch Men on board. Thefe, and many other 
particular Circumftance?, might have made it 
evident to the Underftanding of any Comman- 
der, whofe Hands we might fall into, that we 
were no Pirates, 

But Fear, that blind ufelefs PaiHon, work'd a- 
nother Way, and threw us into the Vapours; it 
bewildred our Underftandings, and fet the Ima- 
gination at Work, to form a thoufand terrible 
Things, that perhaps might never happen. We 
iirft fuppos'd, as indeed every Body had related to 
us, that the Seamen on board the Englijh and 
Dutch Ships, but efpecially the Dutch, were fo en- 
raged at the Name of a Pirate, and efpecially 
at cur beating of their Boats, and efcaping, that 
they would noc give them felves Leave to enquire, 
whcrher we were Pirates or no ; but would ex- 
ecute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving 
us any Room for a Defence. We rcfleded that 
there was really fo much apparent Evidence be- 
fore them, that rhey would fcarce enquire after 
any more i as fuit. That the Ship was certainly 
the faiTiC, and that fome ofthe Seanjen among 

^ S 4 them 



them kncvy her, and had been on board her; 
and fecondly, That when we had Intelligence 
at the River of Cambodia^ that they were coming 
down to examine us, we fought their Boats and 
fled ; fo that we made no doubt but they were 
fully facisfy'dof our being Pirates, as we were fa- 
tisfy'd of the contrary ; and as I often faid, I know 
not but I ihoLiId have been apt to have taken 
thofe Circumftances for Evidence, if the Tables 
were turn'd, and my Cafe was theirs, and have 
niade no Scruple of cutting all the Crew to Pie- 
ces, without believing, or perhaps confidering, 
what they might have to offer in their Defence. 

But let that be how it will, thpfe were our 
Apprehenlions ; and both my Partner and I too 
fcarce Ilept a Night, without dreaming of Hal- 
ters, and Yard-Arms; that is to fay. Gibbets, 
of fighting, and being taken j of killing, and be- 
ing killed; and one Night I was in fuch a Fury 
in my Dream, fancying the Dutch Men had 
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their 
Seamen down, that I flruck my double Fifi: a- 
gainfl the Side' of the Cabin I lay in, with fuch 
a Force, as wounded my Hand mofl grievoufly, 
brol;e my Knuckles, and cut and bruifed the 
FieOi ; fo that it not only wak'd me out of my 
Sileep, but I was once afraid I fhould have loll: 
two of my Fingers. 

Another Apprehenfion I had, was of the cruel 
Ufage we might nieet with from them, if we 
fe.l into their Hands ; then the Story of Am- 
ho)na came into my Head, and how the Dutch^ 
might perhaps torture us, as they AiA our Coun- 
trymen there ; and make fome of the Men, by 
Extremity of Torture, confefs thofe Crimes 
tjiey never were J;uilty of; own themfelves, and 
nil ot us to be Pirates, and fo they would put 

us 



[1^5] 

US to Death, with a formal Appearance of Ja- 
fticei and that they might be tempted to do 
this, for the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which 
was worth four or five thoufand Pounds, put al- 
together. 

Thefe Things tormented me and my Partner 
too, Night and Day; nor did we confider that 
the Captains of Ships have no Authority to ad 
thus h and if we had furrender'd Prifoners to 
them, they could not anf^^ver the deflroying us, 
or torturing us^ but would be accountable for it, 
when they came into their own Country : This I 
fay, gave me no Satisfadion ; far if they will 
ad thus with us, what Advantage would it be 
to us, that tiiey would be call'd to an Accounr 
for it; or if we were firfl to be murthered, 
what Satisfadion would it be to us to have them 
punifh'd when they came Home ? 

' I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Re- 
flexions I now had upon the pafl: Variety of my 
particular Circumftances,- how hard I thought it 
y/as, that I who had fpent forty Years in a Life 
of continued Difficulties, and was at lafl come 
as it were to the Port or Haven, which all Men 
drive at, (viz,.) to have Reft and Plenty, fhould 
be a Voluntier in new Sorrows, by my own un- 
happy Choice ,• and that I, who eicaped fo 
many Dangers in my Youth, fhould now come 
to be hahg'd in my o:d Age, and in fo remote a 
Place, for a Crime I was not in the leaft inclined 
to, much lefs really guilty of; and in a Place 
and Circumflance, where Innocence was not like 
to be any Protedion at all to me. 

After thefe Thoughts, fomething of Religion 

would come in; and I would be confidering, 

that this feem'd to me to be a Difpoiition of 

immediate Providence, and I ought to look up- 

on 



I 166 ] 

on it, and fubmit to it as fuch ; that although I 
^J73iS innocent as to Men, I was far from being 
innocent as to my Maker ; and I ought to look 
in and examine, what other Crimes in my Life, 
were more obvious to me ,* and for which. Pro- 
vidence might juilly inflid this Punifliment, as a 
Retribution ; and that 1 ought to fiibmit to this, 
juft as I would to a Shipwreck, if it had pleafed 
God to have brought fuch a Difafter upon me. 

In its Turn, Natural Courage would fome- 
times takes its Place ,* and then I would be talk- 
ing my felf up to vigorous Refoluripns, that I 
would not be taken, to be barbaroufiy ufed by a 
Parcel of mercilefs Wretches, in cold Blood ; 
that it were much better to have fallen into the 
Hands of the Savages, ' who were Men-Eaters,^ 
and who, I was fure, would feaft upon me, 
when they had taken me ; than by thofe, who 
would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by in- 
human Tortures and Barbarities ; that in the 
Cafe of the Savages, I always refolv'd to die 
fighting, to the lafl: Gafp ; and why fhould I not 
do fo, feeing it was much more dreadful to me 
at leafl, to think of failing into thefe Mens Hands, 
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men ; 
for the Savages, give them their Due, would not 
eat a Man till he was dead, and kill'd them 
firft, as we do a Buljock ; but that thefe Men had 
many Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death. When 
ever thefe Thoiigiits prevaiTd, I was fure to put 
my felf in a kind of Fever, with the Agitations 
of a fuppofed Fight j my Blood would boil, "and 
my Eyes fparkle, as i'[ I was engag'd j and I al- 
ways refolv'd that I would take no Quarter at 
their Hands ; but even at lafr, if I could refiff no 
longer, I would blow up the Ship, and all that 
was in her, and leave them but little Booty to 
bo::a of. By 



U^7 ] . 

3y how much the greater Weighty the Anxie- 
ties' and Perplexities of thefe Thiiigs were to 
our Thoughts while we were at Sea, by fo much 
the greater was our Satisfadion, when we faw 
our felves on Shore , and my Partner told me he 
dream'd, that he had a very heavy Load upon his 
Back, which he was to carry up a Hill, and 
found that he was not able to ft and long under 
it ; but that the Ponuguefe Pilot came and took 
it off his Back, and the Hill difappear'd, the 
Ground before him (lie wing all fmooth and 
plain, and truly it was fo ; we were all like Men, 
who had a Load taken off their Backs. 

For my Parr, I had a Weight taken off from 
my Heart, that I was not able any longer to 
bear j and as I faid above, we refolv*d to go no 
more to Sea in that Ship. When wc came on Shore, 
the old Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a 
Lodging and a VVare-Houfe for our Goods, which 
by the Way, was much the fame ; it was a little 
Houfe or Hut, with a large Houfe joyning to 
it, all built with Canes, and pallifadoed round 
with large Canes, to keep out pilfering Thieves, 
of which, it feems there were not a few iw that 
Country. However, the Magiftrates allowed us 
alfo a little Guard, and we had a Sentinel with 
a kind of Halberd, or Half-pike, who ftood 
Sentinel at our Door ; to whom we allow'd a 
Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money, about 
the Value of three Pence per Day> fo that our 
Goods were kept very fafe. 

The Fair or Mart, ufually kept in this Place, 
had been over fome Time ; hovv'ever, we found 
that there were three or four Jonks in the River, 
and two ^afannersy I mean. Ships from Japan^ 
with Goods which they had bought in China, and 
were not gone away, having Japonefe Merchants 
^n $hor?. The 



[ id8 ] 

The firft Thing our old Portuguefe Pilot did 
for us, was to bring us acquainted with three 
Milfionary Romijh Prieiis, who were in the Town, 
and who had been there lomc Time, converting 
the People to Chriftianity > but we thought they 
made but poor Work or it, and made them but 
forry Chriftians when they had done. However, 
that was none of our Bufinefs : One of thefe was 
a French Man, whom they call'd Father Simon ; he 
was a jolly well conditioned Man, very free iw 
his Converfation, not feeming fo ferious and 
grave as the other two did j one of whom was 
a Portuguefe, and the other a Gencefe; but Father 
Simon was courteous, eafy in his Manner, and 
very agreeable Company. The other two were 
more referv'd, feem'd rigid and anftere, and ap- 
ply -d ferioLifiy to the Work they came about, 
(viz.) to talk with, and infinuate themfelves a- 
mong the Inhabitanrs, wherever they had Op- 
portunity. We often eat and drank with thofc 
Men, and tho' I muft confefs, the Converiion 
as they call it, of the Chinejes to Chriftianity, 
is (o far from the true Converfion required, to 
bring Heathen People to the Faith of Chrifl, 
that it feems to arnount to little more, than 
letting them kngw the Name of Chrift, and 
fay ibme Prayers to the Virgin Alary, and he^ 
Son, in a Tongue which they underftand not, 
and to crofs themfelves and the like ; yet it mull 
be confefs'd, that thefe Religious, whom we call 
M'^Tionaries, have a hrm Belief that thefe People 
fhall be fav'd, and that tney are the Inftruments 
of it ; and on this Account, they undergo not only 
%\\c Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards Oi liv- 
ing in fuch Places, but oftentimes Death it felf, 
with the mofi: violent Tortures, for the Sake 
pf this Work ; and it would be a great Wane 



[ ^^9 1 

of Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of 
the Work ftt'eJf, and the Manner of their doing 
It, i{ we ihould not have a good Opinion oftheir 
Zeal, who undertook it with To many Hazards, 
and who have no Profped of the Jealt temporal 
Advantage to themfelvcs. 

But to return to my Story-, this F/ench Prieft^ 
Father Simon, was appointed it feems, by Order 
of the Chief of the Miflion, to go up loPekingy 
the Royal Seat of the Cbin?fe Emperor, and 
waited only for another Prieft, who was order'd 
to come to him from Macaoy to go along with 
him ; and we fcarce ever met together, but he 
was inviting me to go that Journey, telling me^ 
hbw he would (hew me all the glorious Things 
of that mighty Empire •, and among the reft, 
the greateft City in the World i a City, faid 
he, that your London and our Paris put together, 
cannot be equal to. This was the City of Peking^ 
which 1 confefs is very great, and in finitely full 
of People •, but as I look'd on thofe Things 
with different Eyes from other Men, fo I (hall 
give my Opinion of them in few Words, when 
I come in the Courfe of my Travels, to fpeak 
more particularly of them. 

But firft, I come to my Fryar or MifTionary ; 
dining with him one Day, and being very mer- 
ry together, 1 fhew'd fome little Inch'nacion to 
go with him, and he prefs'd me and my Part- 
ner very hard, and with a great many Perfwa- 
fions to confent. Why Father Simon^ fays my 
Partner, why Ihould you defire our Company 
fo much ? You know we are Hcreticks, and you 
do not love us, nor cannot keep us Company 
with any Pleafurc. O 1 fays he. You may per- 
haps be good Catholicks in Time ^ my Biifinefs 
here is to convert Heathens, and who knows 
; but 



[ ^70 ] 



but I may convert you too. Very well. Fa- 
ther, hid I, fo you will preach to us all the 
Way^ I won't be troublefome to you^ fays he; 
our Religion does not diveft us of good Man- 
ners ^ betides, fays he, we are here like Country- 
men, and Co we are, compared to the Place we are 
in ; and if you are Hugemts^ and I a Carho- 
lick, we may be all Chriftians at lafl: \ at leaft, 
faid he, we are all Gentlemen^ and we may con- 
verfe fo, without being uneafy to one another. I 
lik'd that Part of his Difcourfe very well, and 
ft began to put me in Mind of my Prieft, that I 
had left in the Brafils\ but this Father Simon did 
not come up to his Charafter, by a great deal-, 
for tho' Father Simon had no Appfarance of a 
criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not 
that Fund of Chriftian Zeal, ftridt Piety, and 
fincerc Aifc£l:ion to Religion, that my other 
good Ecclefiaftick had, of whom 1 have faid fo 
much. 

But to leave him a little, tho' he ne^er left 
us, nor folliciting us to go with him *, but we 
had fomething elfe before us at firft \ for we 
had all this while our Ship, and our Merchan- 
dize to difpofe of, and we began to be very doubt- 
ful what WT (hould do, for we were now in a 
Place of very little Bulincfs \ and once 1 was a- 
bout to venture to fail for the River of Kilamy 
and the City o^ Nancjiiin : But Providence fecm'd 
now more vifibly, as 1 thought, than ever, to 
concern itfelf in our Affair •, and I was encou- 
raged from this very Time, to think, 1 (hould 
one Way or other get out of this tangled Cir- 
cumftance, and be brought Home to my own 
Conntry a^ain, tho' I had not the leaft View 
of the Manner^ and when I began fometimes 
to think of it, could not imagine by what Me- 
thod 



thod it was to be done : Providence, I fay, be- 
gan here to clear up our Way a liccle^ and the 
firft Thing that oflfered was, that our old Ponu- 
guefe Pilot brought a Japan Merchant to us, who 
began to enquire what Goods we had ^ and in 
the iirft Place, he bought all our Opium, and 
gave us a very good Price for ic, paying us in 
Gold by Weight •> fome in fmall Pieces of their 
own Coin, and fome in fmall Wedges, of a- 
bout ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for ourOpium^ it came into 
my Head 5 that he might perhaps deal with us 
for the ship too, and 1 ordered the Interpreter 
to propofe it to him-, he fhrunk up his Shoul- 
ders at k^ when it Wc^s firft propos'd to him \ 
but in a few Days after, he came to me with 
one of the Mifiionary Prlefts for his Interpreter^ 
and told me, he had a Propofal to make to 
me, and that was this : He had bought a great 
Quantity of Goods oi us, when he had no 
Thoughts (or Propofals made to him) of buy- 
ing the Ship ', and that therefore, he had not 
Money enough to pay for the Ship-, but if I 
would let the fame Men who were in the Ship 
navigate her, he would hire the Ship to go to 
Japan, and would fend them from thence to 
the Philippine Ulands with another Loading, which 
he would pay rhc Freight of, before they weiic 
ftomjapaii-^ and that at their Return, he would, 
buy the Ship. I began to liilen to his Propofal, 
and fo eager did my Head ftiil run upon Ram- 
bling, that 1 could not but begin to entertain a 
Notion of going mylcjf with him, and to fail 
from the Philippine lilands, away to the South- 
Seas ; and accordingly* I ask'd the Japan VJer- 
chant, if he would not hire us to the Philippine 
Iflands and difj:hargcub there ^ he iaid. No, he 

could 



could not do that, for then he could not have 
the Return of his Cargo ^ but he would dif- 
charge us in Japan^ he laid, at the Ship's Re- 
turn. Wei], {Hil 1 was for taking him at that 
Propofal, and going myfelf^ but my Partner, 
wifer than myft^if, perfwaded me from it, re- 
prcfenring the Dangers as well of the Seas, as of 
the Japoriefesy who are a falfe, cruel, and trea- 
cherous People i and then of the Spaniards^ at 
the Philippines^ more falfe^ more cruel, and more 
treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to 
a Conclulion •, the firft Thing we had to do, was 
to conlnlt with the Captain of the Ship, and 
with his Men, and know if they were willing 
to go to Japan ; and while I was doing this, the 
young Man, whom, as 1 faid, my Nephew had 
left with nie as my Companion for my Tra- 
vels, came to me, and told me, that he thought 
that Voyage promifed very fair, and that 
there was a great Profpedt of Advantage, and 
he would be very glad if I undertook it ; but 
that if 1 would not , and would give him 
leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I 
pleas'd to order him j that li ever he came to 
England, and I was there and alive, he would 
render me a a faithful Account of his Succefs, 
and it fhould be as much mme as I pleas'd. 

1 was really loath to part with him, but con- 
fidering the Profpcd of Advantage^ which was 
really conliderable, and that he was a young 
Fellow, as likely to do well m it, as any I 
knew, I inclin'd to let him go •, but firft I told 
him, I would confult my Partner, and give him 
an Aniwer the next Day. My Partner and I 
difcours'd about ic, and my Partner made a 
mod generous Offer > he told me, you know it 

has 



[ ^73 ] 

has been an unlucky Ship, and we both refolve 
not to go to Sea in k again ; if your Steward, 
fo he call d my Man^ will venture the Voyage^ Til 
leave my Share of the VeiFei to him, and let 
him make his bed of it ; and if we live to meet 
in England^ and he meets with Succefs abroad^ 
he (hall account for one Half of the Profits of 
the Ship'^ Freight to us, the olher fhali be his 
own. 

, M my Partner, who was no Way concerned 
with my young Man, made hirri fuch an Offer, 
I could do no lefs than offer him the fame^ and 
all the Ship's Company being willing to go with 
him, we made over Half the Ship to him in Pro- 
perty, and took a Writing frorii him, obliging 
him to account for the other, and away he 
went to Japan. The "Japan Merchant prov'd 
a very pun61:ual honefl Man to him, protefted 
him at J^pan^ and got him a Licenfeto come on 
Shore, which iht Europeans in general have not 
lately obtained \ paid him his Freight very pun- 
dually^ fenc him to the Philippines^ loaded with 
Japan^ alid China Ware<J, and a Supra*Cargo of 
their own, who trafficking with the Spaniards^ 
brought back European Goods again, and a great 
Quantity of Cloves, and other Spices •, and there 
he was not only paid his Freight very well, and 
at a very good Price, but being not willing to 
fell the Ship then, the Merchant furnirti'd him 
with Goods on his own Account ; that for fome 
Money, and fome Spices of hh own, which he 
brought with him, he went back :o ilvz ManiUcts 
to the Spaniards^ where he fold lih Cargo very 
weil. Here having gotten a good Acquaintance 
aiManil/a, he got his Ship made a free Ship-, and 
the Governor of Manilla hired him, to go to y^c- 
cdpukoy \x\ America, on the Coall of MexkOy and 
Part II. T gave 



[ ^74 ] 

gave him a Liccnle to Land there, and travel 
to Mexico, and to pafs in any Spanifi Ship to Ew 
rofe^ with all his Men. 

He made the Voyage to Accupuko very happily, 
and there he fold his Ship ; and having there al- 
fo obtained Allowance to travel by Land, to Por- 
to-Bel/o, he found Means fome how or other, to 
get to Jamaica, with all his Trcafure •, and about 
eight Years after, came to England exceeding 
Rich ; of the which, 1 (hall take Notice in its 
Place V in the mean Time, 1 return to our parti- 
cular Affairs. 

Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's 
Company ; it came before us of Courfe, toconfi- 
der what Recom pence we fhould give to the two 
Men, that they gave us fuch timely Notice of the 
Defign againft us in the P.iver of Cambodia, The 
Truth was, that they had done us a confiderable 
Service, and deferv'd well at our Hands ; tho* by 
the Way, they were a Couple of Rogues too •, for 
as they believed the Story of our being Pirates, and 
that we had really run away with the Ship, they 
came down tons, not only to betray the Defign 
that was form'd againft us, but to go to Sea with 
us as Pirates; and one 9f them confefs'd after- 
wards, that nothing elfe but the Hopes of going 
a Roguing brought him to do it. However, the 
Scrvicethcy did us was not the lefs ^ and there- 
fore, as I had promised to be grateful to them, 
I fiiTt order'd the Money to be paid to them, 
which they fa id was due to them on board their 
refpe6l:ive Ships •, that is to fay, the Englifi Man 
nineteen Months Pay, and to the Dutch Man fe- 
ven \ and over and above that, I gave them, 
each of them, a fmall Sum of Money in Gold, 
and which contented them very well. Then 1 
made the EngUfh Man Gunner in the Ship, the 

Gunner 



[ ^75 ] 

Gunner being now made fecond Mate, and Puf- 
fer ^ the Dutch Msinl made Boatfwain •, fo they 
were both very well pleas'd, and prov'd very 
ferviceable, being both able Seamen, and very 
ftout Fellows. 

We v/ere now on Shore in China j if I thought 
myfelf banifli'd, and remote from my own 
Country at jB^;z^^/, where I had many Ways to 
get home for my Money ; what could I think 
of myfelf now > When I was gotten about a thou- 
fand Leagues farther off from home, and per- 
fedly defticute of all Manner of Profped of Re- 
turn. 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
Months Time, there was to be another Fair at the 
Place where we were; and then we might be a- 
blc to purchafe all forts of the Manufadures of 
the Country, and withal, might poffibiy find 
fome Chinefejonks or VeiTels from lonquin^ that 
would be to be fold, and would carry us and our 
Goods, whiihcr we pleas'd; this I lik'd very 
well, and refolv*d to wait ; befides, as our 
particular Perions were not obnoxious, fo if any 
Engljfi or Dutch Ships came thither, perhaps we 
might have an Opportunity to load our Goods, 
and get PaiTage to fome other Place in India^ 
nearer home. 

Upon thefc Hopes we refolvVl to continue 
here i but to divert our felves, we took two or 
three Journeys into the Country ; firft we went 
ten Days Journey to fee the City of Nanquiny a 
City well worth feeing indeed i they fay it has a 
Million of People in it •, which however, I do 
not believe. \t is regularly built, the Streets all 
exaftly ftrait, and crofs one another, in dire6l 
Lines, which gives the Figure of it great Ad- 
vantage. 

\ T 2 But 



[ 176 ] 

But when I come to compare the mifcrablc 
People of thefe Countries with ours, their Fa- 
bricks, their Manner of Living, their Govern- 
ment, their Reh'gion, their Wealth, and their 
Glory, (as fome call it) I muft confefs, 1 do not 
fomuch as think k is worth naming^ or worth 
my while to write of, or any that (hall come 
after me to read. 

It is very obfervable, that v/e wonder at the 
Grandeur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremo- 
nies, the Government, the Ma n u fa 61 u res, the 
Commerce, and the Coridu£i: of thefe People i 
not that it is to be wonder*d at, or indeed in the 
Jcaft to be regarded ; butbecaule, having firft a 
true Notion of the Barbarity of tliofe Coun- 
tries, the Rudentfs and the Ignorance that pre- 
vails there, we do not exped to find any llich 
Things fo far off. 

Orherwife, what arc their Buildings to the Pa- 
laces and royal Buildings of Europe? What is their 
Trade, to the univerfal Commerce of England^ 
Holland, Prance and Spain ? What are their Cities 
to oursj for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Appa- 
rel, rich Furnifure> and an infinite Variety ? 
What are their Ports, fupply'd with a few Jonks 
and Barks to our Navigation, our Merchant 
Fleets, our large and powerful Navies? Our City 
of IoWo« has more Trade than all their mighty 
Empire. One Englijh^ or Dutch y or French Man 
of War of 8o Guns, would fight and deftroy all 
the Shipping of China. But the Greatnefs of their 
Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Govern- 
ment, and Strength of the r Armies, isfurprifing 
to us, becaufe, as I have faid, confidering them a5 
a barbarous Nation of Pagans, little better thari 
Savages, we did not exped fuch Things among 
ihem '•> and this indeed is the Advantage with 

which 



[ ^77 ] 

which all their Greatnefs and Power is repre" 
fented to us; otherwife it is in it felf nothing at all* 
for as 1 have faid of their Ships, fo may be fai^ 
of their Armies and Troops: All the Forces o^ 
their Empire, tho' they were to bring two Mil- 
lions o( Men into the Field together, would 
be able to do nothing but ruin the Country, and 
ftarve themfeves. If they were to beiiege a ftrong 
Town in Flanders^ or to fight a difciplin'd Army, 
one Line oi German CuriaHiers, or oi French Caval- 
ry, would overthrow all the Horfe o^ China. A Mil- 
lion of their Foot coul<i not fland before one em- 
battled Body of our Infantry, pofted (o as not to 
be furrounded, tho' they were to be not one t« 
twenty in Number : Nay, I do not boaft, if I fay 
that :?oooo German or Englijh Foot, and looco 
Fyemh Horfe, would fairly beat all the Forces of 
China : And fo of our fortified Towns, and of the 
Arc of our Engineers in aflaulting and defending 
Towns. There^s not a fortified Town in China^ 
could hold out one Month againft the Batteries 
and Attacks of an European Army ; and at the fame 
Time, all the Armies in China could never take 
fuch a Town as Dunkirk^ provided it was no: 
flarv'd ; no, not in ten Years Siege. They hav^ 
Fiie-Arms, his true, but they are aukward, 
ciumfy, and uncertain in going off: They h^v^ 
Powder, but it is of no Strength : They hav^ 
neither Difcipline in the Field, Exercife to their 
Arras, Skill to attack, or Temper to retreat; 
and therefore, I muft confefs, it feemM fttange to 
rae, when I came Home, and heard our People 
fay fuch fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glo- 
ry, Magnificence, and Trade o^ the Chinefe ; be- 
caufe I faw, and knew that they were a contemp- 
tib!c Herd or Crowd of ignorant fordid Slaves, 
iubjcctcd so a Government qualified only to rule 
T 3 ' ^ ' fu<;h 



[ ^78 1 

fuch a People ; and in a Word, for I am nQW 
launch'd quite befide my Defign ; 1 fay, in a Word, 
were not its Dillance inconceiveably great from 
Mufcovy, and was not the Mufcovite Empire almoft 
as rude, impotent, and ill govern'd a Crowd of 
Slaves as they, the Cz.aY of Mufcovy might with 
much Eafe drive them all out of: their Country, 
and conquer them in one Campaign : And had the 
Cz,ar, wno I (ince hear is a growing Prince, and 
begins to appear formidable in the World, fallen 
this Way, inflead of attacking the warlike Swedes^ 
in which Attempt, none of the Powers of Europe 
would have envy 'd or interrupted him ; he might 
by this Time have been Emperor of China, initead 
of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, 
when the latter was not one to fix in Number, 
As their Strength, and their Grandeur, fo their Na- 
vigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is imper^ 
fe6c and impotent, compared to the fame Things 
in Europe ; alfo in their Knowledge, their Lear- 
ning, their Skill in the Sciences. They have Globes 
and Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge 
of the Mathematicks ; but when you come to 
enquire into their Knowledge, how fiiort-fighted 
are the wifefl of their Students ! they know nothing 
oi: the Motion of the heavenly Bodies ; and fo 
grofsly andabfurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is 
eclips'd, they think 'tis a great Dragon has af- 
faulted, and run away with it, and they fall a 
clattering with all the Drums and Kettles in the 
< Country, to fright the Monfter away, jufl as we 
do to hive a Swarm of B^^s, 

As this is the only ExcurfTon of this Kind which 
I have made in all the Account I have given of 
my Travels, fo I fhall make no more Defcriptions 
ot Countries and People, 'tis none of my Bulinefs, 
or any Part of my Defign ; but giving an Account 

of 



[ ^79 1 

of my own Adventures, through a Life of inimi- 
table Wandrings, and a long Variety of Changes, 
which perhaps few that come after me will have 
heard the like of^ Ifhall therefore fay very little 
of all the mighty Places, defart Countries, and 
numerous People, I have yet to pafs thro', more 
than relates to my own Story, and which my Con- 
cern among them will make neceffary. I was now, 
as near as I can compute, in the Heart of Chinay ' 
about the Latitude of thirty Degrees North of the 
Line, for we were returned from Nanquin : I had 
indeed a Mind to fee the City of Peking^ which 1 
had heard fo much of, and Father Simon impor- 
tuned me daily to do it. At length his Time of going 
away being fet, and the other MifTionary, who 
was to go with him, being arriv'd from Mzc^t?, 
it was neceffary that we fliould refolve, either to 
go, or not to go; folreferr^ him to my Partner, 
and left it wholly to his Choice, who at length 
refolv'd it in the Affirmative, and we prepar'd for 
our Journey. We fet out with very good Advan- 
tage, as to finding the Way *, for we got Leave to 
travel in tlie Retinue of one of their Mandarines, 
a Kind of Viceroy, or principal Magiflrate in the 
Province where they refide, and who take great 
State upon them, travelling with great Atten- 
dance, and with great Homage from the People, 
who are fometimes greatly impoverifli'd by them, 
becaufe all the Countries they pafs thro' are oblig'd 
to furnifii Provifions for them and all their At- 
tendance. That which 1 particularly obferved, 
as to our travelling with his Baggage, was this, 
Thattho'we received fufficient Provifions^ both 
for our felves and our Horfes, from the Country, 
as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were oblig'd 
to pay for every Thing we had, after the Mar- 
ket Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's 
T 4 Steward, 



[ i8o ]• 

Steward, or CommifTary of the Provifions, col- 
kded it duely from us j fo that our travelling m 
the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho^ it was a very 
great Kindnefs to us, was not fuch a mighty Fa- 
vour in him, but was indeed a great Advantage 
to him, confidering there were above thirty other 
People travelled in the fame Manner befides ui/ 
under the Protection of his Retinue, or as we-may 
call it, under his Convoy. This, I fay, was a great 
Advantage to him, for the Country furnifhed all 
the Provilions for nothing, and he took all our Mo- 
ney for them. 

We were Rvc and twenty Days travelling to Pe- 
king, through a Country infinitely populous, but 
miferable cultivated; the Husbandry, the Oe- 
conomy, and the Way of living miferable, thongh 
they boaft fo much of the Induftry of the People; 
I fay, miferable j and fo it is, if we who under-- 
ftand how to live, were to endure it, or to com- 
pare it with our own -, but not fo to thtfc poor 
Wretches who know no other. The Pride of t-hefe 
People is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing, 
but their Poverty, which adds to that which 1 call 
their Mifery : And I muft mcds think the naked 
Savages o^ Amenca Vivo, much more happy, becaufe^ 
as they have nothing, fo they defir'e nothing^ 
whereas thefe are proud and infolent, and in the 
main, are meer Beggars and Drudges. Their 
Oflentation is inexpreffible, and is chiefly f he wed 
in their Clothes and Buildings, and in keeping 
;^ultitudesofServ^ntsor Slaves, and, which is to 
the laft Degree ridiculous, their Contempt of aU 
the World but themfelves. 

I muft confefs, I travelled more pleafantly after- 
wards in the Defarts and vaaft Wildernefics of 
Cirand T'aytayy^ than here , and yet the Roads 

■ hert 



[i8i ] 

here are well paved, and well kept, and very con- 
venient for Travellers : But nothing was more 
aukward to me, than to fee fuch an haughty, im- 
perious, infolent People in the midflof the grof- 
feft Simplicity and Ignorance, for all their famed 
Ingenuity is no more. - And my Friend Father Si- 
mon and I, ufed to be very merry upon thefe Qc- 
cafions, to fee the beggarly Pride of thofe People. 
For Example. Coming by the Houfe of a Coun- 
try Gentleman, as Father ^non call'd him, about 
ten Leagues off of the City o^N/itiqum, we had firft 
of all, the Honour to ride with the Mailer of the 
Houfe about two Miles. The State he rode in, 
was a perfect Don Quixotifmy being a Mixture of 
Pomp and Poverty. 

- The Habit of this greafy Don was very proper 
for a Scaramouch or Merry Andrew, being a dirty 
Callicoe, with all the Tawdry and Trapping of 
a Fool^s Coat, fuch as Hanging-fleeves, Toflelsj 
and Cuts and Slafhes almofl on every Side : It co- 
vered a Taffaty Veil, as greafy as a Butcher, and 
which teftified that his Honour mufl needs be a 
moft exquifite Sloven. 

' His Hor-fe was a poor, lean, flarv'd, hobbling 
Creature, fuch as in England might fell for about 
30 or 40 Shillings ; and he had two Slaves fol- 
lowed him on Foot, to drive the poor Creature 
along. He had a Whip in his Hand, and he be- 
laboured the Beaft as fail about the Head, as his 
Slaves did about the Tail ,* and thus he rode by 
us with about ten or twelve Servants^ and we 
were told he was going from the City to his 
Country- Seat, about Half a League before us. We 
travelled on gently, but this Figure of a Gentle- 
man rode away before us, and we flopped at a 
Village about an Hour to refrefh us. When v.x 
game by tlie Country Seat cf this great Man, we 

faw 



C i8i ] 

faw him in a little Piace, before his Door, eating 
his Repaft. It was a Kind of a Garden, but he 
was eafy to be feen, and we were given to un- 
derftand thac the more we look'd on him, the bet- 
ter he would be pleafed. 

He fat under a Tree, fomething like the Pal- 
metto Tree, which etfedtually Ihaded him over the 
Head, and on the South-iide, but under the Tree 
alfo, was placed a large Umbrelio, which made 
that Pare look well enough. He (at lolling back 
in a great Elbow- Chair, being a heavy corpulent 
Man, and his Meat being brought him by two 
Women Slaves : He had two more, whofe Office, 
I think, few Gentlemen in Eurofe would accept of 
their Service in, ( viz.. ) One i^d. the Squire with 
a Spoon, and the other held the Difh with one 
Hand, and fcraped off what he let fall upon his 
Worfhip's P>eard rax! Ta&ty Veft, while the great 
fat Brute thought it bciow him to employ his own 
Hands in any of thofe familiar Offices, which 
Kings and Monarchs would rather do, than be 
troubled with the clumfy Fingers of their Ser- 
vanes. 

I took this Time to think what Pains Mens 
Pride puts them to ; and how troublefome a 
ha' ghty Temper, thus ill-manag'd, mud be to a 
Man ol common Senfe; and leaving the poor Wretch 
to pleafe himfelfw.th our looking at him, as it 
we admired his Pomp, whereas we really pitied 
and ccntemned him, we purfu'd our Journey ; only 
Farher Simon had the Cunofity ro llay to inform 
himfelf what Da'nties the Country Juftice had to 
feed on, in a"l his State, which he faid, he had the 
Honour to tafte oF, and which was, 1 think, a 
Dofe that an Ertglijh Hound would fcarce have^ 
eaten, if it had been offered him, ( viz.. ) a Mefs of 
boii'd Rice, with a great Piece of Garlick in it, 

and 



[ ^83 ] 

and a little Bag fiil'd with Green Pepper, anci 
another Plant which they have there, fomething 
like our Ginger, but fmelling like Musk, and 
rafting like Muftard : All this was put together, 
and afmall Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boil'd 
in it i and this was his VVorfhip's Repaft, four 
or five Servants more attending at a Diftance. If 
he fed them meaner than he was fed himfelf, the 
Spice excepted, they muft fare very coarfely indeed. 

As for our Mandarin, with whom we travelled, 
he was ref^eded like a King ; furrounded always 
with his Gentlemen, and attended in all his Ap- 
pearances with fuch Pomp, that I faw little of 
him but at a Diftance ; but this 1 obferv'd, that 
there was not a Horfc in his Retinue, but that 
our Carriers Pack-Horfes in England feem tome 
to look much better ; but they were (o cover'd 
with Equipage, Mantles, Trappings and fuch 
like Trumpery, that you cannot fee whether 
they are fat or lean: In a Word, we could fee 
fcarce any thing but their Feet and their Htads.f 

I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble 
and Perplexity that I have given an Account of 
being over, I had no anxious Thoughts about 
me, which made this Journey the pleafanter to 
me, nor had I any ill Accident attended me, only 
in the palTing or fording a fmall River, my Horfe 
fell, and made me free of the Country, as they 
call it, that is to fay, threw me in. The Place 
was not deep, but it wetted me all over ; I men- 
tion it,becanfeit fpoil'd my Pocket- Book, where- 
in I had fet down the Names of feveral People 
and Places which I had Occafion to remember, and 
which, not taking due Care of-, the Leaves rotted, 
and the Words were never after to be read, to my 
great Lofs, as to the Names of forae Places I 
touch'd at in this Voyage. 

Ac 



[i84] 

At length we arriv'd at Peking; I had no Body 
with me but the Youth, whom my Nephew, the 
Captain, had given me to attend me as a Servant, 
and who proved very trufty and dih'gent ; and 
my Partner had no Body with him but one Ser- 
vant; who was a Kinfman : As ior the Ponuguefe Pi- 
lot, he being defirous to fee the Court, we gave him 
his PafTage, that is to fay, bore his Charges for 
his Company, and to ufe him as an Interpreter ; 
for he underftc od' the Language of the Country, 
and fpoke good Frei^chy 2Lnd a. little EngUflo: And 
indeed, this old Man was a mod ufeful Implement 
to us every where \ for we ha^i not been above a 
Week at Peking^ when h^ came laughing. Ah, 
Seignior Inglefe, fays he, Ihaue Jomething to tell you 
"xil make your Heart glad. My Heart glad ^ fays I, 
JVl^^f (^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^ Idont know any thing in this Coun- 
try can either give me Joy or -GrieJ to any great Degree. 
Tesy yesy faid the old Man in broken EngUjl:, make 
you glad, meforrow ; furry he w^ould ha^^ faid. This 
made me more inquifitive. J^^hy, faid I, will it 
make' you forry? Becaufe, faid he,' )ou have brought 
me here 25 Days journey^ and '^vill leave me to go 
back alone, and ixhiih v:ay {hall I get to my Port nfte-r^ 
vsard^ without a Ship^ without a Horfe, without Pe- 
cune? So he called Money, being his broken La~ 
tin, of which he had Abundance to make us mer- 
ry with. 

In fliort, he told us there was a great Carravan 
oi'Mufcovite and Po///^ Merchants in the City, 
and they were preparing to fet our on their Jour- 
ney by Land to Mufcovy within four or hvc Week s, 
and he was fure we would take che Opportunity 
to go with them, and-leave him -behind- to go 
back all alone. 1 confefsi I was furpriz'd v/ith 
his News, a fecret Joy fpread it felf over my 
whole Soul, which I cannot dcfcribe, and never 



[ i85 ] 

felt before or (ince, and I had no Power for a 
good wliile to fpbak a V/ord to the old Man ,* bun 
at lad I turn'd to him : How do you know this, 
laid I, are you fure it is true ? Yes, fays he, I 
met this Morning in the Street an old Acquain- 
tance of mine, an Armenian, or one you call a 
Greciany who is among them; he cime lall: from 
Ajhacayiy and was deligning to go to "Tonqtim 
where I formerly knew him, but has alterM his 
Mind, and is now^refolv'd to go with the Carravan 
xo Mufcov^y and fo down the River M^olgato Aftra- 
din. Well, Seignior, fays I, do nor be uneafy a- 
b'out being left to go back alone ; if this be a Me- 
thod for my Return to England, it fhall be your 
"Fault if you go back to Macao at all. We then 
went to confuiting together what was to be done, 
and I ask*d my Partner what he thought of the 
Pilot's News, and whether it would fuit with his 
Affairs ? He told me he would do juft as I would, 
for he had fettled all his Aflairs fo well at Bengal^ 
and left his Eftefts in fuch good Hands, that 
as we had made a good Voyage here, if he 
could veft it in China Silks, wrought and raw, 
fuch as might be worth the Carriage, he would 
be content to go to England, and then make his 
Voyage back to Bengal, by the Company*s 
Ships. 

Having refolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if 
our Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would 
bear his Charges to Mujcovj or to England if he 
pleas'd; nor indeed were we to beefteem'd over 
generous in that Part neither, if we had not re- 
warded him farther, for the Service he had done 
us was really worth all that, and more : for he had 
not only been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had 
bvcu like a Broker for us on Shore : aid his pro- 
curing for us the Japan Merchant, was fome 

hundred 



[ iS6 ] 

hundred of Pounds in our Pocket : So we con* 
fulted together about it, and being wiUing to 
gratify him, which was indeed but doing him 
Juftice, and very willing alfo to have him with us 
befides, for he was a mofl neceffary Man on all 
Occafions, we agreed to give him a Quantity of 
coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it, came to a- 
bout 175 Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear 
all his Charges, both for himfelf and Horfe, ex- 
cept only a Horfe to carry his Goods. 

Having fettled this among our felves, we call'd 
him to let him know what we had refolv'd j I told 
him, he had complain d of our being to let him 
go back alone, and I was now to tell him wq 
were refolv'd he fhould not go back at all : 
That as we had refolv^d to go to Europe with the 
Carravan, were folv'd alfo he fhould go with us, 
and that we called him, to know his Mind. He 
Ihook his Head, and faid, it was a long Journey, 
and he faid no Peaine to carry him thither, or 
to fubiifl: himfelf when he came there. We told 
him, we believ'd it was fo, and therefore we had 
refolv'd to do fomething for him, that fhould 
let him fee how fenfible we were of the Service 
he had done u-, and alfo how agreeable he was 
to us ; and then I told him what we had refolv'd 
to give him here, which he might lay out as we 
would do our own i and that as for his Charges, 
if he would go with us, we would fet him fafe 
a-fhore, CLife and Cafualties excepted) cither in 
Mufcovy or England, which he would, at our own 
Charge, excepr only the Carriage of his Goods. 

He received the Propofal like a Man tranfported, 
and told u? he would go with us over the whole 
World ; and fo, in fhorr, wt all prepared our felves 
for the Journey. However, as it was with us, (o 

it 



[ ^^7 ] 

it was with the other Merchants, they had many 
Things to do, and inftead of being ready in five 
Weeks, it was four Months and fome odd Days, 
before all Things were got together. 

It was the Beginning of February yOi\r Stile, whea 
we fet out from Peking i my Partner and the old 
Pilot had gone Exprefs back to the Port where we 
had firfl put in, to difpofe of fome Goods which 
we had left there ; and I with a Chwefe Merchant, 
whom I had Tome Knowledge of at Nanquin^ and 
who came to Peking on his own Aftairs, went to 
Nanquiity where I bought ninety Pieces of fine Da- 
masks, with about two hundred Pieces of other 
very fine Silks, of feveral Sorts, fome mix'd with 
Gold, and had all thefe brought to Peking againft 
my Partner's Return. Befides this, we bought a 
very large Qiiantity of Raw Silk, and fome other 
Goods, our Cargo amounting in thefe Goods only 
to about three thoufand five hundred Pounds Ster- 
ling, which,^together with Tea, and fome fine 
Callicoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs 
and Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for our 
Share, befides thofe we rode upon ; which with 
two or three fpare Horfes, and two Horfes loaded 
with Provifions, made us in (hort 26 Camels and 
Horfes in our Retinue. 

The Company was very great, and, as near 
as I can remember, made between three and 
four hundred Horfe, and upwards of a hundred 
and twenty Men, very well armed and provided 
for all Events : For as the Eadern Carravans are 
fubjeded to be attacked by the Arabs j fo are thefe 
by the Tartars -, but they are not altogether fo 
dangerous as the Arabs, nor fo barbarous when 
they prevail. 

The Company confifted of People of feveral 
Nations, fuch as Mufcovites chiefly ,• for there were 

above 



[i88] 

above fix ty of them who were Merchants or In- 
habitants of AlufcoWj though of them, forae were 
Livoniansy and to our particuKir. Satisfadion, five 
of them were Scots, who appeard alfo to be Men 
of great Experience in Bufincfs, and Men of very 
good Subftance. 

When we had .travelled one Day^'s Journey, the 
Guides, who were five in Number, call'd all the 
Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to fay, all the 
PafTengers^^ except the Servants, to a great Coun- 
cil, as they call'd it. At this great Council every 
one depofited a certain Qi-iantity of Money to a 
common Stock, for the necelfary Expence of buying 
Forage on the Way, where it was not otherwife 
to be had, and for fatisfying the Guides, getting 
Horfes, and the like. . And here they conftitured 
the Journey, as they call it> viz,, they named Cap- 
tains and Officers, to draw us all up, and give 
the Command in Cafe of an Attack, and gave 
every one their Turn of Command: Nor was this 
forming us into Order any more than what we 
found needful upon the Way; as (lull be obferved 
in its Place. 

The Road alien this Side of the Country is 
very populous, and is full of Potters and Earth- 
makers, that is to fay. People that tempered the 
Earth for rhe China Ware ; and as I was coming 
along, our Portugal Pilot, who had aKvays fome- 
thing or other to fay to make us merry, came 
fneering to me, and told me, he v/ould fiiew me the 
greatell Rarity in all the Country, and that I 
fhould have this to fay of China, after all the ill- 
humoured Things I had faid of it, that I had feen 
one Thing which was not to be feen in all the 
World befide. I was very importunate to know 
what it was. At laft he told me it was a Gentle- 
man's Houfe built all with China Ware. Well, 



fays /, are not the Materials of their Building the 
Produd of their own Country; and fo is ail China 
Ware ; is it not ? No, no, fays hey I mean it is 
an Houfe all made of China Ware, fuch as you 
call it in England; or, as it is called in our Coun- 
try, Porcelkin. Well, fays /, fuch a Thing may be. 
How big is it ? Can we carry it in a Box upon 
a Camel ? If we can, we will buy it. Upon a 
Camel ! fays the old Pilot^ holding up both his 
Handsy why there is a Family of thirty People 
lives in it. 

I was then curious indeed to fee it, and when 
I came to it, it was nothing but this. It was a 
Timber-Houfe, or a Houfe built, as we call it in 
England^ with Lath and Plaiiler, but all the Plai- 
flering was really China Ware, that is to fay, it 
was plaiftered with the Earth that makes China 
Ware. 

The Outfide, which the Sun flione hot upon, 
was glaz'd, and looked very well, perfed white, 
and painted with blue Figures, as the large China 
Ware in England is painted, and hard, as if it had 
been burnt. As to the Infide, all the Walls, in- 
ftead of Wainfcot, were lined up with hardned 
and painted Tiles, like the little fquare Tiles we 
call GaWy-TiiQs in England, all made of the finefl 
Chinay and the Figures exceeding fine indeed, with 
extraordinary Variety of Colours mixed w^ith 
Gold, many Tiles making but one Figure, but 
joined (o artificially, the Mortar being made of 
the fame Earth, that it was very hard to fee where 
the Tiles met. The Floors of the Rooms were 
of the fame Compofition, and as hard as the 
earthen Floors v/e have in ufe in feveral Parts of 
England, efpecially Lincolnjloire, Nottinghamjhirey Lei- 
cefterjhirey &c. as hard as a Stone, and fmooth, but 
not burnt and painted, except fome fmaller Rooms, 
Part II. U like 



[ ^9^^ ] 

like Clofets, which were all as it were pained 
with the fame Tile. The Ceiling , and in a- 
Word, all the plaifteriiig Work in the whole 
Houfe were of the fame Earth -, and after all, the 
Roof was covered with Tiles of the fartie, butoF 
a deep fhining Black. 

This was a China Warehoufe indeed, truly and 
literally to be called fo j and had I not been upon 
the Journey, I could have fiay'd fome Days to fee 
and examine the Particulars of it. They told me 
there were Fountains and Fifii-ponds in the Gar- 
den, all pav'd at the Bottom and Sides with the 
fame, and fine Statues fet up m Rows on the Walks,' 
entirely formed of the Porceilain Earth, and burnt 
whole. 

As this is one of the Singularities of China^ fo- 
they may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very 
jfure they excel in their Accounts of it ; for they 
told me fuch incredible Things of their Perfor- 
mance in Crockery Ware^ for fuch it h^ that I care 
not to relate, as knowing it could not be true. 
They told me in particular, of one Workman that 
made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Mafts, and 
Sails, in Earthen Ware, big enough to carry fifty 
Men. If he had told me, he launched it, and made 
a Voyage to japun in ity I might have faid feme- 
thing to it indeed i but as it was, I knew the 
whole of the Story > which was in fiiorr, asking 
IPardon for the Word, that the Fellow lied. So I 
frniled, and faid nothing to it. 

This odd Sight kept mc two Hours behind the 
Csiravan, for which, the Leader of it for the Day^, 
fined me about the Value of three Shillings, and 
told me, if it had been three Days Journey with- 
out the Wall, as it was three Days v^^ithin, he 
mufi: have fined me four times as much, and made 
me ask Pardon die next Council Day, So I pro- 

mifed 



[ ^91 ] 

mifed to be more orderly ; for indeed I found 
afterward the Orders made for keeping all toge- 
ther, were abfolutely riecellary for our common 
Safety. 

In two Days more, we pa.{s''d the great China 
Wall, made for a Fortification againft tiie lartars ; 
and a very great Work it is, going over Hi s and 
Mountains in a needlefs Tracks where the Rocks 
are impaffable, and the Piecipices fueh as no Ene- 
my could poiTibly enter, or indeed climb up, or 
where if they did, no Wall could hinder them. 
They tell us, its Length is near a thoufand EnglijJj 
Miles, but that the Country is five hundred in a 
ftrait meafured Line, which the Wall bounds, 
without meafuring the Windings and Turnings it 
takes. 'Tis about four Fathom high, and as ma- 
ny thick in fome Places. 

I ftood frill an Hour, or thereabout, without 
trefpafling our Orders, forfo long the Caravan was 
in paffing the Gate ; 1 fay, I flood flill an Hour to 
look at it on every Side, near, and far off ; I mean, 
that was within my View. And the Guide of 
our Caravan, who had been extolling it for the 
Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to hear 
my Opinion of it. I told him it was a mofl ex- 
cellent Thing to keep off the Tartars ; which he 
happened not to underftand as I meant it, and fo 
took it for a Compliment : But the old Pilot: 
laughed. O SeIr;nior Inglefe, fays he, you fpeak m 
Colours. In Colours, faid I, What do you mean 
by that ? Why, you fpeak what looks white thi^ 
Way^ and black that Way ; gay one IVay^ and dull 
another Way. You tell him it is a good Wail to 
keep out Tartars} You tell me by that, it is good 
for nothing but to keep out I'artars, or it will 
keep o«t none but "tartars, I underftand you, Seig- 

XT . 

^ 2 nier 



[ 191 i 

liior Inglefe^ I underAand you, fays he, but Seig- 
nior Chinefe underflood you his own way. 

Well, fays I, Seignior, do you think it would 
fland out an Army oi our Country People, with 
a good Train of Artillery ; or our Engineers, with 
two Companies of Miners ; would not they bat- 
ter it down in ten Days, that an Army might 
enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air», Foun- 
dation and all, that there ftiould be no Sign of it 
left ? Ah, ah, fays he, I know that. The Chinefe 
wanted mightily to know what I faid, and I gave 
him Leave to teil him a few Days after, for he was 
then almoft out of their Country, and he was to 
leave us in a little time afterward , but when he 
knew what I had faid, he was dumb all the reft 
of the Way, and we heard no more of his fine 
Story of the Chinefe Power and Greatnefs, while 
heftay'd. 

After we had pafs'd this mighty Nothing call'd 
a Wall, fomething like the Picis VVail, and fo fa- 
mous in Northumberland, and built by the Romans^ 
we began to find the Country thinly inhabited, 
and the People rather confined to live in fortified 
Towns and Cities, as being fubjed to the Inroads 
and Depredations of the "Tartars, who rob in great 
Armies, and therefore are not to be refiftcd by 
the naked Inhabitants of an open Country. 

And here I began to find the Neceffity of keep- 
ing together in a Carravan as we travelled ; for 
we faw (everal Troops of Tartars roving about » 
but when I came to fee them diftinitly, I won- 
der'd more that the Chinefe Empire could be con- 
quered by fuch contemptible Fellows; for they 
are a mcer Hoord or Crowd of wild Fellows, 
keeping no Order, and underflanding no Difci- 
pline, or manner of Fight. 

Their _ 



[ 2-9? ] 

Their Horfes are poor lean ftarved Creatures^ 
taught nothing, and fit for nothing , and this wc 
faidj the firfl: Day wc faw them, which was af- 
ter we .entered the wider Part of the Country. 
Oura Leader for the Day, gave Leave for about 
fixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it; and 
what was this but hunting of Sheep : However^ 
it may be call'd hunting too ; for the Creatures 
^re the wildeft and fwifteil of Foot that ever I 
faw of their Kind ; only they will not run a great 
Way, and you are fure of Sport when you begin 
the Chafe; for they appear generally thirty or 
forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep, always keep 
together when they fly. 

In Purfuit of this odd fort of Game, it was. 
our Hap to meet with about forty T^artars ; whe- 
ther they were hunting Mutton as we were, or 
whether they look'd for another Kind of Prey, I 
know not; but as foon as they faw us, one of 
them blew a kind of a Horn very loud, but with 
a barbarous Sound, that I had never heard before, 
and by the way, never care to hear again : We all 
fuppos'd this was to call their Friends about them, 
and fo it was; for in lefs than half a Quarter of 
an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty more appeared, 
at about a Mile Diftance ; but our Work was over 
firli:, as it happen'd. 

One of the Scots Merchants of Mufcow hap- 
penM to be amongfl us, and as foon as he heard 
the Horn, he told us in fhort, that we had no- 
thing to do, but to charge them immediately 
without Lofs of Time ; and drawing us up in a 
Line, he askM if we were refolv'd ? We told him, 
we were ready to follow him ; fo he rode diredly 
up to them. They flood gazing at us like a meer 
Crowd, drawn up in no Order, nor (hewing the 
Face of any Order at all ; but as foon as they faw 

V 3 ^h 



[ ^94 1 

ps advance, th^y let fly their Arrows, which 
however mifs'd us very happily. It feems they 
miftook not their Aim, but their Diflance ; for 
their Arrows ail fell a little fhort of us, but with 
fo true an Aim, that had we been about twenty 
Yards nearer, we muit have had ftverai Men 
wounded, if- not kilTd. 

Immediately we halted ; and tho' it was at a 
great Diflance, we fir'd, and fent them Leaden 
Bullets for Wocdon Arrows, following cur Shot 
full Gallop, to fall in am.ong them Sword in Hand, 
for fo our bold Scot that led us direded. He was 
indeed but a Merchant, buthebehav'd wiih that 
Vigour and Bravery on this Occafion, and yet, 
with fuch a ccol Courage too, that I never faw 
any Man in Adion fiirerfor Command. As foon 
as we came up to u'-'cm, we fir'd our Piflols in 
pheir Faces, and then ;l.''"w i but they fled in the 
grcaicrf Confufion imagi!:ible. The only Stand 
any of them made, was on our Right, v/here 
three of them flood, and by Signs caliM the refl 
to come back to them, having a kind of Semiter 
in their Hands, and their Bows hanging at their 
Backs. Our brave Commander, without asking 
any Body to follow him, gallops up clofe to them, 
and with his Fuzee knocks one of them off his 
Horfe, kili'd the fecond with his Pifto!, and the 
third ran av/ay i and thus ended our Fight : Bur 
we had this Misfortune attending it, (viz.) That 
all our Mutton that we had in Chafe, got away. 
We had not a Man kill'd or hurt j but as for the 
T'artars, there was about five ci them killed : Who 
were wounded, we knew not i but this we knew, 
that the other Party was fo frighted with the 
Koifecfour Guns, that they made cfl-^ and never 
made any Attempt upon us. 

Wc 



f ^95 ] 

We were all this while in the Ch'mefe Domlniom 
and therefore the "Tartars were not fo bold as after- 
wards ; but in about iive Days we enter'd a vaft 
great wild Defart, which held us three Days and 
Nights March ; and we wereoblig'd to carry our 
Water with us in great Leather Bottles, and to 
encamp all Night, juft as I have heard they do ia 
the Deiart of Arabia. 

I ask'd whofe Dominion this was in, and they 
told me, this was a kind of Border, that might 
be called no Mans Land; being a Part of the 
Great Karakathie, or Grand Tartary, but that 
however it was all reckoned to China; but that 
there was no Care taken here, to preferve it 
from the Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it 
was reckoned the worft Defart in the whole 
World, tho' we were to go over fome much 
larger. 

In pafTing this Wildernefs, which I confefs was 
at the fird: very frightful to me, we faw two or 
three Times little Parties of the Tartars, but they 
feem'd to be upon their own Affairs, and to have 
i\o Defign upon us; and fo like the Man who 
met the Devil, if they had nothing to fay to 
iis, we had nothing to fay to them ; we let 
them go. 

Once however, a Party of them came fo near, 
as to flan-d and gaze at us ,* whether it was to 
confider what they fhould do, whether attack us, 
or riot attack us, that we knew not; but when 
we were pafs'd at fome Diftance by them, we 
made a Rear- Guard of forty Men, and flood 
ready for them, letting the Caravan pafs half a 
Mile, or thereabouts, before us ; but after a while 
they marched off, only we found they fainted us 
With hve Arrows at their Parting ; one of which 
wounded a Horfe fo, that it difabled him ,' and 
* U 4 we 



we left him the next Day, poor Creature, in 
great Need of a good Ferrier ,* we fuppofe they 
might fhoot more Arrows, which might fall 
fhortofusj but we faw no more Arrows or Tar- 
tars that Time. 

We travelled near a Month after this, the Ways 
being not fo bad as at firfi, tho' iliil in the Do- 
minions of the Emperor of China, but lay for the 
mofl Part in Villages ; fome of which were for- 
tified, becaufe of the Incurfions of the Tartars^ 
When we came to one of thefe Towns, (it was 
about two Days and a Half Journey before we 
were to come to the City Natim) I wanted to 
buy a Camel, of which there are Plenty to be 
fold all the VVay upon that Road, and of Horfes 
aifo, fuch as they are, becaufe fo many Caravans 
coming that Way, they are often wanted. The 
Perfon that I fpoke to, to get me a Camel, would 
have gone and fetchM it for me, but I, like a Fool, 
mufl be oiHcioLis, and go m.y felf along with him : 
The Place was about two Miles out of the Vil- 
lage, where, it feems, they kept the Camels and 
Horfes fcedmg under a Guard. 

I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot, being 
very delirous, forfooth, of a little Variety. When 
we came to the Place, it was a low marfhy 
Ground, wail'd round with a Stone-wall, piled 
up dry, without Mortar or Earth among it, like 
a Park, with a little Guard of Chwefe Soldiers 
at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and a- 
greed for the Price, I came away, and the Chinefe 
Man, that went with me, led the Camel -, when 
on a fudden came up five 'Tartars pn Horfe- 
back ; two of them feized the Fellow, and took 
the Camel from him, while the other three fteppM 
up to me ', and my old Pilot feeing us, as it were, 
unarm'd ; for I had no Weapon about me but my 

Sword, 



[ 197 ] 

Sword, which could but ill defend me againft 
three Horfe-men : The iirft that came up, ftopp'd 
ihort upon my drawing my Sword ; (for they are 
errant Cowards) but a fecond coming upon my 
Left, gave me a Blow on the Head, which I ne- 
ver felt till afterward, and wondered when I came 
to my felf, what was the Matter with me, and 
where I was, for he laid me flat on the Ground ; 
but my never failing old Pilot, the Portuguefe (fo 
Providence unlooked for direds Deliverances from 
Dangers, which to us are unforefeen) had a Piilol 
in his Pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the 
Tartars ; neither if they had, I fuppofe they would 
not have attacked us : Bat Cowards are always 
boldeft when there is no Danger. 

The old Man feeing me down, with a bold 
Heart ftepp'd up to the Fellow that had flruck 
me, and laid hold of his Arm with one Hand, 
and pulling him down by main Force a little to- 
wards him with the other, fhot him into the 
Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot. He then 
immediately ftepp'd up to him who had flopp'd us, 
as 1 faid, and before he could come forward a- 
gain, (for it was all done as it were in a Moment) 
made a Blow at him with a Semiter which he al- 
ways wore \ but miffing the Man, cut his Horfe 
into the Side of his Head, cut one of his Ears off 
by the Root, and a great Slice down the Side of 
his Face. The poor Bead; enraged with the Wound, 
was no more to be governed by his Rider, tho' the 
Fellow fat well enough too ^ but away he flew, 
and carried him quite out of the Pilot^'s Reach, 
and at fome Diftance rifing up upon his hind 
Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon 
him. 

In this Interval, the poor Chinefe came in, who 
had loft the Camel, but he had no Weapon ; how- 
ever. 



r 198 ] 

ever, feeing the Tartar down, and his Horfe hWm 
upon him, away he runs to him, and feizing upon 
an ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had by his Side, 
fomething like a Pole-axe, but not a Pole-axe nei- 
ther, he wrenched it from him, and made fhift 
to knock his Tartarian Brains out with it. But 
my old Man had the third Tartar to deal with 
ilill, and feeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor 
come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but 
ftand flock flill, the eld Man ftood flill too, and 
falls to work with his Tackle to charge his Piflol 
again : But as foon as the Tartar faw the Piflol, 
^vhether he fuppofed it to be the fame, or another, 
I know not, but away he fcow^ered, and left my 
Pilot, my Champion 1 cali'd him afterward, a com- 
pleat Vidrory. 

By this Time I was a little awake, for I thought: 
when firfl I began to wake, that I had been in 
a fweet Sleep ; but as I faid above, I wondered 
where I was, how I came upon the Ground, and 
what was the Matter. In a Word, a few Moments 
after, as Senfe returned, I felt Pain, tho' I did not 
know where ; I clapp'd my Hand to my Head, and 
took it away bloody; then I felt my Head ach, 
and then in another Moment, Memory returned, 
and every Thing was prtfent to me again. 

I jump'd up upon my Feet inflantly, and got 
hold of my Sword, but no Enemies in View. I 
found a Tartar \ic dead, and his Horfe ftanding very 
quietly by him ; ap,d locking farther, I faw my 
Champion and Deliverer, who had been to fee 
what the Chniefe had done, coming back with his 
Hanger m his Hand. The old Man feeing me on 
my Feet, came running to me, and embraced me 
with a great deal of Joy, being afraid before that 
I had been killed, and feeing me bloody, would 
fee how I was hurt -, but it was not much, only 

what 



C ^99 3 

what we call a broken Head, neither did I af- 
terwards find any great Inconvenience from the 
Blow, other than the Place which was hurt, and 
which was well again in two or three Days. 

We made no great Gain however by this Vi- 
(^ory, for we loft a Caqiel, and gained a Horfe^ 
but that which was remarkable, when we came 
back to the Village^ the Man demanded to be 
paid for the Camel • I diff)uted it, and it was 
brought to a hearing before the Chinefe Judge of 
the Place,* that is to fay, in EngUfh^ we went 
before a Juftice of the Peace : Give him his due, 
he afted with a great deal of Prudence and Im- 
partiality; and having heard both Sides, he 
gravely ask'd the Chinefe Man, that went with 
me to buy the Camel, whofe Servant he was ? 
I am no Servant, fays he, but went with the 
Stranger. At whofe Requeft, fays the Juftice > 
At the Stranger's Requeft, fays he. Why then, 
fays the Juftice, you were the Stranger's Ser- 
vant for the Time, and the Camel being de- 
liver'dtohis Servant, it was delivered to him, 
and he muft pay for it. 

I confefs the Thing was clear, that I had 
not a V/ord to fay ; but admiring to fee fuch juft 
Reafoning upon the Confequence, and fo accu- 
rate ftating the Cafe, I pay^'d willingly for the 
Camel, and fent for another; but you may ob- 
ferve, I fent for it, I did not go and fetch it my 
f^lf any more j I had enough of that. 

The City of Naum is a Frontier of the C/;/- 
iic-fe Empire; they call it fortified, and fo it is^ 
as Fortifications go there; for this I will venture 
to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathi,, 
which I believe, are fome Millions, could not 
batter down the Walls with their Bows and Ar- 
anvs : But to call it ftrong, if it were attacked 

with 



[ 300 ] 

with Cannon, would be to make thofe who uu- 
derfland it, laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have fald, above two Days 
Journey of this City, when McfTengers were fent 
Exprefs to every Part of the Road, to tell all 
Travellers and Carravans, to halt till they had a, 
Guard fent for them ; for that an unufual Body 
of Tartars, making ten thoufand in all, had ap- 
peared in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond 
the City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers ; how- 
ever, it was carefully done of the Governour, 
and we were very glad to hear we fhould have 
a Guard. Accordingly, two Days after, we had 
two hundred Soldiers lent us from a Garrifcn of 
the Chinefes, on our left, and three hundred more 
from the City of Naum, and with thofe we ad- 
vanced boldly. The three hundred Soldiers from 
Naum, march'd m our Front, the two hundred 
in our Rear, and our M^n on each Side of our 
Camels with our Baggage, and the whole Carra- 
van in the Center. In this Order, and well pre- 
pared for Battle, we thought our felves a Match 
for the whole ten thoufand A%2^/ Tartars, if they 
had appeared ,* but the next Day when they did 
appear, it was quite another thing. 
'It was early in the Morning, when^marching 
from a little well fituated Town call'd Changu, 
we had a River to pafs, where we were obliged 
to ferry ; and had the Tartars had any Intelli- 
gence, then had been the Time to have attacked 
us, when the Carravan being over, the Rear- 
Guard was behind ; but they did not appear. 

About three Hours after, when we were en- 
tered upon a Defart of about fifteen or fixteen 
Miles over, behold, by a Cloud of Duft they 
rais'd, we faw an Enemy was at Hand, and they 

v/cre 



[ 301 ] 

\vcre at Hand indeed^ for they came on upon the 
Spur. 

The Chinefes, our Guard on the Front, who 
had talk'd fo big the Day before, began to ftag.- 
ger, and the Soldiers frequently look'd behind 
them, which is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that 
he is juft ready to run away. My old Pilot was 
of my Mind, and being near me, he call'd out. 
Seignior Inglefe^ fays he, thofe Fellows muft be 
encourag'd, or they will ruin us all •, for if the 
Tartars come on, they will never (land it. I am 
of your Mind, faid /, but what Courfe muft be 
done ? Done ! fays he, let fifty of our Men ad- 
vance, and flank them on each Wing, and en- 
courage them, and they will fight like brave 
Fellows in brave Company -, but without, they 
will every Man turn his Back. Immediately I 
rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was 
exaftly of our Mind ; and accordingly, fifty of 
us march'd to the right Wing, and fifty to the 
left, and the reft made a Line cf Refcrvc ; and 
fo we march'd, leaving the laft two hundred 
Men to make another Body by themfelves, and 
to guard the Camels ; only that if need were, 
they fhould fend a hundred Men, to afiift the laft 
fifty. 

In a Word, the Tartars came on, and an in- 
numerable Company they were •, how many we 
could not tell, but ten Thoufand we thought 
was the leaft. A Party of them came on firft, 
and view'd our Pofture, traverfing the Ground 
in the Front of our Line* and as we found them 
within Gun (hot, our Leader ordered the two 
Wings to advance fwiftly, and give them a Sal- 
vo on each Wing with their Shot, which was 
done i but they went off, and I fuppofe back to 
give an Account of the Reception they were 

like 



[ 30i ] 

like to meet with : And indeed that Salute 
clogg'd their Stomach, for they immediateiy 
halted, flood a while to confider of it, and 
wheeling off to the left, they gave over the De- 
fign, and faid no more to us for that time i 
which was very agreeable toour Circumftances, 
which were but very indifferent for a Battle with 
fuch a Number. 

Two Days after this, we came to the City 
Naun, or Nauin ; we thank*d the Governour for 
his Care for us, and collefted to the Value of a 
hundred Crowns, or thereabouts, which we 
gave to the Soldiers fent to guard us i and here 
we refted one Day. This is a Garrifon indeed, 
and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept here 5 
but the Reafon of it was, that formerly the 
Mufcovite Frontiers lay nearer to them than they 
do now, the Mufco'vites having abandon'd that 
Part of the Country (which lies from this City 
Weft, for about two hundred Miles) as defo- 
lateand unfit for life •, and more efpecially, be- 
ing fo very remote, and fo difficult to fend 
Troops thither for its Defence ; for we had yet 
above two thoufand Miles to Mufcovy, properly 
fo caird. 

After this, we pafs*d feveral great Rivers, and 
two dreadful Defarts, one of which we werei^ 
Days paffing over, and which, as 1 faid, v/as to 
be C2ilMm Mans Land ; and on the 13th of ^- 
fril we came to the Frontiers of the Mufcovite Do- 
minions: I think the firfl: City or Town, or 
Fortrefs, whatever it might be cali'd, that be- 
long*d to the Czar of Mufcovy, was call'd Argun, 
being on the Weft Side of the River Argun, 

I could not butdifcover an infinite Satisfafti- 
on, that I was fo foon arrived in, as I call'd k^ 

a Chri» 



[ 303 1 

n Chrrffiian Country, or at leaft in a Country 
governed by Chriftians ; for tho' the Mufco'vitef 
do, in my Opinion, but ;uft defer vc the Name of 
Chriftians, yet fuch they pretend to be, and 
are very devout in their Way. It would eertain- 
iy occur to any Man vi^ho travels in the World 
as I have done, and who had any Power of Re- 
fle6i:ion; I fay, it would occur to him^ to re- 
fled what a BleiTing it is to be brought into 
the World, where the Name of God^, and of 
a Redeemer is known, worfhipp'd and ador'd j 
and not where the People given up by Hcavea 
to ftrong Delufions, worfhip the Devil^ and 
proftrate themfelves to Stocks and Stones, wor- 
fhip Monfters, Elements, horrible fliaped Ani- 
mals, and Statues, or Images of Monflcrs ; not 
a Town or City wepafs'd thro\ but had their 
Pagods, their Idols, and their Temples, and ig- 
norant People worftiiping, even the Works of 
their own Hands. 

Now we came where at leaft ^ a Face of the 
Chriftian Worfhip appeared, where the Knee 
was bow'd to Jefus-, and whether ignorantly or 
not, yet the Chriftian Religion was own'd, and 
the Name of the true God wascall'd upon, and 
adored ; and it made the very Receftes of my 
Soul rejoice to h-z it. I fainted the brave Sects 
Merchant 1 mentioned above, with' my iirfi: Ack- 
nowlegment of this-, and taking him by the 
Hand, 1^ faid to him, Blcflcd be God, vve are 
once again come among Chriftians. He fmiled, 
and anfwcred, do not rejoice too foon Country- 
man, thefe Mufcczfites are bnt an odd fort of Chri- 
ftians ; and but for the Name of ic, you may 
kc very little of the Subft-ance, for fome Monchs 
farther of our Journey. 

Well, fays I, but ftill 'tis better than Paganifm, 
and worlhipping of Devils. Why, I'll tell you^

[ 304 ] 

lays hCj except the Ruffian Soldiers in GarnTons, 
and a few of the Inhabitanrs of the Cities upon 
the Road, all the reft of this Country, for a- 
bove a thoufand Miles farther, is inhabited by 
the worft, and moll ignorant of Pagans ; and 
fo indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatcft Piece 
of folid Earth, if I underftand any Thing of the 
Surface of the "'lobe, that is to be found in any 
Part of the Earth -, we had at leaft twelve hun- 
dred Miles to the Sea, Eaftward ; we had at 
leaft two Thoufand to the Bottom of the Baltick 
Sea, Weftward ; and above three thoufand Miles, 
it we left that Sea, and went on Weft to the 
Britijh and French Channels : We had full five 
thoufand Miles to the Indian^ or Perfian Sea, 
South ; and about eight hundred Miles to the 
Frozen Sea, North: Nay, iffome People may 
be believed, there might be no Sea, North-Eaft, 
till we came round the Pole, and confecjuently 
into the North- Weft, and fo had a Continent of 
Land into America, the Lord knows where ; tho' 
I could give fome Reafons, why 1 believe that to 
be a Miftake. 

As we encer'd into the Mufcovite Dominions, 
a good while before we come to any confidera- 
ble Towns, we had nothing to obferve there 
but this ; iirft, that all the Rivers that run to 
the Eaft, as I underftood by the Charts, which 
fome in our Carravan had with them; it was 
plain, all thofe Rivers ran into the great River 
Tamour^ or Gaynmoiir : This River, by the natural 
Courfe of it muft run into the Eaft Sea, or Chi- 
nefeOcczn. The Story they tell us, that the 
Mouth of this River, is choak*d up with Bull- 
rufhes, of a monftrous Growth, (viz,.) three 
Fcoc about, and twenty or thirty Foot highr I 

muft 



[ 305 ] 



muft be allowed to fay, I believe nothing of ; but 
as its Navigation is of no UCq, becaufe there is 
no Trade that Way, the Tartars to whom alone 
it belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle ; fo no 
Body that ever I heard of^ has been curious enough, 
either to go down to the Mouth oi it in Boats, 
or come up from the Mouth of it in Ships ; but 
this is certain, that this River running due Eaft, 
in the Latitude of carries a vaft Con- 

courfe of Rivers along with it, and finds an Ocean 
to empty it felf in that Latitude. So we are fure 
of Sea there. 

Some Leagues to the North of this River, there 
are feveral confiderable Rivers, whofe Streams run 
asi^due North as the Tamour runs Eaft ; and thefe 
are all found to join their Waters with the great 
River Tartarus, named ofrom the Northernmoft 
Nations of the Mongul Tartars, who the Chinefe 
fay, were the firfl: Tartars in the World ; and 
who, as our Geographers alledge, arc the Gog 
and Magog mentioned in facred Story. 

Thefe Rivers running all Northward, as well 
as all the other Rivers, I am yet to fpeak of, make 
it evident, that the Northern Ocean bounds the 
Land alfo on that Side ; fo that it does not feem 
rational in the leaft to think, that the Land can 
extend it felf to join with America on that Side, or 
that there is not a Communication between the 
Northern and the Eaftern Ocean ; but of this I 
fhall fay no more; it was my Obfervation at that 
time, and therefore I take Notice of it in this Place. 
We now advanced from the River Arguna by eafy 
and moderate Journeys, and were very vifibly 
obliged to the Care the Czar o^ Mufcovy has taken 
to have Cities and Towns built in as many Places 
as are poflible to place them, where his Soldiers

diers plac'd by the Romans in the icmoteft Coun- 
tries of their Empire, feme of which 1 had read 
particularly were plac'd in Britain for the Security 
of Commerce, and for the lodging Travellers; 
and thus it was here-, for wherever we came, 
tho' at thefe Towns and Stations, the Garrifons 
and Governor \mzvc Ruffians^ and profcfs'd Chri- 
flians, yet the Inhabitants of tlie Country were 
xncre Paganss facrificing to Idols, and worlhipping 
the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all the Hod of Hea- 
ven, and not only io^ but were of all ih^ Heathens 
and Pagans that ever I met with, the moft barba- 
rous, except only that they did not eat Man's Flefh, 
as our Savages ofA?nerica did. 

Some Inftances of this we met with in the 
Country between Arguna, where we enter the Miif- 
ccvite Dominions, and a City of Tartars and Ruffians 
Together 5 caird Nortz-iuskoy, in which is a con- 
tinu'd Dcfart or Foreft, which cofl: us 20 Days to 
travel over it. In a Village near the laft of thofe 
Places I had thcCuriofity to go and fee their Way 
of Living, which is moft brutilh and unfufferable ^ 
they had 1 fiippofe a great Sacrifice that Day, for 
there flood out upon an old Stump of a Trre, an I- 
dol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at leaft 
asanyThingwecanthinkoftoreprefenttheDeviJ, 
can be made •, k had a Head certainly not fo much 
as refembling any Creature that the World ever 
faWi Ears as big as Goats Horns, and ^s high ^ 
Eyes as big as a Crown- Piece ; a Nofe like a crook- 
ed Ram's Horn, and a Mouth extended four cor- 
ner 'd like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, 
hooked like a Parrot's under Bill; it v/as drefled up 
in the filthieft Manner that you could fuppofe -, hs 
upper Garment was of Sheep- Skins, with the 
Wool outwardj a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head, 

with 



[507] 

with two Horns growing through it •, it was a- 
boiit eight Foot high, yet had no Feet or Legs, or 
any other Proporcion of Parts. 

This Scare- crow was fct up at the ottrer Side ot 
the Village, and when I came near to it, there 
was I <5 or 17 Creatures, whether Men or Wo- 
men, I could nor tell, for they make no Diftin- 
6tion by their Habits, either of Body or Head* 
Thefe lay all flat on the Ground^ round this for- 
midable Block of ihapelefs Wood : I faw no 
Motion among them any more, than if they 
had been all Logs of Wood like the Idol, and 
at firit, really thought they had been fo^ but 
when I came a little nearer, they darted up up- 
on their Feet, and rais'd a howling Cry, as if it 
had been fo many deep-mouth'd Hounds, and 
walk'dawayas if they were difpleas'd atourdi- 
fturbing them. A little Way off from the Idol, 
and at the Door of that Tent or Hutc, made all 
of Sheep-Skins and Covv-Skins, dry'd, flood 
three Butchers •, I thought they were fuch when 
I came nearer to them, I found they had long 
Knives in their Hands, and in the middle of the 
Tent appear'd three Sheep kili'd, and one young 
Bullock or Steer. Thefe, it feems, were Sacri- 
fices to that fenOefs Log of an Idol, and thefe 
three Men, Priefts belonging to ic^ and the 17 
proftrated Wretches, were the People who 
brought the Offering, and were making their 
Prayers to that Stock. 

I confefs 1 was more mov'd at their Stupidity 
and brutiOi Worfhip of a Hobgoblin, than ever 
i was at any Thing in my Life'^ to fee God's 
nlofi: glorious and beft Creature, to whom he 
had granted fo many Advantages, evenl?y Creation,

honour his Maker, and be honoured by him, 
funk and degenerated to a Degree fo more than 
ftupid, as to proftrate itfelf to a frightful No- 
thing, a meer imaginary Ob)ed drcls'd up by 
themfclves, and made terrible to themfclves by 
their own Contrivance ; adorn'd only with Clouts 
and Rags •, and that this (hould be the EfFeft of

. But what fignityd all the Aftonifhment and 
Refleaion of Thoughts •, thus it was, and 1 faw 
it before my Eyes, and there was no room to 
wonder at it, or think it impoffible-, all my Ad- 
miration turn'd to Rage, and I rid up to the I- 
mage, or Monfter, call it what you will, and with 
my Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head in 
two in the Middle, lo that it hung down by one 
of the Horns ^ and one of our Men that was with 
me took hold of the Sheep-Skin that cover'd it, 
and pnird at it, when behold a moft hideous 
Outcry and Howling run thro' the Village, and 
two or three hundred People came about my Ears, 
fo that 1 was glad to fcour for it ^ for we fiw 
fomc had Bows and Arrows^ but 1 refolved from 
that Moment to vifit them again.

Defign in Execution : I communicated my Projed 
to the Scots Merchant of M/v^oiu, of whofe Courage 
I had had fuiEcient Teftimony, as above. I 
told him what I had feen, and with what Indig- 
nation I had fince thought that human Nature 
could be fo degenerate : I told him, I was refolv'd. 
if I could but get four or five Men well arm'd to" 
go with me, I was refolvM to go and deflroy that 
vile, abominable Idol, and let them fee that it had^ 
no Power to help itfdfy and confequently could 
not be an Objed of VVorOiip, or to be pray'd to, 
much lefs help them that offered Sacrifices to it- 
He laugh'd at me ; Jays he. Your Zeal may be 
good, but what do you propofe to yourfelf by 
it? Propofe faid I, to vindicate the Honour, of 
God, which is infulted by this Devil VVorfliip. But 
how will it vindicate the Honour o^ God, /aid he? 
while the People will not be able to know what 
you mean by it, unlefs you could fpeak to^ them 
and tell them (o, and then they will light you, and 
beat you too^ I'll aiture you, for they are defpe- 
rate Fellows, and that efpecially in Defence of 
their Idolatry. Can we not, faid I, do it in the 
Night, and then leave them the Reafons and Caufes 
in Writing in their own Language ? Writing 1 faid

them that know any thing of a Letter, or how to 
read a Word in any Language, or in their own. 
Wretched Ignorant! faid I to him,* however I,

draw Inferences from it to them, to let them fee 
how brutifh they are, to worfhip fuch horrid 
Things. Look you. Sir, faid he, ' if your Zeal

plain, and demand Satisfaction ; and if he cannot 
give them Satisfadion, 'tis ten to one but they 
revolt; and will occafion a new War with all the 
T^r^^zr J in the Country. 

This, I confefs, put new Thoughts into my 
Head for a while i but I harp'd upon' the fame 
String ftill, and all that Day I was uneafy to put 
my Pi'Ojed in Execution. Towards the Evening the 
Scots Merchant met me by Accident in our Walk 
about the Town, and deiir'd to fpeak with me; 
I believe faid he, I have put you oft" of your good 
Delign: I have been a little concern^ about it 
iince, for I abhor the Idol and the Idolatry as 
much as you can do : Truly, fays /, you have put 
it off a little as to the Execution of it, but you 
have not put it all out of my Thoughts, and I 
believe I ftiall do it fHll before I quit this Place, 
the' I were to be delivered up to them for Satif- 
faction. No, no, fays hey God forbid they fhould 
ideliver you up to fuch a Crew of Monfters ; they 
Ihall not do that neither, that would be murdering 
you indeed. Why, fays I, how would they ufe me ? 
Ufeyou! fays he; Til teli you how they ferv'd a 
^00^ Rujft an, who affronted them in their Wor- 
Ihipjuftas you did^ and who they took Prifoner ; 
after they had lam'd him with an Arrow that he 
could not run away, they took him and flrippM 
him flark naked, and fet him up on the top of the 
Idol Monfler, and flood all round him, and fhot 
as many Arrov/s into him as would flick over 
his whole Body, and then they burnt him and all 
the ArrowsJfticking in him as a Sacrifice to the 
idol. And was this the fame Idol .^ Yes, fays he, 
the very fame. Well, fays I, V\\ tell you a Story ; 
fp I related the Story of our Men at Madagafcar, 
'" '■• '' ■-.-•. and 



and how they burnt and fack'd the Village there^ 
and kiird Man, Woman and Child, for their mur' 
dering one of our Men, juft as it is related before ; 
and when I had done, I added, that I thought 
we ought to do fo to this Village. 

He liftenM very attentively to the Story ; but 
when I talk'd of doing fo to that Village, fays he. 
You miftake very much, it was not this Village, 
it was aimoil a hundred Mile from this Place, but 
it was the fame Idol, for they carry him about in. 
ProcefFion all over the Country : Well, then, fays 
I, then that Idol ought to be punifli'dfor it, and 
itfhall, fays I, if I live this Night out. 

In a Word, finding me refolute, he lik'd the 
Defign, and told me I fliould not go alone, but 
he would go with me, and bring a flout Fellow, 
one of his Countrymen, to go alfo with us ; and 
one, fays he, as fimous for his Zeal at you can 
defire any one to be, againft fuch Devilifh things 
as thefe. In a Word, he brought me his Comrade, 
a ScctsM:in, whom he cali'dCaptainjR/cto'^;^, and 
I gave him a full Account of what 1 had feen ,* and 
in a Word, of what I intended ,* and he told me 
readily, he would go with me if it cofl him his 
Life ; fo we agreed to go only us three. I had 
indeed propos a it to my Partner, but he declined 
it; he faid, he was ready to afTift me to the ut- 
mod, and upon all Occafions for my Defence ; butr 
that this was an Adventure quite out of his Way; 
fo, I fay, we refolv'd upon our Work only us 
three and my Man-Servant, and to put it in Exe- 
cution that Night about Midnight, with all the 
Stcrefy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond Thoughts, we were 
willing to delay it till the next Night, becaufc 
the Carravan being to fet forv/ard in the Morning, 
Ve fuppos'd the Governour could not pretend 

X 4 to 



to give them any Satisfadion upon us, when we 
were out of his Power. The Scots Merchant, as 
fleady in his Refolution for the Enterpnze, as 
bold m executing, brohght me a T'anar's Robe or 
Gown of the Sheep- Skins, and a Bornet, with 
a Bow and^Arrows, and had provided the fame 
for h mfclf and his Countryman, that the People, 
if they faw us, fhonld not be able to determine 
who we were. 

All the firfl Night we fpent in mixing up fomc 
ComDuftible Matter with Aqua-vitse, Gun-powder, 
and fuch other Materials as we could get ; and ha- 
ving a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, a- 
bout an Hour after Night we fet out upon oui: 
Expedition. 

We came to the Place about eleven a Clock at 
NJLght, and found that the People had not the leail: 
Jeaioufy of Danger attending their Idol : The 
Night was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light 
enough to fee that the Idol flood jufi: in the fame 
Pofture and Place that it did before. The People 
feemed to be all at their Reff, only, that in the 
great Hutt, or Tent, as we caiiM it, where we 
faw the three Priefrs, whom we miflook tor Butch- 
ers, we faw a Light, and going up clofe to the 
Door, "we heard People talking, as if there were 
five or fix of them. We concluded therefore, that if 
we icz the Wiid-fire to the Idol, thefe Men would 
come out immediately, and run up to the Place to 
refcue it from the Deftrudion that we intended for 
it, and what to do with them we knew not. Once 
we thought^of carrying it away, and fecring Fire 
to it at a Diflance ,• but when we came to handle 
ir, we found it too bulky for our Carriage, fo we 
were at a Lofs again. The fecond Scots Man was 
for fecting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, and knocking 
the Creatures that were there on the Head when 



[?!?] 



they came out ; but I could not joyn with that ; 
I was againft killing them, if it was poilible to be 
avoided: Well then, faid the -5ro^j Merchant, Yi\ 
tell you what we will do, we will try to take them 
Prifoners, tye their Hands behind them, and 
make them ftand ftiil, and fee their Idol de- 
ftroy'd. 

As it happened, we had Twine or Packthread 
enough about us, which was ufed to tye our Fire- 
Works together with ; fo we rcfolv'd to attack 
the People firfl, and with as little Noife as we 
could. The firfl Thing we did, we knocked at 
the Door, which ifllied jufl: as we delired it ; for 
one of their Idol Priefls came to the Door : We 
immediately feized upon him, ftopp'd his Mouth, 
and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to 
the Idol, where we g^gg'd him, that he might 
not make a Noife j tyM his Feetalfo togetheij^- 
and left him on the Ground. 

Two of us then waited at the Door, expeding 
that another would come out to fee what the 
Matter was ; but we waited fo long 'till the third 
Man came back to us ; and then no Body coming 
out, we knock 'd again gently, and immediately out 
came two more, and we ferved them jud inthe fame 
Manner, but v/ere obliged to go all with them, 
and lay them down by the Idol fome Diftance 
from one another : When going back, we found 
two more were come out to the Door, and a 
third flood between them within the Door : We 
fciz'd the two, and immediately ty'd them, when 
the third flepping back, and crying out, my 
Scots Merchant went in after him', and taking 
out a Compofition we had made, that would on^- 
ly fmoke and flink, he fet Fire to it, and threw 
it in among them. By that Time the other Scots 
Man and my Man taking Charge of the "tx^^o 

Men 



Men who were already bound, and ty'd together 
alfo by the Arm, Jed them away to the Idol, and 
left them there, to fee if their Idol would ..relieve 
them, making Hafte back to us. 

When the Fuze we had throw^n in had fill'd the 
Hutt with fo much Smoke, that they were almoft 
fuffocated, we then threw in a fmall Leather Bag 
of another Kind, which flam'd like a Candle, 
and following it in, we found there was but four 
People left, who, it feems, were two Men and 
two Women; and, as we fuppofed, had been 
^bout fome oi their Diabolick Sacrifices : They 
appeared, in fliort, frighted to Death, at leaftfo 
as to fit trembling and flupid, and not able to 
fpeak neither, for the Smoke. 

In a Word, wc took them, bound them as we 
had the other, and all without any Noife : I 
ftould have faid, we brought them out of the 
Hpufe or Hutt firfl; for indeed we were not able 
to bear the Smoke any m.ore than they were. When 
we had done this, we carry'd them altogether to 
the ^ Idol. When we came there, we fell to 
work with him j and firfl we daub'd him all over, 
^nd his Robes alfo, with Tar and fuch other Stuff 
as we had, which was Tallow mixM with Brim- 
ilone ; then weflopp'd his Eyes, Ears, and Mouth, 
full of Gun-Powder, and then we wrapp'd up a 
great Piece of Wild-fire in his Bonnet, and then 
flicking all the Combuflibles we had brought with 
us upon him, \vq look'd about to fee if we could 
iind any Thing elfe to help to burn him, when 
my Man remembred, that by the Tent or Hutt 
where the Men were, there lay a Heap of dry 
Forage, whether Straw or Rufhes I do not re- 
member j away he and one of the Sects Men run, 
and fetch'd their Arms full of that. When we had 
^one this, we took all our Prifoners, and brought 

them. 



[ 315 ] 

them, having unty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their 
Mouths, and made them ftand up, and fet them 
JLift before their monftrous Idol, and then fet Fire 
to the whole. 

We ftay'd by it a Qiiarterof an Hour, or therea- 
bouts, till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and 
Ears of the Idol blew up, and we could perceive 
had iplir and deformed the Shape ; and in a Word, 
'till we faw it burn into a meer Block or Log of 
Wood ; and then fett ipg the dry Forage to it, we 
found it would be quite confumed, when we be- 
gan to think of going away 2 But the Scots maa 
laid no, we muft not go, for thefe poor deluded 
Wretches will all throw themfelves into the Firc^ 
and burn themfelves with the Idol. So we refol- 
ved to ilay 'till the Forage was burnt down too, 
and then we came away and left them. 

In the Moming we appeared among our Fellow 
Travellers exceeding bufy, in getting ready for our 
journey ,• nor could any Man fuggeft that we had 
been any where but in our Beds, as Travellers 
might be fuppofed to be, to fit themfelves for the 
Fatigue of that Day's Journey. 

But it did not end fo. The next Day came a 
great Multitude of the Country People, not only 
of this Village, but of a hundred more, for ought 
I know, to the Town-Gates, and in a mofl; out- 
rageous Manner, demanded Satisfadion of the Ruf" 
fan Governour, for the infulting their Priefts, 
and burning their great Cham-Chi-T'haimgUy fuch a 
hard Name they gave the monftrous Creature they 
worfhipped. The People of Nertfinskayy were at 
firft in a great Confternation, for they faid, the 
Tartars were no lefs than thirty thoufand, and that 
m 2l few 'Days more, would be one hundred thou- 
fand ftrong, 

Jhe 



The Ruffian Governor fent out Meflfengers to 
appeafe them, and gave them all the good Words 
imaginable. He allured them, he knew nothing 
oF it, and that there had not a Soul of his Garri- 
fori been abroad ; that it could not be from any 
Body there i and \i they would let him know who 
it was, they (houid be examplarily punifhed. They 
returned haughtily, that all the Country reveren- 
ced the great Cham-Chi-T'haungu, who dwelt in 
i\ic Sr.n, and no Mortal would have decreed to of- 
fer Violence to his Image, but fome Chriftian Mif- 
creant, fo they call'd them itfeemsi and they there- 
fore denounced War againfl: him, ^ and all the Ruf- 
fians^ who, they faid, were Mifcreants and Chri- 
Hians. 

The Governor flill patient, and unwilling to 
make a Breach, or to have any Caufe of War al- 
ledged to be given by him, the Czar having flrid- 
ly charged them to treat the conquered Country 
with Gentienefs and Civility, gave them flill all 
the good Words he could : At laft he told them, 
there was a Caravan gone towards Ruffia that Mor- 
ning, and perhaps it was fome of them, who had 
done them this Injury ; and that if they would be 
fatisHed with that, he would fend after them, to 
enquire into it. This feemed to appeafe them a 
little i and accordingly the Governor fent after 
us, ^nd gave us a particular Account how the 
Thing was, intimating withal, that i^ any in our 
Caravan had done it, they fliould make their E- 
Icape ^ but that whether they had done it or no, 
we fiiould make all the Hafle forward that was 
pofTible ; and that in the mean time, he would 
keep them in Play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the Governor : How- 
ever, when it came to the Caravan, there was no 

Body 



Body knew any Thing oF the Matter. And as 
for us, that were guilty, we were the lead of all 
fufpeded j none fo much as asked us the Qiier 
ftion. However the Captain of the Caravan for 
the Time, took the Hmt, that the Governor gave 
us, and we marched or travelled two Days and 
two Nights, without any confiderable Stop ,* and 
then we lay at a Village called Plothus ; nor did we 
make any long Stop here, but haitned on towards 
Jarawem, another of the Czar of Mufcovy's Co- 
lonies, and where we expeded we fhould be fafe ; 
but it is to be obferved, that here we began for 
two or three Days March, to enter upon the 
vaft namelefs Defart, of which I Ihall fay more 
in its Place : And which, if we had now been 
upon it, it is more than probable we had been 
all deftroyed. It was the fecond Day's March 
from Plothus^ that by the Clouds of Duft behind 
us, at a great Di/lance, fome of our People be- 
gan to be fenfible we were purfued . We had en- 
tered the Defart, and had pafled by a great Lake 
called, Schaks-OjeVy when we perceived a very great 
Body of Horfe appear on the other Side of the 
Lake to the North, we travelling Weft. V/e ob- 
ferved they went away Weft as we did, but 
had fuppofed we would have taken that Side of 
the Lake, whereas, we very happily took the 
South Side ; and in two Days more, we faw 
them not, for they believing we were ftill be- 
fore them, puftied on till they came to the River 
Udda. This is a very great River when it paf- 
fcs farther North ; but where we came to it, we 
found it narrow, and fordable. 

The third Day they either found their Mi- 
ftake, or had Intelligence of us, and came pou- 
ring in upon us, towards the Dusk of the Even- 



C 3iM 

ing : We had, to our great Satisfaction, jufl pitch'd 
upon a Place for our Camp, which was very 
convenient for the Night ,• for as we were up- 
on a Defart, tho' but at the Beginning of it, 
that was above Rvq hundred Miles over, we had 
no Towns to lodge at, and indeed expeded 
none but the City Jarawena, which we had yet 
two Days March to ; the Defart, however, had 
feme few Woods in it on this Side, and little 
Rivers, which ran all into the great River Udda. 
It was in a narrow Strait between two little, but 
very thick Woods, that we pitch'd our little 
Camp for that Night, expeding to be attack'd 
in the Night. 

No Body knew but our felves, what we were 
purfued for ; but as it was ufual for the Mongul 
"tartars to go about in Troops in that Defart, fo 
the Caravans always fortify themfelves every 
Night againft them, as againfl Armies cf Rob- 
bers ; and it was therefore no new Thing to be 
purfued. 

But vve had this Night, of all the Nights of 
our Travels, a mofl advantageous Camp ; for 
we lay between two Woods, with a little Rivu- 
let running juft before our Front; fo that we 
could not be furrounded, or attack'd any Way, 
but in our Front or Rear : We took Care alfo 
to make our Front as flrong as we could, by 
placing our Packs, with our Camels and Horfes, 
all in a Line on the Inlide of the River, and fel- 
ling fome Trees m our Rear. 

In this Pofture we encamp'd for the Night, 
but the Enemy was upon ws before we had ^'' 
nifli'd our Situation : They did not come on us like 
Thieves, as we expected, but fent three Meilen- 
gers to us, to demand the Men to be delivered to 
them, that had abus'd their Priefcs, and burnt 

their 



[ 3'9 ] 

^heir God, Cham-Chi-Thamgu with Fire, that 
^hey might burn them with Fire; and upon 
J^his, they /aid they would go away, and do us 
no farther Harm ,* otherwife, they would burn 
us all with Fire. Our Men look'd very blank 
at this Meifage, and began to flare at one ano- 
ther, to fee who look'd with moft Guilt in their 
Faces \ but no Body was the Word, no Body did 
it. The Leader of the Caravan fent Word, he 
was well aflur'd, it was not done by any of our 
Campi that we were peaceable Merchants, tra- 
velling on our Bufinefs ; that we had done no Harm 
to them, or to any one elfe j and that therefore, 
they muft look farther for their Enemies who had 
injur'd them, for we were not the People i fo de- 
fir'd them not to difturb usi for, if they did, we 
ftould defend our felves. 

They were far from being fatisfy'd with this: 
for an Anfwer, but a great Crowd of them came 
down in the Morning by Break of Day to our 
Camp ; but feeing us in fuch an unnaccountable 
Situation, they durft come no farther than the 
Brook in our Front, where they fiood and fhew'd 
us fuch a Number, that indeed terrify 'd us very 
much-, for thofe that fpoke leaft of them, fpoke 
of ten thoufand: Here they flood and look'd 
at us a while, and then fetting up a great Howl, 
they let fly a Crowd of Arrows among us ; bur 
we were well enough fortify 'd for that ,* for we 
llielter'd under our Baggage ; and I do not remem- 
ber, that one Man of us was hurt. 

Some Time after this we faw them move a little 
to our Right, and expeded thegi on the Rear, 
when a cunning Fellow, a Coffack, as they call them, 
oijarawena, in the Pay of the Mufccvites, calling 
to the Leader of the Caravan, faid to him, Til go 
fend all thefe People away to Sibeilka ; this was 

a Ci- 



[ 32-0 ] 

a City, four or five Days Journey at leafl: to the 
South, and rather behind us : So he takes his 
Bow and Arrows, and getting on Horfe-back, he 
rides away from o.ur Rear direftly, as it were 
back to Nertijinskay. After this, he takes a great 
Circuit about, and comes to the Army of the 
Tartars, as if he had been fent Exprefs to tell 
them a long Sroryi that the People who had 
burnt the Cham-Chi-'Thaungu, were gone to Siheilka, 
with a Caravan of Mifcreants, as he call'd them, 
that is to fay, Chriftians ; and that they had re- 
folv'd to burn the God Schal-Ifary belonging to the 
Tofiguefes. 

As this Fellow was himfelf a meer T^r/^r, and 
perfectly fpoke their Language, he counterfeited 
fo well, that they all took it from him, and 
away they drove in a moil violent Hurry to 
Siheilka, which it feems was five Days Journey 
to the North, and in lefs than three Hours, they 
were entirely out of our Sight, and we never 
heard any more of them ; and we never knew 
whether they v/ent to that other Place called Si- 
hei/ka, or no. 

So we pafs'd fafely on to the City of Jarazvenay 
where there was a Garrifon of Mufcovites, and 
there we refted Evt Days, the Caravan being ex- 
ceedingly facigu'd with the lafl Day's hard March, 
and with Want of Reft in the Night. 

From this City we had a frightful Defart, 
wh.'ch held us three and twenty Days March. 
We furnifh'd our felves with fome Tents here, 
for the better accommodating our felves in the 
Night; and the Leader of the Caravan, procu- 
red fixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Coun- 
try, for carrying our Water and Provifions, and 
thefe Carriages were our Defence every Night 
round our little Campi fo that had the Tartars 

appeared, 



[ 3^1 ] 

appeared, iiniefs they had been very numerous 
indeed, they would not have been able to hurt 
us. 

We may well be fuppofed to want P<eft again 
after this long Journey ; for in this Dciart we faW 
abimdance of the Sable-Hunters, ss they call'd 
them. Thefeare MTartars g( the Mirzmllartaryy 
of which this Country is a Part, and they fre- 
quently attack fmall Caravans, but we law no 
Numbers of tliem together. 1 was curious to fee 
the Sable Skins they catched, bat could never 
(peak withany of them^for they durft not come 
near us, neither durft we ftraggle from our Com- 
pany, to go near them. 

After we had pafs'd this Defart we came into a 
Country pretty well inhabited •> that is to fay, 
we found Towns and Caftles, fettled by the 
Czar of Mufcovy^ with Garrilons of Stationary 
Soldiers to proteft the Caravans, and defend the 
Country againft the T'artarsy who would other- 
wife make it very dangerous travelling; and his 
Cz,arijh Majefly has given fuch ftrift Orders for 
the well guarding the Caravans and Merchants, 
that if there are any I'artars heard of in the 
Country, Detachments of the Garrifons are al- 
ways fent to fee the Travellers fafe from Station 
to Station. 

And thus the Governour oi Admskojy whom I 
had Opportunity to make a Vifitto,^ by means 
of the 6'co^j Merchant who was acquainted with 
him, offer'd us a Guard of 50 Men, if we thought 
there was any Danger, to the next Station. 

1 thought long before this, that as we came 
nearer to Europe we (hould find the Conntry bet- 
ter peopled, and the People more civiliz'd, but I 
found mvfelfmiftaken in both, for we had yetthe 

Part II. Y Na- 



Nation of thcTonguefes 10 pafs througfi > where wd" 
faw the fame Tokens of l^aganifm and Barbarity, 
or worfej'than befoie, only as they were conq'ier'J 
by the Mufccojitei, and entirely rcduc'd, they were 
not ib dangerous i but for Rudenefs ot:' Manners_^ 
Idolatry, and Multithcifm no People in iheWorld 
ever went beyond them. They are cloth'd all ia 
Skins of Beads, and their Houfes are built of the 
fame. You know not a Man from a Woman^ nei. 
ther by the Ruggalnefs of their Countenances or 
their Clothes •, and in the Winter, when the 
Ground is cover'd with Snow, they live under 
Ground in Houfes like Vaults, which have Ca- 
yities going from one to another. 

If tht Tartars had ihdt Cham-Chi-Tongu for a 
,who!e Village or Country^tbcle had Idols in eve- 
ry Hutt, and in every Cave ^ befides, they wor- 
iliip the Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and 
an a Word, every Thing that they do not under- 
il-and, and they undcriland but very little ; fo 
that almoft every Element, every uncommcn 
iThing, lets them a facrificing. 

But I am no more to dcicribc People than 
Countries, any farther than my own Story comes 
to be concerned in them. I met with nothing pe- 
culiar to myfelf in this Country, which I reckon 
was from the Defart which I fpoke of lad, at leaff 
400 Miles, halfof it being another Defart, whicb 
took us up 12 Days fevcre travelling, without 
HoL]fe,or 1 rce, or Bulh, but were obi igd agair^ 
to cany our own Proviiions, as well Water as 
Bread. After we were out of this Defart, and' 
had traveird two Days^ we came to 'Ja}uz.ayy :jl 
Mufcovite Cirv or Station, on the great River Jane- 
z>ay : This River they told us parted Europe Worn 
Afiuy tho' our Map-makers, as I am told, do not 
agree to it ^ however, it is ceicainly the Eaftern 

Boun- 



[ 3^3 1 

boundary of the ancient Siberia^ which now 
makes up a Province only of the vaft Mufcovite 
Empire, but is ic(elf equal m Bignefs to the 
whole Empire of Germany, 

And ycc here I obferv'd Ignorance and Pagan- 
i(m ftill prev-iird, except In the Mufcovite Garri- 
lons ; all the Country between Lhe River Oby and 
thGK\VQxJatie2.ay is as entirely Pagattj and the 
People as barbarous, as the remoceii- o(thc7artarsy 
nay, as any Nation, for ought I know, in AJia or 
America. I alfo found, which 1 oblerv'd to the 
M(/co'z;?>^ Governors, whom I had Opportunity to 
converfe with, that the poor Pagans are not much 
the wifer or the nearer Chriftianity for being un- 
der the Mufcovite Government ; which they ack- 
nowledge was true enough ; but, as they faid, 
was none of their Bufinefs : That if the Czarex- 
pe61:ed to convert his Siberian, or longuefe, or Tartar 
Subjefts, it ihould be done by fending Clergymen 
among them, not Soldiers i and they added, with 
mote Sincerity than I expeded, that they found 
it was not fo much the Concern of their Mo- 
narch to make the People Chriftians^ as it was to 
make them SubjetSis. 

From this River to the greatRiver Oby, we crofs'd 
a wild and uncultivated Country. I cannot fay 'tis 
a barren Soil ^ 'cis only barren of People, and good 
Management, otherwife it is in itfelf a moft plea- 
fant, fruitful and agreeable Country. What In- 
habitants we found in u are ailPagans,except fuch 
as are fent among them (vomRuffia; for this is th« 
Country 1 mean on both Sides the River Oby^ 
whither the Mufcovite Criminals^ that are not put 
to Death, are banilh'd, and 'from whence it is 
next to impoflible they fnould ever come away. 

I have nothing material to fay of my partjcu- 

iar Affairs, till I came to T'obohki, the capital City 

Y 2 of 



C 3M ] 

of Siberia, where 1 continued fome time on the foF 
lowing Occaiion. 

We had been now almoft feven Months on ou? 
Journey, and Winter began to come on apace ; 
whereupon my Partner and I called a Council a- 
bout our particular Affairs, in which we found if 
proper, confiderin^'^ that we were bound for Eng^ 
land, and not for Mufcow, to confider how to dif- 
pofe Oi our felves. They lo'.d us of Sledges and 
Kane Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Win- 
ter time ; and indeed they have fuch Things, that 
it w^ould be incredible to relate the Particulars oFy 
by which Means the Ruffians travel more in the 
Winter than they can in Summer, becaufe in thefe 
Sledges they are able to run all Night and Daj/ ; 
the Snow being frozen, is one univerfal Covering to- 
Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the Ri- 
vers, the Lakes, all are fmooth, and hard as a 
Stone, and they run upon the Surface, without 
any Regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no Occafion to pufh at a Winter Jour- 
iiey of this Kind. I was bound to England, not 
to MujcQ'c^, and my Rout lay two Ways, either I 
muft go on as the Caravan went, till I came to 
^eroflavj, and then go off Well for Narva, and 
the Gulph of Finland ; and fo either by Sea or 
Land to Dantz^ick, where I might poffibly fell my 
China Cargo to good Advantage, or I mud leave 
the Caravan at a little Town on the Divina, from 
Ax^hence I had but fix Days by Water to Arch- An- 
gely and from thence might be fure of Shipping, 
either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. 

Now to go any of thefe Journeys m the Winter,. 
would ha' been prcpofterous ; for as to Dantzicky 
the Baltick would be frOijen up, and I cou\d nor get 
Paffage, and to go by Land in thofe Countries^ 
was far lefs Mq than among the Mongul Tartars % 

Like- 



i^kewife to go to Arch-Angel in OBober^ all the 
Ships would be gone from thence, and even the 
Merchants who dwell there in Summer, retire 
South to Miifcow in the Winter, when the Ships 
are gone ; fo that I fhould have nothing but Ex- 
tremity of Cold to encounter; with a Scarcity of 
Provi(ionS, and mufi: Jye there in an empty Town 
all the Wiiiter. So that upon the whole I thought 
it a much better Way to let the Caravan go, and 
to make Provifion to winter where I was, 'viz>, 
:\t T^obolski in Sileria^ in the Latitude of De- 
grees, where I was fure of three Things to wear 
out a cold Winter v/ith, %n'i^. Plenty of Provi- 
fion fuch as the Country afforded ; a warm Houfe, 
with Fuel enough, and excellent Company j of 
all which I fiiall give a full Account in its Place. 

I was now in a quite difterent Climate from my 
fceloved Illand, where I never felt Cold except when 
I had my Ague. On the contrary, I had much 
to do to bear my Clothes on my Back, and never 
made any Fire but without Doors, and for my 
NecefTity in drefling my Food, &c. Now I made 
me three good Veils, with large Robes or Gowns 
pver them to hang down to the Feet, and button 
clofe to the Wrefts, 'and all thefe lin'd with Furs 
to make them fufficiently warm. 

As to a warm Houfc, 1 muft confefs I greatly di- 
{liked our Way in EKgumd of making Fires in e- 
Very Room in the Houfe, in open Chimneys, 
which when the Fire was out, always kept the 
Air in the Room cold as the Climate : But taking 
an Apartment in a good Houfe in the Town, I 
ordered a Chimney to be buik like a Furnace, in 
the Center of fix feveral Rooms, like a Stove, the 
Funnel to carry the Smoke went up one Way, the 
poor to come at the Fire, went in another, and 
. Y 3 ' a« 



[ 3i<^] 

all the Rooms were kept equally warm, but no 
Fire feen ; juft as they heat the Bagnioes in Eng- 
land. 

By this Means we had always the fame Climate 
in all the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preferv'd ; 
and how cold foever it was without, it was al- 
ways warm within, and yet we faw no Fire, nor 
was incommoded with any Smoke. 

The mofl wonderful Thing of all was, that it 
fhould be poflible to meet with good Company 
here, in a Country fo barbarous as that oF the 
moft Northerly Parts of Europe^ near the frozen^ 
Ocean, and within but a very few Degrees of 
'^Qva Zemblii. 

■ But this being the Country where the State Cri- 
minals of Mufcovy, as I obferved before, are all ba- 
nifhed this City, was full of Noblemen, Princes, 
Gentlemen, Colonels ; and in fhort, all Degrees of 
the Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery and Courtiers of 
Mifco'uy. Here vvas the famous Prince GallUz>eny 
the old General RoboftiskJ, and feveral other Per- 
fons of Note, and fome Ladies. 

By Means o'^my Scots Merchant, whom neverrhe- 
lefs I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance 
here with feveral of thefe Gentlem.en, and fome of 
them of the firft Rank i and from thefe in the long 
Winter Nights in which I flay'd here, I received 
feveral very agreeable Vifits. It was talking one 

Night with Prince - - one of the banifhed 

Miniflers of Stare, belonging to the Czar ci Muf- 
ccvy, that my Talk of my particular Cafe began. 
He had been telling me Abundance of fine Things 
of the Greatnefs, the Magnificence, the Domi^ 
nions, and tha abfolute Power of the Emperor of 
the Rii[pans, ^ I interrupted him, and told him 1 
xvas a greater and more powerful Prince than c- 
vcr the Czar oi Mufcovy was, tho' my Dominions 
V- . . '■ ^ were 



[3^7] 



were not fo large, or my People To many. The 
Mufftan Grandee look'd a little furpriz'd, and fixing 
his Eyes fteddily upon me, began to wonder what 
I meant. 

I told him, his Wonder would ceafe when I had 
explained my felf. Firft, I told him^ I had the ab- 
foiute Difpofal oF the hw^s and Fortunes oF all 
my Subjeds : That notwithftanding my abfokite 
Power, I had not one Perfon difaffeiSted to my 
Goveriiment, or to my Perfon, in all my Domi- 
nions. He fhook' his Head at that, and faid, 
there indeed I outdid the Czar of Mufcovy. I told 
hinty That all the Lands in my Kingdcm w^ere 
my own, and all my Subjed^s were not only my 
Tenants, but Tenants at Will : That they would 
all fight for me to the lad Drop ; and that never 
Tyrant, for jlich I acknowledged my felf to be^ was 
ever fo univerfally beloved, and yet fo horribly 
feared by his Subjeds. 

After amuiing them with thefe Riddles in Go- 
vernment for a while, lopenM the Cafe, and told 
them the Story at large of my living in the Ifland, 
and how I managed both my felf and the People 
there that were under me, jiiH: as I have iince mi- 
nuted it down. They wxre exceedingly taken with 
the Story, and efpecially the Prince, who to;d me 
with a Sigh, that the true Greatnefs of Life was 
to be Mafter of our klvQS : That he would not 
have exchanged fuch a State of Life as mine, to 
have been Czar of Mufcovy; and that he found 
more Felicity in the Retirement he feem'd to be 
banifh'd to there, than ever he foun«d in the high- 
eft Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his Mafter 
the Czat : That the Heighth of human Wifdom 
was to bring our Tempers down to our Circum- 
ftances ; and to make a Calm within, under the 
.Weight of the^ greateil Storm without. When he 

Y 4 came 



^ame firft hither, he faid he ufed to tear the Hair 
from his Head, and the Clothes from his Back, as 
others had done before him j but a little Time and 
Confideration had made him look into himfelf, 
as well as rour.d him to Things without : That he 
found the Mind of Man, if it was but once brought 
to refled upon the State of univerfal Life, and 
how little this World was concern'd in its true 
Felicity, was perfectly capable of making a Fe- 
licity for it felf, fully fatisfying to it felf, and 
fuitable to its own beft Ends and Defires, with 
but very little Afliftance from the World : That 
Air to breath in, Food to fuflain Life, Clothes 
for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercife in Order to 
Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the 
World could do for us ; and tho' the Greatnefs, 
the Authority, the Riches, and the Pleafures 
which feme enjoy'd in the World, and which he 
had enjoy'd his Share of, had much in them that 
was agreable to us ; yet he obferved that all thofe 
Things chiefly gratify'd the coarfeft of our Affe- 
(5tions, fuch as our Ambition, our particular Pride, 
our Avarice, our Vanity, and our Senfuality j all 
which were indeed rhe meer Produd of the worft 
Part of Man, were in themfelves Crimes, and 
had in them the Seeds of all Manner of Crimes, 
but neither were related to, or concern^ with any 
of thofe Virtues that conftituted us wife Men, or 
of thofe Graces which diflinguifh'd us as Chri- 
flians: That being now deprived of all the fancy'd 
Felicity which he enjoy'd in the full Exercife of 
all thofe Vices, he faid he was at Leifure to look 
upon the dark Side of them, where he found all 
Manner of Deformity, and was now convinced, 
that Virtue only makes a Man truly wife, rich, 
and great, and preferves him in the Way to a lii'- 
perior Happinefs in a future State. And in this 

he 



[ 3^9 ] 

be faid, they were more happy in their Banifli- 
ment than all their Enemies were, who had the 
full Pofleflion ol: all the "Wealth and Power that 
they (the Bani/h'd) had left behind them. 

Nor, Sir, fays he, do I bring my Mind to this 
politically, by the NecefTity of my Circumfiances, 
which fome call miferable ; but ii I know any 
Thing of my felf, I would not now go back, tho* 
the Czar, my Mafler, (hould call me, and re-indate 
me in all my former Grandeur ; I fay, I would no 
more go back to it, than I believe my Soul, when 
it Ihall be deliver'd from this Prifon of the Body, 
and has had a Tafte of the glorious State beyond 
Life, would come back to the Jayl of Flefh and 
Blood it is now enclosed in, and leave Heaven to 
deal in the Dirt and Crime of human Affairs. 

He fpoke this with fo much Warmth in his 
Temper, fo much Earneftnefs and Motion of his 
Spirits, which were apparent in his Countenance, 
that it was evident it was the true Senfe of kis 
Soul : There was no room to doubt his Since- 
rity. 

I told him, I once thought my felf a kind of a 
Monarch in my old Station, of which I had given 
him an Account, but that I thought he was not sl 
Monarch only, but a great Conqueror^ for that he 
;hat has got a Vii5lory over his own exorbitant 
Dehres, and has the abfolute Dominion over him^ 
felf, whofe Reafon entirely governs his Will, is 
QQVtSiinly greater than he that conquers a City. 
But, my Lord, fcitd /, fliall I take the Liberty to 
ask you a Qj.)cItion ? With all my Heart, fays he. 
If the Door of your Liberty was opened, Jaid /, 
would you not take hold of it to deliver your 
felf from this Exile. 

Hold faid he, your Queflion is fubtle, and re- 
C[uires fomeferiousjufl Diftindtions, to give it a 

iincere 



[ 350 ] 

fincere Anfvver ; and Til give it you from the Bot^ 
torn of my Heart. Nothing that I know of in this 
World would move me to deliver my felf from this 
State of Banifliment, except thefe two j Firft, the 
Enjoyment of my Relations, and Secondly, a lit- 
tle warmer Climate ; but I protefl: to you, that 
to go back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, 
the Power, the Hurry of a M-'nifler of State, the 
Wealth the Gaiety, and the Pleafures, that is to 
fay. Follies of a Courtier ; if my Mafter Ihould 
fendme Word this Moment, that he rcilores me 
to all he banifh'd me from ; I prorcft, If I know 
?ny felf at all, I would not leave this Wildernef^-, 
thelc befarts, and thefe frozen Lakes, for the Pa- 
lace at Mufcov). 

But, my Lord, faid I, perhaps you not only 
are banifh'd from the Pleafureof the Court, and 
from the Power, and Authority, and Wealth you 
enjoy 'd before, but you may be abfcnt too from 
fome of the Conveniences of Life, your Eflate 
perhaps conhfcated, and your Etieds plundered, 
and the Supplies left you here may not be fuitable 
to the ordinary Demands of Life. 

Ay, fays he, that is as you fuppofe me to be a 
Lord, or a Prince, &c. So indeed I am •, but you 
are now to confider me only as "a Man, a human 
Creature not at all diffinguifti'd from another, 
and fo I can fuffer no Want, unlefs I fhould be 
vilited with Sicknefs and Diflempers. However, 
to put the Qiieflion out of Difpure, you fee our 
Manner : We are in this Place five Perfons of Rank ; 
we live perfectly retir'd, as fuiced to a State of Ba- 
nifhment; we have fomething refcu'd from the 
Shipwreck of our Fortunes, which keeps us from 
the meet Neceifity of hunting for our Food; But 
the poor Soldiers who are here, without that 
Help, live in as mixh Piei^y as we, who go 

intv> 



[ J3> ] 

into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes ; the 
Labour of a Month will maintain them a Year ; 
knd as the Way of Living is not expenfive, fo it 
is not hard to getfufficient to our (elves. So that 
Objcdion is out of Doors. 
■ 1 have not room to give a full Acount of the 
mo ft agreeable Converfarfon I had with this truly 
great Man '•* in all which he fhew'd that his 
Mind was fo infpir'd with a fuperior Knowledge 
of Things, fo fupported by Rehgion, as well a> 
by a vaft Share of VVifdom ; that his Comtempt 
of the World was really as much as he had ex- 
prefs'd, and that he WuS always the fame to the 
laft, as wiil appear in the Story I am going to 
tell. 

I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful 
Winter I thought it to be, the Cold fo intenfe, 
that I could not fo much as look about without 
being wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before 
my Face, or rather a Hood with only a Hole for 
Breath, and two for Sight : The little Day-light 
we had, was, as we reckon'd, for three Months, not 
above five Hours a Day, and fix at moft ; only thas 
the Snow lying on the Ground continually, and the 
Weather clear, it wasneverquite dark : OurHorfes 
were kept (or rather ftarv'd) under Ground, and 
as for our Servants, for we hir'd three Servants 
here to look after our Horfes and felves, we had 
every now and then their Fingers and Toes to 
thaw and take Care of> left they fhould mortify 
and fall off. 

■ It is true, within Doors we were v/arm, the 
Houfes beirigclcfe, the Walls thick, the Lighrs 
fmall, and the Glafs all double ; our Food was 
chiefly the Flefli of Deer dry'd and cur'd in the 
Seafon ; good Bread enough, but bak'd as Biskets : 
dry'd Fifh of feverai Scrts^ and fome Flefii of 
' . - - ' ■ Milt- 



[3?0 

Mutton, and of the BufFeloes, which is pretty 
good Beef. All the Stores of Provifion for the 
Winter are laid iip in the Summer, and well cur 'dj 
our Drink was Water mix'd with Aqua-vitar in- 
"ftcad of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead inftead 
of Wine, which, however, they have excellent 
good. The Hnntersj who venture abroad all Wea- 
thers, frequently brought us in frefh Venifon, ve- 
ry fat and good, and (ometimcs Bears Flefh, but 
we did not much care for the laft : We had a good 
Stock of Tea, "with which we treated our Friends, 
as above Vand in a Word, we 1 iv'd very chearfuUy 
and well, all things confiderM! 
■ It was now March, and the Days grown confi- 
derably longer, and the Weather, atleaft, tolera- 
ble; fo the other Travellers began to prepare Sleds 
to carry them over the Snow, and to get things rea- 
dy to be %o\:\^ ; but my Meafures being fix'd, as I 
havefaid, iox Arch- Angel, and not to Mufcovy OT 
the Bahick, I made no Motion ; knowing very well 
that the Ships from the South do not fet out for 
that Part of the WorlcJ till May or Jj^ne, and that 
if I was there by the beginning of Augtifl, it would 
be as foon as any Ships would be ready to go away : 
And therefore, 1 fay, I made no Hafte tp be gone, 
as others did. In a Word, I faw a great many Peo- 
ple, niay, ah the Travellers go away before me : 
It feems every Year they go from hence to Aluf^ 
co-u) for Tra.e, (vtT..) to carry Furs, and buy Ne- 
ceflaries with them, which they bring back tofur- 
nifti thr.) . Shops, alfo others went of the fame 
Errand to Arch- Angel, but then they alfo being 
tocemc back again above 800 Miles, went all 
out before me. 

In fiiort, about the latter End of Mny I began 
to make aU ready to pack up ; and as J was doing 
this, it occur*d to me, that feeing all thefe People 

wer€i 



#ere banifh'd by the Czar of Mufcovy to Siheria^ 
^nd yet when they came there, were left at Liberty 
to go whither they would ^ why did they not 
then go away to any Part of the World where- 
ever they thought fit, and I began to examine 
what (liould hinder then from making fuch an At- 
tempt. 

But my Wonder was over, when I enter'd upon 
that Subjed with the Perfon I have mentioned, 
who anfwer'd me thus : Confider Firfl, Sir, faid 
he, the Place where we are ; and Secondly, the 
Condition we are in ,• efpecially, faid he, the Ge- 
nerality of the People who are banifh'd hither; 
we are furrounded, faid he, with llronger Things 
than Bars and Bolts j on the North Side an unna- 
vigable Ocean, where Ship never fail'd, and Boat 
never fwam j neither, i^ we had both, could we 
know where to go with them : Every other Way, 
faid he, we have above a Thoufand Miles to pafs 
through the Czar's own Dominions, and By- Ways 
utterly unpaflable, except by the Roads made by 
the Governour^f and by the Towns garrifon'd by 
his Troops ; fo that we could neither pafs undi^- 
covered by the Road, or fubfift any other Way, 
fo that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was (ilenc'd indeed at once, and found that 
they were in a Prifon, every Jot as fecure as if 
they had been lock'd up iw the Callle at Mufcow; 
however, it came into my Thought, that I might 
certainly be made an Initrument to procure the 
Efcape of this excellent Perfon, and that what- 
ever Hazard I run, I would certainly try if I could 
carry him off. Upon this I took an Occafion one 
Evening to tell him my Thoughts : I reprefented 
to him, that it was very eafy for me to carry him 
away, there being no Guard over liim in the Coun- 
5ry, and as I was not going to Mufcozvy but to u^rc/j- 



t m] 



At^gei, and that I went in the nature of a Carravari; 
by which I was not oblig'd to lye in the Stationary 
Towns in the Defart^ but could encamp every 
Night where I would, we might eafily pals unin- 
terrupted to Arch-Angely where I would immedi- 
ately fecure him on Board an EngUJI? or Dutch Ship, 
and carry him off {j^k along with me i and as to 
his Subfiflence, and other Particulars, it fhould 
be my Care till he could better fupply himfelf. 

He heard me very attentively, and look'd ear- 
neftly on me all the while 1 fpoke i nay, 1 could lee 
in his very Face, that what I faid put his Spirits 
into an exceeding Ferment ; his Colour frequently 
chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and his Heart flut- 
tered, that it might be even percciv'd in his Coun- 
tenance ; nor could he immediately anfwer me. 
When I had done, and as it were expeded what 
he would fay to it j but after he had paus'd a h'ttle 
he embracM me, and faid, how happy are we 
unguarded Creatures as we are, that even our 
greateft Afts of Friendfliip are made Snares to us, 
and we are made Tempters of one another I My 
dear Friend, faid he, your Office is fo lincere, 
has fuch Kindnefs in it, is fo difinterefled in it 
felf, and is fo calculated for my Advantage, that 
I muft have very little Knowledge of the V/or'd, 
it I did nor both wonder at it, and acknowledge 
the Obligation I have upon me to you for it. 
But did you believe I was fincere in what I have fo 
often faid to you of my Contempt of the World > 
Did you believe I fpoke my very Soul to you, and 
that I had really obrain'd that Degree of Felicity 
here, that had plac'd me above all that the World 
could give me, or do for me ? Did you believe I 
was fmcere, when I told you I would not go backv 
if I was recall'd even to all, that once I was in 
the Court with the Favour of the Czar my Mafter ? 

Did 



pld you believe me, my Friend, to be an honefl 
Man, or did you think me to be aboaib'ng Hypo- 
crite ? Here he flopped, as it' he would hear whae 
I would fay, but indeed, I i'coh after perceiv'd, thac 
he ftopp'd becaufe his Spirits were in Motion, his 
great Heart was full of Struggles, and he could 
not go on. I was, I confefs, ailoniOrd at the 
Thing as well as at the Man, and I us'd fome Ar- 
guments with him to urge him to fet himfeli: free : 
That he ought to look upon this as a Dooropen'd 
by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Summons 
by Providence, who has the Care and Difpofition 
of all Events, to do himfelf good, and to render 
himfelf ufeful in the World. 

He had by this Time recoverd himfelf : How 
do you know Sir, fays he warmly, that mlfead of 
a Summons from Heaven, it may not be a Feint of 
another Inftrument ? Reprefenting in all the allu- 
ring Colours to me the Shew of Felicity as a Deli^ 
verance, which may in itfelf be my Snare, and 
tend diredly to my Ruin : Here I am free from 
the Temptation of returning to my former mifera- 
ble Greatnefs ; there I am not fure but that all the 
Seeds of Pride, Ambition, Avarice and Luxury, 
which I know remain in Nature, may revive and 
take Root ; and in a Word, again overwhelm me, 
and then the happy Prifoner, whom }0u fee now 
Mailer of his Soul's Liberty, Ihall be the miTerable 
Slave of his own Senfes, in the Full of all perfonal 
Liberty : Dear Sir, let me remain in this blefled 
Confinement, banifli'd from the Crimes of Life, 
rather than purchafe a Shew of Freedom, at the 
Expence of the Liberty of my Reafon, i.nd at the 
Expence of the future Happinefs which now I have 
in my View, but fhall then, I fear, quickly lofe 
Sight of j for I am but Flefli, a Man, a mecr Man, 
have PafTionsand Afedions as likely to pollcfs and 

over- 



bverthrow me as any Man : O be not my 
Friend and my Tempter both together ! 

If I was furpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now, 
and flood filent, locking at him, and indeed ad- 
mir'd at what Ifaw ; the Struggle in his Soul was 
fo great, that tho"* the Weather was extreamly 
cold, it put him into a moft violent Sweat, and I 
found he wanted to give Vent to his Mind ; fo 
I faid a Word or two, that I would leave him to 
confider of it, and wait on him again, and then 
I withdrew to my own Apartment. 

About two Hours after I heard fome Body at, 
or near, the Door ot my Room, and I was going 
to open the Door, but he had opened it, and came 
in : My dear Friend, fays he, you had almofl o- 
verfet me, but I am recover^ ,* do not take it ill 
that I do not clofe with your Offer, 1 allure 
you, 'tis not for want of a Senfe of the Kindnefs 
of it in you, and I came to make the mod fincere 
Acknowledgment of it to you ; but I hope I have 
got the Victory over my (elf. 

My Lord, faid /, I hope you are fully fatisfy'd 
that you do not refift the Call of Heaven. Sir, 
faid he, if it had been from Heaven, the fame 
Power would have influenced me to accept it ; 
but I hope, and am fully fatisfy'd, that it is 
from Heaven that 1 decline it, and I have an infi- 
nite Satisfaction in the Parting, that you fhall 
leave me an honefl Man ffill, tho' not a free Man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiefce, and 
make Profelfiuns to him of my having no End 
in it, but a lincere Defire to ferve him : He em- 
brac'd me very pafHonately, and affut'd me, he 
was fenfible of that, and lliould always acknow- 
ledge it, and with that he ofFer'd me a very 
fine Prefent of Sables, too much indeed for 
me to accept from a Man in his Circuii^ftanccs, 

and

and I would have avoided diem, but he would not 
be rehis'd. 

The next Morning I fent my Servant to his 
Lordfhip, with a imall Prefent oF Tea, and two 
Pieces oF China Damask, and four little Wedges 
of Japan Gold, which did not all weigh above 
fix Ounces, or thereabout, but were far fhort of 
the Value of his Sables, which, indeed, when I 
came to England, I found worth near 200 /. He 
accepted the Tea, and one Piece of the Damask, 
and one of the Pieces of Gold, A^hich had a 
fine Stamp upon it, of the Japan Coinage, which I 
found he took for the Rarity of it, but would 
not take any more, and he fent Word by my Ser- 
vant, that he defir'd to fpeak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, f knew 
what had pafs'd between us, and hop'd I would 
not move him any more in that Affair ; but 
that fince I had made fuch a generous Offer to 
him, he ask'd me, if I had Kindnefs enough to 
offer the fame to another Perfon th^t he would 
name to me, in whom he had a great Share of 
Concern. I told him, that I could not fay I en- 
clin'd to do fo much for any one but himfelf, 
for whom I had a particular Value, and fliould 
have been glad to have been the InflrumenC 
of his Deliverance *> however, if he would pleafe 
to name the Perfon to me, I would give him 
my Anfwer, and hop^d he would not be difplea- 
fed with me, if he was with my Anfwer. He 
told me, it was only his Son, whom, tho' I had 
not feen, yet was in the fame Condition with 
himfelf, and above two hundred Miles from him, 
on the other Side the Oby ; but that if I con- 
fented, he would fend for him. 

I made no Hefitation, but told him I would 
do it : I made fome Ceremony in letting him 
Part IL Z und^ 



[ Sii ] 

ttnderfrand -that it was wholly on his Acconnr, 
and that Teeing I could not prevail on him, I 
\yould fhewmy Refpea to him, by my Concern 
viior his Soii,- but thcCc Things are too tedious to 
repeat here : He fent awi.y the next Day for his 
Son, and in about twenty Days he came back 
with the Meflenger, bringing lix orfeven Horfes, 
-loaded with very rich Furs, and which in the 
whole, amounted to a very great Value. 

His Servants brought the Horfes inta the 
Town,, but left the young Lord at a Diftance, 
till Kight, When- he came- incognito into our 
-Aparrment,- and his Father prefented him to 
TO«5 and in (liort, we concerted there the Man- 
ner ot our travelling, and every Thing proper 
fbr the JcHirftcy. 

' I had bought a eonftderable Quantity of Sables,

Ftirs as are very rich *, I fay, I had bought them 
in that Ciry in Exchange for fome of the Goods 
I brought from China j in particular for the Cloves 
and Nutmegs, of which-, I fold the greateft Pare 
here, and the reft afterwards at Arch-Angel, for 
a much better Price than I could have done at 
London ; and my Partner who was fenfible of 
the Profit, and whofe Bu£meh m.ore particular- 
ty than mine was Merchandize, was mightily 
pleased with our Stay, on Account of the Traf- . 
lick we made h^xQ. 

It was the beginning of June, when I left this 
remote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of 
in the World ; and indeed it is fo far out of 
the Road of Commerce, that I know not how 
it fhould be much talk'd of. We were nov^come 
to a very fmall Carravan, being only thirty 
two^ Horfes and. Camels in alJ, and all of them 
pafs'd. for rain^, rho' my new Gueft was Propri-

fftor of eleven of them. It was mod: natural alfo 
that I (hould take more Servants with me than 
I had before, and the yOung Lord pafs'd for my 
Steward ; what great Man I pafs'd for my felf, 
I know nor, neither did it concern me to en- 
quire. We had here, the worfl and the largelt 
Defarc to pafs over that we met with in all the 
Journey ; indeed 1 call it the worfl, becaufe the 
Way was very deep in Tome Places, and very 
uneven in others ; the bed we had to fay for 
it, was, that we thought we had no Troops of T^ar- 
tars and Robbers to fear, and that they never 
came on this Side the Oby^ or at leafl, but very 
feldom, but we found it other wife. 

My young Lord had with him, a faithful 
Mtifccvite Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant^ 
who was perfectly acquainted with the Country, 
and led us by private Roadsj that we avoided 
coming in to the principal Towns and Cities, 
upon the great Road, fuch as T'umeriy Soly-Kawr 
skoiy and feveral others ; becaufe the Mufcovite 
Garrifons which are kept there, are very cu- 
rious and ftrid in their Obfervation upon Tra- 
vellers *, and fearching left any of the banifhM 
Perfons of Note Ihould make their Efcape that 
Way into Mufcovy; but by this Means, as we 
v/ere kept out of the Cities, fo our whole Jour- 
ney was a Defart, and we were obliged to encamp 
and lye in our Tents, when we might have 
had very good Accommodation in the Cities 
on the Way : This the young Lord was fo fen- 
(ible of, that he would not allow us to lye a- 
broad, when we came x<y feveral Cities, on the 
Way, but lay abroad himfelf with his Servant 
in the Woods, and met us always at the ap- 
pointed Places,

We were juft enter'd Europe, having pafs'd 
the River A'/zw?.^, wh?ch in thefe Parts, is the 
Boundary between Europe and AJiuy and the firft 
City on the Ei^ropeau Sid^ was call'd »Sb/y- 
-Kantikoyy which is as much as to fay, the great 
City, on the Kiver A'^«2^,; and here we thought 
to have feen foqac- (^vident Alteration in the 
People, their Manner, their Habit, their Reli- 
gion, .and their Buiinefs,' but we were miflaken, 
for as. we had a-va#. Deter to pafs, which by 
Relation, is near feven hundred Miles long in 
ibme Places, but not above two hundred Miles 
over where we pafs'd it ,• fo ^till we came paft 
that horrible Place, we found very little Difte- 
jence between that Country and the M^jgullav 
tary',..x.\\^ Pi:opIe, mofc Pagans, and little better 
than the Savages of America, their Houfes and 
jTowns full of Idols, and their Way of Living, 
wholly barbarous, except in the Cities as above, 
and the Villages near them ; where there are 
Cl)rillians as tney call themfelves, of the Greek 
Chutch, but h^ve their Religion mingled with 
Jo many Reliques ot Supeiilition, that it isfcarce 
to be kflown m fome Places from meer Sorcery 
'and V/itchcraft.,, 

In paiTiug this.Foreft, I thought indeed we muft, 
after all our Dangers were in our Imagination e- 
fcap'd, as before, have been plunderM2:nd robbed, 
and perhaps murther'd by a Troop of Thieves ; 
of what Country. they were, whether the ro- 
ving Bands of the Oftiachi, a Kind of Tartars or 
wild People on the Bank of the Oby^ and rang'd 
thus far; or whether they were the Sable^ 
Hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a Lofs to know ; 
but they were all on Horfeback, carry 'd Bows 
and Arrows, and were at firif about five and 
forty in Number. They came fo near to us, as 

withia 



[ 341 ] * 

within about two Mufqiiet Shot, and asking no 
Queftions, they furrounded us with their Horfc, 
and look'd very earneftly upon us twice. Ac 
length they pjac'd themfelves juft in our Way, 
upon which, we drew up in a little Line before our 
Camels, being nor above fixteen Men in ^11 ; 
and being drawn up thus, we halted and 
fent out the Siberian Servant, \^ ho attended his 
Lord, to fee who they were. His Mailer was 
the more willing to let him go, becaufe he was 
not a little apprehenfive, that they were a Si- 
berian Troop fent out after him : The Man 
came up near them with a Flag of Truce, 
and caird them, but the' he fpoke feveral 
of their Languages of Dialeds or Language? ra- 
ther, he could not underfland a Word they 
faid. However, after fome Signs to hfm, not 
to come nearer to them at his Peril, fo he faid, 
he uxiderflood them to mean offering to flioot at 
him if he advanc'd, the Fellow came back no 
wifer than he went, only that by their Drefs, 
he faid, he believ'd them to be fome Tartars of 
Kalmuck, or of Circaffian Hoords ; and that there 
muft be more of them upon the gieat Defart, 
tho' he never heard that any of them ever were 
feen fo far North before. 

This was fmall Comfort to us ; however, we 
had no Remedy. There was on our left Hand at a- 
bouta Qiiarterof aMile's Diftance, a little Grove 
or Clump of Trees which flood clofe together, 
and very near the Roadi I immediately rcfolv'd 
we would advance to thofe Trees, and toriify our 
felves as well as we could there ; for firfl 1 con- 
fidered, that the Trees would in a great Mea- 
fure cover us from their Arrows, and in the next 
Place, they could not come to charge us in a Bo- 
dy. It was indeed my old Pcrtuguefe Pilot who 
Z 3 pro 



[ 34^ ] 

propofed it, and who had this Excellency at- 
tending him, namely, that he was always rcadieft, 
and moil apt to dired and encourage us in Ca- 
fes of the moft Danger. We advancM immedi- 
ately with what Speed we could, and gain'd that 
little Wood, the Jartars or Thieves, for we know 
not what to call them, keeping their Stand, 
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came 
thither, we found to our great Satisfadion, that 
it was a fwampy fpringy Piece of Ground, and 
on the one Side, a very great Spring of Water^ 
which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was 
a little farther, joyn'd by another of the like 
Bignefs, and was in fhort, the Head or Source of 
a confiderable River, call'd afterwards the Win- 
ska-, the Trees which grew about this Spring, 
were not in all above two hundred, but were very 
large, and flood pretty thick -, (o that as foon as 
we got in, v/e faw our felves perfedly fafe from 
the Enemy, unlefs they alighted and attacked lis 
on Foot. 

But to make this more difficult, our Portu- 
guejey with indefatigable Application, cut dow2i 
great Arms of the Trees, and laid them hang- 
ing not quite cut off from one Tree to another, 
lo that he made a continued Fence almofl: round 
us. 

We ftay'd here waiting the Motion of the Ene- 
my fome Hours, without perceiving they made 
any Motion j when about two Hours before 
Kight, they came down diredly upon us, and 
tho^ we had not perceived it, we found they had 
been join'd by fome more of the fame, fo that 
they were near fourfcore Horfe, whereof how- 
ever, we fancy 'd fome were Women. They 
came on till they were within half Shot of our 
iiitle Wood, when we lEr'd one Mufquet without 

Ball, 



C 3^3 1 

Ball, and call'd to ,them in the Rujpan Tongue, 
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep 
o&; but as ii , they knew nothing of v/hat wc 
faid, tkey came on with a double Fur}' dire<5tT 
ly up to the Wood-iide, not imagining we wet'C 
fo barricado'd that they coiild not break in. Out 
old Pilot was our Captain, a6 well as he had 
been our Engineer, and defir'd of us not to fir« 
upon them till they came . within Piftol Shot, 
and that we might be fure to kill, and that whea 
we did fire, we fliould be fure to take good 
Aim ; we bad him giwe the Word of Command, 
which he delayed fo long, that they were fome 
of them within two Pikes Length of us when w^ 
fir'd. 

We aim'd fo true, (or. Providence directed our 
Shot fo fure) that we killed fourteen of them, 
and wounded feveral others, as alfo feveral of their 
Horfes ; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces 
with two or three Bullets at lead. 

They were terribly furpriz'd with our Fire, 
and retreated immediately about one Hundred 
Rods from us ; in which Time, we loaded our 
Pieces again, and feeing them keep that Diftance, 
we fally'd out and catch'd four or five of their 
Horfes, whofe Riders we fuppofe were kill'd, 
and coming up to the dead, we could eafily 
perceive they were Tartars, but knew not from 
what Country, or how they came to make an 
E^xcuriion fuch an unufual Length. 

About an Hour after they made a Motion to 
attack us again, and rode round our little Wood, 
to fee where elfe they might break in ; but find-- 
ing us always ready to face them, they went oft 
again, and we refolv'd not to ftir from the Place 
fpr that Night. 

. 2 4 We 



C 544 ] 

We flept little, you may be fure, but fpent 
the molt Pare of the Night in ftrengthning our 
Sicution, and » barricadoing the Entrances into 
the Wood, and keeping a ftrid Watch. We 
waited for Day-Light, and when it came, it 
gave us a very unwelcome Difcovery indeed; 
for the Enemy, whom we thought were dif- 
courag'd with the Reception they had met 
with, were now encreafed to no lefs than three 
hundred, and had fet up eleven or twelve 
Hurts and Tents, as if they were refolv'd to be- 
fiege us J and this little Camp they had pitched 
Upon the open Plain, at about three Quarters 
of a Mile fiom us. We were indeed furpriz'd 
at this Difcovery ; and now I confefs, I gave 
my feU over for loft, and ail that I had. The 
Lofs of my Effeds did not lyQ (o near me, (tho' 
they were very confiderable) as the Thoughts offal- 
ling into the Hands of fuch Barbayiansy at the lat- 
ter End of my Journey, ^fter fomany Difficul- 
ties and Hazards as I had gone through ; and even 
in Sight of our Port, where we expeded Safety 
and Deliverance. As for my Partner, he was ra- 
ging : He declar'd, that to lofe his Goods would 
be his Ruin, and he would rather die than be 
flarv*d ', and he v?as for fighting to the laft 
Drop. 

The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flefh fhewM 
it felf, was for fighting to the laft aifo j and my old 
Pilot was of the Opinion we were able to refift 
them all, in the Situation we were then in ; and 
thus we fpent the Day in Debates of what we 
fliould do ,• but towards Evening, we found that 
the Number of our Enemies ftill encreas'd, 
perhaps as they were abroad in feveral Parties 
for Prey. The firft had fcnt out Scouts to call 
for Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty ; 

an^ 



[ 345 ] 

and we did not know, but by the Morning they 
might fliil be a greater Number ; fo I began t6 
enquire of thofe People we had brought from 
Tohlski, if there was no other, or more private 
Ways by which we might avoid them in the 
Night, and perhaps either retreat to fome Town, 
or get Help to guard us over the Defart. 

Tlie Siberian, who w^as Servant to the young 
Lord, told us, if we defignM to avoid them, and 
not fight, he would engage to carry us off m the 
Night, to a Way that went North towards the 
Petrou, by which he made no Queflion but we 
might get away, and the Tartars never the wi- 
fer: But he faid, his Lord had told him, he 
would not retreat, but would rather chufe to 
fight. I told him, he miftook his Lord ,* for 
that he was too wife a Man to love Fighting for 
the Sake of it ; that 1 knew his Lord was brave 
enough by what he had fliew'd already j but 
that his Lord knew better, than to defire tohave 
feventeen or eighteen Men fight Rve hundred, 
unlefs an unavoidable NecefTity forced them to 
it ; and that if he thought it pofTible for us 
to efcape in the Night, we had nothing elfe to 
do but to attempt it. He anfwercd, If his Lord 
gave him fuch Orders^ he would lofe his Life. 
if he did not perform it. We foon brought his 
Lord to give that Order, tho' privately, and 
\ve immediately prepared for the putting it in 
Pradice. 

• And firft, as foon as it began to be dark, we 
kindled a Fire in our little' Camp, which we 
kept burning, and prepar'd io as to make it 
burn all Night, that the Tartars might conclude 
we were ftiil there ; but as fcon as it was dark, 
(that js to fay! fo as we could fee the Stars (for 
our Guide vvculj not ftir before) having all out 

Horfes 



[ 34<^ 1 

Horfes and Camels ready Joaden, we folloived our 
^jew Guide, who I foon found fleer'd himfelf by 
the Pole, or Norrh Star, all the Country being le- 
vel for a long Way. 

After we had travelled two Hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter {till, not that it was quite dark 
all Night, but the Moon began to rife, (o that 
in a Word, it was rather lighter than we wifhed it 
to be; by fix a Clock the next Morning we were 
gotten near forty Miles, though the Truth is, we 
almoft fpoiled our Horfes. Here we found a Ruf- 
Jtan Village named Kermazlnskoy, where we refted, 
and heard nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that 
Day. About two Hours before Night we fet 
out again, and travelled till eight the next Mor- 
ning, though not quite fo quiet as before, and 
about ^tx^n a Clock we palled a little River cal- 
led Kirtza, and came to a good large Town inha- 
bited by Ruffians^ and very populous, c^\'dOz>omc\s, 
There we heard that feveral Troops or Hoords 
of Calmucks had been Abroad upon the Defart, 
but that we were now completely out of Dan- 
ger of them, which was to our great Satisfadion 
you may be fure. Here we were obliged to get 
ibme frefli Horfes, and having Need enough of 
Reft, we ftayM five Days ; and my Partner and 
i agreed to givz the honeft Siberian, who brought 
us thither, the Value often Piftoles, for hiscon- 
dr.ding us. 

In five Days more we came to Veuflima, upon the 
River WitT^ogda^ and running into the Dvjina ; we 
were there very happily near the End of our Tra- 
vels by Land, that River being Navigable in fe- 
ven Days Paffage to Arch- Angel. From hence we 
came to Lawrenskoy the 3d of July, and providing 
our felves with two Luggage Boats, and a Barge 
for our own Convenience, we embark 'd the 7th. 



[ 347 ] 



^nd arrived all fafe at Anh- Angel the i Stb, having 
been a Year and five Months and three Days on 
the Journey, including our Stay of eight Months 
and odd Days at T'obolski. 

We were obliged to flay at this Place fix Weeks 
for the Arrival of the Ships, and muft have tarry 'd 
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a 
Month iopner than any oi: the EngliJIo Ships, when 
after fome Confideration, that the City of Ham- 
burgh might happen to be as good a Market for 
our Goods as London, we all took Freight with 
him, and having put my Goods on Board, it was 
mofl natural for me to put my Steward on Board 
to take Care of them, by which Means my young 
Lord had a fufficient Opportunity to conceal him- 
felf, never coming on Shore in ail the Time we 
llay'd there ; and this he did, that he might not 
be Teen m the City, where fbme of the Ahfcoio 
Merchants would gcrtainly have feen 2.nd diko- 
vered him. 

We failed from Arch- Angel the 20th of Augufi 
the fame Year, and after no extraordinary^ bad 
Voyage, arrived in the Elbe the 15 th oi September. 
Here my Partner and I found a very good Sale for 
pur Goods, as well thofe of Chinay as the Sables, 
&c. of Siberia j and dividing the Produce of our 
Effects, my Share amounted to 3475 -- 17 -- 3^. 
notwichftanding fo many Lofles we had fuif ained, 
and Charges we had been at , only remembring 
that I had included in this, about fix hundred 
Pounds worth of Diamonds vt^hich I had purcha- 
fed at Bengal, 

Here the young Lord took his Leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe in order to go to the Court of 
Vienna, where he refolved to feek Protedion, and 
where he could correfppnd with thofe of his Fa- 
ther's Friends who were left s^livc. He did not 

part^ 



[348 ] 



part without all the Teftimonies he could give 
xne of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, 
and his Senfe of my Kindncfs to the Prince his 
Father. 

To conclude, having ftaid near four Months 
in Hamburgh^ I came from thence over Land to 
the Hague, where 1 embark'd in the Pacquet3 
and arriv'd in London the loth of January^ 17055 
having been gone from England ten Years and 
nine Months. 

And here, refolving to harrafs myfelf no 
more, I am preparing tor a longer Joutney than 
all thefe, having iiv'd 72 Years, a Ux^o^ of infi- 
nite Variety, and Jcj.rn'd fufficiently to know the 
Value of Retirement, and the Blefling of end- 
ding our Days in Peace.
