PREFACE.
This little book is the result of much experi-
ence in seeking to adapt the story of Robinson
Crusoe to the literary attainments and educa-
tional needs of children in the primary schools.
It is supposed to follow the study of the '' Clas-
sic Stories for Little Ones " and to precede the
study of the ''Pioneer History Stories," which
recount the stirring events in the lives of those
heroes who first broke ground for our American
civilization in the Mississippi Valley. Crusoe
is the transition from myths and fairy tales,
where the imagination is untrammeled by the
"practical," to the study of real biography.
Those events in DeFoe's story that are of
doubtful educational value are omitted; but it
is believed that the child's interest in the nar
rative is not impaired thereby. The language
is that of children, and Robinson seems to be
telling his story to them. It will prove to be
4 Preface,
valuable supplementary reading for classes in
the second and third grades.
The Appendix in the Teachers' and Mothers'
Edition of this story, prepared by Dr. Frank McMurry and Dr. C. C.Van Liew, will be studied
with interest and profit by those for whom it
was written. The former shows the educa-
tional value of the story, and the latter pre-
sents a method of teaching it to children in
the second and third grades. The authors
hereby acknowledge their obligations to them
for their able assistance in the preparation of
this edition.
The Authors.

Robinson Crusoe at Home.
When I was a little boy, I lived in a great
city by the sea, with my father and mother.
They were very kind to me and loved me
dearly. They wished me to go to school
and learn a great deal, so that I might
some day be a useful man.
But I was lazy, and liked better to play
by the river than to study. I often sat 6 Robinson Crusoe.
hour after hour watching the great ships
loading and unloading their cargoes, and
as they sailed away I wished I might go
with them.
My father had told me that the ships
came from lands where the men did not
look like those I knew, and the plants and
animals were very different from any I
had seen.
He wished me to be a merchant, but I
could think of nothing but the ships, and I
often ran away from my work to watch
them-
When I was sixteen years old, father
said to me one day: "Robinson, I wish you
to be a merchant. If you attend to your
work, you shall some day take charge of
my business; but if you are lazy, no one
will have any use for you and you will not
be able to take care of yourself." He talked
to me a long time about my bad habits.
At Home. 7
I thought about what he had said and
made up my mind to work hard, But it
was not long before I began to think about
the ships again and long to sail across the
ocean.
Father saw that I was not doing my
work well, and one morning he said: "Robinson, what will become of you? Do you
want to become a good-for-nothing, and
some day beg for your bread?"
I said: "But, father, I do not wish to be
a merchant. I want to go away on one of
those ships. It must be fine to be out
on the ocean, and I want to see those
strange lands."
My father replied: "But, my son, if you
do not learn anything you will be of no use
to anyone on the ship, and one must work
in other countries as well as here. You
must remember that idleness is the begin-
ning of all mischief. If you disobey your father and mother and run away, you will
sometime be sorry; for whoever disobeys
his parents will never be happy."
While he was talking, the tears ran
down his face, and I could not help but
feel that I ought to do as he wished, and
I again promised to do so.
But very soon I forgot all about my
promise, and when my father was not
near I threw my work aside, put on my
hat, and went to the harbor.
As I sat watching the ships, I wished
more than ever to sail away. I knew it
would do no good to say more to father
about going; but I went to my mother
and said: "Mother, will you please ask
father to let me go off on just one voyage?"
But she would listen to nothing of the
kind, and with tears in her eyes she said:
"Robinson, you are our only child, and
if we should lose you, we would be left all alone. Your father and I are old, and
who would take care of us if we should
get sick? Do not make us unhappy. Do
not leave us." I said nothing more then,
but I could not help thinking about a voy-
age on the ocean.
Two years passed, and as I was walking
one day along the harbor I met a friend,
the son of the captain of one of the vessels.
After talking awhile, my friend said,
"Well, Robinson, father starts for America
today, and I am going with him."
"Oh! how I wish I could go with you!"
said I.
"Come along!" said he.
"But I have no money," I replied.
"Father will take you for nothing, I am
sure," said my friend. ''You can work for
him."
Giving him my hand I said, "Good! if
he will let me work my way I'll go with you."
The Voyage.
Theship on which I found myself, that
bright September morning, was a large one.
It was being made ready to start. Soon I
heard the cry, "A—all ha—a—nds! up
anchor, a—ho—oy!" At once everyone The Voyage. 11
seemed to be filled with life; the sails were
loosed, the yards braced, and the anchor
slowly raised.
Orders were given so rapidly and there
was such a hurrying about and so many
strange noises that I hardly knew what to
make of it. Above all sounded the boom
of a cannon; then the vessel moved slowly
out of the harbor. In a short time we
were under way.
I turned to look at the home I was leav-
ing. I could see the streets with the
people passing up and down, the houses,and the gardens. Soon I could see only
the towers; finally they, too, faded from
sight, and I was out on the great ocean.
Behind me and before me, to my right
and to my left,I could see nothing but
water—water—water. Then I began to
think of what I had done. I remembered
my father's tears and my mother's kindness, and here I was out upon the ocean, sailing
away from parents, home, and friends.
In a short time a strong wind arose, and
the ship rocked so fearfully from side to
side that I became dizzy. The storm grew
worse, and I thought that every wave would
surely swallow up the ship. Every time it
went down into the trough or hollow of the
sea, I feared it would never come up again.
I told my friend that I was very much
afraid; but he only laughed at me and said,
"Oh, you will get used to this after awhile."
I began to feel faint, so that I had to
hold on to something to keep from falling
down. The masts and ropes danced about
and the sailors seemed to be walking on
their heads. Finally, as I let go my hold,
I fell full length upon the deck and could
not rise. I was seasick. This sickness
lasted for two days; then the sea became
quiet and I began to get better.
This storm was followed by a few days of
pleasant weather, then suddenly the sky
grew dark and there was much calling and
shouting among the sailors. Another storm
had arisen. I thought every minute that
the ship would sink and made up my mind
that if I ever reached land I would go back
home and stay there.
The storm lasted all day and all night.
But next morning the waves were more
quiet, the sky became clear, and the ocean
looked beautiful. I was used to the rocking
of the vessel by this time, and began to
enjoy the excitement.
We had been out several weeks when
another heavy storm arose. This was very
much worse than either of the others; all on
board thought that we were lost. The
wind and waves carried the ship before
them, tossing it about like a nut-shell.
Suddenly one of the sailors cried out, "Land!" All rushed out of the cabin to
see where we were, but the waves broke
over the deck with such fury that they were
driven back into the cabin.
Then, all at once, we felt a fearful shock.
The vessel had struck a rock. The sailors
cried out, "The ship has sprung a leak!"
The water now poured into it. Everyone
called for help, and each thought only of
saving his own life.
A small boat was let down into the water,
and all of the men jumped into it. When
we were only a little way from the sinking
vessel, a great wave, that looked like a
mountain, came rolling toward our boat. It was overturned and all the men went
down.
I knew how to swim very well, but the
waves were so strong that I could do noth-
ing. I came to the top but a wave carried
me under again. Another wave brought me again to the top, and this time I could
see land very near. Then a heavy sea
hurled me against a rock, and I clung to
this with all my strength. Another wave
dashed over me, but I held on to the rock.
Then I ran up the cliff, but only a little
way, for I fell, and knew nothing more for
a long time.
When I opened my eyes again, my first
question was, "Where am I?" I looked
about for the sailors, but alas! I did not see
them, and I knew then that all must have
been drowned. I was the only one whose
life had been saved.
When I saw this I knelt down on the
rocks and thanked God for His mercy
to me.
Robinson in His New Home.
I began to wonder what I should do here
by myself. I was very wet and had no
change of clothes. I was hungry and thirsty
and did not know where to look for food or
drink. I was also afraid that wild animals
might attack me, and I had no gun.
It was getting dark and I knew that I
must look for a place to sleep. Where In His New Home. 17
should it be? For a long time I stood still,
not knowing what to do.
At last I said, "I will do as the birds do,
and rest in a tree." I soon found one with
thick branches in which I could settle my-
self quite comfortably and sleep without
danger of falling.
As I had nothing with which to defend
myself but a knife, I cut me a good stick.
Then I climbed the tree, arranged myself
carefully and fell asleep. Being very tired,
I slept soundly till morning.
When I awoke it was broad day; the
weather was clear and the sea quiet. I was
weak from hunger and thirst and wondered
what I could find for breakfast. I got down
from my bed and walked around looking for
food, but I found nothing but grass, and
trees that bore no fruit.
"I shall die of hunger," I thought. But
when the need is greatest then God's help is nearest. I had gone but a few steps when
I saw a large plant with a thick stalk, and
on it were three long ears. It was a stalk
of corn.
I broke off one ear and ate the kernels.
The other ears I put into my pocket I
also found a spring of clear, cool water.
Not far away was a high hill, and I went
up that I might look about me. It took me
half an hour to climb, it but when I had
reached the top I could see a long distance
away. I found that there was water all
around me. This distressed me greatly.
"So I am upon an island," I cried, "alone
and without food or shelter. O, what will
become of me!"
As I spoke my eyes fell upon the ship.
It lay about a mile from the shore, and had
not been broken to pieces by the storm, as
I had supposed. It was still resting upon
the rock. "I must reach that ship," I
thought. "How can I do it?"
The water was so shallow that I could
wade to within a quarter of a mile of it, and
I swam the remainder of the distance. By
the help of a rope I climbed to the deck of
the vessel. No sooner had I reached it
than I was greeted by the joyful barking
of the dog, which the sailors had named Barri.
He jumped and sprang about me, rejoicing
to see a friend once more. I, too, was glad
to have a living being with me again.
I found many things on board the vessel
which were not injured at all. First of all
I hunted for food. I found a chest of ship
biscuits, and gave some to Barri who was
nearly starved, and I ate all I wished myself.
I gathered the things together which I
wished to take with me, and built a raft
by fastening a number of logs together by
ropes, and nailing some boards upon these.
I put upon the raft the chest of biscuits, a
flint for making a fire, a box of tools, a saber, four guns, two barrels of powder,
shot, clothing, and many other things.
With a broken oar I then rowed toward
land. Suddenly I heard a splashing behind
me, and turned about, much frightened.
But it was only Barri, the faithful dog, who
was swimming after me. I drew the poor
fellow out of the water on to the raft.
In a half hour I landed everything safely.
It was now getting dark, and I hunted
for a tree in which to spend the night.
The next morning my first thought was
of the ship. I decided to bring over all of
the things for which I might have any use.
I went to the vessel on my raft and
brought back two kegs of nails and spikes, a
large auger, a grindstone, two barrels of
bullets, a large bag of shot, seven muskets,
a piece of sail, and some bedding. I wanted
to put on other things, but the raft could
hold no more. I brought all these safely to land. My next care was to get my goods
under cover. For this purpose I went to
work to build myself a tent. I cut a few
poles, set them into the ground in the form
of a circle, the tops touching, and fastened
the sail over them. Into this tent I put
everything I had brought from the ship.
The third time I went to the ship I found
in a drawer a pair of scissors, a few knives,
and a bag of gold. I was very glad to get
the scissors and knives, but I had no use
for the gold.
As I was rowing to land a strong wind
arose, and I had to hurry to reach the
shore with my raft. I had barely reached
it when the wind became so strong that the
waves covered the ship. When the sea
became quiet again nothing could be seen
of it. I felt very thankful that I had been
able to get so much, for I thought, "How
could I have lived without these things!"
Robinson's House.
My tent stood on low, wet ground and I
wished to find a better spot for my home.
After looking around a long time, I found a Robinson's House. 23
level place on the side of a hill near the sea,
which suited me very well.
Back of this plain was a high, steep wall
of rock, in which was an opening like the
door of a cave. I said to myself, "What a
fine home I can make here!"
I first brought up my tent and everything
that was in it. This was hard work. I set
up the tent, and moved my things into it,
then I built a double wall or fence in the
shape of a semi-circle, extending from one
side of the cave around to the other side,
inclosing a beautiful green yard.
The front of the fence was ten yards from
the cave door, and its two ends were about
twenty yards apart. This double fence was
made by driving two rows of strong stakes
into the ground until they stood very firm,
the biggest end being out of the ground and
sharpened at the top. These two rows
were only six inches apart.
Between them I laid one row after an-
other of ship cable until it reached the top.
Other stakes, two and a half feet high were
driven inside of the second row, leaning
against them so as to brace them. Neither
man nor animal could get through or over
this fence.
Instead of a gate I made me a ladder so
that I might go over the top. When I
was within, I lifted the ladder in after me.
The fencing in of my home had been a hard
piece of work and had lasted more than
three months.
Within this fence I built a cabin. My
tent had allowed the rain to come through. I
wished to make the roof of the cabin rain
proof. At the sides of the cave opening I
set poles in the ground ten steps apart.
Upon these I laid a cross piece. Upon this
cross piece were the rafters, their other end
resting on the rocky cliff and forming a
slanting roof,
24 Robinson Crusoe.
I covered this roof with long grass and
with leaves. The sides were made of wood,
and I filled the cracks with mud. A piece
of sail formed the door.
When I had done this I began to dig my
way into the rock. I carried all the stones
out through my cabin and laid them up
within the fence. This raised the ground
all around, about a foot and a half. The
cave formed the cellar to my house.
His Work.
While I was at work in the cave a storm
came up. It grew dark, and suddenly there
was a flash of lightning, and after that a
great clap of thunder. I thought, "Oh, my
powder! If the lightning should reach that,
what would I do? If I lose my powder I
cannot get food, and I shall have nothing
with which to protect myself."
After the storm was over I shook out
some small grain bags which I had, and
made some others and put the powder into
about a hundred of these, hoping that if
some of it should burn, I could keep a part
at least. I hid these bags of powder in
holes among the rocks. Here it could not
get wet.
His Work. 27
While I was doing this I went out at least
once a day with my gun. The first time I
discovered that there were goats upon the
island, and I was glad to see them. But
they were very shy and would run so
swiftly that it was the most difficult thing
in the world to catch them.
One day I watched for them, thinking
perhaps I could shoot one; but when they
were upon the rocks and saw me in the val-
ley they would run away, very much fright-
ened. When they were feeding in the
valley and saw me upon the rocks, however,
they took no notice of me. From this I
thought that they could not see readily ob-
jects that were above them. So I climbed
the rocks, to get above them, and then fired
at them.
The first goat that I shot was an old one.
She had a little kid by her side, which I did
not see at first. It grieved me that I had killed the mother. I picked up the goat
and carried it home over my shoulder, the
little kid following me. I thought I could
tame the kid, but it would not eat, so I had
to kill it to keep it from starving to death.
Many times I grew sad thinking of my
home in England. Then I would remem-
ber how I had been saved and this would
make me very thankful.
I had been on the island about ten or
twelve days, when the thought came to me
that I should not be able to tell the day of
the week or month after a while, for want
of books and pen and ink, and should not
know which was the Sabbath day.
To prevent this, I set up a post, and on
this I cut these words: "I came on shore
here the 30th of September, 1659." Then
for every day I cut a notch. Every
seventh notch was longer than the others.
One day, as I was looking over the things 29
I had brought from the ship, I found pens,
ink, and paper; also three good Bibles and
several other books. I must not forget,
also, that we had in the ship two cats,
which I brought home with me.
I was careful not to waste any ink, for I
knew that I could not get any more when
that was gone.
One day I wrote the following upon
paper:
EVIL.
I am cast upon a lonely island; no hope of being saved.
I am alone—one man all alone.
I have no clothes.
I have nothing to fight
with.
I have no one to speak to.
GOOD.
But I am alive.
But I am not starved.
But it is warm here.
But I am upon an island where I see no wild beasts.
But God sent the ship near
enough to the shore for
me to get many things,
and 1 have Barri and the
cats for company.
This made me think that no matter how hard my life seemed, I could find something
for which to be thankful.
I needed many things in the house, so I
went to work and made some. First, I
made a chair and a table out of short pieces
of boards which I had brought from the
ship. Then I made some shelves along one
side of my cave. You may know that this
was no light task, when I tell you that I had
no tools but an ax and an adze. If I wanted
a board, I must chop down a tree, cut off
from the trunk the length that I wanted,
and hew it flat on either side with my ax
until I had made it as thin as a plank.
Then I smoothed it with my adze. In this
way I could make but one board out of a
whole tree. But there was no help for it,
and as I had plenty of time, it was just as
well to spend it in this way.
The boards which I used for shelves were
a foot and a half wide, and were placed one under another all along one side of my cave.
On these I laid my tools, nails, and other
things. I drove spikes into the wall, on
which to hang my gun. It was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and to know that I had so many use-
ful things.
I went out for about two hours with my
gun, every morning that it did not rain.
Then I worked until eleven o'clock. After
this I had my dinner. From twelve to two
I slept, then I went to work again.
One day when I was out hunting I killed
a young goat and lamed another. I caught
the lame one, led it home, and bound up its
leg, which I found was broken. I took such
good care of it that it soon became as well
as ever. It would eat near my door and it
was so tame that it would not go away.
I worked hard, but often the rains kept
me in the house. I had to go to bed early, for I had no light. I wished for a lamp
very often, and I studied how to make one.
The best that I could do was to save the
tallow from a goat which I had killed. With
a little dish made of clay, which I baked in
the sun, and some oakum for the wick, I
made a lamp. This gave me a light, but
not a clear, steady light like a candle.
Surprises.

Surprises.
One day I saw before my door a few
blades of something green coming up out
of the ground. I thought it might be some
plant I had not seen. I was very much
surprised, a few weeks later, to see heads
of wheat on the plants.
When I saw this new gift, tears came to
my eyes. I thought of the prayer, "Give
us this day our daily bread," and I re-
peated it.
I asked myself, "How came this wheat
here?" Then I remembered that one day
during a great rain I had shaken some dust
out of a bag which had once held wheat.
There must have been a few grains in this.
It was in April when I found the plants,
and by June I had gathered every grain of
wheat and saved it for seed.
By the side of the rock, back of my
house, a few rice plants were growing. I
watched these and when the rice was ripe
I gathered it for seed.
I had been working very hard for three
or four months trying to get my fence done.
The very next day after it was finished, I
came near having my work spoiled and my-
self killed.
As I was busy behind my cabin, just at
the opening of the cave, I was terribly
frightened by a most surprising thing. The
earth began to fall from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over
my head. Two posts which I had set up
in the cave cracked.
I was alarmed, for I thought that the
roof was falling in, and fearing that I should
be buried in it, I ran to my ladder. I did
not feel safe here, for the rocks from the
hill might roll down upon me; so I got over
the fence, and as soon as I had stepped
down upon the ground I knew that it was
an earthquake.
The ground on which I stood shook three
times. The shocks were heavy enough to
overturn the strongest building in the
world. A great piece of the top of a rock,
which was about half a mile from me, near
the sea, fell down with a terrible noise such
as I had never heard in all my life.
I was so frightened that I grew faint and
sick. The falling of the rock aroused me,
and then I could think of nothing but the
hill falling upon my cabin.
After the third shock was over, I felt no
more, but I was still afraid to go over my
fence, and I sat upon the ground, not know-
ing what to do.
While here, the clouds gathered and it
looked as if it might rain. Soon after, the
wind began to blow, and in less than half
an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane.
The sea was white with foam, and the
shore was covered with water. Great trees
were torn up by the roots. It was a ter-
rible storm.
This lasted for three or four hours, then
it began to rain. All this time I sat upon
the ground, but when the rain began to
fall I went into my cabin. But it rained so
hard that I had to go into the cave, although
I was still afraid that it would fall upon my
head.
It rained all night and a great part of the
next day. I began to wonder what I would 
best do. I thought that if there were earth-
quakes on the island, it would not do to
live on the side of the hill beside the rocks.
So I determined to build a cabin away
from the hill, and then build a fence around
it; but I was settled so comfortably here
that I did not like to think of moving.
My tools were all so dull that 1 could not
do much chopping until they were sharp-
ened. I had a grindstone but I could not
turn it and grind my tools too.
At last I fastened a crank to the axle;
this crank I connected with a treadle by a
string; I worked this treadle with my foot,
that I might have both my hands to hold
the tools. Then I spent two days sharp-
ening them.
One morning I found, by the seaside, a
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had
seen, not because they were scarce, for
there were many on the side of the island which I had not visited. I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I
found afterward, but perhaps I should
have paid dear enough for them. I cooked
this one and found that it tasted better
than any food I had eaten since I landed.
Robinson Sick.
The day on which I found the turtle it
began to rain. It rained all day and it was
still raining the next morning.
It was usually too warm, but this rain felt
cold, and I was sick and chilly all day. At
night I could not sleep for the fever and
pain in my head.
I was no better in the morning, and I be-
came greatly frightened and did not know
what to do. I prayed to God, but I scarcely
knew what I said.
I was some better the fourth day, but
worse on the fifth. The sixth day I was
better again, but on the seventh I had
another chill and a burning fever.
The next day I was better again, and
having nothing to eat, I took my gun and
went out hunting. I killed a goat, but I
was so weak I could hardly carry it home.
The chill came again the next day and I
had to lie in bed. I was nearly dead with
thirst, but I was too weak to get any water.
I prayed to God, but all I could say was,
"Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me!
Lord, have mercy upon me!" After awhile
I fell asleep.
When I awoke it was far into the night
and I was very thirsty, but as there was no Robinson Sick. 41
water in my cabin, I had to do without un-
til morning. I went to sleep again and had
a strange dream.
I thought that my good father stood be-
fore me and called, "Robinson, Robinson."
I stretched out my arms and said, "Here I
am; here I am,"and then I fell back upon
the bed.
When I awoke, my mouth burned and I
feared I was going to die. Then I cried
out, "Lord, be my help, for I am in great
need!" I soon fell asleep again, and when
I awoke I felt better.
The first thing I did after getting up was
to fill a bottle with water and place it near
my bed. Then I broiled a piece of meat on
the coals, but I could eat very little. I
walked about, but was very weak, and I
felt sad thinking that the next day the chill
would return.
At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the
ashes. After I had eaten I tried to walk,
but I was too weak to carry a gun; so I went
but a little way and sat down upon the
ground, looking out over the sea, which lay
just before me, so beautiful and calm.
As I sat here I thought of my father and
mother. How kind they had always been
to me! I thought how terrible it would be
to die here all alone, and I prayed again to
God to help me and bring me home again.
Then I thought, "Why should God help
me? Have I not disobeyed His commands?
God wants us to obey our parents and love
them, but I have not done so. I have run
away from them and made them very un-
happy."
I walked back slowly to my cabin, lighted
my lamp, and sat down and wondered what
I could do to cure me of my sickness. I
went to one of the chests to see if I could not find some medicine. I did not find the
medicine, but during my search I found a
Bible.
I brought it to the table and tried to read,
but I was still dizzy and the letters danced
before my eyes; but I made out this verse:
"Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
These words comforted me. I began to
grow sleepy, so, leaving my lamp burning,
I went to bed. But before I lay down, I
knelt and asked God to take care of me.
Then I fell asleep and did not wake until
almost three o'clock the next day, much re-
freshed, and when I got up I felt stronger.
From this time on I grew better each
day, although it was several weeks before I
fully recovered. I kept thinking of that
verse, "I will deliver thee." I wondered
how God would deliver me. Then I thought,
"Has He not done so? I was delivered from the wreck and from my sickness. And
how have I glorified Him?" I fell on my knees and thanked God for
all His kindness to me.

Robinson Explores the Island.
When I was well again, I started out to
see more of my island home. At first I had
been afraid of wild animals and men, but now I said, "God has taken care of me so
far and I believe He will keep me from
harm all the time."
One morning in July, I started out, going
up the creek which flowed past my house.
On both sides of it lay beautiful meadows
covered with grass, and many plants were
growing on its banks. I tried to find a kind
of root out of which the Indians make their
bread, but I found none.
The next day I went up the stream
again, but I went farther. I found that
beyond the meadows were thick woods.
In this part I found melons and grapes
that were sweet and ripe.
When night came I was so far from home
that I did not try to get back. I slept well
in a tree, and the next morning I continued
my journey about four miles, through a
valley with hills on each side. At the end
of this valley I came to an opening, where Explores the Island. 47
there was a little spring of cold water, and
everything looked fresh and green.
I saw cocoa trees, orange, lemon, and
citron trees. From these I gathered more
fruit than I could carry home. I filled my
pockets as full as I could, and left a great
heap of it lying on the ground, thinking I
would come again. Before I got home the
grapes were spoiled.
The next day I went back, having made
two small bags in which to carry my fruit.
I was surprised upon coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine, to find
them all scattered about, trodden to pieces,
and many of them eaten.
I knew that some animal must have done
this, so after that when I wanted to save
grapes I put them on the branches of the
trees where they would dry. In this way I
could have a supply of raisins. This time
I took as many lemons as I could carry.
This place was so beautiful that I thought
I would like to live here, and I looked
around for a spot upon which to build my
house. But after I had thought about it, I
remembered that now my home was near
the sea, where I hoped some day to see a
ship. Or, if some one should be ship-
wrecked as I had been, I should be near to
help him.
I liked the woods so well, that I built a
kind of bower where I could stay when I
chose. I put up a strong fence of poles and
brushwood, and used a ladder as I did in
my other home. I called this my country
home.
Just after I had finished my country
house, the rainy season came on and I had
to stay in my cabin.
On September thirtieth, I counted up the
notches on my post, and found that I had
been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I spent this day in religious worship.
I knelt down and prayed God to forgive my
sins. I fasted for twelve hours, then I ate
a biscuit and a bunch of raisins and went to
bed.
During the rainy season I stayed in my
cabin as much as I could, but I always
found work to do. I needed baskets very
much, and I had tried several ways of mak-
ing them. But all of the twigs that I could
get were too brittle.
One day while at my country house, I
found some willow twigs that seemed tough.
I cut them and let them dry, and then car-
ried them to my cabin.
I made my baskets of these, in the rainy
season. This business was not new to me,
for when I was a boy, I used to like to
watch a basketmaker who lived in our town,
and sometimes he would let me help him.
Another Trip.
In order to know still more about my
island, I got ready for a longer trip. I took
my gun and dog, a hatchet, and some bis-
cuits and raisins.
I went beyond my country house to a
place where I could see the ocean on the
other side of the island. Away off across
the water I saw more land. I thought it
must be some part of America, or perhaps
another island.
This side of the island seemed more pleas-
ant than my side, for there were many beau-
tiful flowers and trees here. In the woods
near by, birds were singing their songs and
flitting from tree to tree. There were also
a great many parrots with their gay plum-
Another Trip. 51
age. I caught a young one and carried it
home, that I might teach it to talk.
I also saw many small wild animals, but
I shot none as I did not wish to waste my
powder. On the seashore I was surprised
to see the sand nearly covered with turtles.
I put a stake into the ground for a land-
mark, thinking that on the next journey
which I took, I would go around the seacoast the other way until I came to my post.
I was ready to go home now and I took a
new way. I had not gone far when I found
myself in a large valley with hills all around
covered with woods. My only guide was
the sun, and the weather was hazy for three
or four days, so that I lost my way.
I wandered about for a long time and at
last found my post and went home the same
way that I had come.
On the way home Barri caught a young
goat and saved it alive, and I took it home to tame. I made a collar for the little thing
out of some string which I always carried
with me and led it to my country home and
there I left it.
After being away from home a month, I
was very anxious to get back, and I cannot
tell what a pleasure it was to me to come
into my cabin and lie down in my hammock
again.
I rested for a week after my journey, and
while doing so I made a cage for Polly.
Then I began to think of the little kid I had
left penned up. I went out to it and found
it nearly starved. After I fed it, it became
so tame and gentle that it followed me like
a dog, and it became a great pet.
His Garden. 53
His Garden.
I found now that there were two seasons
upon the island, one rainy and the other
dry. Prom the middle of February till the
middle of April, it was rainy; from the mid-
dle of April to the middle of August, it was
dry; from the middle of August till the mid-
dle of October, rainy; from the middle of
October till the middle of February, dry.
One year I planted my seed on the first
of May and it did not sprout. The next
season I planted some early in August and
the rain coming soon, it grew nicely.
So I found that there were two seed times
and two harvests. I planted my garden and
in October and November it looked well. I
thought, "What a fine harvest I am going to have." But one day I saw that some
wild goats and hares were eating off the
tender blades of the grain.
I knew of nothing that I could do to keep
them away unless I built a close fence, so I
went to work at this and at the end of three
weeks it was done.
But this fence could not save my grain,
for one day when it was nearly ripe I saw a
great many birds in my garden. I shot at
them and a great flock arose; this made me
feel badly for I knew that unless I could do
something immediately they would eat up
all my grain and I might starve.
I went into the garden and found that
they had spoiled some already, and as I was
coming away I saw the thieves sitting upon
all the trees about me as if waiting until I
should go away.
Sure enough, as soon as I had gone a
short distance, down they flew. I fired my gun at them and killed three. These I hung
up to scare the others away, and they did
not come back.
When the grain was ripe I hardly knew
now to harvest it as I had neither scythe
nor sickle. But I remembered a broad
sword that I had brought from the ship and
this did very well. I carried the grain home
in the baskets which I had made, and rub-
bed it out with my hands.
I had a large stock of rice and with my
new harvest I had more. The third plant-
ing brought me over a bushel of wheat and
as much rice. The fourth planting brought
five bushels of wheat and still more of rice.
Next time I planted two bushels of each
kind and gathered more than forty bushels
of both. Then I had all of the grain that I
needed.
It might be truly said that now I worked
for my bread.
I had no plow to turn up the earth; no
spade nor shovel to dig with; so I spent
many days making a wooden spade. I had
no harrow, so I had to go over the ground
dragging a great heavy bough of a tree to
break the clods of earth and make the
ground smooth.
Now that I had wheat how could I grind
it? And if I had it ground into flour, how
could I make bread of it? Then how could
I bake the bread if I had the flour? I spent
many hours planning how all these things
could be done.
Robinson a Cook.
The rainy season coming on again, I had
to work in the house. I taught my parrot
to speak, and I was very glad when she
could say, ''Polly wants a cracker, cracker."
I found that I needed some jars and
plates very much, so I studied how to make
some. I looked around and found a certain
kind of clay which I thought would do.
It would make you pity me or laugh at
me were I to tell you of the queer shaped
things I formed; but at last I made some which I dried in the sun, and they held my
rice and grain very well.
But what I wished for most was some-
thing in which to cook my food. Some
time after I made my first jars I had a
hot fire for cooking my meat, and when I
went to put it out I found a broken piece of
one of my jars in the fire. It was burned
as hard as stone and as red as tile. I was
surprised to see this, and I said to myself,
"Why not burn whole jars and make them
hard like this piece?"
So I went to work and made some more
kettles and jars, and although they were
not very smooth and round, yet they did
very well.
Next I placed the three largest vessels
close together, with a good bed of live coals
under them. I made a big fire all around
them, but hardly had the flames begun to
shoot up when I heard "crack! crack!" and Robinson a Cook. 59
one vessel fell to pieces. I said to myself,
"I believe it is too hot." So I put some of
the fire out. As the others did not crack,
I kept up the fire and after a while they
turned a bright red.
I thought this was all right, and I stayed
up the whole night to watch the burning of
my pottery. "Now," said I, "they are
ready to use." But I found that something
was the matter. They crumbled and fell
to pieces.
I did not know what to do now, but I dug
a deep hole and laid stones about it. Then
I made a small fire in the hole and put in
my jars. I kept making the fire a little
hotter, and after a few hours they were all
a glowing red. Then it seemed as though
they would all melt, so I let the fire go
down.
I could hardly wait for them to cool before
trying them. This time they were well baked, for they had been in the fire just
long enough.
I put some meat into one of them, with
water and rice, and set it on the fire. It
cooked well and tasted very good, better
than any I had had since I came to the
island. Some salt, which I found near the
sea on one of my trips, gave just the right
flavor.
I had worked so hard on my jars that I
had forgotten to write the days in my cal-
endar. I found that the next day would be
Sunday. I wished to spend it in the right
way, for I thought of what the Bible says:
"Six days thou shalt labor and do all thy
work, but the seventh is the Sabbath of
the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do
any work."
When I had eaten my supper I went to
sleep, and in the morning I wakened just
as the sun was lighting up the hilltops. I jumped up quickly and offered my morning
prayer. Then I milked my goats and drank
the milk for breakfast.
After breakfast I went out into the morn-
ing air, where the birds were singing their
beautiful songs and everything was glad.
I took off my hat and sang too. I never
before felt so thankful to God. Then I
knelt down and prayed before a palm tree
as before an altar, pouring forth my thank-
fulness.
I had been thinking for a long time how
I could make flour out of my wheat. First
of all I needed a mill. "If I had a mortar,"
thought I, "I could crush the grain in that."
I hunted many days for a large hollow
stone for a mortar, but I could not find one;
and I had no tools to cut one out of the
solid rock. Besides, rocks were sandy, and
they would not do. At last I gave up look-
ing for a stone and began to hunt for a block of hard wood. After I had found one
large enough, I rounded it off with my
hatchet, and then with much hard work
and the help of fire, I made a hollow place
in it.
After this I made a heavy pestle of iron-
wood.
The next thing was to make a sieve, and
this was a hard thing to do. I had no cloth
which I could use for it; I had goat's hair,
but I did not know how to weave it.
After a long time I found some coarse
muslin in one of the chests, and with some
of this I made three sieves which did the
work very well.
The baking was the next thing to plan
for, and as I had no oven, I made some
dishes that were broad and not deep.
These I burned in the fire as I had done
the others.
When I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth. After the fire had
burned into live coals I drew them forward
upon the hearth so as to cover it all over.
When the hearth was very hot I swept
away the coals and placed a loaf there.
Then I covered it with one of my dishes,
and drew the coals all around the outside of
the dish, to keep in the heat and make
more. In this way I baked my bread, and
after a time I made puddings.
It took me nearly a year to make all
these things. I could not work at it all of
the time for I had my garden to take care
of and other work to do.
Robinson Makes a Boat.
While I was at work I often thought
about the land which I had seen across the
water,and I could not help but wish to go
there. I thought that perhaps people lived
there, and if I could reach it I might at last
get home.
Eobinson Makes a Boat. 165
Many times I wished for a boat so that I
might sail over to that country.
I began to think then that perhaps I
might make a canoe out of the trunk of a
tree. This seemed quite easy to do.
So I went to work, first cutting down a
fine cedar tree. It was five feet ten inches
in diameter at the stump, and four feet
eleven inches at the distance of twenty-two
feet farther up.
I was over two weeks cutting this tree
down and as long trimming off the branches.
Then I spent a month in shaping it, and
three times as long in digging out the inside.
When I had the work done, I was very
much pleased with it. It would carry twenty-six men, and was large enough to hold me
and everything I had.
The boat was about one-half hour's walk
from the ocean, and there was a small hill
to go over. I began to dig through this hill to make a sort of trench; but when this was
done I could not stir the boat.
Then I thought that I would cut a canal
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could
not bring the canoe to the water. Well, I
began this work, but when I thought how
deep it must be and how broad, I knew it
would take me at least ten years to finish it.
Thus I had to give up this boat. I felt
very sorry about it, for I had worked hard
to make it. But I learned too late how
foolish it is to begin a work before counting
all the cost.
RobinsonaTailor.
I had now been on the island so long that
many things which I had brought from the
ship were nearly used up. My ink had been
gone for some time. I put in some water
and made it last as long as I could, but it
was so pale that the words on the paper
were scarcely visible.
My clothes, too, were old and ragged, for
I had worn them in the rain and in doing a
great deal of hard work. I had brought
some clothing from the ship, but I had
worn that out.
Now I must look out for some new clothes.
I had plenty of money, but what good could
that do me here? If I had been at home I
could have bought many fine clothes with
it, but it was of no use to me now.
For a long time I did not know from what
to make my clothes. Then I remembered
that I had saved all of the skins of the goats
I had killed, and dried them in the sun.
These might do for cloth, but how could I
make them?
First, I took my measure for a jacket. I
found that I would need three skins—one
for the back, one for the front, and one for
the sleeves.
Next, I cut them into four-cornered pieces.
It took a long time to sew them together,
and I made but poor work of it. If I was a
bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
The sleeves made me the most trouble
because they had to be sewed in at the
shoulders to the other parts. It took me
nearly two days to make the jacket, but
when it was finished it was just the thing.
I put the hair on the outside to turn the
rain, and it kept off the heat, also.
I made some leggings, and then a cap—all out of skins. The cap looked like a large
cone and it was somewhat longer behind
than in front, so as to keep the rain and the
heat from my neck. I was very proud of
my suit when it was finished.
After this, I spent much time in making
an umbrella from skins. I spoiled two or
three before I made one that suited me. I
wanted it so that I could shut it up, for
I could not always carry it open. At last I
made one, and now I could go out in the
hottest weather, for it kept off the heat.
He Makes a Smaller Canoe.
For five years after this, nothing unusual
happened to me, but I lived on in the same
way as before. I had my regular work of
taking care of my garden, curing my raisins,
and hunting.
He Makes a Smaller Canoe. 71
Besides this, I was working upon another
canoe. As for the first one, it lay just
where I had made it, as a reminder to me
to be wiser hereafter.
The second boat was about half a mile
from the water, for I could find no tree
nearer that would do. It was smaller than
the first, and by digging a canal to it, six
feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it
to the creek.
This little boat would not serve for such
a trip as I had planned with the other one,
but it would do to sail around my island in.
I fitted up a mast in it and made a sail
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails
that I still had. Then I made a trial trip
and found that it would sail very well.
I made little boxes at each end in which
to put powder and other things which were
to be kept dry. Then I cut a long hollow
place in the side of it where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.
To keep the heat of the sun off, I fixed
my umbrella in a step at the stern. Once
in a while I took a little trip down the creek
and out on the ocean, but I did not go far.
At last I got ready for a trip around the
island. I put in some bread, rice, powder,
and shot, and two large watch-coats which
I had saved from the ship, one to lie upon
and the other to cover me at night.
It was in November, in the sixth year of my stay, that I started out on this trip; and
it proved to be a longer one than I had ex-
pected.
It was not that the island was so large,
but when I came to the east side I found a
ledge of rocks reaching far out into the
ocean, and beyond this was a strip of sand.
To get around this I had to go out a long
way into the sea.
When I first saw these rocks, I thought I
would go back home. I anchored my boat,
and taking my gun I climbed a hill. After
looking about from its top, I made up my
mind to try to go on in my boat.
The sea being a little rough, I staid on
shore for two days. But on the third day
the sea was calm again and I started out.
When I reached the point, suddenly the
boat began to go faster, and to my dismay
I saw that a strong current was carrying me
out to sea. I could do nothing with my
paddle, and there was no wind. I feared
that unless some help came soon I should
be lost.
Now that I was being carried away from
my island home out into the ocean it
seemed to me the most pleasant home in
the world. I stretched out my hands to it,
wishing I were there once more. Then I
thought, "I was not happy while I was there, but we never know how to enjoy
what we have, until it is lost to us."
As I have said, there was no wind to help
me, but I worked hard, and after a while I
felt a little breeze. Then it blew quite a
gale and I thought that now I might save
myself.
By this time I was a long way from the
island and if it had not been clear I should
certainly have been lost, for I should not
have known which way to go.
I soon found that the current had changed
and by hard work and the help of the wind
I sailed out of it. Upon nearing the shore
I found that it was the opposite side of the
island from where I had started.
As soon as I reached the land again, I
fell upon my knees and gave thanks toGod
for saving me. I brought my boat close to
the shore, into a little cove, and after eat-
ing some food, I went to sleep, for I was
very tired.
In the morning I hardly knew how to re-
turn home. I did not care to try going by
water after being so nearly lost the day be-
fore. I looked along the shore and several
miles further I found a small creek flowing
into the ocean, and into it I brought my
boat. I drew it up on the shore, where it
would be safe, and left it.
Taking my umbrella and gun, I started
on foot for home. Not far away was my
old landmark and before evening I reached
my country house. Here everything was
just as I had left it. I got over the fence
and lay down in the shade to rest and soon
fell asleep.
You may imagine my surprise upon being
awakened by some one calling my name.
The voice said, "Robin, Robin, Robin Cru-
soe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
have you been? Poor Robin Crusoe?"
I was sleeping so soundly that it seemed
like a dream. But the voice kept on saying
''Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe! Poor Robin
Crusoe!" At last I awoke, greatly fright-
ened.
I looked around and there on the fence
sat Polly blinking her eyes and chattering
away. Holding out my hand I said, "Come
here, Polly, pretty Polly!'' She flew down
to me and sitting on my shoulder laid her
head against my face and kept saying,
"Robin, Robin Crusoe! Where have you
been? Poor Robin Crusoe!"—just as if she
were very happy to see me again.
I had enough of sailing now for a time,
but I often wished that the boat were on my
side of the island.
Robinson's Flocks.
At the end of eleven years on the island I
found that my ammunition was beginning
to run low. I therefore planned to catch
some goats, tame them, and have my own
flocks. By doing this I should save both
time and ammunition. I already had one
tame goat. I wondered what I could do to
catch more.
At first I made traps of rope, and baited
them, and I am sure I caught some goats in
these, but the ropes were rotten and would
not hold; so I dug some pits three or four
feet deep and covered them with small
branches of trees. The next morning I
found that I had caught three young kids.
I tied them together and managed with much trouble to get them home. When I
got them there I had no good place to keep
them, so I set about finding a pasture, one
where there would be plenty of grass, water,
and shade.
I soon found a place that suited me well,
and began to enclose a very large pasture,
which would require two miles of fence. I
changed my mind,however, after thinking
more about it, not because I had not time
to make so long a fence, for I had time
enough to make it five times as long had
I cared for such an one, but with such a
large pasture,how could I tame my goats?
They would be nearly as free as they were
in the woods, and I could never catch one
where there was so much space in which to
chase it.
I therefore decided to fence in about a
quarter of an acre. When I should need
more pasture, I could enclose more land. While I was making the fence I kept my
goats tied near me that they might become
used to me, and very often I would carry
them a handful of wheat or of rice, which
they learned to eat out of my hand. It
took about three months to make my fence.
By the time it was done the goats would
follow me up and down the pasture calling
for grain.
After three years I had forty-three goats,
and, besides, I had killed several for food.
At different times I fenced in more pas-
ture, until I had five pieces of ground
fenced, with little pens opening out of each,
and gates leading from one pasture into
another.
I had not only plenty of meat, but I had
plenty of milk as well—sometimes a gallon
or two a day—and after many failures I
learned to make very good butter and
cheese.
Robinson's Manner of Living.
It would have made you smile to see me
and my little family sit down to dinner.
There was our majesty, the lord of the
whole island. My subjects were under my
complete control, and there were no rebels
among them.
How like a king I sat at my table all
alone, attended by my servants. Poll was Robinson's Manner op Living. 81
the only person allowed to talk to me. My
dog, who was now very old and crazy, sat
always at my right hand, and the cats at my
left. I needed nothing to add to my hap-
piness but society.
My dress was very odd. Any one in
England would have been frightened at
meeting such a man, or else he would have
laughed at him. There was my great, high,
shapeless cap, made of goat skin, with a flap
hanging down behind to keep the sun and
rain off of my neck; my short coat of goat's
skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same material. The
breeches were made of the skin of an old
goat whose hair hung down so long that it
reached to the middle of my legs. I wore
a pair of leggings laced up on the outer side.
Around my waist I wore a broad belt of
goat's skin, which was laced together by leather strings. From one side of it hung
my hatchet, from the other, my saw. Over
my shoulder I wore another belt, not so
broad as the first, and from this, under my
left arm,hung two pouches, both made of
goat's skin, in one of which I carried my
powder, and in the other, my shot. On my
back I carried my basket, on my shoulder
my gun, and over my head my great, clumsy,
ugly umbrella, which, after all, was the
most necessary thing I had, next to my gun.
Near my home, but upon lower ground,
were my two corn-fields which I ploughed and
sowed every year, and which yielded me
good harvests. My vineyard I also cared
for, and the raisins that I made were not
only pleasant to eat, but were healthful,
as well.
Alarm.
ALARM.One day, about noon, I was walking
along the shore toward my boat, when,
looking down, I saw in the sand the print
of a man's naked foot. I was very much
frightened at this. I made use of all my
eyes and ears but I could neither see nor
hear anyone, so I went to the top of a hill that I might look off some distance; but
there was no one in sight. I went again
to the shore and walked to and fro, search-
ing in the sand, but there was no other
footprint to be seen and I could not imagine
how this one came to be there.
It was growing late, and I started for
home, looking behind me at every three or
four steps, and thinking every stump I saw
at a distance was a man.
When I came to my cave, which I now
named my castle, I ran into it as if I were
chased by wolves.
I could not sleep that night. I thought
and thought about that footprint, and made
up my mind that some savages from the
mainland had come over in canoes, but had
gone away to sea again, being as unwilling
to stay on the island as I was to have them.
I felt very grateful that I was not near
when they landed, and that they had not Alarm. 85
seen my boat; for if they had seen it, very
likely they would have hunted the island
over for its owner.
One morning when I was worrying over
this discovery, these words from the Bible
came again to my mind, "Call upon me in
the day of trouble; I will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me." I prayed to God to
deliver me from my enemies, then rose from
my bed greatly comforted.
For three days and nights I had not
stirred from my castle, so that I was in
much need of food; for I had nothing in the
house but some wheat cakes and water.
My goats, too, needed to be milked, and I
started at last for my country house to milk
them. After I had gone down there and
back for two or three days and had seen no
one, I began to feel less alarm.
Robinson Prepares for Trouble.
My business for the present was to make
myself safe against an enemy. The first
thing that I planned to do was to make
another tight fence around my castle out-
side of the first fence. About twelve years
before this, I had planted a double row of
trees here, where I wished to make a sec-
ond fortification. These trees stood close
together, so I had to drive in but a few
posts to make a thicker and stronger fence
than the first one.
In this outer fence or wall I made seven
little holes about as big around as my arm.
Through these seven holes I put seven mus-
kets, which I fitted into frames which held
them in place, so that they looked much
like small cannons. I could fire all of these Prepares for Trouble. 87
seven guns in two minutes' time. The inner
wall I thickened until it was ten feet through.
This I did by taking dirt from my cave.
Outside of the outer wall, and some dis-
tance from it, I stuck all the ground for a
great way out, with twigs of willow, which
grow quickly, and in five or six years' time
I had a wood about my home, so very thick
and strong that no one would think of a
house being within, and if anyone had tried
to get through, he could not have done so.
For myself, I planned to go in and out by
two ladders—one to lead from the outside
of my outer wall to a shelf of rock, and the
other to lead from this shelf of rock to the
top of the hill. When the two ladders were
down, no man living could come down to
me without getting hurt; and even if one
could get down, he would still be outside the
outer wall.
The next question to answer was, "How shall I keep my goats out of the way of ene-
mies?" This is the plan that I made: I
would fence in three or four pastures far
away from one another, and well hidden by
trees; then I would divide my flock, so that
if one pasture were found by them, the
others might be safe.
So I went out in search of good pasture
land, and found a little damp piece in the
middle of a hollow, with woods all around
it. These woods were so thick that I nearly
got lost myself. There were about three
acres in this piece. I worked about a month
fencing it in, then I brought twelve goats to
it. These, I thought, were quite secure.
Later on, I fenced in two more pastures
and put tame goats into them.
For two years after my fright, I was very
careful not to fire my gun, though I never
went without one, and I carried two pistols
in my goat-skin belt.
I moved my boat to the east end of the
island where I ran it into a little sheltered
place. I thought that no one be likely to
find it here.
I seldom went away from home except to
milk and care for my goats. I did not dare
drive a nail or chop a stick of wood, for fear
the noise would be heard by someone. I
felt afraid, too, every time I made a fire,
that the smoke would tell where I was hid-
ing. So I made some charcoal by burning
wood under turf till it became dry coal.
This dry coal or charcoal would burn with-
out making any smoke.
A DISCOVERY.
I was cutting off some branches of trees
one day to make charcoal, when I saw,
back of the trees, an open place. I looked
into it and found that it was a cave, so
high that I could stand up in it. But I
came out much faster than I had gone in,
for as I looked into the cave, which was per-
fectly dark, I saw two large shining eyes,
twinkling like two stars.
I did not dare to leave the place without
finding out to what those eyes belonged,
so I took up a stick of burning wood and
rushed into the cave with it in my hand.
I had not gone more than three steps when
I was frightened as badly as at first; for I
heard a very loud sigh, as if some man were A Discovery. 91
in pain. After this there was a mumbling
sound as of words half spoken, then another
deep sigh.
I stepped back and broke out into a cold
sweat; but soon I went on again into the
cave, and by the light of a stick held a little
above my head, I saw a great goat lying on
the ground gasping for breath, and dying of
old age. I stirred him a little to see if I
could get him out, but he could not stand
up, and I comforted myself thinking that
no savage would go into that cave while the
goat lived, at any rate.
This cave was not very large, but at the
further end, to the right, was a small pas-
sage, so low that one must creep on his
hands and knees to get through it. Having
no candle, I could not go into that part of
the cave, but I planned to come next day
and bring lights with me.
So on the following day I came with my candles, made of goat's tallow, and passed
through the low opening. I crept along on
my hands and knees about ten yards; at
the end of this long, low hall the roof sud-
denly rose to the height of twenty feet.
This was a most beautiful room. The
walls and ceilings reflected a thousand lights
from my two candles. The floor was dry
and level and had loose gravel upon it, and
there was no dampness about the roof or
sides of the cave. I thought, '' Surely,
here is a place of safety, and I will bring to
it some of the things I am most anxious to
save—my powder and five guns, at least.
The old goat died that night, and I took
full possession of the cave.
Return of the Savages.
About a year and a half had passed after
my discovery of the footprint, when, one
morning, I was surprised by seeing five
canoes drawn up on shore on my side of
the island. The people were all landed.
I knew that these canoes carried from four to six men, and I was at a loss to know
how to resist so many alone, so I lay still in
my castle for a long time.
As I could hear no noise, I at length set
my guns against the foot of the ladder and
climbed to the top of the hill. I could not
be seen here but I could see the men
through my glass. There were not less
than thirty of them.
They had kindled a fire and seemed to
be cooking their dinner and dancing around
it. I then saw two miserable beings dragged
out from the boats, to be killed. One of
these men they knocked down, while the
other was left standing alone until they
should be ready for him.
This savage seeing a little chance for
life, darted away from his captors. He ran
very fast right toward my home. I was
dreadfully frightened when I saw this, for I
thought all the savages were after him. I Return of the Savages. 95
soon saw, however, that only three of the
men were following the runaway and he
was gaining ground on these, so that if he
could hold out at that rate he would be be-
yond their reach in half an hour. On coming to the creek he jumped in
and swam over. Two of the savages swam
after him, but the third one gave up the
chase and went back to the shore.
I thought, "Now is my chance to get
me a servant, if I can save this poor fel-
low's life;" so I ran down the ladder,
fetched my two guns and rushed out so as
to stand between him and the two savages
who were following him.
I called to the runaway, who was at first
as much frightened at me as at his two
enemies. Then I motioned for him to
come back and at the same time I went
toward the two savages, rushing at the
head one and knocking him down with my gun. I feared to fire lest those on the
shore should hear.
The second savage stopped when the
first one was knocked down, but I saw that
he was fitting an arrow into his bow, so I
shot at him and killed him.
The poor savage who saw both of his
enemies fall was so frightened by the noise
of my gun that he seemed about to run
away. I called to him again and beckoned
to him to come nearer, and he came a little
way. By a great deal of coaxing I got him
to come to me at last. He threw himself
at my feet, and placed my foot on his head
to show me that he would be my servant
forever. I raised him up and treated him
kindly.
But there was more work to be done.
The savage who was knocked down was
only stunned, and he was sitting up. This
frightened the runaway very much. I raised my gun as if I would fire at the sav-
age. At this the runaway made a motion
for me to let him take my sword, which
hung naked in my belt, at my side.
As soon as he had the sword he ran at
his enemy and cut off his head at one blow.
Then he took the head and ran to me and
laid it and the sword at my feet, laughing
as he did so. I signed to him to follow
me, for fear others should search for him.
Getting Acquainted With the New
Servant.
My savage made signs that he would
bury his two enemies, and I made signs to
him to do so.
Getting Acquainted. 99
This being done, I took him to my cave
and gave him some bread, a bunch of rais-
ins, and a cup of water, then told him, by
motions, to lie down and sleep on some rice
straw and a blanket which I placed there
for him.
While he was sleeping I had a chance to
study him more closely. He was a fine
looking fellow, tall and straight. He had a
manly, pleasant face, plump and round.
His hair was long and black, his forehead
high and broad, and he had bright, spark-
ling, black eyes. His skin was quite dark,
though not black. I think he was about
twenty-five years old.
When he awoke he looked for me. I was
out milking my goats. As soon as he saw
me he ran to me, threw himself flat on the
ground, and, taking one of my feet, placed
it on his head as before, to show how he
would serve me.
I let him know that his name was to be
Friday, which was the day on which his life
was saved, and I taught him that he was to
call me master.
Taking a cup of milk, I drank some of it
and moistened my bread in some. I gave
Friday a cup of milk; he did the same thing
with his bread, showing by signs that he
thought it very good.
After supper, I started with Friday to
the shore. He carried my sword and one
gun, and I carried two others.
When we came to the place where the
dreadful feast had been made, I grew faint
at the sight. It was covered with the re-
mains of the bodies of the poor savages.
I told Friday to gather these up and burn
them.
He would have eaten some of the flesh,
but I showed such anger at this that he did
not offer again to take any.
When we went back to the cave I gave
Friday a pair of goat-skin trousers, a goat-
-skin coat, and a cap made of hare's skin.
He was very proud of his clothes, though
he hardly knew how to get around at first,
when dressed in them, for he had never
worn clothes.
Now I wondered where I should make a
bed for Friday. I wanted to do well by
him, and yet I wished to feel safe myself,
so I made a tent for him in the space be-
tween the two fences.
This tent opened by a door into my yard.
The door was made to lock from the inside,
and I locked it and took in my ladder every
night, so that Friday could not reach me.
Had I known what a true friend he was to
me, I should not have wanted to lock him
out.
I learned from Friday, later, that he
came from the mainland, and that there were several tribes of Indians there who
were constantly at war with one another.
The army that won the battle would feast
on the prisoners which they had taken.
Some of these feasts were kept on my
island!
RobinsonaTeacher.
Friday, after a while, knew English so
well that I could talk to him about anything
that I wished.
I taught him that there is one God who made everything, and that He loves men
as a father loves his children, and that He
cares for them even more tenderly than
does a father. When Christmas time came
I taught him about Jesus.
I told him how I happened to be on the
island, and how long I had been there, and
what a hard time I had had at first to get
food and make a home, and how lonely I
had been until he came.
I taught him to shoot a gun. At first,
every time that he heard it he was so frightened that he trembled, but he soon
got over that.
I also taught Friday how to plant and
harvest the wheat and rice, and how to
make baskets and dishes. He milked the
goats every morning and evening, and
made butter and cheese.
One day it had been very warm, and
toward evening the sky was covered with
dark clouds. It began to thunder and
lightning, and Friday cowered away into a
dark corner of the house. I could not
think why it was that he was so frightened
and trembled so all over; so I said,
''Friday, what is the matter?" There was
no answer.
"Well, well," thought I, "is Friday
afraid of thunder and lightning as so many
people are?'' That was the case, for when
it thundered louder he trembled still more.
"Listen to me, Friday," I said, "if it thunders again do not be afraid, for God is
not angry. He is a kind and loving Father.
He can do anything that He wishes but
He does nothing that is not good for His
children."
Robinson Prepares for a Journey.
One day when Friday and I were walking
by the shore I said to him, "Do you not
wish you were in your own country?"
"Yes," said Friday, "I be much O glad
to be at my own country."
''What would you do there? Would you
be a man eater such as you used to be?"
Friday shook his head and said, "No, no;
Friday tell them to live good and pray to
God; tell them to eat corn, bread, and
cattle-flesh and drink milk; no eat man
again."
"But, Friday, they will kill you."
"Oh, no," said Friday, "they no kill me,
they will love learn.''
"Then will you go, Friday?" I asked.
Friday shook his head and said, "How
go? Friday no swim so far."
"I will make you a canoe, Friday, if you
want to go home," said I.
''Then Friday go, if you go," said Friday.
"But they will eat me, Friday."
"Oh, no, master, me make them no eat
you. Me make them much love you." Then
he told me how kind they had been to sev-
enteen white men who were thrown on shore
by a terrible storm.
When I heard this I began to think
strongly of going with Friday, hoping that by joining with the seventeen white men
there, we might find some way to cross the
ocean and get home. I took Friday to see
the boats that I had made. He thought
that the first one was too small. He liked
the size of the larger boat, but it was cracked
and rotten. He said that we could sail over
to his country in one of that size.
So now a new boat must be made, and
this time I wished to choose a tree near the
shore, that we might launch the boat without
trouble.
At last Friday found a good tree, for he
knew much more about the trees on the
island than I did. He was going to burn
out the inside of it, but I showed him how
to cut it out with tools. This he did very
handily.
In about a month the boat was done, and
a fine vessel it was. I asked Friday if it
would do. He said, "Yes, we go over in
her very well, though great blow wind."
But I did not intend to start out in the
boat as it was. I found a good cedar tree
and had Friday cut it down and shape it as
I directed. This was my mast.
But what should I do for a sail? There
were many pieces of old sails which I had
had twenty-six years, but they were mostly rotten. I looked them over carefully and
found two large pieces which were quite
good; these I sewed together. It took
about two months to get the mast and sail
ready.
My next piece of work was the making of
a rudder, which I fastened to the stern of
the vessel.
When the boat was all ready I taught
Friday how to use the rudder, and he be-
came a good sailor.
But we had to wait for good weather, for
it was now fall. I had been on the island
twenty-six years. I kept this anniversary
with a grateful heart. The last three years
had been much the happiest of my life here,
for Friday had been a faithful and true
friend to me.
I had brought the boat up the creek to
keep it from the storms and Friday had
covered it so thickly with the boughs of trees that the rain could scarcely get through
at all. Then we waited for November and
December, at which time we intended to
start on our voyage.
New Trouble.
The rainy season was now over and
Friday and I began to get ready for our
journey.
One morning I sent Friday to the shore
for a turtle. He had not been gone long
when he came rushing back, out of breath,
crying, "Oh, master! Oh, master! Oh,
sorrow! Oh, death!"
"What is the matter, Friday?" I asked.
"Oh, master, yonder there, one, two,
three canoes—one, two, three; carry Friday
off, cut Friday in pieces and eat him," cried
he, trembling from head to foot.
''Do not be afraid, Friday," said I. ''We
will go out and fight them. They shall not
carry you off, if you will help me fight.
Now will you do all that I tell you to do?"
''Me shoot," cried Friday, ''but there
come many number."
"Never mind that, Friday, just do as I
tell you."
Seeing me so cool, Friday became more
quiet himself.
We loaded two pistols and four guns with
bullets, then I hung my great sword by my
side and gave Friday a hatchet.
When we were ready, I took my spy-
-glass and went up the hill, to see what had
become of the boats. There I saw twenty-

one savages and two prisoners in three
canoes. They were coming, as before, to
make a feast.
I went down and told Friday that I
wanted to kill all of the savages, and asked
him if he were going to help me.
He said, "Friday die, if master say die."
I gave Friday one pistol to hang in his
belt and three guns to carry upon his shoul-
der, and a large pouch full of powder and
bullets. I took one pistol and the other
gun and told Friday to keep close behind
me.
We went through the woods so that the
savages should not see us until we came
near enough to them to shoot.
When we came near to the place where
the savages had landed I said to Friday,
"Go to that great tree there and see if you
can find out what they are doing."
Friday obeyed at once and came back bringing word that the men could be seen
plainly. He said they were all about the
fire eating the flesh of one of the prisoners
and another was lying bound upon the sand
near them; they would kill him next. He
was a white man with a beard.
When I heard thiswe moved toward the
savages, but kept out of their sight. We
were still about fifty yards from them and
there was no time to lose. Nineteen sav-
ages sat on the ground huddled close together
while two of them were stooping down to
untie the bands of the white man.
"Now, Friday, do as I tell you," I said
''Do exactly as you see me do." At this I
took my gun and aimed at the savages.
Friday did the same. "Now fire," said I,
and we both fired together. Three sav-
ages were killed and several others were
wounded.
They all jumped up but they did not know which way to look or which way to
run. I threw down my gun and grabbed
another. Friday did the same. We both
aimed at the savages and shot at the same
time. Two more were killed and several
more wounded.
''Now, Friday, follow me," I said, throw-
ing down my gun and picking up my pistol.
Then I rushed out of the wood, Friday fol-
lowing closely. We both screamed and ran
down to the prisoner. Five of the savages
jumped into a canoe. I told Friday to fire
at them while I set the poor prisoner free.
As soon as I had cut the bands that held
the white man and he had gotten over his
fright somewhat, he was able to help us
fight the savages. Only four got away in
a canoe and one of these was wounded.
The others were all killed.
Friday wanted very much that I should
follow the four in the canoe, and I also wished to do so, that no savages might be
left to carry the news to their home. If
they were to hear of this, great numbers
might come over and kill us; so I ran to
one of the canoes, jumped in and told
Friday to follow me.
A Happy Meeting. 117
AHappyMeeting.
Imagine my surprise on jumping into the
boat to find another prisoner, bound hand
and foot, and almost dead with fright. He
was lying in the bottom of the canoe.
I cut the ropes which bound him and
tried to raise him up, but he could neither
sit nor speak. He groaned piteously, for
he thought that he had been unloosed to
be killed.
I told Friday to speak to him and tell
him that we were his friends. Friday did
so, and the prisoner then sat up in the
boat. Friday stared at him a moment,
then threw his arms around him, kissing and
hugging him, and crying, jumping, laugh-
ing, dancing, and singing by turns. It was some time before I could get him to speak
to me and tell me what was the matter. At
last he cried, '' Oh, sir, my father!"
This meeting of father and son put an
end to following the savages, for they were
now nearly out of sight.
I was glad afterward that we had not
gone, for a great storm of wind arose, and
there seemed very little doubt that the sav-
ages who were in the boat must have been
drowned.
Friday was so busy taking care of his
father that I did not like to call him away.
At last I askedhim if had given his father
any bread. He shook his head and said,
"None; ugly dog eat all up self."
So I gave him a piece of bread and a
handful of raisins for his father. He gave
these to him, then jumped out of the boat
and ran off as fast as he could go. I called
after him but he did not stop.
In a quarter of an hour I saw him coming
back. As he came near I saw that he must
have been home, for he carried a jug of
water and two loaves of bread. He gave
the bread to me and carried the water to
his father. The water helped his father
morethan anything else Friday had done
for him, for he was faint from thirst.
After Friday had given his father a drink
I asked him if there was any water left.
He said, "Yes, master;" so I told him to
give the poor white man some.
The white man was lying in the shade of
a tree, very weak. Friday gave him the
water and some bread, which revived him.
I went to him and gave him some raisins.
This prisoner,who was a Spaniard, was
very grateful. As soon as he had eaten he
tried to stand, but was unable to do so, for
his ankles were very badly swollen and
pained him severely.
I wanted to take the strangers home with
me but did not know how to carry them
there. Friday said that he could get them
part way home,at any rate. He picked up
the Spaniard, carried him to the canoe and
placed him beside his father; then he rowed
along the shore and up the creek. He left
them here and ran back for the other canoe,
in which he brought me.
Then he helped the guests out of the boat
and set them down on the bank.
He could not tell what to do with them
now, but I had been planning for this, and
I called to Friday to come and help me to
make a litter of the branches of trees. On
this we carried the men home.
We could not get them over the fence,
so we made a tent outside and covered it
with old sails, over which we placed boughs
of trees. In this tent I made two good
beds of rice straw, with blankets for covers.
This being done I prepared some meat
soup and put rice and whole wheat into it.
When it was done we set a table in the new
tent and all dined there together.
The Spaniard had been so long among
the savages that he spoke their language
quite well, so that Friday could understand
him and could tell me what the two guests
said.
After supper Friday went after the two
guns which had been left on the battle-
-field, and the next day he buried the dead
bodies and the remains of the dreadful
feast.
Getting Ready for More Guests.
A few weeks later I began to think once
more of going over to Friday's old home.
His father told me that I might be very
sure that the people would treat me well,
after my kindness to him.
I talked with the Spaniard about it, and
learned from him that there were sixteen
white men living with this tribe of Indians.
They had been well treated by the savages,
but it was very hard to get enough food
and clothing to keep them alive.
The Spaniard wanted very much to bring
them to my island if I were willing. I felt
very sorry for them, and, besides, I thought
if we were all on the island, we might, by
working together, make a ship in which we
could sail home.
Getting Ready for More Guests. 123
But there were not enough provisions for
so many, so we all set to work and dug up
a large piece of ground and sowed all the
seed that could be spared. Friday's father
and the Spaniard planned to go back for
the white men after the harvest.
While the crops were growing, I set the
men at work cutting down oak trees and
making them into planks for the ship, which
I hoped we might some time build.
We also caught several goats which were
added to my flock, and we gathered and
dried a great many grapes.
It was now harvest time. From the
twenty-two bushels of wheat sown, two
hundred and twenty bushels were gathered,
and the rice crop was as good as that of the
wheat. A great many baskets had to be
made in which to store so much grain.
We had a good supply of provisions on
hand now, and Friday's father and the Spaniard were ready to start back. I gave
each of them a gun and about eight charges
of powder and balls, and told them not to
use these unless it should be very necessary.
They took on board bread and raisins
enough to last them a long time, and supply
all the Spaniards about eight days.
They promised to hang out a flag on
their boat when they came back so that we
might know who they were, long before
they reached the island.
AnotherSurprise.
Eight days had passed since the Span-
iard and the old Indian left the island. On
the morning of the ninth I was fast asleep
in my cabin when Friday ran to me and
said, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come!"
When I heard this I dressed quickly and
ran down toward the shore, but I soon saw
that this was not the boat we were looking
for. I called Friday to me and told him to
keep out of sight of the crew of the boat.
Then I got my glass and went up the hill
where I could look without being seen.
Lying south of the island was a ship.
Yes, and it was an English ship, and the
boat was an English boat manned by Eng-
lish sailors. What a joyful sight!
Friday and I went down to the shore to
the boat, in which were the captain and two
other officers of the ship. These men were
very much surprised to find human beings
on the island. I told them how I came to
be here and how I had been longing these
many years to see my home and my pa-
rents.
The captain offered to take Friday and
me to England and I was very happy at the
thought of seeing my father and mother
again.
I told Friday that he might stay if he
wished to, and live with the Spaniards, or
take a canoe and go home, but he chose to
go with me, for he knew that his father was
free now and among his own people, and he
had come to think that I could not live with-
out him.
I left a letter for the Spaniards telling
them that I would send word to their coun-
trymen where they could be found. I left
them my guns and ammunition, also.
I took home with me, as relics, my goat-
-skin cap, my umbrella, and one of my par-
rots. I also took the bag of money, which
would now be worth something to me. I
could not help but feel sad when I bade a
last farewell to my island-home—my cave,
my vineyard and orchard which I had
planted, my tame goats, and my parrots.
They had all become dear to me.
I had lived upon the island more than
twenty-eight years.
Home Again.
After sailing seven weeks the ship rode
into the harbor from which I had set sail so
many years before. Everything was strange
to Friday, and he did not know what to
make of it all. He asked many questions,
but I was so busy thinking about my parents
that I did not answer all of them.
I hurried from the ship, telling Friday to
follow me. When nearly home I asked a man
whom I met about my parents. He told
me my father was still living, but my mother
had died from sorrow over the loss of her
boy. When I heard this I cried aloud.
On reaching home I opened the door
into my father's room. There he sat, the
poor old man, in his arm chair, his Bible
open on a table near by.
Home Again. 129
I hastened to him and cried in a tremb-
ling voice, ''Father, father, do you not know
your son? It is I, your boy Robinson!"
"Can it, oh, can it be my son?" said my
father, feebly. "Can it be my boy has
come back?" And he drew me lovingly to
his breast. After that he could not bear
that I should be out of his sight.
But my relatives and friends heard that I
was at home, and flocked to see me. I had
to tell the story of my shipwreck and of my
life on the island until late into the night.
When I had ended I said, "You see I
have had a hard time, and all because I
would not obey my parents and was lazy
when I was a boy."
From this time on, Friday and I lived a
quiet life. I took charge of my father's bus-
iness and Friday helped me. But I never
forgot to be grateful to God for keeping me
through so many dangers.
Robinson on His Island.
"I am monarch of all I survey;
My right there is none to dispute;
From the center all 'round to the sea
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
O, Solitude, where are the charms
That sages have seen in thy face?
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,
Than reign in this horrible place
"I am out of humanity's reach;
I must finish my journey alone;
Never hear the sweet music of speech:
I start at the sound of my own!
The beasts that roam over the plain
My form with indifference see;
They are so unacquainted with man,
Their tameness is shocking to me.
"Society, Friendship, and Love,
Divinely bestowed upon man,
Oh, had I the wings of a dove
How soon would I taste you again! My sorrows I might then assuage,
In the ways of religion and truth;
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheered by the sallies of youth.
On His Island. 131
Ye winds that have made me your sport,
Convey to this desolate shore
Some cordial, endearing report
Of a land I shall visit no more.
My friends—do they now and then send
A wish or a thought after me?
Oh, tell me I yet have a friend,
Though a friend I am never to see.
"How fleet is a glance of the mind!
Compared with the speed of its flight
The tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift-winged arrows of light.
When I think of my own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection at hand
Soon hurries me back to despair.
"But the sea-fowl has gone to her nest,
The beast is laid down in his lair;
Even here is a season of rest,
And I to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place,
And mercy—encouraging thought—
Gives even affliction a grace, And reconciles man to his lot."
--William Cowper.

WHO HAVE
UNCONSCIOUSLY AIDED US IN THE ADAPTION OF
THIS STORY,
THIS VOLUME
IS LOVINGLY DEDICATED. .
This little book is the result of much experi-
ence in seeking to adapt the story of Robinson
Crusoe to the literary attainments and educa-
tional needs of children in the primary schools.
It is supposed to follow the study of the '' Clas-
sic Stories for Little Ones " and to precede the
study of the ''Pioneer History Stories," which
recount the stirring events in the lives of those
heroes who first broke ground for our American
civilization in the Mississippi Valley. Crusoe
is the transition from myths and fairy tales,
where the imagination is untrammeled by the
"practical," to the study of real biography.
Those events in DeFoe's story that are of
doubtful educational value are omitted; but it
is believed that the child's interest in the nar
rative is not impaired thereby. The language
is that of children, and Robinson seems to be
telling his story to them. It will prove to be
valuable supplementary reading for classes in
the second and third grades.
The Appendix in the Teachers' and Mothers'
Edition of this story, prepared by Dr. Frank McMurry and Dr. C. C.Van Liew, will be studied
with interest and profit by those for whom it
was written. The former shows the educa-
tional value of the story, and the latter pre-
sents a method of teaching it to children in
the second and third grades. The authors
hereby acknowledge their obligations to them
for their able assistance in the preparation of
this edition.
The Authors.
Robinson Crusoe at Home.
When I was a little boy, I lived in a great
city by the sea, with my father and mother.
They were very kind to me and loved me
dearly. They wished me to go to school
and learn a great deal, so that I might
some day be a useful man.
But I was lazy, and liked better to play
by the river than to study. I often sat hour after hour watching the great ships
loading and unloading their cargoes, and
as they sailed away I wished I might go
with them.
My father had told me that the ships
came from lands where the men did not
look like those I knew, and the plants and
animals were very different from any I
had seen.
He wished me to be a merchant, but I
could think of nothing but the ships, and I
often ran away from my work to watch
them-
When I was sixteen years old, father
said to me one day: "Robinson, I wish you
to be a merchant. If you attend to your
work, you shall some day take charge of
my business; but if you are lazy, no one
will have any use for you and you will not
be able to take care of yourself." He talked
to me a long time about my bad habits.
I thought about what he had said and
made up my mind to work hard, But it
was not long before I began to think about
the ships again and long to sail across the
ocean.
Father saw that I was not doing my
work well, and one morning he said: "Robinson, what will become of you? Do you
want to become a good-for-nothing, and
some day beg for your bread?"
I said: "But, father, I do not wish to be
a merchant. I want to go away on one of
those ships. It must be fine to be out
on the ocean, and I want to see those
strange lands."
My father replied: "But, my son, if you
do not learn anything you will be of no use
to anyone on the ship, and one must work
in other countries as well as here. You
must remember that idleness is the begin-
ning of all mischief. If you disobey your father and mother and run away, you will
sometime be sorry; for whoever disobeys
his parents will never be happy."
While he was talking, the tears ran
down his face, and I could not help but
feel that I ought to do as he wished, and
I again promised to do so.
But very soon I forgot all about my
promise, and when my father was not
near I threw my work aside, put on my
hat, and went to the harbor.
As I sat watching the ships, I wished
more than ever to sail away. I knew it
would do no good to say more to father
about going; but I went to my mother
and said: "Mother, will you please ask
father to let me go off on just one voyage?"
But she would listen to nothing of the
kind, and with tears in her eyes she said:
"Robinson, you are our only child, and
if we should lose you, we would be left all alone. Your father and I are old, and
who would take care of us if we should
get sick? Do not make us unhappy. Do
not leave us." I said nothing more then,
but I could not help thinking about a voy-
age on the ocean.
Two years passed, and as I was walking
one day along the harbor I met a friend,
the son of the captain of one of the vessels.
After talking awhile, my friend said,
"Well, Robinson, father starts for America
today, and I am going with him."
"Oh! how I wish I could go with you!"
said I.
"Come along!" said he.
"But I have no money," I replied.
"Father will take you for nothing, I am
sure," said my friend. ''You can work for
him."
Giving him my hand I said, "Good! if
he will let me work my way I'll go with you."
The Voyage.
Theship on which I found myself, that
bright September morning, was a large one.
It was being made ready to start. Soon I
heard the cry, "A—all ha—a—nds! up
anchor, a—ho—oy!" At once everyone seemed to be filled with life; the sails were
loosed, the yards braced, and the anchor
slowly raised.
Orders were given so rapidly and there
was such a hurrying about and so many
strange noises that I hardly knew what to
make of it. Above all sounded the boom
of a cannon; then the vessel moved slowly
out of the harbor. In a short time we
were under way.
I turned to look at the home I was leav-
ing. I could see the streets with the
people passing up and down, the houses,and the gardens. Soon I could see only
the towers; finally they, too, faded from
sight, and I was out on the great ocean.
Behind me and before me, to my right
and to my left,I could see nothing but
water—water—water. Then I began to
think of what I had done. I remembered
my father's tears and my mother's kindness, and here I was out upon the ocean, sailing
away from parents, home, and friends.
In a short time a strong wind arose, and
the ship rocked so fearfully from side to
side that I became dizzy. The storm grew
worse, and I thought that every wave would
surely swallow up the ship. Every time it
went down into the trough or hollow of the
sea, I feared it would never come up again.
I told my friend that I was very much
afraid; but he only laughed at me and said,
"Oh, you will get used to this after awhile."
I began to feel faint, so that I had to
hold on to something to keep from falling
down. The masts and ropes danced about
and the sailors seemed to be walking on
their heads. Finally, as I let go my hold,
I fell full length upon the deck and could
not rise. I was seasick. This sickness
lasted for two days; then the sea became
quiet and I began to get better.
This storm was followed by a few days of
pleasant weather, then suddenly the sky
grew dark and there was much calling and
shouting among the sailors. Another storm
had arisen. I thought every minute that
the ship would sink and made up my mind
that if I ever reached land I would go back
home and stay there.
The storm lasted all day and all night.
But next morning the waves were more
quiet, the sky became clear, and the ocean
looked beautiful. I was used to the rocking
of the vessel by this time, and began to
enjoy the excitement.
We had been out several weeks when
another heavy storm arose. This was very
much worse than either of the others; all on
board thought that we were lost. The
wind and waves carried the ship before
them, tossing it about like a nut-shell.
Suddenly one of the sailors cried out, "Land!" All rushed out of the cabin to
see where we were, but the waves broke
over the deck with such fury that they were
driven back into the cabin.
Then, all at once, we felt a fearful shock.
The vessel had struck a rock. The sailors
cried out, "The ship has sprung a leak!"
The water now poured into it. Everyone
called for help, and each thought only of
saving his own life.
A small boat was let down into the water,
and all of the men jumped into it. When
we were only a little way from the sinking
vessel, a great wave, that looked like a
mountain, came rolling toward our boat. It was overturned and all the men went
down.
I knew how to swim very well, but the
waves were so strong that I could do noth-
ing. I came to the top but a wave carried
me under again. Another wave brought me again to the top, and this time I could
see land very near. Then a heavy sea
hurled me against a rock, and I clung to
this with all my strength. Another wave
dashed over me, but I held on to the rock.
Then I ran up the cliff, but only a little
way, for I fell, and knew nothing more for
a long time.
When I opened my eyes again, my first
question was, "Where am I?" I looked
about for the sailors, but alas! I did not see
them, and I knew then that all must have
been drowned. I was the only one whose
life had been saved.
When I saw this I knelt down on the
rocks and thanked God for His mercy
to me.
Robinson in His New Home.
I began to wonder what I should do here
by myself. I was very wet and had no
change of clothes. I was hungry and thirsty
and did not know where to look for food or
drink. I was also afraid that wild animals
might attack me, and I had no gun.
It was getting dark and I knew that I
must look for a place to sleep. Where should it be? For a long time I stood still,
not knowing what to do.
At last I said, "I will do as the birds do,
and rest in a tree." I soon found one with
thick branches in which I could settle my-
self quite comfortably and sleep without
danger of falling.
As I had nothing with which to defend
myself but a knife, I cut me a good stick.
Then I climbed the tree, arranged myself
carefully and fell asleep. Being very tired,
I slept soundly till morning.
When I awoke it was broad day; the
weather was clear and the sea quiet. I was
weak from hunger and thirst and wondered
what I could find for breakfast. I got down
from my bed and walked around looking for
food, but I found nothing but grass, and
trees that bore no fruit.
"I shall die of hunger," I thought. But
when the need is greatest then God's help is nearest. I had gone but a few steps when
I saw a large plant with a thick stalk, and
on it were three long ears. It was a stalk
of corn.
I broke off one ear and ate the kernels.
The other ears I put into my pocket I
also found a spring of clear, cool water.
Not far away was a high hill, and I went
up that I might look about me. It took me
half an hour to climb, it but when I had
reached the top I could see a long distance
away. I found that there was water all
around me. This distressed me greatly.
"So I am upon an island," I cried, "alone
and without food or shelter. O, what will
become of me!"
As I spoke my eyes fell upon the ship.
It lay about a mile from the shore, and had
not been broken to pieces by the storm, as
I had supposed. It was still resting upon
the rock. "I must reach that ship," I
thought. "How can I do it?"
The water was so shallow that I could
wade to within a quarter of a mile of it, and
I swam the remainder of the distance. By
the help of a rope I climbed to the deck of
the vessel. No sooner had I reached it
than I was greeted by the joyful barking
of the dog, which the sailors had named Barri.
He jumped and sprang about me, rejoicing
to see a friend once more. I, too, was glad
to have a living being with me again.
I found many things on board the vessel
which were not injured at all. First of all
I hunted for food. I found a chest of ship
biscuits, and gave some to Barri who was
nearly starved, and I ate all I wished myself.
I gathered the things together which I
wished to take with me, and built a raft
by fastening a number of logs together by
ropes, and nailing some boards upon these.
I put upon the raft the chest of biscuits, a
flint for making a fire, a box of tools, a saber, four guns, two barrels of powder,
shot, clothing, and many other things.
With a broken oar I then rowed toward
land. Suddenly I heard a splashing behind
me, and turned about, much frightened.
But it was only Barri, the faithful dog, who
was swimming after me. I drew the poor
fellow out of the water on to the raft.
In a half hour I landed everything safely.
It was now getting dark, and I hunted
for a tree in which to spend the night.
The next morning my first thought was
of the ship. I decided to bring over all of
the things for which I might have any use.
I went to the vessel on my raft and
brought back two kegs of nails and spikes, a
large auger, a grindstone, two barrels of
bullets, a large bag of shot, seven muskets,
a piece of sail, and some bedding. I wanted
to put on other things, but the raft could
hold no more. I brought all these safely to land. My next care was to get my goods
under cover. For this purpose I went to
work to build myself a tent. I cut a few
poles, set them into the ground in the form
of a circle, the tops touching, and fastened
the sail over them. Into this tent I put
everything I had brought from the ship.
The third time I went to the ship I found
in a drawer a pair of scissors, a few knives,
and a bag of gold. I was very glad to get
the scissors and knives, but I had no use
for the gold.
As I was rowing to land a strong wind
arose, and I had to hurry to reach the
shore with my raft. I had barely reached
it when the wind became so strong that the
waves covered the ship. When the sea
became quiet again nothing could be seen
of it. I felt very thankful that I had been
able to get so much, for I thought, "How
could I have lived without these things!"
Robinson's House.
My tent stood on low, wet ground and I
wished to find a better spot for my home.
After looking around a long time, I found a level place on the side of a hill near the sea,
which suited me very well.
Back of this plain was a high, steep wall
of rock, in which was an opening like the
door of a cave. I said to myself, "What a
fine home I can make here!"
I first brought up my tent and everything
that was in it. This was hard work. I set
up the tent, and moved my things into it,
then I built a double wall or fence in the
shape of a semi-circle, extending from one
side of the cave around to the other side,
inclosing a beautiful green yard.
The front of the fence was ten yards from
the cave door, and its two ends were about
twenty yards apart. This double fence was
made by driving two rows of strong stakes
into the ground until they stood very firm,
the biggest end being out of the ground and
sharpened at the top. These two rows
were only six inches apart.
Between them I laid one row after an-
other of ship cable until it reached the top.
Other stakes, two and a half feet high were
driven inside of the second row, leaning
against them so as to brace them. Neither
man nor animal could get through or over
this fence.
Instead of a gate I made me a ladder so
that I might go over the top. When I
was within, I lifted the ladder in after me.
The fencing in of my home had been a hard
piece of work and had lasted more than
three months.
Within this fence I built a cabin. My
tent had allowed the rain to come through. I
wished to make the roof of the cabin rain
proof. At the sides of the cave opening I
set poles in the ground ten steps apart.
Upon these I laid a cross piece. Upon this
cross piece were the rafters, their other end
resting on the rocky cliff and forming a
slanting roof,
24 Robinson Crusoe.
I covered this roof with long grass and
with leaves. The sides were made of wood,
and I filled the cracks with mud. A piece
of sail formed the door.
When I had done this I began to dig my
way into the rock. I carried all the stones
out through my cabin and laid them up
within the fence. This raised the ground
all around, about a foot and a half. The
cave formed the cellar to my house.
His Work.
While I was at work in the cave a storm
came up. It grew dark, and suddenly there
was a flash of lightning, and after that a
great clap of thunder. I thought, "Oh, my
powder! If the lightning should reach that,
what would I do? If I lose my powder I
cannot get food, and I shall have nothing
with which to protect myself."
After the storm was over I shook out
some small grain bags which I had, and
made some others and put the powder into
about a hundred of these, hoping that if
some of it should burn, I could keep a part
at least. I hid these bags of powder in
holes among the rocks. Here it could not
get wet.
While I was doing this I went out at least
once a day with my gun. The first time I
discovered that there were goats upon the
island, and I was glad to see them. But
they were very shy and would run so
swiftly that it was the most difficult thing
in the world to catch them.
One day I watched for them, thinking
perhaps I could shoot one; but when they
were upon the rocks and saw me in the val-
ley they would run away, very much fright-
ened. When they were feeding in the
valley and saw me upon the rocks, however,
they took no notice of me. From this I
thought that they could not see readily ob-
jects that were above them. So I climbed
the rocks, to get above them, and then fired
at them.
The first goat that I shot was an old one.
She had a little kid by her side, which I did
not see at first. It grieved me that I had killed the mother. I picked up the goat
and carried it home over my shoulder, the
little kid following me. I thought I could
tame the kid, but it would not eat, so I had
to kill it to keep it from starving to death.
Many times I grew sad thinking of my
home in England. Then I would remem-
ber how I had been saved and this would
make me very thankful.
I had been on the island about ten or
twelve days, when the thought came to me
that I should not be able to tell the day of
the week or month after a while, for want
of books and pen and ink, and should not
know which was the Sabbath day.
To prevent this, I set up a post, and on
this I cut these words: "I came on shore
here the 30th of September, 1659." Then
for every day I cut a notch. Every
seventh notch was longer than the others.
One day, as I was looking over the things 29
I had brought from the ship, I found pens,
ink, and paper; also three good Bibles and
several other books. I must not forget,
also, that we had in the ship two cats,
which I brought home with me.
I was careful not to waste any ink, for I
knew that I could not get any more when
that was gone.
One day I wrote the following upon
paper:
EVIL.
I am cast upon a lonely island; no hope of being saved.
I am alone—one man all alone.
I have no clothes.
I have nothing to fight
with.
I have no one to speak to.
GOOD.
But I am alive.
But I am not starved.
But it is warm here.
But I am upon an island where I see no wild beasts.
But God sent the ship near
enough to the shore for
me to get many things,
and 1 have Barri and the
cats for company.
This made me think that no matter how hard my life seemed, I could find something
for which to be thankful.
I needed many things in the house, so I
went to work and made some. First, I
made a chair and a table out of short pieces
of boards which I had brought from the
ship. Then I made some shelves along one
side of my cave. You may know that this
was no light task, when I tell you that I had
no tools but an ax and an adze. If I wanted
a board, I must chop down a tree, cut off
from the trunk the length that I wanted,
and hew it flat on either side with my ax
until I had made it as thin as a plank.
Then I smoothed it with my adze. In this
way I could make but one board out of a
whole tree. But there was no help for it,
and as I had plenty of time, it was just as
well to spend it in this way.
The boards which I used for shelves were
a foot and a half wide, and were placed one under another all along one side of my cave.
On these I laid my tools, nails, and other
things. I drove spikes into the wall, on
which to hang my gun. It was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and to know that I had so many use-
ful things.
I went out for about two hours with my
gun, every morning that it did not rain.
Then I worked until eleven o'clock. After
this I had my dinner. From twelve to two
I slept, then I went to work again.
One day when I was out hunting I killed
a young goat and lamed another. I caught
the lame one, led it home, and bound up its
leg, which I found was broken. I took such
good care of it that it soon became as well
as ever. It would eat near my door and it
was so tame that it would not go away.
I worked hard, but often the rains kept
me in the house. I had to go to bed early, for I had no light. I wished for a lamp
very often, and I studied how to make one.
The best that I could do was to save the
tallow from a goat which I had killed. With
a little dish made of clay, which I baked in
the sun, and some oakum for the wick, I
made a lamp. This gave me a light, but
not a clear, steady light like a candle.

Surprises.
One day I saw before my door a few
blades of something green coming up out
of the ground. I thought it might be some
plant I had not seen. I was very much
surprised, a few weeks later, to see heads
of wheat on the plants.
When I saw this new gift, tears came to
my eyes. I thought of the prayer, "Give
us this day our daily bread," and I re-
peated it.
I asked myself, "How came this wheat
here?" Then I remembered that one day
during a great rain I had shaken some dust
out of a bag which had once held wheat.
There must have been a few grains in this.
It was in April when I found the plants,
and by June I had gathered every grain of
wheat and saved it for seed.
By the side of the rock, back of my
house, a few rice plants were growing. I
watched these and when the rice was ripe
I gathered it for seed.
I had been working very hard for three
or four months trying to get my fence done.
The very next day after it was finished, I
came near having my work spoiled and my-
self killed.
As I was busy behind my cabin, just at
the opening of the cave, I was terribly
frightened by a most surprising thing. The
earth began to fall from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over
my head. Two posts which I had set up
in the cave cracked.
I was alarmed, for I thought that the
roof was falling in, and fearing that I should
be buried in it, I ran to my ladder. I did
not feel safe here, for the rocks from the
hill might roll down upon me; so I got over
the fence, and as soon as I had stepped
down upon the ground I knew that it was
an earthquake.
The ground on which I stood shook three
times. The shocks were heavy enough to
overturn the strongest building in the
world. A great piece of the top of a rock,
which was about half a mile from me, near
the sea, fell down with a terrible noise such
as I had never heard in all my life.
I was so frightened that I grew faint and
sick. The falling of the rock aroused me,
and then I could think of nothing but the
hill falling upon my cabin.
After the third shock was over, I felt no
more, but I was still afraid to go over my
fence, and I sat upon the ground, not know-
ing what to do.
While here, the clouds gathered and it
looked as if it might rain. Soon after, the
wind began to blow, and in less than half
an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane.
The sea was white with foam, and the
shore was covered with water. Great trees
were torn up by the roots. It was a ter-
rible storm.
This lasted for three or four hours, then
it began to rain. All this time I sat upon
the ground, but when the rain began to
fall I went into my cabin. But it rained so
hard that I had to go into the cave, although
I was still afraid that it would fall upon my
head.
It rained all night and a great part of the
next day. I began to wonder what I would 
best do. I thought that if there were earth-
quakes on the island, it would not do to
live on the side of the hill beside the rocks.
So I determined to build a cabin away
from the hill, and then build a fence around
it; but I was settled so comfortably here
that I did not like to think of moving.
My tools were all so dull that 1 could not
do much chopping until they were sharp-
ened. I had a grindstone but I could not
turn it and grind my tools too.
At last I fastened a crank to the axle;
this crank I connected with a treadle by a
string; I worked this treadle with my foot,
that I might have both my hands to hold
the tools. Then I spent two days sharp-
ening them.
One morning I found, by the seaside, a
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had
seen, not because they were scarce, for
there were many on the side of the island which I had not visited. I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I
found afterward, but perhaps I should
have paid dear enough for them. I cooked
this one and found that it tasted better
than any food I had eaten since I landed.
Robinson Sick.
The day on which I found the turtle it
began to rain. It rained all day and it was
still raining the next morning.
It was usually too warm, but this rain felt
cold, and I was sick and chilly all day. At
night I could not sleep for the fever and
pain in my head.
I was no better in the morning, and I be-
came greatly frightened and did not know
what to do. I prayed to God, but I scarcely
knew what I said.
I was some better the fourth day, but
worse on the fifth. The sixth day I was
better again, but on the seventh I had
another chill and a burning fever.
The next day I was better again, and
having nothing to eat, I took my gun and
went out hunting. I killed a goat, but I
was so weak I could hardly carry it home.
The chill came again the next day and I
had to lie in bed. I was nearly dead with
thirst, but I was too weak to get any water.
I prayed to God, but all I could say was,
"Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me!
Lord, have mercy upon me!" After awhile
I fell asleep.
When I awoke it was far into the night
and I was very thirsty, but as there was no water in my cabin, I had to do without un-
til morning. I went to sleep again and had
a strange dream.
I thought that my good father stood be-
fore me and called, "Robinson, Robinson."
I stretched out my arms and said, "Here I
am; here I am,"and then I fell back upon
the bed.
When I awoke, my mouth burned and I
feared I was going to die. Then I cried
out, "Lord, be my help, for I am in great
need!" I soon fell asleep again, and when
I awoke I felt better.
The first thing I did after getting up was
to fill a bottle with water and place it near
my bed. Then I broiled a piece of meat on
the coals, but I could eat very little. I
walked about, but was very weak, and I
felt sad thinking that the next day the chill
would return.
At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the
ashes. After I had eaten I tried to walk,
but I was too weak to carry a gun; so I went
but a little way and sat down upon the
ground, looking out over the sea, which lay
just before me, so beautiful and calm.
As I sat here I thought of my father and
mother. How kind they had always been
to me! I thought how terrible it would be
to die here all alone, and I prayed again to
God to help me and bring me home again.
Then I thought, "Why should God help
me? Have I not disobeyed His commands?
God wants us to obey our parents and love
them, but I have not done so. I have run
away from them and made them very un-
happy."
I walked back slowly to my cabin, lighted
my lamp, and sat down and wondered what
I could do to cure me of my sickness. I
went to one of the chests to see if I could not find some medicine. I did not find the
medicine, but during my search I found a
Bible.
I brought it to the table and tried to read,
but I was still dizzy and the letters danced
before my eyes; but I made out this verse:
"Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
These words comforted me. I began to
grow sleepy, so, leaving my lamp burning,
I went to bed. But before I lay down, I
knelt and asked God to take care of me.
Then I fell asleep and did not wake until
almost three o'clock the next day, much re-
freshed, and when I got up I felt stronger.
From this time on I grew better each
day, although it was several weeks before I
fully recovered. I kept thinking of that
verse, "I will deliver thee." I wondered
how God would deliver me. Then I thought,
"Has He not done so? I was delivered from the wreck and from my sickness. And
how have I glorified Him?" I fell on my knees and thanked God for
all His kindness to me.

Robinson Explores the Island.
When I was well again, I started out to
see more of my island home. At first I had
been afraid of wild animals and men, but now I said, "God has taken care of me so
far and I believe He will keep me from
harm all the time."
One morning in July, I started out, going
up the creek which flowed past my house.
On both sides of it lay beautiful meadows
covered with grass, and many plants were
growing on its banks. I tried to find a kind
of root out of which the Indians make their
bread, but I found none.
The next day I went up the stream
again, but I went farther. I found that
beyond the meadows were thick woods.
In this part I found melons and grapes
that were sweet and ripe.
When night came I was so far from home
that I did not try to get back. I slept well
in a tree, and the next morning I continued
my journey about four miles, through a
valley with hills on each side. At the end
of this valley I came to an opening, where there was a little spring of cold water, and
everything looked fresh and green.
I saw cocoa trees, orange, lemon, and
citron trees. From these I gathered more
fruit than I could carry home. I filled my
pockets as full as I could, and left a great
heap of it lying on the ground, thinking I
would come again. Before I got home the
grapes were spoiled.
The next day I went back, having made
two small bags in which to carry my fruit.
I was surprised upon coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine, to find
them all scattered about, trodden to pieces,
and many of them eaten.
I knew that some animal must have done
this, so after that when I wanted to save
grapes I put them on the branches of the
trees where they would dry. In this way I
could have a supply of raisins. This time
I took as many lemons as I could carry.
This place was so beautiful that I thought
I would like to live here, and I looked
around for a spot upon which to build my
house. But after I had thought about it, I
remembered that now my home was near
the sea, where I hoped some day to see a
ship. Or, if some one should be ship-
wrecked as I had been, I should be near to
help him.
I liked the woods so well, that I built a
kind of bower where I could stay when I
chose. I put up a strong fence of poles and
brushwood, and used a ladder as I did in
my other home. I called this my country
home.
Just after I had finished my country
house, the rainy season came on and I had
to stay in my cabin.
On September thirtieth, I counted up the
notches on my post, and found that I had
been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I spent this day in religious worship.
I knelt down and prayed God to forgive my
sins. I fasted for twelve hours, then I ate
a biscuit and a bunch of raisins and went to
bed.
During the rainy season I stayed in my
cabin as much as I could, but I always
found work to do. I needed baskets very
much, and I had tried several ways of mak-
ing them. But all of the twigs that I could
get were too brittle.
One day while at my country house, I
found some willow twigs that seemed tough.
I cut them and let them dry, and then car-
ried them to my cabin.
I made my baskets of these, in the rainy
season. This business was not new to me,
for when I was a boy, I used to like to
watch a basketmaker who lived in our town,
and sometimes he would let me help him.
Another Trip.
In order to know still more about my
island, I got ready for a longer trip. I took
my gun and dog, a hatchet, and some bis-
cuits and raisins.
I went beyond my country house to a
place where I could see the ocean on the
other side of the island. Away off across
the water I saw more land. I thought it
must be some part of America, or perhaps
another island.
This side of the island seemed more pleas-
ant than my side, for there were many beau-
tiful flowers and trees here. In the woods
near by, birds were singing their songs and
flitting from tree to tree. There were also
a great many parrots with their gay plum-
age. I caught a young one and carried it
home, that I might teach it to talk.
I also saw many small wild animals, but
I shot none as I did not wish to waste my
powder. On the seashore I was surprised
to see the sand nearly covered with turtles.
I put a stake into the ground for a land-
mark, thinking that on the next journey
which I took, I would go around the seacoast the other way until I came to my post.
I was ready to go home now and I took a
new way. I had not gone far when I found
myself in a large valley with hills all around
covered with woods. My only guide was
the sun, and the weather was hazy for three
or four days, so that I lost my way.
I wandered about for a long time and at
last found my post and went home the same
way that I had come.
On the way home Barri caught a young
goat and saved it alive, and I took it home to tame. I made a collar for the little thing
out of some string which I always carried
with me and led it to my country home and
there I left it.
After being away from home a month, I
was very anxious to get back, and I cannot
tell what a pleasure it was to me to come
into my cabin and lie down in my hammock
again.
I rested for a week after my journey, and
while doing so I made a cage for Polly.
Then I began to think of the little kid I had
left penned up. I went out to it and found
it nearly starved. After I fed it, it became
so tame and gentle that it followed me like
a dog, and it became a great pet.
His Garden.
I found now that there were two seasons
upon the island, one rainy and the other
dry. Prom the middle of February till the
middle of April, it was rainy; from the mid-
dle of April to the middle of August, it was
dry; from the middle of August till the mid-
dle of October, rainy; from the middle of
October till the middle of February, dry.
One year I planted my seed on the first
of May and it did not sprout. The next
season I planted some early in August and
the rain coming soon, it grew nicely.
So I found that there were two seed times
and two harvests. I planted my garden and
in October and November it looked well. I
thought, "What a fine harvest I am going to have." But one day I saw that some
wild goats and hares were eating off the
tender blades of the grain.
I knew of nothing that I could do to keep
them away unless I built a close fence, so I
went to work at this and at the end of three
weeks it was done.
But this fence could not save my grain,
for one day when it was nearly ripe I saw a
great many birds in my garden. I shot at
them and a great flock arose; this made me
feel badly for I knew that unless I could do
something immediately they would eat up
all my grain and I might starve.
I went into the garden and found that
they had spoiled some already, and as I was
coming away I saw the thieves sitting upon
all the trees about me as if waiting until I
should go away.
Sure enough, as soon as I had gone a
short distance, down they flew. I fired my gun at them and killed three. These I hung
up to scare the others away, and they did
not come back.
When the grain was ripe I hardly knew
now to harvest it as I had neither scythe
nor sickle. But I remembered a broad
sword that I had brought from the ship and
this did very well. I carried the grain home
in the baskets which I had made, and rub-
bed it out with my hands.
I had a large stock of rice and with my
new harvest I had more. The third plant-
ing brought me over a bushel of wheat and
as much rice. The fourth planting brought
five bushels of wheat and still more of rice.
Next time I planted two bushels of each
kind and gathered more than forty bushels
of both. Then I had all of the grain that I
needed.
It might be truly said that now I worked
for my bread.
I had no plow to turn up the earth; no
spade nor shovel to dig with; so I spent
many days making a wooden spade. I had
no harrow, so I had to go over the ground
dragging a great heavy bough of a tree to
break the clods of earth and make the
ground smooth.
Now that I had wheat how could I grind
it? And if I had it ground into flour, how
could I make bread of it? Then how could
I bake the bread if I had the flour? I spent
many hours planning how all these things
could be done.
Robinson a Cook.
The rainy season coming on again, I had
to work in the house. I taught my parrot
to speak, and I was very glad when she
could say, ''Polly wants a cracker, cracker."
I found that I needed some jars and
plates very much, so I studied how to make
some. I looked around and found a certain
kind of clay which I thought would do.
It would make you pity me or laugh at
me were I to tell you of the queer shaped
things I formed; but at last I made some which I dried in the sun, and they held my
rice and grain very well.
But what I wished for most was some-
thing in which to cook my food. Some
time after I made my first jars I had a
hot fire for cooking my meat, and when I
went to put it out I found a broken piece of
one of my jars in the fire. It was burned
as hard as stone and as red as tile. I was
surprised to see this, and I said to myself,
"Why not burn whole jars and make them
hard like this piece?"
So I went to work and made some more
kettles and jars, and although they were
not very smooth and round, yet they did
very well.
Next I placed the three largest vessels
close together, with a good bed of live coals
under them. I made a big fire all around
them, but hardly had the flames begun to
shoot up when I heard "crack! crack!" and one vessel fell to pieces. I said to myself,
"I believe it is too hot." So I put some of
the fire out. As the others did not crack,
I kept up the fire and after a while they
turned a bright red.
I thought this was all right, and I stayed
up the whole night to watch the burning of
my pottery. "Now," said I, "they are
ready to use." But I found that something
was the matter. They crumbled and fell
to pieces.
I did not know what to do now, but I dug
a deep hole and laid stones about it. Then
I made a small fire in the hole and put in
my jars. I kept making the fire a little
hotter, and after a few hours they were all
a glowing red. Then it seemed as though
they would all melt, so I let the fire go
down.
I could hardly wait for them to cool before
trying them. This time they were well baked, for they had been in the fire just
long enough.
I put some meat into one of them, with
water and rice, and set it on the fire. It
cooked well and tasted very good, better
than any I had had since I came to the
island. Some salt, which I found near the
sea on one of my trips, gave just the right
flavor.
I had worked so hard on my jars that I
had forgotten to write the days in my cal-
endar. I found that the next day would be
Sunday. I wished to spend it in the right
way, for I thought of what the Bible says:
"Six days thou shalt labor and do all thy
work, but the seventh is the Sabbath of
the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do
any work."
When I had eaten my supper I went to
sleep, and in the morning I wakened just
as the sun was lighting up the hilltops. I jumped up quickly and offered my morning
prayer. Then I milked my goats and drank
the milk for breakfast.
After breakfast I went out into the morn-
ing air, where the birds were singing their
beautiful songs and everything was glad.
I took off my hat and sang too. I never
before felt so thankful to God. Then I
knelt down and prayed before a palm tree
as before an altar, pouring forth my thank-
fulness.
I had been thinking for a long time how
I could make flour out of my wheat. First
of all I needed a mill. "If I had a mortar,"
thought I, "I could crush the grain in that."
I hunted many days for a large hollow
stone for a mortar, but I could not find one;
and I had no tools to cut one out of the
solid rock. Besides, rocks were sandy, and
they would not do. At last I gave up look-
ing for a stone and began to hunt for a block of hard wood. After I had found one
large enough, I rounded it off with my
hatchet, and then with much hard work
and the help of fire, I made a hollow place
in it.
After this I made a heavy pestle of iron-
wood.
The next thing was to make a sieve, and
this was a hard thing to do. I had no cloth
which I could use for it; I had goat's hair,
but I did not know how to weave it.
After a long time I found some coarse
muslin in one of the chests, and with some
of this I made three sieves which did the
work very well.
The baking was the next thing to plan
for, and as I had no oven, I made some
dishes that were broad and not deep.
These I burned in the fire as I had done
the others.
When I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth. After the fire had
burned into live coals I drew them forward
upon the hearth so as to cover it all over.
When the hearth was very hot I swept
away the coals and placed a loaf there.
Then I covered it with one of my dishes,
and drew the coals all around the outside of
the dish, to keep in the heat and make
more. In this way I baked my bread, and
after a time I made puddings.
It took me nearly a year to make all
these things. I could not work at it all of
the time for I had my garden to take care
of and other work to do.
Robinson Makes a Boat.
While I was at work I often thought
about the land which I had seen across the
water,and I could not help but wish to go
there. I thought that perhaps people lived
there, and if I could reach it I might at last
get home.
Many times I wished for a boat so that I
might sail over to that country.
I began to think then that perhaps I
might make a canoe out of the trunk of a
tree. This seemed quite easy to do.
So I went to work, first cutting down a
fine cedar tree. It was five feet ten inches
in diameter at the stump, and four feet
eleven inches at the distance of twenty-two
feet farther up.
I was over two weeks cutting this tree
down and as long trimming off the branches.
Then I spent a month in shaping it, and
three times as long in digging out the inside.
When I had the work done, I was very
much pleased with it. It would carry twenty-six men, and was large enough to hold me
and everything I had.
The boat was about one-half hour's walk
from the ocean, and there was a small hill
to go over. I began to dig through this hill to make a sort of trench; but when this was
done I could not stir the boat.
Then I thought that I would cut a canal
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could
not bring the canoe to the water. Well, I
began this work, but when I thought how
deep it must be and how broad, I knew it
would take me at least ten years to finish it.
Thus I had to give up this boat. I felt
very sorry about it, for I had worked hard
to make it. But I learned too late how
foolish it is to begin a work before counting
all the cost.
RobinsonaTailor.
I had now been on the island so long that
many things which I had brought from the
ship were nearly used up. My ink had been
gone for some time. I put in some water
and made it last as long as I could, but it
was so pale that the words on the paper
were scarcely visible.
My clothes, too, were old and ragged, for
I had worn them in the rain and in doing a
great deal of hard work. I had brought
some clothing from the ship, but I had
worn that out.
Now I must look out for some new clothes.
I had plenty of money, but what good could
that do me here? If I had been at home I
could have bought many fine clothes with
it, but it was of no use to me now.
For a long time I did not know from what
to make my clothes. Then I remembered
that I had saved all of the skins of the goats
I had killed, and dried them in the sun.
These might do for cloth, but how could I
make them?
First, I took my measure for a jacket. I
found that I would need three skins—one
for the back, one for the front, and one for
the sleeves.
Next, I cut them into four-cornered pieces.
It took a long time to sew them together,
and I made but poor work of it. If I was a
bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
The sleeves made me the most trouble
because they had to be sewed in at the
shoulders to the other parts. It took me
nearly two days to make the jacket, but
when it was finished it was just the thing.
I put the hair on the outside to turn the
rain, and it kept off the heat, also.
I made some leggings, and then a cap—all out of skins. The cap looked like a large
cone and it was somewhat longer behind
than in front, so as to keep the rain and the
heat from my neck. I was very proud of
my suit when it was finished.
After this, I spent much time in making
an umbrella from skins. I spoiled two or
three before I made one that suited me. I
wanted it so that I could shut it up, for
I could not always carry it open. At last I
made one, and now I could go out in the
hottest weather, for it kept off the heat.
He Makes a Smaller Canoe.
For five years after this, nothing unusual
happened to me, but I lived on in the same
way as before. I had my regular work of
taking care of my garden, curing my raisins,
and hunting.
Besides this, I was working upon another
canoe. As for the first one, it lay just
where I had made it, as a reminder to me
to be wiser hereafter.
The second boat was about half a mile
from the water, for I could find no tree
nearer that would do. It was smaller than
the first, and by digging a canal to it, six
feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it
to the creek.
This little boat would not serve for such
a trip as I had planned with the other one,
but it would do to sail around my island in.
I fitted up a mast in it and made a sail
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails
that I still had. Then I made a trial trip
and found that it would sail very well.
I made little boxes at each end in which
to put powder and other things which were
to be kept dry. Then I cut a long hollow
place in the side of it where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.
To keep the heat of the sun off, I fixed
my umbrella in a step at the stern. Once
in a while I took a little trip down the creek
and out on the ocean, but I did not go far.
At last I got ready for a trip around the
island. I put in some bread, rice, powder,
and shot, and two large watch-coats which
I had saved from the ship, one to lie upon
and the other to cover me at night.
It was in November, in the sixth year of my stay, that I started out on this trip; and
it proved to be a longer one than I had ex-
pected.
It was not that the island was so large,
but when I came to the east side I found a
ledge of rocks reaching far out into the
ocean, and beyond this was a strip of sand.
To get around this I had to go out a long
way into the sea.
When I first saw these rocks, I thought I
would go back home. I anchored my boat,
and taking my gun I climbed a hill. After
looking about from its top, I made up my
mind to try to go on in my boat.
The sea being a little rough, I staid on
shore for two days. But on the third day
the sea was calm again and I started out.
When I reached the point, suddenly the
boat began to go faster, and to my dismay
I saw that a strong current was carrying me
out to sea. I could do nothing with my
paddle, and there was no wind. I feared
that unless some help came soon I should
be lost.
Now that I was being carried away from
my island home out into the ocean it
seemed to me the most pleasant home in
the world. I stretched out my hands to it,
wishing I were there once more. Then I
thought, "I was not happy while I was there, but we never know how to enjoy
what we have, until it is lost to us."
As I have said, there was no wind to help
me, but I worked hard, and after a while I
felt a little breeze. Then it blew quite a
gale and I thought that now I might save
myself.
By this time I was a long way from the
island and if it had not been clear I should
certainly have been lost, for I should not
have known which way to go.
I soon found that the current had changed
and by hard work and the help of the wind
I sailed out of it. Upon nearing the shore
I found that it was the opposite side of the
island from where I had started.
As soon as I reached the land again, I
fell upon my knees and gave thanks toGod
for saving me. I brought my boat close to
the shore, into a little cove, and after eat-
ing some food, I went to sleep, for I was
very tired.
In the morning I hardly knew how to re-
turn home. I did not care to try going by
water after being so nearly lost the day be-
fore. I looked along the shore and several
miles further I found a small creek flowing
into the ocean, and into it I brought my
boat. I drew it up on the shore, where it
would be safe, and left it.
Taking my umbrella and gun, I started
on foot for home. Not far away was my
old landmark and before evening I reached
my country house. Here everything was
just as I had left it. I got over the fence
and lay down in the shade to rest and soon
fell asleep.
You may imagine my surprise upon being
awakened by some one calling my name.
The voice said, "Robin, Robin, Robin Cru-
soe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where
have you been? Poor Robin Crusoe?"
I was sleeping so soundly that it seemed
like a dream. But the voice kept on saying
''Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe! Poor Robin
Crusoe!" At last I awoke, greatly fright-
ened.
I looked around and there on the fence
sat Polly blinking her eyes and chattering
away. Holding out my hand I said, "Come
here, Polly, pretty Polly!'' She flew down
to me and sitting on my shoulder laid her
head against my face and kept saying,
"Robin, Robin Crusoe! Where have you
been? Poor Robin Crusoe!"—just as if she
were very happy to see me again.
I had enough of sailing now for a time,
but I often wished that the boat were on my
side of the island.
Robinson's Flocks.
At the end of eleven years on the island I
found that my ammunition was beginning
to run low. I therefore planned to catch
some goats, tame them, and have my own
flocks. By doing this I should save both
time and ammunition. I already had one
tame goat. I wondered what I could do to
catch more.
At first I made traps of rope, and baited
them, and I am sure I caught some goats in
these, but the ropes were rotten and would
not hold; so I dug some pits three or four
feet deep and covered them with small
branches of trees. The next morning I
found that I had caught three young kids.
I tied them together and managed with much trouble to get them home. When I
got them there I had no good place to keep
them, so I set about finding a pasture, one
where there would be plenty of grass, water,
and shade.
I soon found a place that suited me well,
and began to enclose a very large pasture,
which would require two miles of fence. I
changed my mind,however, after thinking
more about it, not because I had not time
to make so long a fence, for I had time
enough to make it five times as long had
I cared for such an one, but with such a
large pasture,how could I tame my goats?
They would be nearly as free as they were
in the woods, and I could never catch one
where there was so much space in which to
chase it.
I therefore decided to fence in about a
quarter of an acre. When I should need
more pasture, I could enclose more land. While I was making the fence I kept my
goats tied near me that they might become
used to me, and very often I would carry
them a handful of wheat or of rice, which
they learned to eat out of my hand. It
took about three months to make my fence.
By the time it was done the goats would
follow me up and down the pasture calling
for grain.
After three years I had forty-three goats,
and, besides, I had killed several for food.
At different times I fenced in more pas-
ture, until I had five pieces of ground
fenced, with little pens opening out of each,
and gates leading from one pasture into
another.
I had not only plenty of meat, but I had
plenty of milk as well—sometimes a gallon
or two a day—and after many failures I
learned to make very good butter and
cheese.
Robinson's Manner of Living.
It would have made you smile to see me
and my little family sit down to dinner.
There was our majesty, the lord of the
whole island. My subjects were under my
complete control, and there were no rebels
among them.
How like a king I sat at my table all
alone, attended by my servants. Poll was the only person allowed to talk to me. My
dog, who was now very old and crazy, sat
always at my right hand, and the cats at my
left. I needed nothing to add to my hap-
piness but society.
My dress was very odd. Any one in
England would have been frightened at
meeting such a man, or else he would have
laughed at him. There was my great, high,
shapeless cap, made of goat skin, with a flap
hanging down behind to keep the sun and
rain off of my neck; my short coat of goat's
skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same material. The
breeches were made of the skin of an old
goat whose hair hung down so long that it
reached to the middle of my legs. I wore
a pair of leggings laced up on the outer side.
Around my waist I wore a broad belt of
goat's skin, which was laced together by leather strings. From one side of it hung
my hatchet, from the other, my saw. Over
my shoulder I wore another belt, not so
broad as the first, and from this, under my
left arm,hung two pouches, both made of
goat's skin, in one of which I carried my
powder, and in the other, my shot. On my
back I carried my basket, on my shoulder
my gun, and over my head my great, clumsy,
ugly umbrella, which, after all, was the
most necessary thing I had, next to my gun.
Near my home, but upon lower ground,
were my two corn-fields which I ploughed and
sowed every year, and which yielded me
good harvests. My vineyard I also cared
for, and the raisins that I made were not
only pleasant to eat, but were healthful,
as well.
Alarm.
ALARM.One day, about noon, I was walking
along the shore toward my boat, when,
looking down, I saw in the sand the print
of a man's naked foot. I was very much
frightened at this. I made use of all my
eyes and ears but I could neither see nor
hear anyone, so I went to the top of a hill that I might look off some distance; but
there was no one in sight. I went again
to the shore and walked to and fro, search-
ing in the sand, but there was no other
footprint to be seen and I could not imagine
how this one came to be there.
It was growing late, and I started for
home, looking behind me at every three or
four steps, and thinking every stump I saw
at a distance was a man.
When I came to my cave, which I now
named my castle, I ran into it as if I were
chased by wolves.
I could not sleep that night. I thought
and thought about that footprint, and made
up my mind that some savages from the
mainland had come over in canoes, but had
gone away to sea again, being as unwilling
to stay on the island as I was to have them.
I felt very grateful that I was not near
when they landed, and that they had not seen my boat; for if they had seen it, very
likely they would have hunted the island
over for its owner.
One morning when I was worrying over
this discovery, these words from the Bible
came again to my mind, "Call upon me in
the day of trouble; I will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me." I prayed to God to
deliver me from my enemies, then rose from
my bed greatly comforted.
For three days and nights I had not
stirred from my castle, so that I was in
much need of food; for I had nothing in the
house but some wheat cakes and water.
My goats, too, needed to be milked, and I
started at last for my country house to milk
them. After I had gone down there and
back for two or three days and had seen no
one, I began to feel less alarm.
Robinson Prepares for Trouble.
My business for the present was to make
myself safe against an enemy. The first
thing that I planned to do was to make
another tight fence around my castle out-
side of the first fence. About twelve years
before this, I had planted a double row of
trees here, where I wished to make a sec-
ond fortification. These trees stood close
together, so I had to drive in but a few
posts to make a thicker and stronger fence
than the first one.
In this outer fence or wall I made seven
little holes about as big around as my arm.
Through these seven holes I put seven mus-
kets, which I fitted into frames which held
them in place, so that they looked much
like small cannons. I could fire all of these seven guns in two minutes' time. The inner
wall I thickened until it was ten feet through.
This I did by taking dirt from my cave.
Outside of the outer wall, and some dis-
tance from it, I stuck all the ground for a
great way out, with twigs of willow, which
grow quickly, and in five or six years' time
I had a wood about my home, so very thick
and strong that no one would think of a
house being within, and if anyone had tried
to get through, he could not have done so.
For myself, I planned to go in and out by
two ladders—one to lead from the outside
of my outer wall to a shelf of rock, and the
other to lead from this shelf of rock to the
top of the hill. When the two ladders were
down, no man living could come down to
me without getting hurt; and even if one
could get down, he would still be outside the
outer wall.
The next question to answer was, "How shall I keep my goats out of the way of ene-
mies?" This is the plan that I made: I
would fence in three or four pastures far
away from one another, and well hidden by
trees; then I would divide my flock, so that
if one pasture were found by them, the
others might be safe.
So I went out in search of good pasture
land, and found a little damp piece in the
middle of a hollow, with woods all around
it. These woods were so thick that I nearly
got lost myself. There were about three
acres in this piece. I worked about a month
fencing it in, then I brought twelve goats to
it. These, I thought, were quite secure.
Later on, I fenced in two more pastures
and put tame goats into them.
For two years after my fright, I was very
careful not to fire my gun, though I never
went without one, and I carried two pistols
in my goat-skin belt.
I moved my boat to the east end of the
island where I ran it into a little sheltered
place. I thought that no one be likely to
find it here.
I seldom went away from home except to
milk and care for my goats. I did not dare
drive a nail or chop a stick of wood, for fear
the noise would be heard by someone. I
felt afraid, too, every time I made a fire,
that the smoke would tell where I was hid-
ing. So I made some charcoal by burning
wood under turf till it became dry coal.
This dry coal or charcoal would burn with-
out making any smoke.
A DISCOVERY.
I was cutting off some branches of trees
one day to make charcoal, when I saw,
back of the trees, an open place. I looked
into it and found that it was a cave, so
high that I could stand up in it. But I
came out much faster than I had gone in,
for as I looked into the cave, which was per-
fectly dark, I saw two large shining eyes,
twinkling like two stars.
I did not dare to leave the place without
finding out to what those eyes belonged,
so I took up a stick of burning wood and
rushed into the cave with it in my hand.
I had not gone more than three steps when
I was frightened as badly as at first; for I
heard a very loud sigh, as if some man were in pain. After this there was a mumbling
sound as of words half spoken, then another
deep sigh.
I stepped back and broke out into a cold
sweat; but soon I went on again into the
cave, and by the light of a stick held a little
above my head, I saw a great goat lying on
the ground gasping for breath, and dying of
old age. I stirred him a little to see if I
could get him out, but he could not stand
up, and I comforted myself thinking that
no savage would go into that cave while the
goat lived, at any rate.
This cave was not very large, but at the
further end, to the right, was a small pas-
sage, so low that one must creep on his
hands and knees to get through it. Having
no candle, I could not go into that part of
the cave, but I planned to come next day
and bring lights with me.
So on the following day I came with my candles, made of goat's tallow, and passed
through the low opening. I crept along on
my hands and knees about ten yards; at
the end of this long, low hall the roof sud-
denly rose to the height of twenty feet.
This was a most beautiful room. The
walls and ceilings reflected a thousand lights
from my two candles. The floor was dry
and level and had loose gravel upon it, and
there was no dampness about the roof or
sides of the cave. I thought, '' Surely,
here is a place of safety, and I will bring to
it some of the things I am most anxious to
save—my powder and five guns, at least.
The old goat died that night, and I took
full possession of the cave.
Return of the Savages.
About a year and a half had passed after
my discovery of the footprint, when, one
morning, I was surprised by seeing five
canoes drawn up on shore on my side of
the island. The people were all landed.
I knew that these canoes carried from four to six men, and I was at a loss to know
how to resist so many alone, so I lay still in
my castle for a long time.
As I could hear no noise, I at length set
my guns against the foot of the ladder and
climbed to the top of the hill. I could not
be seen here but I could see the men
through my glass. There were not less
than thirty of them.
They had kindled a fire and seemed to
be cooking their dinner and dancing around
it. I then saw two miserable beings dragged
out from the boats, to be killed. One of
these men they knocked down, while the
other was left standing alone until they
should be ready for him.
This savage seeing a little chance for
life, darted away from his captors. He ran
very fast right toward my home. I was
dreadfully frightened when I saw this, for I
thought all the savages were after him. I soon saw, however, that only three of the
men were following the runaway and he
was gaining ground on these, so that if he
could hold out at that rate he would be be-
yond their reach in half an hour. On coming to the creek he jumped in
and swam over. Two of the savages swam
after him, but the third one gave up the
chase and went back to the shore.
I thought, "Now is my chance to get
me a servant, if I can save this poor fel-
low's life;" so I ran down the ladder,
fetched my two guns and rushed out so as
to stand between him and the two savages
who were following him.
I called to the runaway, who was at first
as much frightened at me as at his two
enemies. Then I motioned for him to
come back and at the same time I went
toward the two savages, rushing at the
head one and knocking him down with my gun. I feared to fire lest those on the
shore should hear.
The second savage stopped when the
first one was knocked down, but I saw that
he was fitting an arrow into his bow, so I
shot at him and killed him.
The poor savage who saw both of his
enemies fall was so frightened by the noise
of my gun that he seemed about to run
away. I called to him again and beckoned
to him to come nearer, and he came a little
way. By a great deal of coaxing I got him
to come to me at last. He threw himself
at my feet, and placed my foot on his head
to show me that he would be my servant
forever. I raised him up and treated him
kindly.
But there was more work to be done.
The savage who was knocked down was
only stunned, and he was sitting up. This
frightened the runaway very much. I raised my gun as if I would fire at the sav-
age. At this the runaway made a motion
for me to let him take my sword, which
hung naked in my belt, at my side.
As soon as he had the sword he ran at
his enemy and cut off his head at one blow.
Then he took the head and ran to me and
laid it and the sword at my feet, laughing
as he did so. I signed to him to follow
me, for fear others should search for him.
Getting Acquainted With the New
Servant.
My savage made signs that he would
bury his two enemies, and I made signs to
him to do so.
This being done, I took him to my cave
and gave him some bread, a bunch of rais-
ins, and a cup of water, then told him, by
motions, to lie down and sleep on some rice
straw and a blanket which I placed there
for him.
While he was sleeping I had a chance to
study him more closely. He was a fine
looking fellow, tall and straight. He had a
manly, pleasant face, plump and round.
His hair was long and black, his forehead
high and broad, and he had bright, spark-
ling, black eyes. His skin was quite dark,
though not black. I think he was about
twenty-five years old.
When he awoke he looked for me. I was
out milking my goats. As soon as he saw
me he ran to me, threw himself flat on the
ground, and, taking one of my feet, placed
it on his head as before, to show how he
would serve me.
I let him know that his name was to be
Friday, which was the day on which his life
was saved, and I taught him that he was to
call me master.
Taking a cup of milk, I drank some of it
and moistened my bread in some. I gave
Friday a cup of milk; he did the same thing
with his bread, showing by signs that he
thought it very good.
After supper, I started with Friday to
the shore. He carried my sword and one
gun, and I carried two others.
When we came to the place where the
dreadful feast had been made, I grew faint
at the sight. It was covered with the re-
mains of the bodies of the poor savages.
I told Friday to gather these up and burn
them.
He would have eaten some of the flesh,
but I showed such anger at this that he did
not offer again to take any.
When we went back to the cave I gave
Friday a pair of goat-skin trousers, a goat-
-skin coat, and a cap made of hare's skin.
He was very proud of his clothes, though
he hardly knew how to get around at first,
when dressed in them, for he had never
worn clothes.
Now I wondered where I should make a
bed for Friday. I wanted to do well by
him, and yet I wished to feel safe myself,
so I made a tent for him in the space be-
tween the two fences.
This tent opened by a door into my yard.
The door was made to lock from the inside,
and I locked it and took in my ladder every
night, so that Friday could not reach me.
Had I known what a true friend he was to
me, I should not have wanted to lock him
out.
I learned from Friday, later, that he
came from the mainland, and that there were several tribes of Indians there who
were constantly at war with one another.
The army that won the battle would feast
on the prisoners which they had taken.
Some of these feasts were kept on my
island!
RobinsonaTeacher.
Friday, after a while, knew English so
well that I could talk to him about anything
that I wished.
I taught him that there is one God who made everything, and that He loves men
as a father loves his children, and that He
cares for them even more tenderly than
does a father. When Christmas time came
I taught him about Jesus.
I told him how I happened to be on the
island, and how long I had been there, and
what a hard time I had had at first to get
food and make a home, and how lonely I
had been until he came.
I taught him to shoot a gun. At first,
every time that he heard it he was so frightened that he trembled, but he soon
got over that.
I also taught Friday how to plant and
harvest the wheat and rice, and how to
make baskets and dishes. He milked the
goats every morning and evening, and
made butter and cheese.
One day it had been very warm, and
toward evening the sky was covered with
dark clouds. It began to thunder and
lightning, and Friday cowered away into a
dark corner of the house. I could not
think why it was that he was so frightened
and trembled so all over; so I said,
''Friday, what is the matter?" There was
no answer.
"Well, well," thought I, "is Friday
afraid of thunder and lightning as so many
people are?'' That was the case, for when
it thundered louder he trembled still more.
"Listen to me, Friday," I said, "if it thunders again do not be afraid, for God is
not angry. He is a kind and loving Father.
He can do anything that He wishes but
He does nothing that is not good for His
children."
Robinson Prepares for a Journey.
One day when Friday and I were walking
by the shore I said to him, "Do you not
wish you were in your own country?"
"Yes," said Friday, "I be much O glad
to be at my own country."
''What would you do there? Would you
be a man eater such as you used to be?"
Friday shook his head and said, "No, no;
Friday tell them to live good and pray to
God; tell them to eat corn, bread, and
cattle-flesh and drink milk; no eat man
again."
"But, Friday, they will kill you."
"Oh, no," said Friday, "they no kill me,
they will love learn.''
"Then will you go, Friday?" I asked.
Friday shook his head and said, "How
go? Friday no swim so far."
"I will make you a canoe, Friday, if you
want to go home," said I.
''Then Friday go, if you go," said Friday.
"But they will eat me, Friday."
"Oh, no, master, me make them no eat
you. Me make them much love you." Then
he told me how kind they had been to sev-
enteen white men who were thrown on shore
by a terrible storm.
When I heard this I began to think
strongly of going with Friday, hoping that by joining with the seventeen white men
there, we might find some way to cross the
ocean and get home. I took Friday to see
the boats that I had made. He thought
that the first one was too small. He liked
the size of the larger boat, but it was cracked
and rotten. He said that we could sail over
to his country in one of that size.
So now a new boat must be made, and
this time I wished to choose a tree near the
shore, that we might launch the boat without
trouble.
At last Friday found a good tree, for he
knew much more about the trees on the
island than I did. He was going to burn
out the inside of it, but I showed him how
to cut it out with tools. This he did very
handily.
In about a month the boat was done, and
a fine vessel it was. I asked Friday if it
would do. He said, "Yes, we go over in
her very well, though great blow wind."
But I did not intend to start out in the
boat as it was. I found a good cedar tree
and had Friday cut it down and shape it as
I directed. This was my mast.
But what should I do for a sail? There
were many pieces of old sails which I had
had twenty-six years, but they were mostly rotten. I looked them over carefully and
found two large pieces which were quite
good; these I sewed together. It took
about two months to get the mast and sail
ready.
My next piece of work was the making of
a rudder, which I fastened to the stern of
the vessel.
When the boat was all ready I taught
Friday how to use the rudder, and he be-
came a good sailor.
But we had to wait for good weather, for
it was now fall. I had been on the island
twenty-six years. I kept this anniversary
with a grateful heart. The last three years
had been much the happiest of my life here,
for Friday had been a faithful and true
friend to me.
I had brought the boat up the creek to
keep it from the storms and Friday had
covered it so thickly with the boughs of trees that the rain could scarcely get through
at all. Then we waited for November and
December, at which time we intended to
start on our voyage.
New Trouble.
The rainy season was now over and
Friday and I began to get ready for our
journey.
One morning I sent Friday to the shore
for a turtle. He had not been gone long
when he came rushing back, out of breath,
crying, "Oh, master! Oh, master! Oh,
sorrow! Oh, death!"
"What is the matter, Friday?" I asked.
"Oh, master, yonder there, one, two,
three canoes—one, two, three; carry Friday
off, cut Friday in pieces and eat him," cried
he, trembling from head to foot.
''Do not be afraid, Friday," said I. ''We
will go out and fight them. They shall not
carry you off, if you will help me fight.
Now will you do all that I tell you to do?"
''Me shoot," cried Friday, ''but there
come many number."
"Never mind that, Friday, just do as I
tell you."
Seeing me so cool, Friday became more
quiet himself.
We loaded two pistols and four guns with
bullets, then I hung my great sword by my
side and gave Friday a hatchet.
When we were ready, I took my spy-
-glass and went up the hill, to see what had
become of the boats. There I saw twenty-
one savages and two prisoners in three
canoes. They were coming, as before, to
make a feast.
I went down and told Friday that I
wanted to kill all of the savages, and asked
him if he were going to help me.
He said, "Friday die, if master say die."
I gave Friday one pistol to hang in his
belt and three guns to carry upon his shoul-
der, and a large pouch full of powder and
bullets. I took one pistol and the other
gun and told Friday to keep close behind
me.
We went through the woods so that the
savages should not see us until we came
near enough to them to shoot.
When we came near to the place where
the savages had landed I said to Friday,
"Go to that great tree there and see if you
can find out what they are doing."
Friday obeyed at once and came back bringing word that the men could be seen
plainly. He said they were all about the
fire eating the flesh of one of the prisoners
and another was lying bound upon the sand
near them; they would kill him next. He
was a white man with a beard.
When I heard thiswe moved toward the
savages, but kept out of their sight. We
were still about fifty yards from them and
there was no time to lose. Nineteen sav-
ages sat on the ground huddled close together
while two of them were stooping down to
untie the bands of the white man.
"Now, Friday, do as I tell you," I said
''Do exactly as you see me do." At this I
took my gun and aimed at the savages.
Friday did the same. "Now fire," said I,
and we both fired together. Three sav-
ages were killed and several others were
wounded.
They all jumped up but they did not know which way to look or which way to
run. I threw down my gun and grabbed
another. Friday did the same. We both
aimed at the savages and shot at the same
time. Two more were killed and several
more wounded.
''Now, Friday, follow me," I said, throw-
ing down my gun and picking up my pistol.
Then I rushed out of the wood, Friday fol-
lowing closely. We both screamed and ran
down to the prisoner. Five of the savages
jumped into a canoe. I told Friday to fire
at them while I set the poor prisoner free.
As soon as I had cut the bands that held
the white man and he had gotten over his
fright somewhat, he was able to help us
fight the savages. Only four got away in
a canoe and one of these was wounded.
The others were all killed.
Friday wanted very much that I should
follow the four in the canoe, and I also wished to do so, that no savages might be
left to carry the news to their home. If
they were to hear of this, great numbers
might come over and kill us; so I ran to
one of the canoes, jumped in and told
Friday to follow me.
AHappyMeeting.
Imagine my surprise on jumping into the
boat to find another prisoner, bound hand
and foot, and almost dead with fright. He
was lying in the bottom of the canoe.
I cut the ropes which bound him and
tried to raise him up, but he could neither
sit nor speak. He groaned piteously, for
he thought that he had been unloosed to
be killed.
I told Friday to speak to him and tell
him that we were his friends. Friday did
so, and the prisoner then sat up in the
boat. Friday stared at him a moment,
then threw his arms around him, kissing and
hugging him, and crying, jumping, laugh-
ing, dancing, and singing by turns. It was some time before I could get him to speak
to me and tell me what was the matter. At
last he cried, '' Oh, sir, my father!"
This meeting of father and son put an
end to following the savages, for they were
now nearly out of sight.
I was glad afterward that we had not
gone, for a great storm of wind arose, and
there seemed very little doubt that the sav-
ages who were in the boat must have been
drowned.
Friday was so busy taking care of his
father that I did not like to call him away.
At last I askedhim if had given his father
any bread. He shook his head and said,
"None; ugly dog eat all up self."
So I gave him a piece of bread and a
handful of raisins for his father. He gave
these to him, then jumped out of the boat
and ran off as fast as he could go. I called
after him but he did not stop.
In a quarter of an hour I saw him coming
back. As he came near I saw that he must
have been home, for he carried a jug of
water and two loaves of bread. He gave
the bread to me and carried the water to
his father. The water helped his father
morethan anything else Friday had done
for him, for he was faint from thirst.
After Friday had given his father a drink
I asked him if there was any water left.
He said, "Yes, master;" so I told him to
give the poor white man some.
The white man was lying in the shade of
a tree, very weak. Friday gave him the
water and some bread, which revived him.
I went to him and gave him some raisins.
This prisoner,who was a Spaniard, was
very grateful. As soon as he had eaten he
tried to stand, but was unable to do so, for
his ankles were very badly swollen and
pained him severely.
I wanted to take the strangers home with
me but did not know how to carry them
there. Friday said that he could get them
part way home,at any rate. He picked up
the Spaniard, carried him to the canoe and
placed him beside his father; then he rowed
along the shore and up the creek. He left
them here and ran back for the other canoe,
in which he brought me.
Then he helped the guests out of the boat
and set them down on the bank.
He could not tell what to do with them
now, but I had been planning for this, and
I called to Friday to come and help me to
make a litter of the branches of trees. On
this we carried the men home.
We could not get them over the fence,
so we made a tent outside and covered it
with old sails, over which we placed boughs
of trees. In this tent I made two good
beds of rice straw, with blankets for covers.
This being done I prepared some meat
soup and put rice and whole wheat into it.
When it was done we set a table in the new
tent and all dined there together.
The Spaniard had been so long among
the savages that he spoke their language
quite well, so that Friday could understand
him and could tell me what the two guests
said.
After supper Friday went after the two
guns which had been left on the battle-
-field, and the next day he buried the dead
bodies and the remains of the dreadful
feast.
Getting Ready for More Guests.
A few weeks later I began to think once
more of going over to Friday's old home.
His father told me that I might be very
sure that the people would treat me well,
after my kindness to him.
I talked with the Spaniard about it, and
learned from him that there were sixteen
white men living with this tribe of Indians.
They had been well treated by the savages,
but it was very hard to get enough food
and clothing to keep them alive.
The Spaniard wanted very much to bring
them to my island if I were willing. I felt
very sorry for them, and, besides, I thought
if we were all on the island, we might, by
working together, make a ship in which we
could sail home.
But there were not enough provisions for
so many, so we all set to work and dug up
a large piece of ground and sowed all the
seed that could be spared. Friday's father
and the Spaniard planned to go back for
the white men after the harvest.
While the crops were growing, I set the
men at work cutting down oak trees and
making them into planks for the ship, which
I hoped we might some time build.
We also caught several goats which were
added to my flock, and we gathered and
dried a great many grapes.
It was now harvest time. From the
twenty-two bushels of wheat sown, two
hundred and twenty bushels were gathered,
and the rice crop was as good as that of the
wheat. A great many baskets had to be
made in which to store so much grain.
We had a good supply of provisions on
hand now, and Friday's father and the Spaniard were ready to start back. I gave
each of them a gun and about eight charges
of powder and balls, and told them not to
use these unless it should be very necessary.
They took on board bread and raisins
enough to last them a long time, and supply
all the Spaniards about eight days.
They promised to hang out a flag on
their boat when they came back so that we
might know who they were, long before
they reached the island.
AnotherSurprise.
Eight days had passed since the Span-
iard and the old Indian left the island. On
the morning of the ninth I was fast asleep
in my cabin when Friday ran to me and
said, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come!"
When I heard this I dressed quickly and
ran down toward the shore, but I soon saw
that this was not the boat we were looking
for. I called Friday to me and told him to
keep out of sight of the crew of the boat.
Then I got my glass and went up the hill
where I could look without being seen.
Lying south of the island was a ship.
Yes, and it was an English ship, and the
boat was an English boat manned by Eng-
lish sailors. What a joyful sight!
Friday and I went down to the shore to
the boat, in which were the captain and two
other officers of the ship. These men were
very much surprised to find human beings
on the island. I told them how I came to
be here and how I had been longing these
many years to see my home and my pa-
rents.
The captain offered to take Friday and
me to England and I was very happy at the
thought of seeing my father and mother
again.
I told Friday that he might stay if he
wished to, and live with the Spaniards, or
take a canoe and go home, but he chose to
go with me, for he knew that his father was
free now and among his own people, and he
had come to think that I could not live with-
out him.
I left a letter for the Spaniards telling
them that I would send word to their coun-
trymen where they could be found. I left
them my guns and ammunition, also.
I took home with me, as relics, my goat-
-skin cap, my umbrella, and one of my par-
rots. I also took the bag of money, which
would now be worth something to me. I
could not help but feel sad when I bade a
last farewell to my island-home—my cave,
my vineyard and orchard which I had
planted, my tame goats, and my parrots.
They had all become dear to me.
I had lived upon the island more than
twenty-eight years.
Home Again.
After sailing seven weeks the ship rode
into the harbor from which I had set sail so
many years before. Everything was strange
to Friday, and he did not know what to
make of it all. He asked many questions,
but I was so busy thinking about my parents
that I did not answer all of them.
I hurried from the ship, telling Friday to
follow me. When nearly home I asked a man
whom I met about my parents. He told
me my father was still living, but my mother
had died from sorrow over the loss of her
boy. When I heard this I cried aloud.
On reaching home I opened the door
into my father's room. There he sat, the
poor old man, in his arm chair, his Bible
open on a table near by.
I hastened to him and cried in a tremb-
ling voice, ''Father, father, do you not know
your son? It is I, your boy Robinson!"
"Can it, oh, can it be my son?" said my
father, feebly. "Can it be my boy has
come back?" And he drew me lovingly to
his breast. After that he could not bear
that I should be out of his sight.
But my relatives and friends heard that I
was at home, and flocked to see me. I had
to tell the story of my shipwreck and of my
life on the island until late into the night.
When I had ended I said, "You see I
have had a hard time, and all because I
would not obey my parents and was lazy
when I was a boy."
From this time on, Friday and I lived a
quiet life. I took charge of my father's bus-
iness and Friday helped me. But I never
forgot to be grateful to God for keeping me
through so many dangers.
Robinson on His Island.
"I am monarch of all I survey;
My right there is none to dispute;
From the center all 'round to the sea
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
O, Solitude, where are the charms
That sages have seen in thy face?
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,
Than reign in this horrible place
"I am out of humanity's reach;
I must finish my journey alone;
Never hear the sweet music of speech:
I start at the sound of my own!
The beasts that roam over the plain
My form with indifference see;
They are so unacquainted with man,
Their tameness is shocking to me.
"Society, Friendship, and Love,
Divinely bestowed upon man,
Oh, had I the wings of a dove
How soon would I taste you again! My sorrows I might then assuage,
In the ways of religion and truth;
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheered by the sallies of youth.
Ye winds that have made me your sport,
Convey to this desolate shore
Some cordial, endearing report
Of a land I shall visit no more.
My friends—do they now and then send
A wish or a thought after me?
Oh, tell me I yet have a friend,
Though a friend I am never to see.
"How fleet is a glance of the mind!
Compared with the speed of its flight
The tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift-winged arrows of light.
When I think of my own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection at hand
Soon hurries me back to despair.
"But the sea-fowl has gone to her nest,
The beast is laid down in his lair;
Even here is a season of rest,
And I to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place,
And mercy—encouraging thought—
Gives even affliction a grace, And reconciles man to his lot."
--William Cowper.
