4 ()[t nearly four centuries the arctic regions have been an interesting
iield for explorers, and public attention has been frequently drawn to
the voyages and travels that have been made in the zones of ice and snow.
The fresh interest given to polar study by the story of the Jromwlle and
the Work of Lieutenant (irecly, on Lady Franklin Bay, has led to the
preparation of the present \'ollmle. It, is especially intended for youthful
readers, but the author indulges the hope that those of mature yeals may
find instruction and mnnsenmnt in its pages. He has pursued the plan
which met with favor in his previous works, and endeavored to present an
may of facts upon a groundwork of fiction, in the same manner as in
" The Boy 'l'ravellers in the Far East." llo trusts that the youths \vho fol-
lowed the fortunes of l" aid: and Fred in their many renderings will give
a kindly welcome to "The \'o_v:we of the Vivian" and its young.)' heroes.
The ship and its crew are fie tions, but the scenes of the voyage, and
the incidents and adventures herein described, are intended to be realities.
They have been mainly derived from the experiences of explorers, from
the time of Martin 1"robisher down to the present date. it was the author's
design to introduce all the important incidents of arctic voyages, together
with the most recent scientific discoveries, into a single narrative. The
portion of the voyage from Ilerald Island to the North-pole, and thence to
(irant Land. is wholly inmginary. (The writer believes that the sea around
the pole is open in summe . and will yet be reached by a ship fortunate
enough to iind an opening through the icy barrier which surrounds it.)
Thus believing, he has permitted the l'iz-ivm and (hull/[cud to pierce the
barrier. and explore the islands and waters which are as yet concealed
from mortal vision. ilc asks the literal ralder to remember that from
('hapters Xll. to X\'ll., inclusive, the geowraphieal positions of the ex-
plorers are not. to be regarded as actualities.
Many Works of arvtic navi-mtors and travellers have been consulted in
the preparation of the buolt. The history of polar explo'ation has been
carefully studied. from the voyages of John and Sebastian Cabot. in 1497'
down to the. most recent. publications in England and America. Many of
the authorities are given in the text of the book. The author acknowledges
his personal obligations to Professor J. E. Noun-so. author of "American
J'prlorations in the. lee-zones." and other works; to Lieutenant Lucien
Young, of the linited States Navy; and to Deputy lHS]rector-general llohert
M'Cormielaof the loyal Navy of England. lle is also indebted to the
courtesy of his publishers for their kind permission to make use of illustra-
tions that have appeared in their previous publications relative to the arctic
regions and the adventures of polar explorers.

With this brief explanation of his motives. and plan of work. the,
author submits " The Voyage of the Vivian" for the inspection of press
and public.

l'.S.--The pages of this book had been printed and made ready for
binding when, on the 17th of July, the country was electrified with the
news of the rescue of Lieutenant (ireely, at Cape Sabine, on the 22d of
the previous month. Sorrow was mingled with joy when it was learned
that out, of the twenty-three companions of the heroic explorer only tive
survived; eighteen had perished of cold and starvation, and if the relief
expedition had been forty-eight hours later in arriving at (.'ape Sabine
not: one would have been found alive!

Lieutenant (ireely's expedition has added materially to the work of
previous explorers. The country to the east and West of Lady Franklin
Bay has been examined, and a large extent of coast-line carefully sur-
veyed: valuable meteorological observations have been recorded; impor-
tant additions are made to the map of Northern (iretmland and the Polar
llasin; and the believers in an open sea around the Pole have received
fresh support. to their theories. The tlag of the United States has tloated
nearer to the Pole than that of any other nation. In May. 1.38:}, it was
unfurled by Lieutenant Lockwood in latitude 83" '_'-l-' 30" .\'., longitude
40deg 45' \V. in the friendly contest. in polar explorations the honors
have been transferred from England to America. but the whole world
will share in the additions which have been made to our knowledge of
the far North.

THE DEPARTURE--BOUND FOR THE .\'0RTH.--DESSCRIPTION OF THE PARTY.

" " LL ready there 2"
" A y, ay, sir," was the reply.

" Up with the anchor!"

The capstan went slowly round, propelled by the arms of twenty
men; the anchor left its bed at the bottom of San Francisco Bay, and
as the cable shortened till it hung straight down from the bows of the
vessel, the order " Go ahead slow!" was shouted to the engineer, who stood
at his post below. The machinery responded to his touch, and the whir -
ing screw churned a great breadth of discolored foam around the stern
of the Vivian. Soon she was ploughing her way through the water, turn-
ing now to port and now to starboard to avoid collisions with anchored

or moving craft. in the harbor
of the great city by the west-
ern sea.

The ships at the docks or
in the bay dipped their flags;
the steamers, great and small,
sounded their whistles pitched
to all the notes of the chromat-
ic scale; cannon boomed from
their embrasures on Alcatraz
Island and the other defences

on a steamboat which followed closely in the wake of the Viz-[an tilled
the air with its music. The (leeks of the steanilmat were black with people
who kept up a perpetual waving of hamlkerchiefs and, in the pauses of
the band, replaced the music with shouts and cheers of farewell.
Without: a pause the departing vessel held her way to the Golden
Gate; then she stopped her engines to permit the departure of the pilot,
together with several gentlemen who had accompanied her commander
from the anchorage in the harbor. The crowd on the steamboat cheered
more loudly than ever; the band played again. its notes growing less

distinct at every pulsation of the engine, as the V ivian headed away
into the open Ocean and left the shores of California fading in the dis-
tance. And to many on the deck of the steamboat, as she returned to
San Francisco, the query arose, " Shall we ever see her again ?"

The Vivian was bound on a voyage to the arctic seas; she added
a. unit to the number of those that have sailed in quest of the North-pole.

It was not. her first visit to the regions of ice, although she had never
before gone in the character of an explorer. Originally she was built
for a Whaler: as the whale has been driven from the open ocean, it has
been necewry for those who desire his oil to follow him to his retreat
in the region of perpetual ice. In the early part of this century, and
down to thirty years ago, the huntsmen of the sea found their prey in the
broad expanse of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. But in these latter
days the whale is not to be found in his former haunts, and even in theTHE DI-ZPAR'l'URl-I. 1'

C

far .\'orth he is by no means abundant. The successful hunters must
pursue him where ice abounds through the entire year, and only during
a few months in summer is it sniliciently open for ships to find a way
through it. Frequently the whale-ships are nipped in the ice, and a craft
of ordinary construction would be speedily crushed and destroyed.

"She was just as strong as wood and iron could make her," said the
former owner of the Vioimt. "That is, I mean she was one of the
strongest whalevs ever launched, and that is saying a good deal.

"She is a bark of 490 tons, old measurement; her ribs and all her
timhcls were the best we could find; her sides were twenty inches thick,
and we covered her with extra planking till she looked as though she had
put on an ulster overcoat for a sleigh-ride. For ten feet back from her
stem the bow was Solid oak, and then she was braced all through with
timbeis, so that no ordinary pressure could break her in.

"We christened her the l'lumy. She has made the voyages to the
Arctic Ocean, and come home every time full of oil, and not a man in-
jurcd. lint she had some narrow chances in the ice, and two or three
times it looked as though her crew never would see land again."

We shall hear more of the adventures of this tough little craft, as her
former captain is now her sailing-master. When she left San F'anciseo,
as described in our opening lines, she was owned by some wealthy gentle--
men of that city, who had subscribed a sufficient amount. to purchase
and fit her out for a voyage of exploration.

" What shall we call her 2" was a question in dispute for several day',
as each of her joint-owners had a pet name which he wished to have
adopted.

Masculine names were voted out of order on account of the feminine
charmztcr of a ship. The dictionary was consulted,and also the long list
of ships that have been in the arctic regions; finally, it was agreed
to call her the Victim.

"Couldn't be better," said Captain Jones, who formerly commanded
her, when the result of the deliberation was reported to him. "No ship
of that name ever passed the Arctic Circle; besides, you say that Tit-11m.
means 'lively,' and when she's in a rough sea I don't know of a livelier
craft than the old I'imny."

In spite of her excellent qualitieations fo' an arctic voyage, it; was
determined to improve upon them to a considemble extent. The Solid
bows were extended about five feet farther aft than they were originally:
additional braces were placed throughout. the hull; the bow was plated
with steel half an inch thick to within a foot. of the 'ail, and the rest of
the hull received a steel plating three-eighths of an inch thick from the
water-line downward. Thus prepared, it was thought she could resist a
pressure suflicient to lift her bodily from the water without straining her
enough to upon her scams and start a leak.

New sails were bent to her yards, and an extra new set was stowed
below; in addition to these, she had her old sails, which were laid away
in the hold. Thus she was provided with three sets of canvas to guard
against accidents; and, even if they were not needed for their legiiiniate
purposes, the sails would come handy to cut up into tents for camping on
the ice or on land.

 

ARCTIC DISCOVERY SHIPS.

IIer engines were not intended for steady use at sea; she was to rely
on her sails under ordinary circumstances, and only make use of steam
when emergencies required. Four hours after she had drOpped the pilot
at the Golden Gate the engines were stopped, the tires were extinguished,
and all canvas was spread to bear the Vivian northward to her destina-
tion. The wind was blowing down the coast, and almost directly in the
track the bark was to follow; consequently, she was obliged to stretch
away to the westward and make a lung " leg" by which to beat up towards
Behring Strait.

Three persons on the deck of the Vivian watched intently the reced-Tut-2 COMMANDER AND ms strnoamm'rtzs. 1?

ing shore as the bark held her course. Others would have watched with
them had they not been occupied with the work of clearing the decks,
and arranging sundry packages which were lying inconveniently about.
Probably no ship ever sailed from port for a long voyage without having
much to put in order as soon as she got away from land.

The trio in which we are specially interested were the commander
of the expedition and two young men whom he had selected to accom.
pan y him. And, while we are on the subject, we may as well give a brief
description of the principal characters in the story we are about to
narrate.

First and foremost was the gentleman to whose energy the organiza-
tion of the expedition was due, Commander Bronson, formerly an officer
in the United States Navy. He had already made two voyages to the
Arctic Ocean in an effort to reach the pole, and add to the discoveries
of other explorels. He was a cousin of Dr. Bronson, with whom some of
the readers of this volume may be familiar, and possessed all the good
qualities of that indefatigable traveller.*

Second in command was Major Clapp, who had been granted a leave
of absence from his regiment, with which he had been fighting Indians
on our northern frontier. His army rank was that of first lieutenant,
but for the purposes of this expedition he received the commission of
a Major of Volunteers from the Governor of California.

Third and fourth were Alfred Chapman and George Bridgman, two
young men who had just graduated from college, where they were equally
renowned for standing high in their classes and distinguishing themselves
in all the athletic sports that were encouraged by the pl'OfCSS0|'S. Alfmd,
or Fred as he was better known, had rowed "stroke" in the last boat-race
(wherein the rival college was badly beaten), and George was without
a superior in running, leaping, and in the national game of base-ball.
They had never visited the far North, but had spent a good deal of time
out-of-doors in winter and thereby accustomed themselves to the cold.

.-\s we have before said, the sailing-nuister was the former captain-
of the Virian when she rejoiced in the name of the Funny. He was-
allowed to retain his title, and therefore we shall know him as Captain.
Jones.

Dr. Tonuer was the surgeon and historian of the expedition, and, as.
he had a fondness for matters of science, he was iutrusted with the col-

lection of mine 'als, plants, and such natural history specimens as might
be worth preserving. He. was especially cautioned not to waste his time
in skinning,r and stuffing polar bears, arctic foxes, seals, and other well-
known products of the far North. " You may bring back the ears of the
bears and foxes as trophies," said the connnander, " but, as to leading the
ship with specimens that abound in all the museums, we won't think of it."

The crew of twenty men had been carefully selected from a great
number of applicants. All were comparatively young, and at least twelve
of them had been to the North on whaling voyages, and knew something
of the dangers and hardships of the journey before them. "'e shall be-
come better acquainted with the entire party as time goes on.

Major Clapp was occupied with the stowing of the cargo, so that Com-
mander Bronson was left with Fred and George to watch the land and
talk of the subject that was uppermost in their minds. Dr. Touner was
busy with the journal of the expedition, and determined to record the
incidents of their departure before he had time to forget anything. We
are indebted to his notes for much that we shall present in this volume.

"I have not had time to explain fully the plans of the expedition,"
said the commander, " and we may as well devote our leisure to them
now. Dr. Tonner has the whole story in his journal, and as soon as he
comes on deck we will have him read it over to us."

Fred and George nodded assent, as they could hardly do otherwise,
and the conversation: turned to other than arctic topics till the doctor
appeared. When the desire of Commander Bronson was made known
to him, Dr. Tonner went for his journal and proceeded to read its open-
ing pages. They contained a brief history of arctic and antarctic explo-
ration, and included many names that have become famous in history.

Before beginning to read from his journal, the doctor requested his
listenels not to be reluctant about asking questions, as he wished to make
every point perfectly clear to all of them. They agreed to the suggestion,
and, as it was fully carried out, the perusal of the journal took the form
of a dialogue, and resulted in the young men learning a great deal that
they did not: know before.

" A good many people believe," began the Doctor," that the discovery
of America by Europeans was made from the arctic regions, and not by
Columbus in his celebrated voyage from Spain."

"I have read something about it," said Fred, "but had forgotten the
' fact till this moment."

"Nearly five hundred yeats before the time of Columbus," continued

North America, which he deseeuded as far south as Massachusetts and
Rhode Island-at least such is the account. He named the country Vin-
laud, owing to the large number of vines that he found growing wild,an(l
he is credited with the construction of the Old Stone Mill at Newport.
There has been a great deal of discussion about the antiquity of the old
mill, and its origin is net yet. fully settled; but the claim for its construc-
tion by the Northmen has a large number of supporters. \Vllether they
built the mill or not, it is pretty certain that they visited the coast of
North America, and on their return told what they had seen. About
that time the Nnrtluueu explored llafiin's Bay, where they built monu-
ments which were discovered in the early part of the present century.
They established colonies on the coa<t of ('lreeuland which existed for
several hundred years, and can still be traced in the ruins of buildings
where the villages stood.

"They also made settlements on the shores of Spitzbergeu, and their
expeditions were pushed far to the north in pmsnit of whales, seals, and
other products of the sea. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries these
colonies flourished, and we may credit the Nortlnneu with being the first
explorers beyond the Arctic Circle."

One of the youths asked if the Northmen left any history of their
discoveries.

"They did not," was the reply, "except a. few fragmentary records
in some of the old chronicles of Iceland and Norway which tell the
adventures of Eric the Red and his sons. Eric planted the colonies in
Greenland, and his son Leif made the first voyage to Newfoundland and
the coast of New England. The Icelandic chronicles mention other voy-
ages to the same region, and their
stories are confirmed by Adam of
Bremen and by Nicole Zeno, a Ve-
netian, who went to Greenland near
the end of the fourteenth century,
and heard while there about a. great
country to the west and south. Ac-
cording to one account he visited the
country he described; and, if the
story is true, the Venetian Zeno stood
on the soil of America a century in
advance of the Genoese Columbus."

"\Vhat a perfect cyclopmdia of
knowledge the Doctor is," said Fred,
in a whisper to George.

"Yes," replied the latter, "and I shouldn't wonder if his cabin is
stuffed full of cycloptedias and all the latest works on arctic exploration.
I hope so, at any rate, as we can best accomplish the objects of our voyage
by knowing what others have done before us." '

"The Cabots, John and Sebastian, in 1497, were the next explorers of
the arctic seas, as they projected a voyage to the North-pole, and hoped
to go around America to the Pacific Ocean. They went beyond the sixty-
seventh degree of latitude, having previously visited Labrador, but were
turned back by the ice in Davis's Strait. They may be said to have been
the first seekers for the north-west passage, and have had many imitators
no more successful than themselves."

THE VOYAGE 01" THE "VIVIAN."

"I have a long list here," continued Dr. Tonner, " of the early advent-
urers in the arctic regions, and what they endeavored to accomplish.
Unhappily, the story is in many cases a story of disaster, and it, is a credit
to the courage and persistence of mankind that where many have failed
others are always ready to come for-
ward to fill their places. The battle
for the pole will never cease till
some one has stood on the point
where latitude and longitude cease
to exist, and has spread his country's
flag to the icy breeze.

"About AJ). 1500--02," the Doc-
tor read from his notes, " the Broth-
els Cortereal made three voyages to

results; fifty years later Sir Hugh

WWW" "mm in the efiort to find the north-west

Frobisher made three voyages among the fields of ice, and discovered
the strait which bears his name. Relics of Frobisher were found in 1861
by Captain Hall, whosent them to the British 'Museum. Ten years
later came Davis, whose name is preserved in the strait he discovered
and explored; and after him were a host of explorers from most of the
nations of Europe, all in search of a new road to the Indies by way of
the northern sea. English, French, Dutch, and Danes struggled for the
prize, but all in vain. Henry Hudson was sent to find a passage around
North America to India; and to his failure in this attempt we may
attribute his southerly voyage, which resulted in the discovery of the Bay
of New York and the river which flows into it from the north, and keeps
the name of Hudson fresh in our memory.

"While these and later expeditious were in progrc$ on the east, the
Russians were busy on the other side of the Arctic Ocean. The most
noted enterprise of the Russians in the last century was commanded by
Vitus Behring, who sailed in 1741 from Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka; the
Russian histories say that the sails of his ships were of deer-skins, and the
cordage was of thongs of the same material. Nothing important came of
his voyage, nor of the expeditions of Shalaroff, Andreyeff, and Captain
Billing; the latter an Englishman in the Russian service,who attempted
to reach the pole from the mouth of the Kolyma River, in Siberia. TheROSS AND BARRY. 23

most famous of the Russian expeditions is that of Von Wrangell and
Anjou, in 1820--93, which was made o'ver the ice, but got no farther north
than latitude 70deg 51', where progreSS was stopped by open water.

" Coming down to the present century," said the Doctor, partly reading
and partly ill a conversational tone, " we have the expedition of Ross and
Perry in 1813, and that of Captain Buchan and Lieutenant (afterwards
Sir John) Franklin in the same year. Ross and Parry went in search of
the north-west passage, while Buchan and F rauklin were ordered to go to
the North-pole if possible. It is needless to say that both expeditions were
unsuccessful; the one did not find the desired road to India, and the other
failed to reach the pole.

 

SIR JOHN "OK".

" Japtain Ross, who afterwards became Sir John Ross, made three
voyages to the arctic regions, the last being in 1850 in search of Sir John
Franklin. He must not be confounded with his nephew, Sir James Ross,
who sailed with him on his first voyage, and afterwards was an officer
under Captain Parry in his four voyages, between 1819 and 1827. In
1839 he went on a voyage of antarctic discovery, and was absent four
years in the southern hemisphere."24 1111-: roman OF Tim "VIVIAN."

"Was he the discoverer of the antarctic continent?" one of the youths
inquired.

"He was, and he was not," replied the Doctor. " \Vlien he reached the
antarctic continent, and hoisted the English flag upon it, he supposed he
was the first to see that hitherto unknown land. But it happened that a
few months earlier Commander \Vilkes of the United States Navy had
discovered the antarctic continent at a different point, and traced its
coast for several hundred miles. The discovery of Captain Ross was
entirely independent of that of Commander \Villx'cs, and neither knew
what the other had done until a long time after."

"Is it fully determined," asked Fred, "that the South-pole is sur.
rounded by land ?"

"Exploration in that direction has been so limited that it would be
rash to assert that there is an antarctic continent of any great extent.
(.'onnnander "'ilkes saw the land at only a few points, as he was separated
from it by an immense field of ice; and it is quite possible that what he
regarded as the coast-line was nothing more than a series of islands. At
the point reached by Captain Ross there were mountains ten or twelve
thousand feet high; one of them was an active volcano, which he named
Mount Erebus in honor of the ship he commanded.

"There has been," added the Doctor, " very little exploration of the
antarctic regions compared with the attempts to reach the North-pole;
but it is the general belief of geographers that the South-pole is sur-
rounded by land, and the quantity of ice there is much greater than at the
north. Thus far nothing resembling an open sea has been discovered
there, and every explorer has been stopped by immense fields of ice. 0n
the other hand, open water has been found as far north as most of the
explorers have ever been, and many g00gl't'tl)llcl'5 believe that the pole is
surrounded by an iceless sea, easy to navigate if we could only get to it."

" And what is really the case i"

"That. is what we want to find out," replied the Doctor with a smile, as
he closed his journal and promised to give them another talk on the sub-
ject of arctic discovery at a later date. " Is it polynia or paleocrystic t"

" Polynia means an iceless sea around the pole," continued Dr. Tonncr,
"and the name was given by the Russians. I'aleocrystic means a sea of
ancient ice, and is the term used by those who believe that the pole is
surrounded by an area of ice that never melts, but is piled up in enor-
mous masses quite impassable by man. The advocates of each theory
are able to give sound reasons for their belief; let us hope that we may
prove which is the correct one."THE FIRST NIGHT AT SEA. 25

C H AFTER II.

AT SILL--STORIES FROM THE ARCTIC REGIONS.

ALL who were not required for duty on board the Vivian retired early

on the first night at sea. There had been little sleep on shore the
night before, as the oflicels were entertained at a dinner given in their
honor at the Palace Hotel by the gentlemen who had contributed to the
enterprise, and the dinner had lasted until long after midnight. Fred and
George consoled themselves for their late hours with the reflection that it
would be a long while before they could sit down to a similar feast, and it
was well to make the most of it.

In accordance with the nautical custom, Captain Jones had divided the
crew into watches; at eight o'clock the starboard watch was set, and the
men off duty went below. The night was clear, and the Vivian sped
along under full sail, heading into the wind as much as possible in the
effort to beat to the north. As the sun went down the land was visible
on the eastern horizon, but by morning all trace of it had disappeared, and
the bark was in the open ocean, with nothing but sea. and sky within the
line of vision.

Fred and George were on deck soon after six o'clock, and the freshness
of their faces showed that they had made up for previous loss of sleep.
Neither had been disturbed in the least by the motion of the vessel, and
as it was their first sea-voyage, each congratulated the other on the pros-
pect of their becoming good sailors.

" I suppose, though," said George, " that we have not been tried yet, as
we have had very little rolling and pitching since we left port. Every
day of this sort of weather increases the chance that we will not be sea-
sick at all, and if it keeps up a week or so without change, we shall then
be ready for a blow."

" Don't feel too confident," said Captain Jones. who joined them from
below. "I've known men who were not disturbed in their digestion for
nearly a month, but became the most sea-sick of mortals when they caught

a strong gale from the north. This part of the Pacific is well enough, but26 THE vovxm-z or 'rnn "VIVIAN."

when you get above the fiftieth parallel you'll often find it as bad as the
Atlantic."

Then the captain amused them with stories of his experiences as a
whaler among the icebergs until seven o'clock, when breakfast was an<<
nounced. Descending to the cabin they met the counuander and Major
Clapp, and soon after they were seated at table the .Doctor made his ap-
pearance. He was not habitually an early riser, and often came late to
breakfast, always making the excuse that his appetite was light in the
morning, and a very little food would be-suflicient for his purpose.

After the usual greetings had been made, the conversation naturally
turned upon the object of their voyage, and their hopes and fears for its
result.

George asked how many arctic expeditious had been sent out.

" Nearly three hundred in all," replied the Doctor, " if we include those
which have gone by land in America and Russia,instead of proceeding by
sea."

"And how many of these expeditions have been lost altogether?" Fred
inquired.

" Less than you would suppose," the Doctor replied. " Only two expe-
ditions have been completely lost, and their destruction was due to igno-
rance of facts which have since been demonstrated. More than three
hundred years ago Sir Ilugh \Villoughby and all his companions died of
starvation on the coast of Lapland, within a short distance of a native set-
tlement where there were plenty of reindeer. The expedition was poorly
provided, and totally untitted for the severity of an arctic winter. It was
fitted out by an association: of merchants, who hoped to reach India by the
north-west passage; and out of the entire company of one hundred and
thirty-six there were eighteen merchants engaged in the venture.

"The other expedition, which has been entirely lost, was, as you are
well aware, that of Sir John Franklin, consisting of the ships frebus and
Terror, the latter commanded by Captain Crozier. The expedition sailed
from England in May, 1545, and was last seen by a whaler in Baflin's
Bay, on the 26th of July of the same year. The ships were then moored
to an iceberg, waiting for an opportunity to enter Lancaster Sound. For
a long time the fate of the ships and their crews was a mystery, but it is
now clearly known.

"The disappearance of the E'ebus and T error, gave an impetus to
arctic exploration, as it led to more than twenty search expeditions, some
on Government account, and others by private subscriptions. In a single
year (1850) no less than twelve vessels went to the polar regions in searchM'CLINTOCK'S EXPEDITION. 27

of Sir John Franklin, in addition to several sledging parties and land ex-
peditions. No traces of the missing ships and their crews were found, but
the search was continued at various intervals until quite recently.

 

RHIJCS 0F 5m JUII.\' FRANKLIN'S EXI'EDI'HDS.

"The mystery was solved by M'Clintoek's expedition in 1859, which
discovered records showing that Franklin (lied June 11,1847, and that
the crews had been forced to abandon the ships, which were crushed by
the ice. The natives reported that the party went. southward over the ice,
with their boats mounted on sledges, and that many of the men fell and
died on the way."

One of the youths asked if the records found hy Captain M'Clintock
gave a history of the expedition down to the time the ships were ahan-
doned.

"They did not," was the reply. "The records consisted of a slip of
paper enclosed in a tin case. There were two memoranda, one dated
May 25, 1847, on board the ships, and the other April '25, 1843, on the
same slip of paper as the other, but in a different handwriting. The
latter said the ships were abandoned April 22, 1848, having been beset
in the ice since September 12, 1846. It mentioned the date of Sir John
Franklin's death, and said that, down to the writing of the record, out of
a total of one hundred and twenty-nine persons, twenty-four had died.

"A few days before the records were found, Captain M'Clintock dis-
covered a boat fitted to a sledge and containing two skeletons, some guns
and ammunition, Sir John Franklin's silver tea-set, some tea, chocolate,
tobacco, and other things. Many other relics of the expedition were found
in the neighborhood or bought from the natives, and from the accounts
given by the latter it was evident that the entire party had perished.

"Captain Hall, an American explorer, who made three voyages to the
Arctic Ocean and died in Greenland in 1871, discovered additional traces
and relics of Sir John Franklin's expedition, but made no material addi-
tion to its history. He was an enthusiast on the subject, and entertained
the belief that some of the Franklin party remained alive for ten or
twelve years after the loss of the ships. His first voyage covered a period
of two years, and on his second
visit he remained five years
among the Eskimos, learning
their language and becoming
familiar with their ways. He
adopted their dress and mode of
life, and at length became so ac-
customed to the food of the na-
tives that he preferred it to the
dishes of civilization.

"He had a relish for raw seal-
meat, which he pronounced supe-
rior to the finest beefsteak ever cooked, and he was perfectly happy when
sitting down to dinner in an Eskimo hut--a performance that would
not result agreeably to the stomach of an ordinary man. In the account
of his travels he describes one of these parties, where a whole family, in-
cluding half a dozen dogs, entertained him with a feast which began with
raw seal and frozen fish, and terminated with stewed seal, cooked in a pet
that had no other cleaning than what it received from the tongues of the
dogs. Probably his appetite was sharpened by hunger, which in all ages
has been pronounced the best sauce.

"But we are wandering from the searches for Sir John Franklin,
which we may as well finish before we go on to other topics.

 

CAPTAIN HALL AMONG THE ESKIMOS.FINDING THE "OAT.

"After it was definitely ascertained that all the members of the Frank-
lin expedition] had perished, there was a great desire to find its records.
Information came from time to time concerning books which the retreat-
ing explorers carried with them after leaving the ships, and some of the
natives said these books had been buried in a cairn of stones which the
white men erected. The most definite statement came in 1876. A party
of Eskimos were visiting the bark A. Ifimg/ttnn, which was wintering
near Marble Island; one of the natives was looking at the captain's log-
book, and said that the great white luau who visited them years before had
kept a similar book. Having said this he produced a spoon on which the
word 'Franklin' was engraved, and thus made it evident that the book
he had seen was that of the missing explorer.

"These bits of information attracted the attention of Lieutenant
Schwatka of the United States Army, and led him to organize an expedi-
tion for the purpose of finding the missing records. He sailed from New
York in the summer of 1878. The history of his journey has been pub-
lished under the title of "Schwatka's Search," and was written by Mr.
W. II. Gilder, who went with him as second in commam'l.

"Quite likely we shall have occasion to speak again of Lieutenant
Schwalka and his expedition. To put it briefly, the lieutenant and Mr.
Gilder made the most remarkable sledge journey on record, having been
absent from their base of supplies an entire year, lacking only a few days.
In this time they travelled a distance of 3251 statute miles, or 2819
geographical miles, nearly all of it over an unexplored region,aud in one
of the coldest seasons known in the arctic regions for many years. Once
the thermometer showed the temperature to be 71deg below zero, Fahrenheit;
there were sixteen days averaging 100deg below the freezing point, and
twenty-seven days when it was more than 90deg below it. During all this
time the expedition was travelling, and its historian says it never stopped
at all on account of the cold."

"But you haven't told us what Schwatka learned about the records
of the Franklin expedition," said the commander with a smile.

"I was just getting to that," answered the Doctor. "He found that
the books had been destroyed by the natives; not maliciously, but because
they were quite ignorant of the value of the property. They gave some
of the volumes to their children for playthiugs, and no doubt the
Eskimo urchins had a great deal of fun with them. The rest of the
books were left on the rocks until they were destroyed by the wind and
storms: they had originally been deposited in a tin case, which the natives
broke open in the expectation of finding something valuable. Of courseSCIHYATKA'S SEA RC". 31

the books were of no use to them, and it seems a great pity that the offi-
cers had not informed them that the records would bring a gr *at price
if carried to where white men could see them.

"Schwa'tka brought back quite a collection of relics of the Franklin
expedition, and buried the bones of many of the men, which had been
lying exposed for years. The grave of one oflicer, Lieutenant Irving, was
found, and his remains were removed and sent to England. All the other
graves of ofiicers had been opened by the natives and the contents scat-
tered about: that of Lieutenant Irving was opened like the rest, and a
portion of the bones had disappeared; those that remained were gathered
as carefully as possible, and were identified by a silver medal awarded to
John Irving at the Royal Naval College, England, in 1830. The medal
was lying on a stone near by, where it was probably placed by the natives
when they robbed the grave, and was forgotten by accident."

 

TRAVIZLIJNG BY SLEDGE.

The conversation which we have recorded was frequently interrupted
by the movements of the steward, who was busy with the work of serving
breakfast, and as the cabin was narrow he was obliged to display a. good
deal of skill to avoid accidents. Once he upset the coffee-pot at the edge
of the table, but managed to catch it before the entire contents were
spilt. A few minutes later he allowed a fried egg to slip inside the col-
lar of George's coat, just as that young gentleman was leaning forward
to help himself to a sea-biscuit; consequently, George left the table for
a short period, and missed a part of the Doctor's lecture. Ile consoled
himself with the double reflection that the Doctor's fund of informa-

tion was by no means exhausted, but the store of fresh eggs would soon
give out.

After breakfast there was an inspection of the list of provisions that
had been brought along for the use of the party in the North. Previous
to the inspection the commander explained to the youths the plan of the
voyage, and his reasons for preferring San Francisco to New York as a
point of departure.

"To make it clear to you," said he, "I must first tell about, the polar
currents.

" Most. of the navigators who have entered the Arctic Ocean by way of
Davis's Strait and Bnfl'in's Bay have found themselves opposed by the
currents flowing down to the south. Frequently, when their ships an"
enclosed in the ice, they have been carried slowly but steadily along overRECOVERY OF THE "RESOLUTE." 33

the very track by which they ascended to the North, and without any
power to resist the movement.

"There are many instances of this on record. Captain Tyson, on his
escape from the Polaris in October, 1872, drifted south nearly two thou-
sand miles on a large flue of ice, from which he was rescued by the
steamer Tigress. In 1827 Captain Parry made a sledge journey over
the ice, but found that he drifted to the south nearly as fast as his sledges
carried him northward. Captain )I'Clintock, in the steam'yacht Foe, had
a similar experience: the Fox was locked in the ice in Baflin's Day,
August 17, 1857, and was carried back on her course until April 25th
of the following year; when released she had drifted one thousand three
hundred and ninety-fire miles southward.

that she had not been visited by the natives. Some deeantets of wine

which they had fairly earned by their long tramp over the ice.

"The prize was a valuable one, and the captain of the George Ilem'y

ice. lie divided his crew between the two vessels, going on board the

mate. It was rather a curious circumstance that. in a day or two after
he had done so the [Rea/[lulu was free and the (hm-ye [fem-y frozen in.
She got free, however, shortly after, and the two vessels made the best
of their way to New London. The Resale/v was bought by the [Tuited
States Government, and, after being thoroughly relitted, was sent to Eng-
land as a present to the Queen. The British Government accepted the
gift, but iunnediately dismantled the ship, and laid her up in the Wool-
wich docksyard.

"From the time she was abandoned until picked up by the George
[lam-y, the [Resolute had drifted a thousand miles, entirely by the force of
the current. Other instances of the steady drift of the currents could be
given, but those I have cited are sufficient."

One of the boys asked how the currents were made, and whether they
were the same throughout the whole year.

"The currents are generally stronger in winter than in the warm
months, but such is not always the case. They -re formed by the Gulf
Stream, in the Atlantic Ocean, and the [fury bum, or Japan current, in
the Pacific. The Gulf Stream, as you know, flows from the (inlf of Mex-
ico northward and eastward till it reaches the coast of Northern Europe,
passes the North Calm, and strikes the western shore of Nova Zembla.
Portions of it flow northward towards the pole, and naturally create a
counter current which sweeps down the coast of Greenland to the south.
It is this current. which brings the icebergs that are one of the dangers
of navigation in the North Atlantic."

"I know them very well," said George. "\Vheu I came home from
Europe in the steamer Arizona last year, we passed ten or twelve ice-
bergs in a single day. Captain hooks, who connnanded the Arizona,
said they had come from Greenland, and were brought, down by the cur-
rent; and he said they sometimes went as low as forty degrees north lati<
tude before they were melted hy the warmth of the atmosphere."

"The other stream," continued Conmtander lh-ouson. "is the [foreTHE (iA'l'l'lWAY TO THE POLE. 35

Silva, and flows from the coast of Japan northward through Behring
Strait. It greatly resembles the Gulf Stream, only it, is much smaller,
the narrowness of the strait preventng the passage of a great body of
water; still it is suiliciently extensive to sweep away the ice from that
part of the Arctic Ocean in ordinary summers, and give an entrance for
whalers and other ships. Many scientists have thought that this current
would furnish the best mode of reaching the pole, and some of theln
believe that it flows directly over it. While many explorers have sought
to reach the pole by the Greenland route, and been carried back by the
currents, others have argued that. the true way to get there is to take
advantage of the current through Behring Strait. Nine-tenths of the
sailing or steaming expeditions to the arctic regions have been by the
Greenland or the Spitzhergen route;
only a few have tried the other ap-
proach, and consequently its capa'
bilities have not been tested.

"It is my opinion that the gate-
way to the pole is through Behring
Strait; for that reason I wished to
sail from San Francisco rather than
from New York. l'erhaps we may
be caught in the ice and drifted
across the pole by the Japan cur-
rent; then we tnay be brought. down

it is all conjecture, but where everything is guesswork, the guess of one
is as good as that of another."

"Do you think there is water at the pole," said one of the youths, " or
perhaps solid land i"

"That is one of the vexed questions," replied the commander, with a
smile, "and it cannot be answered until somebody has actually been to
the pole and seen for himself. I have already told you of the discussions
relative to the sea at the pole (supposing there is a sea there), whether it
is polynia or paleocrystic, open or eternally closed. All that the expo-
ditions have accomplished towards reaching the pole is to get within about
five hundred miles of it; ten hours of an express train on a railway might
finish the journey, but, nnhappily, the railway has not been extended to it,
and Pullman cars are unavailable. Certainly the pole is surrounded by
an icy barrier, which does not remain the same at all times. One expe-
dition finds open water where another,a few years earlier or later, discov-
els only solid ice; and this experience has been repeated again and again.
The barrier of ice has been indented in a few places, but, practically, there
is an area of two and a half million square miles around the pole where
the foot of man has never tr0( ."

" It seems to me," said one of the youths, "that the cold must increase
as we go towards the pole, and where there is so much ice at every point
four or five hundred miles from it, there must be a great deal more ice at
the pole itself."

" Evidently you adhere to the paleocrystic theory," was the reply," butIS THERE AN ARCTIC CONTINENT.' 37

on one question you are wrong. The point of greatest cold is not at the
pole itself, but away to the south; observation shows that there are two
points of greatest cold, one in Northern Siberia and the other on Parry
Island,on the American side of the globe. North of these points the tem-
perature decreases as we approach the pole, but our progress is impeded
by the ice barrier already mentioned, and which has been such a hin-
deranee to every explorer in that direction.

" The North-pole is not the magnetic pole any more than it is the pole
of greatest cold. Sir James Ross, in 1832, fixed the magnetic pole in
latitude 70deg 5' 17" N., longitude 96deg 46' 45" W. It is there the needle
of the mariner's compass points, and not to the spot over which the North.
star is supposed to hang perpetually."

"What are the arguments in favor of an arctic continent?" was the
next inquiry.

"Here is the opinion of Lieutenant Lucien Young," was the reply;
and so saying, Commander Bronson drew from his pocket a slip cut from
a newspaper. "He has given much time to the study of arctic explora-
tion,and his theory is the result of careful deliberation.

 

AKCIIC BIRDS.

" ' The wild-fowl of the higher arctic regions,' says Lieutenant Young,
'when winter comes on,do not go south, but north. There, somewhere
in the unknown, mysterious regiuns,they build their nests and hatch their3-3 'l'lll-I \'(|\'.\(il-'. "I" 'l'illi "\'|\'l.\.\'."

nests on ice and snow, and are fond of vegetable suhstauces. Again, the
Gulf Stream, as is well known.al'ter leavingr the coast of America, divides
into three currents. (hie of them breaks on the ,llritish Isles, and gives
them the tempe'ature of New York: another goes along the northern

Stream meet with a resistance that they give out their latent heat. For
instance, they pass by the Grand Bank of Newfoundland, and do not. ma.

Isles is encountered,the heat is given otf.'

"'Now,' continues Lieutenant Young,'may not. the portion of the
Gulf Stream running north meet with the obstruction of land around the

ture of the region very materially? In support of this thcol'y we lind

Commander Bronson folded the paper and carefully replaced it in his
pocket.

"I can understand the benefits of the currents flowing; from the pole,"
said one of the youths. " They hring away the ice and thus prevent a vast.
accumulation. If it. were not for the currents there would he a great
increase every year."

"Quite true," replied the connuamler, "hut, in spite of the currents.
it, is gene'ally helieved that; the quantity of ice at. the pole is increasing
every year. Here comes the Doctor; let; us ask him to explain his theory
of the gala] cataclysln."

The query was made, and the Doctor readily assented to the proposal.

"My theory," said he, "is not by any means my own: it was pro-
pounded years ago by M. Adhemar, a eeleh'aterl French mathematician.
and is supported partly o' altogether hy Lyell, Darwin, Hebert, lion, and
others.

"Briefly stated. it is that the centre of g'avity of the earth is changed

and forming the deposits that: compose the difi'erent strata of the earth's
surface."

" How often do these upsets ocean" Fred inquired.

" About once in every twenty-one thousand yeals," replied the Doctor.
" The last is supposed to have been the Deluge, which is deserihed in the

added, " as the next eataclystn is not, expected for at least ten thousand

" "at I don't understand how it all comes aheut," said George.
" "'hat is it sets the eataclysm going '4"

" According to the geologists," the Doctor explained, "there is a differ-
ence in the amount of heat 'id cold in the two hemispheres. In the first
part; of one of these great: cycles of twenty-one thousand yeats there will
he more heat in one hemisphere than in the other, while at the last half
of the cycle the conditions are rwersed. Ilnmholdt estimated that at,
the present time there are eight days more of winter in the South-pole
than at the North, and consequently eight days less of summer. It fol-
lows, therefore, that there is an accumulation of ice and snow at the
South-pole which increases slightly, but surely, every year. Thousands

we are now a little past the middle of the cycle. Ten thousand years

fallen in the Southern Hemisphere: all the explorers in the direction of
the South-pole say there is a greater quantity of ice there than in the
North. and the. himleram-es to travel are everywhere insurmountal)le."

CHAPTER III.

PROVISIONS FOR AN ARCTIC VOYAGE-<<WHALES AND WHALERS.

'VE have observed that the inspection of the list of provisions was
interrupted by the talk concerning the exploration of the arctic
regions and the searches for Sir John Franklin; then came the disserta-
tion of the Doctor on the grand cataclysm which should change the rela-
tion of the poles and dcrange things generally, coupled with the re-assuring
assertion that it was not likely to come off immediately. Quiet having
been restored, as the reporters say, the list of provisions was produced.

"We are provisioned for two years," said the counnander, " and of
course we have the usual stores of a ship for a long voyage. They in-
clude salted meats, both dry and wet--the former carefully wrapped in
canvas, and the latter in strong (tasks. Then we have a liberal smck of
flour, meal, dried fruit, preserved vegetables of different kinds, canned
meats and fruits, and tea, coffee, and chocolate. Hard bread or sea-biscuit
has not been forgotten, as it is generally the first item in a ship's list of
provisions.

The Doctor remarked that the hardships of long sea-voyages had been
diminished by the abundance of canned goods, which were almost un-
known in the time of Sir John Franklin, and even at a much later date.

"As to that," said Commander Bronson," we are less fortunate than
you might suppose, as there are many qualities of canned provisions which
will not bear transportation to the arctic regions. All articles that con-
tain water are undesirable, as they are injured by freezing, and, besides, it
is not well to carry water where every ounce of weight is of serious con-
sequence. Our canned provisions have been specially prepared for us,
and contain the least possible amount of moisture.

"We have hoiseradish and lime-juice, in large quantities, to prevent
the disease called scurvy; it has frequently impaired the efficiency of
arctic expeditions, and in seine instances has been the direct cause of
failure. I have had our lime-juice prepared in a new form, partly to
facilitate transpmtation, and partly to make it easier of distribution whenPROVISIONS FOR ARCTIC EXPLORATIONS. ~31

wanted. Instead of being in liquid shape it is in the form of lozenges,
and in sticks like candy. When we are on the march over the ice we can
more easily distribute it than if it were frozen solid in bottles.

"()ur pemmican was made by a man who thoroughly understands its
preparation, and we have a liberal supply of it."

One of the youths asked what pemmican was, and the commander
proceeded to enlighten him.

" 1' *Inmican," said he, "is an important article of supply at the posts
of the Hudson's Bay Company and all through the northern regions.
There are two forms, raw and cooked; for the former, lean meat is cut
into thin strips and dried, and for the latter the meat is boiled before
cutting and drying. In either case the meat is reduced to powder, and
this is mixed with melted fat. A little seasoning is added, and in some
parts of the North the powder of certain leaves is introduced. When
thoroughly mixed, the substance is poured into a bag of green hide, the
end of the bag tightly sewed, and as the hide shrinks in drying it com-
presses the contents into a mass nearly as hard as a brick. The pemmican
is preserved from injury by its hide envelope, and is so solid that it must
be cut out with a hatchet or a stout knife.

" As an article of food it is admirably adapted to expeditions over the
ice, or in regions of intense cold; the great quantity of fat contained in it
supplies the carbon required by the system for resisting the effects of a
low temperature, and it is so well protected by its covering that it may lie
for hours in the rain, or be immensed in salt-water, without injury.

"I have tried an experiment," the eotnmander coutinued."or, rather,
I have repeated an experiment that was made by a recent English expe-
dition, and found to work successfully."

"What is that 2"

"I have mixed lime-juice with the pemlnican in such a proportion
that. it will not be necessary to keep the anti-scorbutic medicine always at,
hand. At least,I think the result will be that our men will keep in good
health without. the necessity of frequent tations of limejuice.

" So much for the food provisions," he added, "and with care they will
be all we need, in addition, of coutse, to the game we hope to kill from
time to time.

" For killing our game we are well provided with arms and ammu-
nition. We have several ritles of the latest pattern. and we have rerolvets
sutlicient to set. up a small shop, in case we want to tnake a trading vent-
me. We have a tow ritles that can be loaded with loose powder and
ball, bttt the most of our weapons use tixed ammunition; the shells can be

reloaded if we happen to run short, or are in danger of doing so, and there
is an abundance of material for reloading.

"There are only two sizes of fixed ammunition--one for the rifles and
one for the revolveis. Perhaps I might express it better by saying that
our weapons have only two calibrxs--the rifles one and the revolveis an-
other.

"\Ve have an abundance of warm clothing, both for under and outer
wear; it will serve us in ordinary times very satisfactorily, but on long
journeys over the ice, or in the dead of winter, we shall adopt the native
dress, of which we will learn more by~and~by. 'ou remember the old
adage,'when with the Romans, do as the Romans (lo;' apply it to our case,
and when with the llyperboreans, dress as the Ilyperborcans dress. They
wear thick furs and skins, and so must we if we would escape freezing in
the arctic winter.

" For fuel we have coal--as much as we can stow away in the ship's
bunkers; and we may be able to replenish our stock at one of the inter-
national depots recently established in the arctic regions."

"I had not. heard of them," said the Doctor; " when were they estab-
lished ?"INTERNATIONAL S L' l'l'lA'uS'l'A'l'lONS. 43

" I made. a suggestion three or f our years age," was the reply. " It was
favorably received by our government, and the Secretary of the Navy
proeeeded to act upon it. My suggestion was that every whaler, or other
ship, proceeding to the A '0 Ocean under sail alone, and having spare
room in her hold, should cany a quantity of coal, to be left at certain des-
ignated points, for the use of any explorer who might need it. An ex-
}.doring ship of any nation might use this coal under certain restrictions,
reporting through her own admi 'alty the number of tons taken, so that
compensation could be made to the gorermnent that sent it out. It is

" But won't the natives steal the coal, as they do everything else 2" one
of the youths inquired.

" l'udoubtedly, if it could he of any use to them," was the reply," but
thus far they have not found out how to utilize it. They look with wou--
der on the white man's ability to burn ' black stones,' but have not learned
how to perform the f 'at themselves. As long as they have no stoves, and
are not taught how to create a draft through the coal, they will respect the
heaps which we shall make on the barren rocks at East Cape, Littletou
Island, l'oiut Barrow, and the other places selected for our depots. Then,
too, these depots will be convenient. post-offices for the interchange of news
and information. 1 suggested that at each depot a mark should he made
on some prominent rock, indicating the spot where letters were concealed
a short distance away. The distances should he in yards, and the direction
magnetic by compass; or it might be shown by an arrow, cut or painted on
the rock. Thus " NE. 22 " would mean that a box had been buried twen-
ty-two yards away, in a north--easterly direction; " ---* 27" would show
that the direction of the arrow must be followed twenty-seven yards to
find the place of concealment. The position of the deposits would be ac-
cording to the character of the ground, the drift of the snows, and the
liability to discovery by the natives.

" It is of very little use," he continued, "to deposit papeis under cairns
of stones, as the natives invariably dig into the cairns and break open
the cases containing the papers. This was the fate of the records of the
Franklin expedition, as we have already seen. Now, if the records had
been buried in a dry spot, and all trace of the digging of the ground ob-
literated,future explorers might have been directed to the place by marks
on the rocks some distance away."

"But some of the natives--two or three that have been to the United
States and England--have learned to rear ," said Fred," and one of these
natives could discover the place of deposit."

"Quite likely," said the Doctor," but he would be intelligent enough
to know that the records would bring a handsome reward to whoever
found them, and there could he no danger from such a cause. Suppose
there had been a native of King William Land able to read when the
Franklin records were lying about in the hands of the children, or ex.
posed to the winds on the rocks. Every scrap of paper would have been
carefully collected and carried to one of the stations on Hudson's Bay;
instead of waiting more than ten yeats for detiuite information, we should
have known the fate of the expedition in a couple of years at farthest, and
the history of its work would have been preserved."COAL AND WHALES. 45

"But to return to the subject of coal," said the Doctor; "there is
plenty of coal in the far North,l believe, but it has never been utilized,
partly owing to the difficulties of mining it, and partly because it is of
very poor quality."

" Unless I am misinformed," responded Commander Bronson, " the
most of the coal found in the islands and along the coast of the far North
--with the exception of a large seam of anthracite at Lady Franklin Bay
--contains so much sulphur that it is dangerous to burn it in the furnaces
of steamships, on account of its eating away the iron of the fines."

" Yes,"7 answered the Doctor; "one summer when I was in Alaska we
made a trip to the Aleutian Islands. On one of the islands there is a line
bed of coal, so close to the water that it is an easy matter to get it out.
"'0 stopped there a couple of days, and filled our bunkels, and then
steamed off in high spirits. But we seen found that the sulphur in the
coal was destroying our tines, and the unconsnmed stufi was pitched over-
board. \Ve made the discovery just in time: our engineer said that if
we had gone on with it another day there would have been danger of
setting the to the ship. When we returned to Sitka it was necessary to
replace nearly all the tines with new ones, but, we were consoled by learn-
ing that othels had made the same mistake."

"There she blows!" said Captain Jones, pointing rather excitedly at
the spout of a whale a few hundred yards to windward.

The conversation relative to the Arctic Ocean came to a sudden stop.
and the entire party rushed to the rail to see the " monster of the deep."

" Eighty barrels of oil in him," said the captain. " Wouldn't he give
us a tine stock for winter evenings at the North-pole '5"

"Then we wouldn't have so much occasion for the coal depots we
have just heard about," exclaimed George.

" Let's capture him," said Fred. "and cut up his blubher for the en-
gine-room. "'onldn't the propeller send us along, with such stnfi' as that
for fuel !"

Evidently the whale was not at all frightened, and perhaps he mistook
the ship for one of his own family. He slowly came up, until he was not
fifty yards away. and then made a complete circuit of the l'ir'iun. Fred
wanted to shoot at him. "just for fun," and started below for a rifle; Cap-
tain Jones called him back, and said the sheetingr could not be allowed,
and with that the youth resumed his place at the mil.

" It Would have done no good to shout at him." lit] the -aptain. " and
might have done harm. .l'a'liaps he Would have dived after getting your
shot, and come up a lonf,r distance away, and perhaps he might have come-l-G 'l'llli VOYAGE Ol" Till-2 "VIVIAN."

up directly beneath the ship, and given us a shock that would have
strained us severely, or possibly sent us to the bottom. Such things have
happened, and there are several instances of whales hariug attacked ships,
br~aking in their sides and converting them into helpless wrecks. The
whale-ship Essex was destroyed by a whale in this way, and so was the
Union; other ships have been attacked, and there is no good in taking
a shot 'just. for fun,' as you say."

 

AX INCIDENT 01" THE "'llALH-I'ISIIERY.

Fred assented readily to the captain's suggestion, and concluded that
a shot at anything for mere sport, whether on land or sea, was not to be
recommended. IIe inwardly resolved that the lesson should not be lost
on him, and to strengthen his resolution he impart-ed it to George, who
promptly agreed with him.

Soon another whale, and in a little while another, were reported in
sight, somewhat to the discomfort of Captain Jones, who regretted passing
such magnificent game without trying to capture it.

"Why didn't we rig the ship for a whaling cruise as well as for an
arctic exploration?" said one of the youths; "then we could have had
the sport of killing whales, and made a nice profit from the oil."

" Very good in theory," remarked the Doctor, " but the practice Would
not have been so good. Whaling would delay our explorations, and per-"'HALE-l-'ISHING 1x THE ICE. 4'.'

haps ruin them altogether; you can't put science and connuerce quite so
close together without making one or both of them sxtfier. A better way
would be to make one cruise entirely as a wlialer, and another in the
interests of science; then you wouldn't run the risk of getting things
llllXCl ." .

"A voyage after whales would be an excellent preparation for a
Scientific one," remarked the captain, as he overheard the conversation
between the Doctor and the youths. " You make an intimate acquaint-
ance with the ice-fields, bet-gs, flees, and packs, and what a man doesn't
know about ice after a few whaling,r voyages is hardly worth finding,r out.

" The best whale-fishing is now close in upon the ice, and very often
you go for your game where the bet-gs and packs are thick. The fiist
whale 1 ever struck in the Arctic Ocean was along-side of a. great berg,
like a mountain, and when we hit him he tried to get under the ice to
escape us.

" We sighted him from the berg, where some of the sailors had been
sent to try to find fresh water, the ship meantime standing on and oi?
under full sail. 0f contse when they saw the whale they dropped all
idea of water and went for the prize; he cost us more than three hours
hard lighting, and at one time it looked as though he would get 0E in
spite of us. He doubled around the

him. In one way the ice helped us,
as he finally went into a little nook
or (com), in the berg, where he got
bewildered, and gave us a chance
to finish hiln up.

"I once saw a whale caught in

towards the top of it."

"How did that happen?" said
one of the listeners.

" I'll tell you," reslmuded the mariner. "I was in the [Robert Gibbx,
of New Bedl'ordmll' the southern end of Greenland, and we hadn't seen a
whale for several days. lhtt we kept a sharp lookout all the time, partly
for whales and partly to steer clear of the ice. One day we were sailing
along within a mile or so of a big berg that was drifting south with the

LOOXDX'T 0N AX ICE"
current, and seemed to have everything its own way. I was up in the
crou"s-uest. and had my eyes on the berg. when suddenly about a third of it
broke off from one side with a report like thunder, and went crashing and
splashing into the water.

" The part that broke off changed the balance of the rest, so that tile
berg turned about half~way over. One side went under water, while the
other came out, and the side that came out brought a whale along with it,
and lifted him nearly a lmndred feet into the air. lie was in a hollow iu
the berg, not large enough for him to swim in, but high enough in the
sides to keep him from getting over.

" .lle splashed about and made things lively, and the more he thrashed
the less water there was for him to live in. l shouted, 'there she blows 1'
and pointed to the iceberg. and away went a boat to capture him.

"The boat made fast to the berg, and the boat-steerer went on the ice
with a lance, though he had a hard time getting up the slippery side. But
he got to the whale after a while and finished him with the lance,and
then we wondered what to do with him.

"It wasn't exactly safe to go to chopping the ice enough to make a
channel for the whale to slip through to the water, as our blows would be
likely to split the berg again, and let us into the ocean among the falling
ice. Then it would be a long job to cut off the blnbber where he was.
and carry it away in the boats, after sliding the pieces into the water, and
nobody could tell what minute the berg might turn over again.

" It wasn't a large whale--about fifty barrels or so--but it was too good
to be lost. The captain looked the business all over, and then hit on a
plan which we at once carried out.

" We rove ropes around a dozen empty casks, and fastened the ends of
'em together, so that the lot looked like a bunch of toy balloons which the
peddlers sell on Broadway. Then we towed the casks along-side the berg.
close to where the whale was, and carried up the rope that held the bunch.

" We made it fast to his flukes to prevent its working loose, and then
we went back to the ship.

"The boats were all hauled in, and then we made sail and brought the
ship within about five hundred yards of the perpelulieular side of the
berg. \Ve tired several times at the berg with a small cannon, in the hope
that the concussion might shatter it and make it turn over again; but
though we brought off some large pieces it didn't turn as we wanted.

"Then we went back with one of the boats, taking along some powder
in a. tin canister, 21 long piece of safety--fuse. and the tools we needed for
making a deep hole in the ice. \Ve drilled a big hole just back of the$CUIHPSSBYS VOYAGE". 49

whale; then we put down the canister of powder, with the fuse attached,
and tilled the hole up with the line ice we had ehiselled out of it. When
all was ready, everybody but one man went back to the boat, and then be
lit the fuse and followed too. You can be sure he made the best of titne
down the slope, and the boat's crew never did better pulling than when
they were getting away from that berg.

" "'0 got. to the ship's side before the powder blew up. It split off a
great piece of the berg and let the whale down into the water, where he
was kept from sinking by the casks tied to his tail. When the commotion
was over we went and picked him up, and in a little while had his carcass
along-sidcmnd were cutting him in. I reckon that was about the only
whale ever killed on the top of :m iceberg.

"Talking about. mixingr up the whaling business with arctic explora-
tion,"eoiltiuned Captain Jones, "you'll liud we are indebted to the whalers
for a great deal that has been learned about the polar regions. For in-
stance, there was Captain Scoresby, who flourished in the early part of this
century; be combined the capture of whales with the pursuit of science,
and when he was not busy with the chase of a whale, he was making ob-
servations on the ice-packs and currents.

"Scoresby made more than thirty voyages to the arctic regions; he
believed in the open polar sea, and in 1806, when whales were searce,hc
endeavored to prove the correctness of his theory. He sailed into the ice-
barrier, and reached latitude 51deg 30' N. before he was compelled to return.
Hendrik Hudson had previously reached the same latitude in the Spitz-
bergen seas, but the record of Scoresby was the best made by a whaler
down to that time. Altogether he was full of adventure, as he passed the
80th parallel in lifteen of his voyatc, surpassing everybody else before or
since his time.

" He was full of courage in his lights with the whales, alnl had many
narrow escapes. Once his ship was in a bay that had been freshly frozen
over; the ice was so thin that it would not b *ar the weight of a man, and
too thick to be broken by rowing a heat through it. Whales were in the
bay, and there were holes where they came up to breathe, and Scoresby
wanted to get at them.

" He went to Work and made what he called 'iceslmesf they were of
thin plank, six feet long by a foot wide. and in the centre of each plank
he made a place where his foot could be held by straps. "'ith thes * shoes
he slid along the ice to the holes where the whales came up to breathe.
and there he harpooned them at his convenience.

" But after he had struck the harpoon into a whale the rough part of

4
the business came. The creature dived, and hy-aud-by came up to breathe,
and when he rose he wasn't particular whether he came to a hole or made
a new one with his back. Scoreley followed on his ice-shoes to where he
thought the whale \vunld come up, and if he made a good guess, he gen-
erally succeeded in finishing him off.

 

CAI'TAIX SCUIIESBY.

"Once he calculated a little too closely, for the whale came up right
under where he stood, and sent the old captain into the air, ice-shoes and
all. But there happened to be some strong ice close by, so he skipped out
of his ice-shoes and made for the solid ice, where he could stand in safety."

"Them were two Scoresbys," said the Doctor," and I presume it is of
the elder you are speaking."

"Yes," answered Captain Jones; "I forgot to say there were txro ofORIGIN or BRITISH stmznrrIONs. 51

them, father and son. Both were named William: the father did not be-
gin his seafaring life till 1790, when he was thirty years old, and he died
in 1829. The son ran away to sea in one of the father's ships when he
was only ten years old, and six years later he had risen to the rank of first
mate. The elder Scoresby made many improvements in whaling, and it
was he that invented and used the ice-shoes I told about. He commanded
the ship Resolution, when she made the northward voyage in 1806 to lat~
itude 81deg 30', and at that time his son was second ofliecr under him. The
son was the first to make scientific observations on the electricity of the
polar regions, and he made so many contributions to the geography of the
far North that his work has been long regarded as a high authority."

" He had a good deal of correspondence with Sir Joseph Banks," the
Doctor remarked, "and it was this correspondence, and the various reports
of Captain Scoresby, that led to the equipment of several important expe-
ditions by the British Government."

"\Ve duff our caps to the Scoresbys," said Commander Bronson, "and
they are worthy of all the honor their successors can give them."

The attention of the party was milled to an object on the water almost
ahead of the ship, and, as they neared it, the eyes of the youths were
strained to their utmost to make out
the strange sight. Floeks of birds
were circling about, or settling on the
waves, and there was a commotion
in the water that resembled a small
whirlpool.

"There she doesn't blow !" said
the captain, as soon as he turned his
gaze in that direction.

Then he explained that what they
saw was nothing but the stripped car-
cass of a whale. "Some whaler has
had hold of him," said the captain,
"and his blubber is now being con-
verted into oil, somewhere beyond

 

the l'ol'lzon- A xuuum or rm: SEA.

" The birds are having a rare feast.
on what the huntsmen of the sea have left, and that is why you see so
many of them. The sharks are in for their share as well, and they are
kicking up a lively commotion in the water. They are dangerous cus-
tomcis for the birds; anything is game for them that they can get hold52 'l'lll-I roman-1 or 'l'lll': "VIVIAN."

of, and if you were near enough you would see a bird go under every
few minutes, and become food for a shark.

" The sharks make it risky sometimes for the men who are cutting' in
a whale. A man has to go down on the whales back to start the strip
of blubber, and if he misses his footing while there, and slips into the
water, he runs a great. chance of being swallowed by a shark. The back
of a whale isn't the best footing in the world; you must have spikes in
your boots, or woollen stockings orer them, and even then, when a ship
is rolling and the whale is bobbing about, there is great danger of slipping.
After the strip is started the man climbs into 'the chains,' where he has
a better footing, and can chop away with the spade as fast as the blnbber
is unrolled."

As the Vivian passed the drifting carcass some of the birds flew away.
but their places were promptly filled by others, and there was no decrease
in the number. The captain said that sometimes the carcass of a whale
floated after being stripped and cast adrift, while at othels it sank instant.-
ly. Why it should float at one time and sink at. another was a mystery
nobody had been able to explain. And he further said that, sometimes
when a whale is on the surface of the water, he will sink as rapidly as a
stone, without any apparent motion of fins or tail.

The conversation continued for some time, and touched a variety of
topics, until dinner was announced. The next day and the next there
were more stories about the whale-fishery, and for a week or more Captain
Jones contributed freely to the anntsement of the youths.

One day he was describing an adventure with a sperm-whale in the
South Pacific; just as he was in the middle of his story, it was suddenly
interrupted by the announcement of a sail ahead, which threw everybody
into a state of cxeitemcnt.an

CHAPTER IV.

MEETING A STRANGBIL--SOMETHING ABOUT KAMCHATKA.

EORGE and Fred looked for the sail that had been sighted, but it

was some time before they could make it out. Even when they did
see it there was little more than a speck on the horizon, but. it was clearly
distinguishable to the experienced eyes of the counnauder and the 'ap-
tain. The latter declared it was a bark, even before he brought his glax
to bear upon it; after a long look at the stranger, he said it was probably
the Behring, on her way from 1' *tropavlovsk to San Francisco. The
youths had a suspicion that the latter announcement was entirely guess-
work, and based upon the captain's knowledge that the Behring was on
her way southward, and was due about that time. Whether they were
right; or wrong in their supposition, they had no way, for the present at
least, of finding out.

On the course they were sailing they were not likely to come very
near the stranger, as she was a long distance to leeward. Captain Jones
ordered the Vivian to change her bearing, and thus the two vessels grad-
ually approached each other. An hour or so before sunset they were
within signalling distance, and the guess of Captain Jones turned out to
be correct. For the last two hotns pens had been busy on' board the
Vivian, and letters were ready for despatch to San Francisco. George
and Fred wrote brief accounts of their voyage, for the benelit of friends
at home, and Commander Bronson embraced the oplmrtnnity to say what
he thought best to the owners of the Vivian. The most that any of the
party could say was that everybody was well, the voyage had been delight-
ful thus far, the ship was all that could be desired, and the stores, so far
as they had been examined, were in excellent condition.

The signal, "we desire to couununicate," was hoisted by the Vivian,
and the Bc/u-ing responded by announcing that she would heave to.
Then the Vivian signalled, " we will send a boat." As soon as the two
vessels weie hove to away went the boat from the Vivian's side, in charge
of the second oilicer. The captain suggested that one of tlie'youthson
g.

A VISIT ON THE OCE;

 

might go in the boat: there was a passage of politeness between Fred and
George, each urging that the other should have the honor and novelty of
the expedition, and as they could not decide upon it, the question was sub--
mitted to the commander. The latter promptly declared that the elder
of the twain should go, and without another word Fred descended the
rope-ladder and took his seat in the boat.

She (lanced rapidly over the waves, and in a quarter of an hour Fred
was on the deck of the Behring, exchanging salutations with her captain.
He was nearly knocked over by a large dog, that showed a desire to be
familiar without the formality of an introduction, and the brute continued
his attentions until dragged away by one of the sailois. The captain ex-
plained that the dog was from Kamchatka, and had never been used to
polite society; he was on his way to San Francisco, where it was hoped his
manners would be improved. Fred observed that the animal was identical
with what he had seen in the pictures of the Esquimaux dog, and the
captain confirmed his opinion by declaring that the Esquimanx and
Kamchatka dogs are precisely the same.

Fred delivered the package of letters for San Francisco, and gave the
captain several newspapers of recent date. Then the second ofiicer handed
over a small parcel addressed to "the bark Behring ,'" it contained
letters that had been sent. from San Francisco, on the chance that the
Vivian might meet her, or be able to leave the missives where they could
be delivered. ()n the way back to the Vivian the officer explained to
Fred that it is the custom to send letters in this way by every ship leav-
ing port for a direction in which another is supposed to be.

" My father," said he, " was the captain of a whaler in the old times,
when they sailed from New }edford and came home again, three or {our
years later, with the ship filled with oil and bone. My mother used to
write by every ship that sailed for the Pacific Ocean; not more than one
letter in twenty ever reached my father, but of course that one was wel-
come euongh to he a consolation for the loss of the rest."

The Behring had sailed from Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka, and was
on her way to San Francisco, and her captain had nothing of consequence
to report. He invited our friends hclow, and of course they accepted the
invitation, but did not stay long, as it was getting late and there was no
Occasion for further delay. Just as they were leaving the cabin he re-
marked that the ollicials at Petropavlovsk were preparing to receive a
French ship, which was shortly expected on its way to the Arctic Ocean.
Letters had been received from the French Government for the ofi'icers
of the ship, and with it came a message that the Gallic cxploreis had been56 'I'ln-I \'()t'.\(:!-: ()F Tm: h\'!\'l.\.\'."

instructed to stop at I'ctropavlovsk for their final instructions. "0 could
not give the name of the ship, nor tell anything further than that such a
craft was expected.

The lie/wing lilled away on her course for San Francisco, and her
crew joined in a farewell cheer to the l'im'mt, as the boat of the latter
started on its return. Just as the sun went below the horizon the boat
was hoisted in, and the Vivian turned her sails to the breeze that bore her
to the northward. Fred was overjoyed at his part in the incident of visit-
ing a ship at sea, and George was not far behind in excitement. Only
those who have made long sea voyages can appreciate the feelings of the
youths. A. meeting at sea is a great relief to the monotony of sailing
over the wide expanse of waters, and every incident, however trivial, be-
comes an event of the greatest importance.

When Fred made his report to Connnander Bronson, he caused some
perplexity to that gentleman. The story was a confirmation of what
he had heard while the Vivian's preparations were going ou--that a
French expedition was on its way to the Arctic Ocean by way of Behring
Strait. He desired to co-opcrate in a friendly way with any expedition to
the polar seas, without regard to its nationality, and when the report
reached him he wrote at once to the American minister in Paris for any
information he could obtain concerning it. The latter could learn nothing
definite on the subject, as the French are very reluctant to let their neigh-
bors know what they are doing in the line of explorations, and so the com-
mander had pretty nearly dismissed it from his thoughts.

The information derived from the captain of the Behring had thrown
new light upon the subject, and he at once thought it would be of advan-
tage to meet the French ship at Petroparlovslt, with a view to co--operation.

"How much would it take us out of the direct course to Behring
Strait," he inquired of Captain Jones, "if we should touch at Petro-
pavlovsk ?"

" About a thousand miles," was the reply. "I can tell you almost to a
mile by measuring on our charts."

"Never mind for the present," responded the commander; "perhaps
I will ask you more on the subject to-morrow."

"As we are now steering," the captain explained, " we shall go through
the Oonimak Passage of the Aleutian Islands, and enter Behring Sea.
If we steer for l'etropavlovsk, we shall leave the whole Aleutian chain
to the northward, and go several degrees farther west than we expect to
at present."

Commander Bronson made no reply; the captain discreetly ventured..InzC_Z<._--ACU ,nk-- :74 <=nz.<.r<

nun-mu 1m us. nmmu
a remark about the weather, and walked to the binnacle to see how the
ship was headed.

The commander went to his cabin, but the youths remained on deck and
began to discuss the probabilities of their visiting Petropavlovsk. George
remarked that Petropavlovsk was the principal settlement of the penin-
sula of Kamchatka, and he was sure it would be a very interesting place.

Dr. Touner joined them, and to the question as to whether he had ever
been in Kamchatka, he gave, to their delight, an aflirmative answer.

"I was there several years ago," said he, "and probably the country
has not changed in any appreciable degree since my visit. There is noth-
ing to change, or but very little, as the population: is small, and does not
devote itself to building railways or otherwise making improvements."

"Please tell us something about Kamchatka, and what you saw there,"
said George. " If we go there the information will be useful, and if we
do not visit Petropavlovsk, or any other port, we shall have learned some-
thing at any rate."

"Well," replied the Doctor, settling himself into a deck--chair, and
evidently making preparations for a long dissertation, " Kamchatka is at
the north-western extremity of Asia, as you can see by a glance at the map.

" It is not by any means as cold as you might suppose, from its position
so far to the north. In fact, it is too warm to allow the inhabitants to
raise wheat."

The youths looked at each other with surprise, but were too wellvbred
to indicate a disbelief in the Doctor's assertion.

"That statement requires explanation," continued Dr. Tonuer, "and it
is simple enough when you understand it. Kamchatka is a country of
volcanoes and earthquakes; three volcanoes, two of them extinct, and the
third only acting sluggishly, are in sight from l'ctropavlovsk, and there
are others in more distant parts of the peninsula. The underground fires
make the earth warmer than it should be for agricultural purposes, and
when I landed in Kamchatka, and asked why they did not make their
own flour, they told me the summers were too short for the cultivation of
spring wheat; and as for winter wheat it was invariably killed, because the
warmth of the earth caused it to sprout before the snow melted.

" They have had no severe earthquakes for a long time, but there are
several mild shocks every year. When I was there I was invited to dine
with the governor; we were about half through with our dinner when
there came a shock of an earthquake that threw down the chimney of the
house, and shook the building so violently that it nearly overturned the
table where we sat. I don't like dining under such circumstances, and we. l'.\l\'.SS Ul" KMIUIMTKA.

didn't finish the meal. The governor apologized, and I tried to laugh
over the occurrence, but the fact is, 1 was too scared to do so. The cap-
tain of our ship was of the party, and as he lived in San Francisco when
not at. sea he was able to take things coolly, and declared that he always
had an earthquake for the third or fourth course at. dinner.

" Petropavlovsk is one of the prettiest places, so far as the situation is
concerned, that you ever saw. It is on a great bay, nearly circular and
twenty miles across, with an entrance two miles wide from the ocean.
The bay is surrounded by mountains, and as you enter it the most majestic
of them all is directly in front. The mountain gives its name to the bay, or
the bay to the mountain, I don't know which. At all events, the expanse
of water is called Avatcha Bay, and the mountain is Avatcha Mountain.
It is a magnificent landmark, and can be seen through a clear atmosphere
nearly a hundred miles at sea.

"I shall never forget the scene as we entered the hay on a bright morn-
ing in July. The tops of the mountains were white with snow; half-way
down their sides the color changed to a barren brown, while the base of
every hill was covered with a thick growth of forest which half suggested
the tropics. The dark green of the forest was in several places relieved by
a strip of white beach, which separated it from the waters of the bay, so
that altogether the picture had a great deal of variety. Around the bay
there are some little harbors--eight in all--completely landlocked, and
furnishing admirable shelter to ships that seek them. On one of these
harbons Petropavlovsk is situated; the anchorage is enclosed like a pond,
and the only winds that a ship has any occasion to fear are the sharp blasts
that come down from the mountains.

"\Ve sailed into the great bay with the breeze that was blowing in
from the ocean, but as we approached the little harbor it was necessary to
move with caution. ()ur sails were fut-led one by one, and for the last
mile or more we sent a line on shore and were warped to our anchorage.
All the population came out. to meet us, and our line was grasped by dozens
of willing hands. Ordinarily, not more than half a dozen ships enter Pc-

- tropavlovsk in a year, so that an arrival is an event of importance.

"From the time of Captain Cook and his follmv-explorcrs Petroparlovsk
has been famous for its hospitality, and all travelleis who have been there
are warm in its praise. Our party was kept in constant activity during our
stay, and the nlunber of diunets and parties that were made in our honor
is frightful to contemplate. It was in the middle of summer, with the
thermometer generally above 70deg, and by the end of the first week I was
pretty well used up."A TOWN 'I'ESANTED l3" DOGS. 61

Fred asked if l'etropavlovsk was a large town, and what it lived upon.

" It is not a large town, from our point of view," responded Dr. Tonner,
"but it is the largest in Kamchatka, and is the capital of the peninsula.
Before the Crimean War it had nearly two thousand inhabitants, the most
of them being laborers and sailors connected with the government service.
It was attacked twice by the combined English and French fleets; in the
first attack the fleet was repulsed, but in the following year seventeen ships
were too much for it and the town was abandoned, and thereby hangs an
amusing story.

"The Russian authorities knew of the immense preparations for the
second assault, and sent. orders for the inhabitants to retire when the fleet
arrived, and allow it to land without opposition. The fleet came into
Avatcha Bay, and the town was deserted; but the people left behind them
their dogs, which they use in winter for dragging their sledges. There
was one man, an American, in the town, and more than five hundred dogs.

 

NET 81'. )HCIIAEL'S, 0R Mll'llAEIflVSKI.

The brutes kept up a perpetual howling, and the commanders of the fleet
concluded that there must he a very large garrison in Petropm-lovsk to
keep so many watch-(logs; and so the seventeen English and French ships
waited a whole day before venturing to send a boat on shore to a deserted
town! When they did so, they had the consciousness of being beautifully
'sold.'

" The principal business of Kamchatka, in fact the only business
amounting to anything, is the fur trade, and the chief contributor of
furs is the sable. The animal is caught in a variety of ways, and the
annual catch is about six thousand. The yea-salt, or poll-tax, of the natives
is payable in saliIe-skins--one skin to every four persons--and once a year
the governor makes the tour of the
country and collects the tax. The
trade is on the barter principle, as
there is very little money in the coun-
try; the people bring their furs to
the stores of the merchants, and ex-
change them for whatever commodi-
ties they want."

George asked if they did not get
agood many bear-skins, and the skins
of foxes and others, in addition to the
sable-skins.

" Yes," replied the Doctor, " they

nut-"M" 5",", do, but the sable is the animal of

greatest consequence. They get about

a thousand common fox-skins, and a few silver foxes and sea-otters, and
once in a while they get. a curiosity in the shape of a black fox.

"The government claims every black fox as the property of the em-
peror, and when the governor learns that one has been taken he requires it
to be surrendered, as a present to his imperial master."

"And does the emperor get it?" one of the youths inquired.

"He is more fortunate than I think he is if he does," said the Doctor,
in answer to the question. "Siberian governors are human,and it. is not
impossible that the skin which should be sent to the emperor is privately
sold to an American, or other foreign merchant, and sent out of the coun-
try. The emperor is not likely to hear anything about it--and even if he
does, the governor can declare that it is a long time since a real black fox
was caught.

"The silver fox and the black fox are both liable to he demanded for
the emperor," he continued, "and the result is that the governor doesn't
usually hear about them. When a native catches a silver fox, or by great
good-luck a black one, he conceals the fact, and also the skin. Then he
goes to one of the foreign merchants, and pledges him to secrecy before
admitting what he has to sell.

"As the merchant has a chance to buy the skin for about half its
value, he is easily induced to be silent, especially as he might be compelledHOW A COW CAUGHT A BEAR. G3

to give up the prize if the story should reach the ears of the governor.
Thus it happens that the silver and gray foxes do not adorn the neck of
the emperor as often as they might, if the subjects of the Imperial Gov-
ernment were better treated. They would be willing to sell it to the gov-
ernment at a fair price, but to give it up for little or nothing is not in
accordance with the feelings of human nature."

" But about the bears 't" qneried'George again.

"They have great numbers of bears in Kamchatka," replied the
Doctor," but. their skins are not used for exportation. The beasts grow
very large, and they are not agreeable companions when one meets them
in the woods. The beats are brown or black; I have seen their skins
more than six feet long, and been assured that the animals they originally
belonged to were not considered at all extram-dinary. Bear-hunting is
one of the amusements of the country, but there is a good deal of danger
to it. I went out on a bear-hunt one day with some friends, a few miles
from l'etropavlovsk, and was not at all sorry that we returned without
seeing any game. I remembered the story of the California hunter who
followed the track of a grizzly bear for nearly two days, and then gave it:
up because it was getting a little too fresh. As long as the bear is far off
I enjoy a hunt, which I can't say always when he is close at hand.

" They told me a story of a cow coming home, a year or two before
my visit, with a bear on her back. She had made his acquaintance a
short distance back of the town, and probably concluded that, as a dutiful
cow, she should take him to her master. She was not much hurt by the
performance, but it was observed afterwards that she preferred to (hi her
grazing in the vicinity of her own stable. Formerly she had been ad-
dicted to wandering in the woods, but her habits were completely changed
by her adventure."

The Doctor 'ambled on with his experiences of Kamchatka till it
was time to go to bed. The youths had a good many questions to ask,
and were by no means slow to ask them. aml before the party broke up
they had accumulated knowledge eln'mgh for the production of a news-
paper article on this odd corner of the world. They learned that the
country had an aboriginal population of about six timnsand,aml less than
a thousand Russian inhabinmts--the latter being pretty evenly divided
between Cessacks and the <<.lesecndants of exiles. The Doctor explained
that there were no exiles in the country, as none had been sent there since
1530. and all these had been pardmled long ago. Hardly any of the
original exiles are living at present, but their children are often men-
tioned as exiles. to distinguish them from the Cossack or native population.
 

 

 

 

 

 

MOI? NTEI) COSSACKS.

"What is a Cossack?" Fred inquired, " and in what does he differ from
the soldier and the peasant?"

" I will try to explain," the Doctor answered, " and perhaps the best way
for beginning is to compare the Cossack to a militiamau in the United
States. He is sort of half soldier, half peasant; he lives with his family,
and is engaged in agricultural or other occupations, but is required to give
a. certain nmnber of days every year to the service of the government.
In some parts of Russia the Cossack is required to serve on horseback,
providing his own honsc and equipments, but this is not the case in
Kamchatka. In war he becomes a soldier, and does excellent service in
annoying the enemy; in ordinary times he does any kind of work the
government may require. He may be called on to row a boat, drive a
team, build roads, cut forests, tend the governor's garden,or possibly take
his children out to walk.

"To show the authority of the government over the Cossacks I will
give you an illustration: In 1856 it was determined to colonize the valley
of the Amoor River in Siberia. There was a Cossack population in
Eastern Siberia, and the governor-general gave orders that a hundred
villages should be transferred to the Amour.Russmx cossacxs. 65

"The order was carried out without delay. In each case the old vil-
lage was abandoned for the new one, a thousand miles away; the people,
with their household goods, cattle, and other portable possessions, were
floated on rafts down the Amour to the points that had been selected for
their homes. In the new village each family found itself with the same
neighbors as of old, and everything went on as before. The government
supplied them with food, and paid a part of the expense of building new
houses, but of course the move was a severe loss to the people, as they
abandoned the fields they had cultivated, and were forced to make new ones
in the country to which they were carried. The ordinary peasant popula.
tion of Russia cannot be moved about in this way, but the government can
do pretty much as it pleases with the Cossacks."

 

A VILLAGE US Tlll'i .\.\llllll{ RIVER.

" Haven't I read somewhere," said one of the youths, "that a Cossack
is a robber Z"

"Quite likely you have," was the reply," and in many cases you are
not so far out of the way. In some parts of Russia the Cossacks indulge
in robbery to an extent greater than accords with our notions of honesty,
and this is particularly the case along the frontier of Central Asia. The

5
word 'kazak' in Turkish means robber, but its Tartar interpretation is
the equivalent of soldier. Most of the inhabitants of Eastern Siberia
are Cossacks; the whole country was originally explored and settled by
Cossacks escaping from punishment which had been decreed for some
improper conduct on the banks of the river Don. Their leader, Yermak,
received an imperial pardon for himself and his men, in consideration of
the addition they had made to the empire, and for this reason the Cos-
sacks of Siberia are naturally proud of their ancestry.

"The Cossack, in many parts of Russia though not in all, has a dress
peculiar to himself. He weals a tall hat of sheepskin with the wool out-
side; sometimes its color is jet black, but more frequently it is of a dingy
white, caused by the contact of the wool with a good deal of dirt. He has
wide trousers and a flowing coat; he carries his cartridges in a row across
his breast, and his arms consist of a lance, a carbine, and, generally, a pair
of huge pistols stuck in his waist; if he is a mounted soldier, he has a
small but very tough horse. When an army is on the retreat, in Russia,
the Comcks are a terror, as they pick off all the straggleis and make sud-
den attacks in unexpected places. If you have read the story of Napo-
leon's retreat from Moscow, you will remember what devastation was
caused by the Cossacks during the march."

With this desaltory lecture on Kamchatka and its people the evening
(same to an end.

 

RIIRQIAN CARPENTERS.a CHANGE or PLAN. 67

CHAPTER V.

.\ VISIT TO KAMCIIA'I'KA.

IIERE vas a long coufemuce the next morning between Commander

Bronson and Captain Jones relative to the movements of the Vivian.

It was held in the cabin immediately after breakfast, and required fre-

queut. consultation of the chart of the North Pacific Ocean. The chart was

spread on the table, and several real or imaginary coutses of the ship were
peneilled upon it.

" We shall have more sailing to do," said the captain, " if we go to
Kamchatka instead of steering directly for Behring Strait; but if the
wind continues to blow from the north, we shall make better headway by
going farther to the west than if we keep directly towards the strait. At
present it is almost a head-wiml, and by steering more westerly we shall
have it on the beam.

" We shall be pretty certain to lose time at the Aleutian Islands on ac-
count of the fogs. I have been a week getting through the Oonimak I'as.
sage; the fog was so thick I could not get an observation, and it is dau-
gerous to beat around in that region without knowing exactly where you
are. I have known ships to be kept there a fortnight, waiting for a good
chance to pass the Aleutian Islands. Once, when I was second mate of
the Raver, we sailed through the passage and were shut in by the fog im-
mediately after. The fog lasted three days, without any wind, and when
it lifted we found we had been carried back by the current, and had to
make the passage over again."

The captain paused while Commander Bronson made a calculation on
a slip of paper. .-\s soon as it was COIIGIII(IO(I,I10 went on with the "pros
and cons" of the direct and indirect voyages to Behring Strait. .

The result of the calculation was, that there would be a loss of about
ten days altogether in case the I'll-13m went to l'eh'opavlovsk instead of
proceeding directly to the strait. liven with this loss there would be
ample time to get into the Arctic Ocean in season to take advantage of
the summer: consequently, Commander Bronson decided in favor of the
indirect voyage.
The course of the ship was immediately changed, and it was announced
to all on board that I'etropavlorsk would be their first port.

There were light winds and fogs, fogs and light winds, with now and
then a. corner of a gale, for the rest of the way across the Pacific. Not a
sail was seen, and there was little to break the monotony; occasionally

 

 

AVATCIIA MOUNTAIN.

the Vivian passed through schools of whales; there was hardly a day
when she was not surrounded by sea-birds; and several times the youths
found their attention drawn to seals swimming close to the track of the
ship. The captain said it was not unusual to find these amphibious creat-
ures three or four hundred miles from land. They appear every summer
on the Fur Seal Islands, in or near the Aleutian chain, and after raisingARRIVAL AT PETROPA VLOVSK. 69

their families close to the habitations of tnen they go away, nobody knows
where.

One day the captain made his observation at noon, and after figuring
out his position, announced that they ought to see Avatcha Mountain:
about four in the afternoon. At that hour everybody was on the lookout:
and not live minutes after eight bells had been struck, the captain pointed
out something on the horizon closely resembling a cloud.

"That is Aratcha Mountain," said he, " and it is about eighty miles
from us."

It was two or three minutes before George and Fred could determine
the position of the mountain, which lay almost dead ahead on their comse.
Even when they made it out, they were not altogether certain till they
compared it with the picture on the chart, and satisfied themselves it was
not a conical cloud.

The ship sailed slowly along during the night, and by morning was
within twenty miles of the coast. At nine o'clock fires were kindled un-
der the boilers, and by noon they were steaming inside the entrance to the
bay, and heading for the anchorage in front of the little town. Captain
Jones said that the sailing directions for reaching the harbor were practi-
cally the same as made by the officers of Captain Cook's famous expe-
dition more than a century ago. Avatcha Bay and the harbor of l'etro-
pavlovsk were surveyed by Lieutenant Bligh, who accompanied Captain
Cook, and afterwards became known to the world for his connection with
the romantic story of the mutiny of the Bounty. "From all accounts,"
said the captain," Bligh was :11) admirable navigator and a detestable
brute. He has left a record of splendid seamanship and the most heart-
less tyranny. The mutiny of the Bounty was the natural result of his
brutal treatment of her officers and crew, and his escape from the perils of
a voyage of four thousand miles in an open boat illustrates his skill as a
sailor."

The red roof of the little church at l'etropavlovsk was a prominent
object in the picture before our friends as the Viz-hm steamed to her an-
chorage. George brought his glass to bear on the church, and discovered
that the building. though crowned with a dome, had no helfry; by looking
closely he made out that the bells were hung under a little roof at one end
of the church, and quite apart from it. Commander lronsou explained
that it was not at all uncommon in Russia for the churches to have their
hell-towers entirely apart from the structure. Fred asked the reason for
it, but the conundrum was not answered.

and a cannon at the little wharf near by boomed out its welcome. Several
boats put off from shore, the first bringing the Captain of the Port, an
official without whose authority it was impossible to go on shore or do any-
thing else. He was a portly individual, wearing the uniform of his rank,
and decorated along his breast with a row of stars and crosses. Captain
Jones whispered to the youths that there is no country in the world where
the officers have so many decorations as in Russia, and they need not be
surprised to meet a young lieutenant, hardly out of his majority, wearing
at least half a dozen decorations which had been given for services in time
of peace. "'hat a war might give him, provided he lived through it, was
hardly to be computed.

As soon as the Captain of the Port had completed his inspection and
retired there was liberty for others to come on board, or for the ofliccrs of
the Vivian to go on shore. Two or three resident merchants, and the
captain of an American ship lying at anchor in the harbor, were soon on
her deck to make the acquaintance of the strangeis, and invite them to the
hospitalities of the place; last came an ollicer from a F reueh hark which
lay just beyond the sand-spit marking the entrance of the harbor, and
which Commander Bronson had rightly conjectured to be the craft which0N SHORE IN KAMCHATKA. 71

he wished to see. Exclusing himself from the others, he turned his atten-
tion to the latest visitor, and learned that the Gallic explorer was the bark
Gumbctta, and had arrived only three days before. It was her comman-
der's intention to remain two or three days longer: he had been informed
of the voyage of the Vivian, and hoped she would visit l'etropavlovsk be-
fore his departure.

Captain Jones and Major Clapp, with the assistance of the Doctor
and our young friends, did the honors to the other visitors, and in a little
while the commander went on shore to pay his respects to the governor;
he was accompanied by the major and the Doctor. Fred and George em-
braced the opportunity to have a stroll around the town, and on the hills
near the harbor, and we can be sure it was a great pleasure for them to set
foot on solid earth after nearly a month on board ship. George declared
that his steps were unsteady for the first half mile or so, and Fred could
not resist au inclination to adjust himself to meet an expected rolling or
pitching every time he raised a foot.

int they soon forgot all about their mouth at sea with the novelty
of the sights around them. They realized what they had been told of the
dogs of the place, as they eucountemd some of those animals at every turn,
and were rarely out of sound of their howls. They did not have a high
opinion of the courage of the dogs, as the most of them ran away as soon
as they caught sight of the strangers; occasionally one would stop a Ino-
Inent to gaze, but. he generally concluded to put a good distance between
himself and lmssible harm. Near the edge of the town a dozen or more
dogs were tied to a long pole supported on posts. Fred said the place was
either a stable or a dog boarding-house, and he was inclined to the latter
opinion from the smell of fish that rose from it.

One of the resident merchants who had visited them at the ship joined
them in their promenade, and explained some of the things they could not
understand. Fred asked about the dogs, and the gentleman said his theory
was correct. " The dogs," said he, "are generally tied up in summer, or
kept in pens; if allowed to run at large they get lost or injured, as they
are fond of fighting and can get into a quarrel without half trying. \Ve
tie them up as you saw t.hem,and each dog gets one fish daily as his ration.
In New York it would be extravagant to feed dogs on salmon, but here it
is the cheapest article of food. The only cost of salmon is the trouble of
catching it. When we buy these fish we pay two or three cents apiece,
and if I agreed to take all that would be caught, and pay one cent each,
Ishould have half the population at work for me. Ordinarily, in winter,
there are about two thousand dogs in and around l'etropavlovsk, as every-
body has his dog-team, and many of us keep several teams for carrying
freight. In smmncr most. of the (logs are sent to the country, so that there
are only four or five hundred of them around here at present.

"This place is just like New York," he continued. " The fashionable
part of the population passes the summer in the country or by the sea-side.
Board is cheaper there than here, as the streams in the interior abound in
salmon; sometimes they are so thick that they fill up the stream altogether
and drive out the water, and a friend of mine says he has walked on them
as on a pile of shingles or a heap of potatoes!

" Perhaps you may think that statement is too strong, and I won't dis-
pute you; but they really are so abundant that the bears and dogs catch
their own fish out of the brooks, and the bears soon get so dainty that they
will only eat the backs of those they catch. The fish keep on going up the
stream till their tails are worn off against the rocks, and I have repeatedly
seen them taken from the water with nothing but the bone protruding
where the tail ought to be!

"And perhaps you may be sceptical about the dogs catching their own
fish ? Look there !"

As he spoke he pointed to where a couple of dogs were standing in the
water at the edge of the bay, and evidently waiting for something to turn
up. They were so far out that little more than their backs were visible,THE uses or SALMON. 73

and they held their noses just on a level with the surface of the water.
They were standing perfectly motionless, like sporting-dogs on a " point,"
and the gentleman said they were foraging for their breakfast and waiting
for salmon.

Suddenly one of the dogs darted his head under water with the
rapidity of a flash, and there was a. lively commotion for a minute or
more. It ended in favor of the dog, who came up triumphant witlt a
salmon of his own catching in his jaws, and brought him safely to shore.

 

DOGS CATCIILVG FISH.

"Even the cows and horses eat salmon," said their guide, "but they
never imitate the example of the dogs, and catch their own food. It is
proper to explain that they prefer grass, and generally stick to it when
it can be obtained. We give them dried salmon in winter, and if we
run short of hay they soon get accustomed to this odd food. There is one
cow here that will leave grass in summer and make a meal 01? fresh sal~
mon; but: she is an exception, and not a rule.

" We feed the dogs on fish the whole year round; they eat it in every
shape--fresh, dry, putrid, boiled, smoked, or any other form you can
imagine. ()ne fish a day is a dog's ration; when he is travelling he only
gets half that amount, and the day before he starts on a journey he gets
nothing at all."

" It seems cruel to treat them so," one of the youths remarked, "but of
comse you know from experience what is best for them."
" Yes," was the reply. " When I first came here I thought it was very
hard on the dogs to be only half fed while at work, and determined to
treat mine differently; but I soon found 1 did not get so much out of
them. They did not travel as fast and far as teams that were kept in the
old way, were sooner broken down, and were in worse condition when the
summer came around again, so I concluded to do for the future as the
natives did.

"Perhaps you've heard enough about dogs 2" he continued, "and if so,
we'll talk about something else."

George assured hiln that they had not begun to get enough of the sub-
ject, as they were likely to make an intimate acquaintance with dogs in
their arctic expedition, and the sooner they knew about them the better.

"Well, then," said their informant, "let me give you a piece of advice
at the outset. When you get among the dogs, and are going to use them
for travel, the first thing to do is to make their intimate acquaintance.
You must feed them yourself, and give them all the care they require:
have them understand that you are their master in every sense of the word.
\Vheu they do wrong, don't fail to punish them at once; and when they do
well, you must be just as prompt to reward them. You won't be able to
get up much affection: for them, and they will obey you more front fear
than from love. They have treacherous dispositions, and are not usually
capable of warm attachments. You know what a reputation the spitz dog
beats in New York and elsewhere; well, the spitz is first cousin to the
Kamehadale dog, and his name comes from Spitzbergeu, whence his an-
cestors were imported. He has improved by domestication, but is yet the
most undesirable of family dogs.

"You must drive your own dogs as well as feed them, and when you
begin to practice dog-driving you will find it is no sport. The dogs will
take the first and every opportunity to run away. \Ve harness them with
thongs of deer-skin, and they go in pairs with a leader, so that a team
always consists of an odd number. A great deal depends on the leader;
he is selected for his intelligence and docility, and a good leader is worth
four or five times as much as an ordinary team-dog. He turns to the right
or left at the order of his driver, and frequently when the team is tired
out, and drags slowly along, the leader will rouse them by barking, and
pretending that he is on the track of a wild animal. This will stir them
up, and the brutcs forget their weariness in the excitement of the chase.

"There are two kinds of sledges that we use, one for travel and the
other for freight. The travelling sledge weighs about twenty-tire pounds,
and is just large enough to carry one person with a little baggage. TheTRAVELLING WITH DOG-SLEDGES. 7:)

driver sits with his feet hanging over the side, and clings to a bow that
rises in front. In one hand he holds an iron-pointed staff called an 081011,
which he uses as a brake to retard the sledge while descending hills, or to
bring it to a halt. If you drop the axial! the dogs know it as quickly as
you do, and take the opportunity to run away or upset the sledge, and
even the leader is apt to join in the sport.

"The freight sledge is much heavier than the other, and sometimes
as many as twenty-one dogs are harnessed to it. The team for a. freight
sledge is not trained to high speed like the travelling team, and it is never
well to allow your travelling dogs to he used for freighting purposes, as it
is very hard to get them to run rapidly when they have once practised a
slower gait. An ordinary team for travelling is five dogs--two pairs and
a leader--but very often we use only three dogs in a team."

 

OE'I'HKG READY FOR THE ROAD.

Fred asked how fast the dogs could travel, and what distances they
usually made in a day.

"That depends on the length of the journey and the condition of the
snow," was the reply. "For a week or ten days we are satisfied with
forty or fifty miles a day, if the snow is good, and for two or three (lays'
travel under the same conditions we make fifty or sixty miles daily. I
have gone a hundred miles in little more than a day with a single team,
and once a team travelled from Dolizheretsk to l'etx'opavlovsk--a hundred
and twenty-five miles--in twenty-three hours. It made three or four halts
of not more than fifteen minutes each time. The snow was excellent, and
the dogs were in the very best condition, while the driver was a small man
and had no baggage of any kind. He was a messenger bringing news of
the declaration of the Crimean War.

"We don't use the dogs for sledging in summer, as I told you before,
but occasionally some of the natives harnms theln up for towing boats
along the shore of the bay just to keep them in practice."

 

 

 

 

IIUAT NWED IIY nous.

He pointed, as he spoke, to a boat which was coming along the shore,
and the youths saw that it was propelled in the manner described. Four
persons were in the boat, one of whom steered it, while another attended
to the tow-line; two otheis were seated nearly amidships, and evidently
had nothing to do with the management of the craft. The team was walk~
ing along the bank, under the guidance of a man armed with a stick, and
whenever they showed a disposition to lag he impelled them forward with
his voice and occasional blows.

George said it was certainly a norel mode of t'avelling, and a re--
minder of the old days of going west by canal.

" In North-eastern Siberia," said their guide, " they use dogs for ascend-
ing' the rivers in summer in the way you see. From Ghijiga light-house
to the village of that name they follow the rive' a part of the way, andnoes ,vxo REINDEER. 77

the journey is not at all disagreeable. Occasionally the path shifts from
one bank of the stream to the other, and then the dogs and driver are
taken in the boat to be ferried over. At such times the dogs amuse them-
selves by shaking the mud and water from their slulggy coats, and it is
well for a passenger to wear his worst clothes on such journeys.

"The best dogs in Siberia are in the neighborhood of Ghijiga and
around l'eujiusk Gulf, which is an arm of the ()khotsk Sea. Most of the
Russians buy their dogs from the natives, and there are several villages
where the raising of these animals is the main busineSS. Like everything
else of value that we use, the price is regulated by the laws of supply and
demand; sometimes dogs are very cheap, and at others very dear."

Fred asked if the dogs of Kamchatka were subject, to the same diseases
as the canines of civilized life.

"' Quite as much," said their informant; "and perhaps we may say that
they are more so. They suffer greatly from hydrophobia, and every few
years thousands of them are carried off by epidemics. The cause of these
epidemics is unknown, and it has happened that all the dogs in a village
will die off in the course of a fortnight without any apparent reason. Some
of the native tribes make sacrifices to their deities, and invariably take their
best dogs for the purpose. "'e have tried to convince them that the old
and useless, or even the dead dogs, would do just as well, but they refuse
to believe us. They show their faith in the power of the evil spirits by
offering up the best of their possessions."

George asked if there were any reindeer around I'etropavlovsk, and
said if there were he would like to see them.

" We don't have reindeer in these parts," was the reply. "You will
see plenty of them on the shores of the Arctic Ocean when you have
passed Behring Strait. They are the principal powrssion of the Chuck-
chees, the tribe that occupies that part of the country; and when you ask
how much a man is worth, they state the amount in reindeer, just as you
state it in dollars in New York."

Then the conversation shifted to a variety of topics. The youths
learned that the place was named Petropavlovsk in honor of saints Peter
and Paul,but they could not ascertain how it happened to have two names
when one would have been quite enough. As before stated, it had nearly
two thousand inhabitants previous to the Crimean "'ar, but since that time
the government has transferred its arsenal and naval depot to Nicolayefi
and Vladivostok, farther to the south, and the port of St. l.'*tcr and St.
Paul is shoru of its importance. It now has about three hundred inhabi-
tants, including a garrison of fifty Soldiers and half a dozen otlicials.(I)

THE VOYAGE OF THE "VIVIAN."

In the grounds of the residence of the Captain of the Port there is a
monument in honor of Vitus Behring, whose name is preserved in the
strait between America and Asia. On a tongue of land is another monu-
ment, but without an inscrip-
tion; it is known as the menu}
ment to La Peronse, and the
story goes that a French ship-
of-war was once at Petropavl-
ovsk, and her captain was in-
vited to dine with the governor.
During dinner the Frenchman
said he supposed there was a
monument there to La Peronse,
as that navigator visited the
place on the voyage which re-
sulted in the destruction of his'
ships and their entire company.

" Certainly. there is," an-
. _ swered the Russian, " and I will

uoscxtx'r To Bahama, maemvwvsx. Show it to you tO-mot'row."

He had the monument made
and set up during the night. The next morning he invited the French
captain to go with him to see it. Of course the latter was delighted, and
it is to be hoped he did not observe the newness of the construction. The
memorial to Behring was paid for by the officers of a Russian ship, and
was made in St. Petersbnrg; the other is of sheet-iron, nailed over a
frame of wood, and was evidently constructed in a few hours. Fred re-
marked that it was riddled with bullet-holes, and learned that it was
a favorite target for the practice of anybody who chose to take a shot
at it.

For the next two or three days the strangers had an excellent oppor-
tunity to learn the extent of Russian hospitality, which has been alriady
. mentioned. There was an endless succession of breakfasts, dinners, lunch-
eons, and suppers; and on the latter occasions it was not unusual for the
party to sit down at the table considerably past midnight. Not only did
they have all the meals above enumerated, but whenever they entered
a Russian house, no matter how humble, and remained more than five
minutes, they were greeted with a steaming tea-urn and cups or glasses
of tea.' Here is the diary made by George of the repasts of a. single
day:a rometo'r PICNIC. .9

One day there was a picnic ar'auged hy the ladies and gentlemen of
Petroparlovsk for the entertainment of the visitors. The latter included.
in addition to our friends, the officers of the Gazizbetla and the officers of
an American merchant-ship then in port. The entertaimuent was held in
a little grove about a mile from towu----a short distance from the spot
where the Russians repulsed the men that landed from the allied fleet
during the Crimean W'ar. The picuiekels sat on the grass under the trees.
after the custom of picnics all over the world, and our'friends rotcd that
they had a jolly time.

George said it might be called a polyglot picnic, on account of the
nationalities represented. The entertainers were Russians and Americans.
while the guests were Americans and French, with the addition of an
Italian, a Swede, and a Dane. Conversation was somewhat restricted, as
none of the American or French visitms were fluent in Russian, and sev-
eral of the entertainers could Speak nothing else. But what they lacked
in lingual facil y \'as made up in good-will, and there was many a hearty
laugh over the difficulties of being uudclstood. George and Fred made a
mental note of the strange dishes at the feast, though they had already
seen most of them at the dinner-tables of their hosts. There were sev-
eral pimgx, or pies, quite unknown to the American table, and some of
them were voted excellent. One was made of salmon and eggs, with a
crust ahore and below; another was composed of the marrow of the back-
bone of the sturgeon; while a third was filled with partridge cut; in
halves and alternated with slices of bacon. Of course they had tea in
abundance, and it was accompanied by numerous odds and ends of cakes
and patties, so that there was no danger of any one going away hungry.
In fact, when they returned to the ship for dinner all our friends confessed
their inability to do justice to the repast which their cook had prepared.

A return entertainment was "iron on board the Vivian, and another
on the Cami/elm, the latter vessel sailing a few houis after the last of her
guests had left. The next (lay the Vivian followed her exmnple, and
continued her voyage to the northward. They passed the reeks known
as "The Three Brothels," in front. of the light-house at the entrance of
Arateha Bay, and were once more on the broad waters of the Pacific.
The fires were extinguished, and as the ship spread her sails to the favor-
ing \viud Fred made a hasty sketch of the rocks, as a souvenir of his visit
to a remote but exceedingly friendly port.

CHAPTER VI.

BEHRING'S ISLAND AND BEHRING'S VOYAGER--AMONG TIIE CHUCKCHEES.

AILIXG north from Avatcha Bay the Vivian passed Behriug's Island,

in the Sea of Kamchatka. The name of the island naturally caused

the youths to ask several questions concerning it, and they were promptly
answered by Dr. Tonner.

"In that island," said the Doctor, as he pointed to one of its rocky
headlauds, "the brave old navigator after whom it was named died and
was buried, but the location of his grave is unknown. He deserves much
renown for his arctic explorations, and is worthy of additional fame, as
he is one of the discover-em of America."

Fred and George were not a little surprised at this announcement, as
they had never heard the name of Behring associated with that of Colum-
bus or Americus Vespucius. The Doctor went on with his story, which
was about as follows:

"Peter the Great formed a project
for making discoveries in the ocean be-
yond Kamchatka, and several explorers
were sent to the eastern part of Asia
with that object in view. Very little
was accomplished in the lifetime of
that monarch, but his plans were car- nu: mums.
ricd out by his successors. .

"Behring sailed from Avatcha Bay in June, 1741, and steered to the
eastward. '()n the 16th of July,' says Steller, the historian and naturalist
who accompanied Behring, ' we saw a mountain whose height was so great
that it was visible at the distance of sixteen Dutch miles. The coast of
the continent was much broken, and indented with bays and harbors.'

" This discovery was made on the (lay of St. Elias, and accordingly the
mountain was named in honor of that saint. If you wish to become famil-
iar with its location you can look for Mount St. Elias on the map of North
America.

"Behring sailed a short distance along the coast, and visited several
islands. Then he steered for Kamchatka; but. it was his destiny never to
get there. In the latter part of the voyage he was confined to his cabin
by illness, and the crew suffered severely from scurry. Steller savs that
at one time only ten persons were fit for duty, and they were so weak that

they could not furl the sails. The ship was thus left almost at the mercy
of the winds, and in this condition it was drifted on a rocky island--the
one now before us. It was dashed to pieces on the rocks, but not. until all
the crew had reached the land in safety.

"There were no human inhabitants on the island, but there were a
great many foxes, and they seemed to have no fear of the shipwrecked
mariners. Steller says, 'We killed many of them with our hatchets and
knives. They annoyed us greatly, and we were unable to keep them from
entering our shelters and stealing our clothing and food.'

" Many of the crew died soon after they got on shore, but on the whole
the life on land seems to have diminished the ravages of scurvy among
those who were not already far gone with the disease. Behring died on
the 8th of December, and was buried in the trench where he lay. The
survivors of the party built a small vessel from the pieces of the wreck,
and managed to reach Avatcha Bay with it. On their arrival they learned
that they had been given up for dead, and the property they had left in
Kamchatka had been appropriated by strangers.

"The report of the large number of fur-bearing animals on Behring'sORIGIN OF Till-2 RUSSIAN FUR COMPANY. 53

Island and elsewhere stimulated several adventm'ms to fit out expeditions
in the hope of making a handsome profit. The ships were built in Kam-
chatka, or in the ports of the ()khotsk Sea; they were of the rudest con-
struction, the timbers being fastened with wooden pins, owing to the searc-
ity or entire absence of metal nails, and in some cases they were tied t0~
gether with leathern thongs. The cr 'ices were calked with moss, the
sails were of reindeer skins, and the rigging was made of thongs of the
same material. A good many of these ships were wrecked, but others
made the \'()_\'th safely and brought back loads of fins.

" Out of these expeditions grew the Russian-Amerieau Company, which
received the administration and control of Northwestern America, and had
the exclusive right to the commerce of a vast territory. The company
occupied Russian America and the Aleutian and Kurile Islands, and
pushed its traffic into the Arctic Ocean. It had a monopoly of trade, law,
and everything else; it. reduced the inhabitants to a condition little better
than slavery, by eomwlling them to labor for the company at any time
they were wanted,aud at whatever prices the company chose to pay, and
it managed to control them by keeping them always in debt.

" The company's centre of operations was at Sitka, but it was not es-
tablished without considerable opposition by the natives. At one time the
natives were victorious; the Russians were driven from Sitka, and the fort
they had erected was destroyed. But, the invaders came back and estab-
lished themselves firmly; complaints of their tyranny and abuses reached
St. l'etersburg, and a commission was sent to investigate them. After that
time affairs went along more smoothly, the profits from the trade in furs
were large, and the company made tine dividends. But the fur-bearing an-
imals, principally the fur sea|,were killed off too rapidly, the profits (limin-
ished, the companv's affairs ran down,and finally its title was extinguished,
and the country w sold by Russia to the United States.

" There, you have a whole page of history," said the Doctor, " and it all
grew out, of our interest in the island we are passing. Perhaps you knew
it before, but a repetition will do no great harm. Sitka is now an Amer-
icau town, and the flag of the United States floats over the former resi-
dence of the Russian governor, on a high rock at the foot of Mount Edge-
combe. The fur trade is in the hands of an American company, which is
said to make much larger dividends to its stockholdeis than the old Rus
sian company was ever able to give."

"But what is Alaska good for, now that we have it ?" was the very
natural and practical query of one of the youths.

"That question was very freely discussed at the time we bought the
country," the Doctor answered. "We :cquired a good deal of ice, polar
beats, and similar property with our purchase, and as an investment of
money it is doubtful if the speculation was a profitable one. From a pa-
triotic point of view it was better, as it gave us a large area of territory
and removed the possibility of trouble between ourselves and llu :ia at
some future time. It is a protection to the fisheries in the North Pacific
Ocean, and since the purchase they have grown to considerable impor-
tance. (iold has been discovered in several places, but gold mining can
hardly be carried on with profit, on account of the long winters and the
deep snows that lie on the ground for so large a part of the year. It
is possible that some exceptionally rich mines may be found, similar
to those in Siberia, but up to the pi'sent time they have not been dis-
:overed.

"But the American eagle can scream more loudly than before we
bought Alaska: as there is more for him to scream about; and as the
lungs of that. bird require to be well exercised, we are not so badly off as
we might be in the possession] of this frigid region."

It was arranged between the commanders of the Vivian and the Gum-
lletta. that the ships would meet at East Cape, the mest. north-easterly point
of Asia, and forming one side of Behring Strait. EURach was to make a
direct course under sail, and the first at the rendezvous would wait three
days for the other before proceeding. In case of her departure she Would
leave a memorandum where it could be found by the other. There was
usually a smmner encampment of Chuckchees at that point, but, they could
not be relied on to be there; in case there should be such an encampment,
the memorandum would be intrusted to its chief.

There was no incident of consequence during the voyage from Petro-
pavlovsk to East Cape, but there was enough to do in reading up the his-
tory of arctic research, and observing the peculiarities of the high northern
latitude, to prevent time hanging heavy on the hands of our young friends.
Every hour they were coming nearer to the Polar Circle; the days length-
encd, till it seemed as though there would soon be no night, the air was

 

pcrceptibly cooler, the seabirds were more numerous than in the direct
voyage across the Pacific, whales and seals abmmdcd in the waters, and
the shore, whenever they passed near enough to discern its character, \
a scene of desolation. Entering the strait and passing around the cape,
the captain said they were within the Arctic Circle, and had reached the
regions of the midnight sun.

The Gambetta was at anchor in a little bay, sheltered from all winds
except. from the north and east; on the shore was an encampment of85

natives, and in the waters around the Gamlu'ttw several of the native boats
were plying.

As soon as the Vin/Tan had dropped her anchor Connnandcr Bronson
and Major ()lapp went on board the Gil-)IlIIL'lltl, while Dr. Tonner, with
Fred and George, proceeded to the shore. The youths were anxious to
visit the native village, and the good Doctor was by no means loath to
accompany them.

A Chnekchee boat preceded them, and on the way to the shore
George made a sketch of the strange craft. Arrived at the land, the
native boat was drawn up along-side their own, and the youths examined
it critically.

Here is the description which George entered in his note-book:

" The Chnckchee boat is unlike anything I ever saw in the waters
around New York. Its native name is byllara, and it consists of a frame-
work of wood, over which a covering of deer-skins is stretched. The
skins are sewn together very tightly, and. when properly made and
handled, these boats are said to leak very rarely. In getting into the boat
you must, be careful not to step on the bottom, or you might put your foot
through the skins, which are often kept in use until quite tender.

"They have a short mast, carrying a square sail which is also made
from deer-skins, unless the owner is lucky enough to get a piece of old
canvas from a whaling ship. On each side of the Lydia-a they generally
carry a seal-skin blown up like a bladder and securely fastened to the
boat at each end; these seal-skins serve to buoy the craft in case she heels
over from the effect of the wind or the waves, or is tipped by the clumsy
movement of an occupant.

"They carry heavy burdens in these boats, and venture fearlessly out
into the open sea. Occasionally they cross to the North American con-
tinent for the purpose of trading with the Eskimos, but their favorite
plan is to meet the Eskimos on Dionnede Island, about midway between
the continents, so that neither is within the territory of the other."

Lying on the bank not far from the boat was an inflated seal-skin, at-
tached to a line ten or twelve feet long; the other end of the line was
tied to a harpoou, and the youths naturally wondered what was the use
of the apparatus.

"That is what they use for catching walrus and whales," said the
Doctor. " The way they do it is this:

"They till the boat with as many men as it will hold, and in addition
to their paddles they carry long slips of whalebone, which are flat at. the end
like a piece of board. They paddle to the spot where a walrus has been\mLRus--nuu'rmo. 8?

seen to dive, and then half the men pound on the water with the whale-
bones in such a way as to make a peculiar cracking sound. This rouses
the curiosity of the walrus, and he comes up to see what it all means.
If they are near enough to throw the harpoon it is darted by the man in
the bow; another in the middle of the boat poises the seal-skin and
throws it. simultaneously with the harpoon. If they are lucky enough to
hit the walrus he drags the seal-skin after him as he dives; it pulls steadi-
ly on the harpoon, and after a while brings him to the surface, where he
gets another harpoon, and then another and another.

 

A CIIUCKCIIEE BOAT.

"The old adage that 'it is the first step which costs,' is well illus--
trated by the (L'huckchee mode of catching the walrus. A great many
efforts are made to get thefirst barpoon into him, and sometimes a whole-
day will be pzmed in continuous failures. int when a harpoon is prop--
crly fastened into one of these animals he can be easily traced by the-
floating seal-skin, and the rest of the job is comparatively easy."

"And did you say they catch whales in the same way 2" one of the
youths asked.

" Certainly," was the reply. "but they need a great many floats to hold
him up, so that he cannot (live. It is only when a whale or a walrus is-
prevented from (living by the number of floats attached to him, that they
can lance and kill him. Half a dozen will suffice for an ordinary walrus,
and a dozen for a large one, but in the case of a whale a great many are
needed. He has to be stuck full of liarpoons, and the seal-skins and blad-

of great imlmrtanee to this people, as you will realize when you know
something of their habits and mode of life."

While our friends were examining the boat,and talking about it. they
were surrounded by a group of natives, who looked at them with a good
deal of curiosity, but without any rudeness of manner. They wore a dress
of (leer-skins from which the hair had been stripped. Dr. Tonner ex.
plained to the youths that this was the summer costume, the clothing for
winter being much heavier and lined with far. The costume was a sim-
ple one. as it consisted of a tunic, like a shirt, which came nearly to the
knee, while the lower limbs were encased in garments which fitted rather
more closely than the trousers of civilization.

Fred noticed that all the strangers had the crown of the head shaven
smooth, and asked the Doctor if they were members of a priestly order.
Dr. Tonncr replied that it is the custom of this people, and also of some
other tribes in Siberia, to share the bead, and they are very careful in its
observance. Why they did so he could not say, except that it was the
fashion. Fashion rules as imperiously among savages all over the world
as in the extreme of civilization, and whatever she commands is obeyed.
A Chuckchee would no more think of rebelling against the sharing prac-
tices of his tribe than would a society man of New York venture to dist-e
gard the rules of etiquette prevailing in that city.

"They have strange customs relative to the disposal of their old and
infirm people," said the Doctor. "According to the statements of several
who have been among them, they have a practice of killing the aged
members of their tribe, and the curious thing about it is, that the victims
are always entirely reconciled to being thus put away, and the sacrifice
is gene ally at their request There seems to be no doubt that such is the
case; one gentleman (Mr. Richard J. Bush), who has written a book about
this country, visited a spot where one of these executions was about to
take place."

" Did he stay to witness it ?" George inquired.

"Not by any means," replied the Doctor--" partly because he was
greatly disinclined to do so, and partly because the natives did not seem
willing to go on with the ceremony in the presence of a stranger. When
you go back to the ship you had better read what Mr. 3nsh tells on the
subject."

George promised to do so. and faithfully kept his promise. Here is
what he read, on page 4-39 of " Reindeer, Dogs, and Snowshoes :"

" During one of our visits to the lower end of the bay we saw quite a large group of natives
assembled at a spot on the rugged mountain-side. about half a. mile back of the village, and being59

The natives were unwilling to proceed with the sacrifice until the white
men had gone; the latter had no desire to remain, and consequently rc-
tnrned to their boat. Xaukum afterwards said the old man again post-
poned his execution out of deference to the wishes of his grandson, but
Mr. Bush thought the tribe wished to defer it till after the ships had left
the hay.

From where they landed our friends walked back a hundred yards or
so to the crest of a ridge, where the natives had their summer residence.
The group that had surrounded them walked with them and kept up a
continual chattering and laughter, not. at all in accordance with the soloin-
nity of many savage tribes. Dr. Tonner explained to the youths that the
Chuckohecs are generally friendly with the whites, but sometimes they
have trouble with Whalers and other traders, growing out of disputes in
commercial t'ausactious. As fa' as can be ascertained, the fault is quite

SCHNERY NEAR EA" CAPE.

story is told by the officers of the expedition that was in North-eastern
Siberia in 1865--66, eudeavoring to build a telegraph line from Europe to
America by way of Asia.

One party was landed near Behring Strait, and another at Ghijiga,
near the head of the bay of that name, and on the northern shore of the
()khotsk Sea. During,r the winter the natives brought a report to Ghijiga
that there was a party of white men near Behring Sea who burned black
stones in a box, and had the most wonderful whiskey ever known.

The party at. Ghijiga joined the other towards the end of winter, and
through all the journey across North-eastern Siberia the principal news
that came to them was the astonishment of the natives at the wonderful
whiskey in the possession of the white men. Nothing of the kind had ever
been seen before; the liquid which the whalers sold was of no consequence
whatever in comparison with the new sort.

The sequel was interesting. It turned out. that when the party landed
the natives began at. once to beg for whiskey. Their demand was refused,
and they were told the white men had not brought any of the vile stuff.
To refute this assertion the natives pointed to several barrels that, had been
piled in the camp, and were known to be full of liquid of some kind or
other. To put an end to their demands, some of it was given to them.
The natives d mile and wure delighted; they had heard of the white
man's beverage called lire-water, but never before had they found the
genuine article. Certainly this was the tire-water they had heard of;
there could be no doubt of its eha actor, as it burned and blistered their
throats, and a little of it went a great \'ay. This whiskey, that became so
famous through the land, was nothing more than very strong lmpper-sauce,
which was intended for the preservation of meat.

Dr. Tonner told the youths there was a curious custom aun'mg the
Chuckchees which was not likely to be adopted in America or England--
certainly not in a hurry. He had been told that when a Chuckchee trader,
on a voyage to or from the Dionnede Islands, or elsewhere, was caught in a
storm and found it necessary to lighten his boat, he proceeded to throw
overboard the crew instead of the cargo. Goods are valuable, and cannot
be dropped into the sea without loss, but men are abundant, and a fresh
crew can be engaged at any time. The Doctor further stated that his
informant said the men made no objection: to this novel process of salvage,
but went over the side of the boat when ordered, under the full conviction
that they were simply discharging their duty to their employer.""

At the edge of the village several men were at work on the erection of
a house, and of course George and Fred stopped to have a look at them.
T hongh the men were interesting, the house was a great deal more so, as
it was of a material entirely new to the young travellers.

"You remember I told you how valuable the whale is to the Chuck-
chees," said the Doctor. " This house illustrates what I was saying."

The frame of the house was made of ribs of the whale and walrus, and
a good deal of ingenuity was shown in arranging it. Two or three poles
of wood that had been brought from Kamchatka, or some region far to
the south, served to support the ends of the ribs and other bones that -
formed the sides, while the covering of the roof was kept in place by long
strips of whalebone. One by one the bones were put in their places, and
then the covering was stretched over it. The latter was like a piece of
patchwork on an American quilt; it was composed principally of deer-
skins, but there were a good many sections of walrus hide among them,
and one or two strips of sail which had been begged or otherwise obtained
from the whaleis that frequent this region. This covering serves its pur-
pose admirably, though it is apt to let in water in case of a long rain ; it is
fastened carefully, to prevent its disappearing in thepourgus, or high winds,
that. prevail in these northern latitudes.

at tibijiga, in 18613, and was confirmed by another Rua'ian ollieial present at the inlerview.VALUE or THE REINDEER. 93

Dr. Touuer said the Chuckchee house was not a comfortable one for
a l'Inropean, but it met fully all the desires of the natives. On the score
of ventilation there was mllch to be desired, as there was no chimney, and
the best exit for the smoke was through a hole in the roof. Sometimes
it is necessary to close even this hole, on account of the weather, and then
the smoke has a hard time in getting out. The natives live, without ap-
parent incimveuieuce, in an atmosphere that would stifle a civilized being
in half an hour.

 

KRRC'TLVG A CHUCKK'IINDZ SUMMDIR-"OUSK.

A short distance back of the village a herd of reindeer was grazing,
and after a glance at the house our friends went in their direction. They
were scattered over a considerable area, under the watchful eyes of several
natives who kept them from straying.

Nearly all were standing, and while some continued to pluck the moss
and other vegetation from the ground, others raised their heads and gave
an inquiring look at the strangers. ()ue old deer, with a magnificent pair
of antlers, was lying on the ground in the front of the group, and retained
his position with an air of content and independence.

" The reindeer is even more important to these people than the whale,"
said the Doctor, " at least to the majority of them. The whale can only
be taken in suunner, but the reindeer is with them through the whole
year: his skin supplies the material for clothing. and for the coverings
of the tents. his tlesh is an important article of food, his bones form the
handles of knives and the heads of lauces, his sinews are an excellent
substitute for thread,and his antlers are used for the runners and frame-
work of the sledges.

"Deer are the circulating medium of the country, and values are
reckoned in them; a man with a. hundred deer is in comfortable circum-
stances: one with five hundred is 'well to do,' and one with a thousand
looks complacently on the future. When we go beyond a thousand we
are among the nabohs or millionaires, though the latter are not fairly
reached till we pass ten thonsaml. The wealthiest native of North-west-
ern Siberia is the owner of forty thousand (leer; he is regarded as a
Vanderbilt. or an Astor by his neighbors, and takes quite as much pleas-
ure in life as do the heads of the families I have just named."

" What an enormous herd of deer!" said one of the youths. "Forty
thousand together! I should like to see them."

" It is doubtful if you erer have the opportunity," replied Dr. Tonner.
"and I hardly believe the owner has ever seen them together. Where
a man has a very great number of deer he divides them into herds of a
thousand or twelve hundred each, and then scatters them over a large
area of country. lie is obliged to do this in order to find pasturage for
them; if they were all assembled in a single drove it would be very diffi-
cult to support them."

George asked what was the food of the reindeer. The Doctor replied
that the animal fed in sunnner on the scanty grass and shrubs that grow
in the valleys of the streams, and in the portions of the tumlrm or plains
that are least exposed; in winter he lives altogether on moss, which he
searches for beneath the snow, and displays a wonderful instinct in finding
it. Nature has adapted his nose to turning the snow in search of food,
and when he dies for moss he rarely fails to get it.

George wanted to mount one of the deer and take a ride. The Doe-
tor explained his wishes as well as he could to the natives in charge of
the herd, and one of them ran off to his tent and brought a saddle, and
also a long staff like a stout broom~hamlle.

The saddle was placed across the back of one of the animal's, just be-
hind his shoulders; it. was a pad like an orditmry racing saddle, but very
roughly made and without stirrup's. George thought the man had for--
gotten the stirrups, and motioned for him to go back for them, but the
Doctor explained that they were not used in riding the reindeer.

Both the youths shook their heads at. the prospect of being mounted
in this fashion. While they hesitated, the native took the staff in one
hand to support himself and then swung into the saddle; the instant he
was seath the animal started off for a graceful circuit of a hundred yards'12

or so, and then came back to the starting-point. The native dismounted,
and George endeavored to imitate his movements.

IIe suppm-ted himself with the stud, as he had seen the native do, and
then vaulted into the saddle; the result. was that he went over, and fell
on the other side, more to Fred's amusement than his own. He repeated
the etl'ort with no better success, and as Fred continued to laugh at his
misfortunes, George resigned in the latter's favor.

Fred did exactly what George had done, and then the laugh was the
other way. Then the native assisted him fora few moments,aud as soon
as the youth could find his balance he got along very well. Dr. Touner
explained that nearly every novice in mounting a deer goes over to the
other side, and for the first. day or so he spends most of his time in falling
off. The back of the deer is very weak, and consequently the weight of
rider or other burden must be placed over the shoulders; a weight of
fifty pounds, placed as a horse is loaded, would permanently disable a
strong reindeer.

The shoulders of the deer slide against each other as the animal walks,
and this makes the pad sway from one side to the other at every step.
As the rider has no stirrnps he must keep his balance or run the risk of
falling off, and to prevent this he uses the pol/m or staff. Many persons
on beginning their experience with reindeer use two of these Iii/Mus, one
on each side, but even with this protection they get a good many falls.
The polka has a bag or net of deer thongs at the lower end to keep it
from sinking too deep in the snow; the foot of the deer spreads out as he
steps on snow or on marshy soil, and is evidently admirably adapted to
its purpose. A horse would not be able to walk at all where a reindeer
can proceed with case.

A very little riding of the sort. we have described was enough for our
young friends, and the inspection of the herd of deer did not require a
long time. ()u the way back to the landing-place the Doctor described
the sledges used in winter in North--eastern Siberia. 110 said they were
similar to the (log-sledges, there being some for light travel, and others
for transporting freight. The deer were harnessed with straps or belts
around their necks, and to these straps leather thongs were attached that
extended back to the sledge. The animals were generally driven in pairs,
and as each had a separate harness, the one that went slowest was in
danger of having the sledge dragged on his heels.

The reins are fastened to the horns of the beasts, and the whip con-
sists of a long stick or rod with which the animals can he enlivened when
they grow weary. The sledge is made so that its body is at least a foot.
above the snow, and the greatest care is taken to have the runners slide
as easily as possible. They are usually made of the antlers of deer, or of
bones of the whale, and polished so that they shine like ivory. Where
strips of ash timber can be obtained they are preferred, on account of
their elasticity which renders them les liable to be broken than bone.

Ordinarin the pace of the reindeer is not rapid, but the animals for
the travelling sludges are trained to more with a speed which justifies the
reputation they have received in story-books. Instances are on record of
reindeer having gone at the rate of nineteen miles an hour for three or
four hours, and a single pair has been driven one hundred and fifty miles
in twenty hours. On such occasions they take a steady trot ut starting,
and if the roads are good they rarely break from it. until they have gone
a dozen or twenty miles. In many parts of Siberia they are preferred to
dogs, as they find their own food; but on the other hand the traveller
must follow a route where food is known to exist, or his team will break
down. When reindeer are wearied they stop, and refuse to more until
rested; if urged to go on they lie down, and no whipping in the power of
man to administer can induce them to rise and proceed.

CHAPTER VII.
curt-acums AND K0lt.\KS.--l.\'TERXATIO.\'.\L rHsTIVITIEs.

COMMANDER BRONSOX found the captain of the (Imu/wflrt ready
to receive him, and talk over the plans of their expeditions. Both
had the same purpose--to get as near as possible to the pole.

All the latest maps of the polar regions were spread on the table in the
cabin, and the two explorers sat, for some time in consultation over them.
Commander Bronson pointed to the discoveries of Wrangell and Anjon in
the early part of the century, and to those of De Long and others in recent
times.

" Wrangell was stopped at latitude 72deg 2' north," said he, "not by ice.
but by open water. He had travelled to that point on sledges, and had no
boats with which he could proceed. Since his time the land which he
endeavored to reach has been visited, and found to he a large island,to
which his name has been given. The natives of the Siberian coast had
been there before him, but of course their stories concerning it could not
be relied upon."

" It was almost directly north of \Vrangoil Island," said Captain Girard.
of the Gambetta, "that De Long was beset in the ice on the 4th of Sep-
tember,1879. From that point he drifted, helplessly, till his ship was
crushed and sunk nearly two years later. Ile went five degrees nearer to
the pole than Wrangell had been able to get, and found solid ice where
the Russian discovered open water."

"The drift. of the Jeannette," replied Commander Bronson, "shows
that the current, at that time at least, was setting northward and westward.
Now it is my intention: to seek a more easterly direction, by keeping nearer
to the American coast. From this point where we are now anchored 1
shall keep as close as I can to the 170th meridian of longitude until 1 have
crossed the 70th parallel. ""e may then expect. to encounter the ice, but
we shall hope for the best, and keep a sharp watch for lanes of open water
to carry us towards the pole."

Captain Git'ard said the route was so near what he had planned for hi.-AN EXCHAXGE 0F POLITENESS. 99

own, that he would be pleased to have the- ships proceed in company.
They could doubtless be of mutual assistance in the ice, and if an accident
occurred to one of them she could be aided by the other, and perhaps her
crew relieved from danger. " Of course," he added, "we understand that
each of us is at liberty to make the best of his way where the condition of
the seas will permit. All new discoveries shall belong to the one who
makes them. If we find an island not laid down on the charts, it shall be
named by the man that first sets foot upon it; and if neither ship is able to
send anybody to it, the discovery shall belong to the first who saw the
land and announced it by signal to the other."

 

ll.\l'.0.\' VON "'IL\NGIZLL

Commander Bronson agreed to this proposal, and said he should try to
put the flag of his country in advance of the banner of the French. Cap-
tain Girard stnilingly replied that the tri-eolor would be first at the pole.
and with these good-natured expressions of patriotism the interview came
to an end. Commander lronson invited Captain Girard to dinner on
board the Vivian. ; the invitation was promptly (zepted, and the (20m-
tnander hastened back to his ship to give the necessary orders, and to re-
call the Doctor and our youngr friends from their trip on shore.
Soon after the signal was hoisted the boat came dancing,r over the
waves, and the Doctor and his companions went to their cabins to dress for
dinner. The cook was instructed to do his best, as the occasion was a mo-
nieutons one: none of the party had ever entertained guests at. dinner in
the Arctic Ocean, and as they could not determine what the etiquette of
the country was, they agreed to stick to that of the civilized world.

The French captain came at the appointed time, wearing the full uni-
form of his rank. He was accompanied by the surgeon of his ship, who
had also been invited to the festivity; very cordial was the greeting be
tween the latter and Dr. Tonncr, as they had discovered in Kamchatka
that they were students together in Paris, and had met frequently while
promenading the hospitals. The French surgeon spoke very little English,
while the American doctor was decidedly rusty in the language of Paris;
there was a good deal of blundering in their conversation, and occasion-
ally each managed to misunderstand completely what the other said.
However, they managed to get along, and the meeting was a real pleasure
to both. Their comparison of notes was interesting, as they found they
had been doing the same things in different parts of the world. While
Dr. Tonner was in the service of the American Army in Arizona and New
Mexico his fellow-stmlent had been in similar employment in Algeria; in
the same year that the former had started in private practice in San Fran-
cisco the latter had set up for himself in Ma 'eilles, and almost in the
same week that the American went. from San Francisco to reside in New
York the It'renchman emigrated from Maiseilles to Paris.

"Les cactremes so tone/tent," remarked the surgeon of the Gum/jello
when their comparison of notes was ended.

" Yes," was the reply, "extremes meet, and perhaps we shall continue
on the same lines for the future. We may follow different roads and both
reach the pole."

The eyes of the Frenchman sparkled at the suggestion. lle began to
say something, and suddenly checked himself; then he made a remark
about the hazards of a journey in the arctic regions, and closed with the
suggestion that he certainly hoped to reach the North-pole.

Then he wanted to make a wager that the French flag would he the
titst. to float; over the pole, and warming with excitement he next proposed
to double his wager and make it on behalf of his own ship.

Dr. Tonner grew interested, and asked why he was so confident of suc-
cess where all before had failed.

"370ch Torrens," was the reply; "or, as you says in Eengleesh, 'wc
shall see.' "0L1) AXI) NEW METHODS COMPARED. 101

Then the conversation changed to other topics, and was interrupted by
the announcement that dinner \'as ready. In a few minutes entertainers
and guests were in their places, and the party did ample justice to the
products of the skill of the cook. The guests were loud in their praises of
the number and quality of the dishes, and paid a high compliment to the
skill of the Americans in preserving fresh meat and vegetables.

"You have ea ied the science of 'canning' to a higher degree than
any other country," said Captain Girard, "and have made long voyages
comparativelg' easy, so far as the health of the men is com-erned."

   

 

LOCKED IN THE 1C);

" But we have taken Ie$ons from your nation in the science of cook-
ery," was the polite response of the American connnander; "and without
good cooking our efforts in the preserving line would be of comparatively
little use. The fist must be perfect, or the second will fail."

" For a comparison between the new way and the old," replied Captain
Gi and, "let us take the voyage of the Jeannette and place it by the side
of almost any long voyage of half a century ago. In old times nearly
every crew imprisoned for a single winter in the ice was disabled by
scurvy; the . <<(lunatic passed two winters among the bet-gs and fines, and
after the sinking of the ship her row was three months on the ice before
reaching Siberia, but they were in good condition when the vessel sank,
and even when they landed at the mouth of the Lena. They were weak-
ened by hardship and exposure, it is true, but they sullen-ed almost nothing
from the diseases formerly inseparable from an arctic voyage."

Commander Bronson then told about the arrangements for the distri-
bution of lime-juice to his men when unable to procure fresh 1'm)\'isions,ll'L' 'l'lll-Z \'UYAUI'; ()F 'l'lll-J "\'l\'l.\.\'."

and gave. other details of their preparation {or the voyage. llis guest re-
plied by detailing whatever was new in the mode of outfitting the Gm>>-
(ml/u, and by the end of dinner a good deal of information had been
exchanged.

The party sat for some time after the dinner had been completed, and
finally the hour came for the guests to return to their ship. The crew of
Captain Girard's boat had been entertained by the sailors of the Vivian.
and a spectator of the atl'air would have had an amusing story to tell.
One man of the Vivian's crew could speak a little French, but only a
little, while not a man from the Gmnbaltrie boat knew a Word of English.
(.'onvcrsation was carried on in pantomime for a while, but this could not
last long; then the boatswain of the Vivian suggested a song and dance,
and the idea was immediately carried out.

Among the Vivian's men there were three musicians: one played the
violin, the second the flute, and the third had a high rank on the accor-
dion. A quartette had been formed by adding a drummer, and on the
voyage up from San Francisco a drum was mannfactnrml by the carpenter
which served its purpose very fairly. The violinist, known as "Fiddler
Jack," had been chosen leader of the band, and a good deal of his watch
below was devoted to the trainingr of the musicians under his control.
Their knowledge of what the professors call tec/mz'yuc was very limited,
but they made up for it in the rigor of their execution. Nearly all the
crew could sing after the nautical fashion, and altogether the Vivian was
well equipped for a season of arctic opera.

Jack mustered his band, and several American airs were played, ac-
companied with variations which are not found in the scores of fashionable
performers. Then the crew sang " Ilail Columbia" and " The Star-span-
gled Banner," followed by " The Old Folks at Home" and " Nancy Lee."
All these songs were assisted by the band, the drmn included. Fiddler
Jack suggested in a mild way that the drmn had no business in "The Old
Folks at Home," though it might be all right for the rest.

()ne of the French sailors then lnunnied "The Marseillaise," in the
hope that Fiddler Jack could play it, but the latter shook his head and
said he was not up to foreign music anyhow. The drunnner thought he
might be able to beat the time on his drum, but the lt'renclnncn concluded
that no instrumentation was needed, and sang "The Maiseillaise" without
assistance.

()ne of them gave the solo, and the rest. joined in the chorus with a zest
that showed they were no strangels to the song. The boatswain of the
Vivian said it was Incky there was no more of the frog-eaters, or theyAN lN'l'l-IRNA'I'IONAL FEST] \' HT. 103

would 'aise the ship's (leek and start all the timbers down to the water-
line. This Song was followed by a love ditty or two, and then by a nau-
tical air corresponding to "Tom llowliue" or "Nancy Dawson." Then
came a dance, in which the Yankees gave their French visitors a salnple
of the "double shullle" and other dances peculiar to America, to which
the latter responded by an "All [lauds louml" aml some lofty kicking
which threatened the safety of the deck more than did the singing.

When this was over Jack tuned his violin and sounded some of the
notes of " l'iuafore." This brought one of the Frenchmen to his feet and
led to a discovery!

Though the crews of the two ships had no lauguzge in common, and
their national airs were unlike, they had a mutual acquaintance through
the music of this operetta, which had gone out from England and invaded
both F'ance and America. Its nautical character had caused it to be
received with favor by the sailors of both nations, and a little investigation:
showed that the crews of the Vivian and Gumballa were equally " up" in
their knowledge of it.

Jack and his attendant performers (the drmn included) essaycd the
music of the sailors' chorus in "I'inafore,'y and when the air had been
played through to the satisfaction of all concerned he announced, " Now
we'll sing."

"(J/tantrum! Martians!" shouted the Frenchmen in unison, and the
sailors of two nationalities joined in the performance with such energy
of action and volume of sound that the boatswain declared you couldn't
tell which was which.

While the Americans roared out, in fair time with the instruments,

"For he's the captain of the l'huiax.
And a right. good captain too,"

the Frenchmen were equally earnest in proclaiming,

" Car ('1 wt mid/din: 4Iu (r'um-IuI-Iu,
,

1-,? (ms be" .-.,,..'zt.it..- luf,'

Just as they had finished the song. and were wiping the perspiration
from their forehet: there was a all from the deck for the (r'umllctm's
crew, and with hand-shakes and embraces between those who had had a
good time in spite of their lingual difficulties, the evening's entertailnnent
'atne to an end. In a few minutes the visitors had gone, and the ll'iviaia
resumed her wouted quiet.

The next day most of the ofiicers of both ships were on shore, and the
little village of Chuckchees had quite a foreign aspect. Reindeer meat
was purchased in considerable quantities, and the crews of the Vivian and
Gawdwtla were treated to Siberian venison with great liberality. The
Clmckchees almost uniformly refuse to sell live deer, on account. of
a belief that they will bring misfortune on themselves by so doing, but
they have no objection to slaughtering the animals and selling the meat.

 

A SUMMER VILLAGE IX TI": AllL'rlC REGIONS.

The purchases were paid for with beads, tobacco, liatcliets, knives, and
kindred things; rum was asked for, but refused in every instance, and the
orders of both the French and American commanders were strictly obeyed,
to give no opportunity for trouble. In bartering with the natives the cost
of a door was not more than fifty cents; and as the animals weighed from
eighty to a hundred pounds when dressed, the strangers had no occasion
to complain, while the natives seemed perfectly satisfied. George remarked
that deer at that price could not be considered dear; he was informed that
the joke had been made by every Euglish-swaking visitor to that region
for the last hundred years.

Commander Bronson's first inquiry was for a village where he could
purchase dogs for sledgiug purposes; both he and Captain Girard had in-cnt'cxcnm: axn KORAK VILLAGES. 105

tended to buy (logs in Petropavlovsk, but had been advised not. to take
them from that place, as they could be procured in the vicinity of East
Cape or Cape Szerdze Kamen. The Clmekehees formerly had no dogs,
but a. few yeals previous to the date of which we are speaking they made
a friendly arrangement with the Koraks by which the latter had a settle-
ment in the Chuckchee country on payment of a tribute to the owners of
the land. The Koraks had an abundance of dogs, while the Chuckchees
possessed thousands of reindeer: there was a Korak village close to a Chuck-
chee one, and at-these villages it was possible to purchase dogs for arctic
travel, and plenty of meat on which to feed them.

The villages were about ten miles from where the ships were anchored.
and a guide was easily procured to lead the way to them. Major Clapp
and one of the French officers set. out at once, accompanied by Fred and
a youth of about his age from the Grunbdtw. They were mounted on rein-
(leer from the herd our friends had visited the day before, and Fred esti-
mated that they made not less than half a dozen tumbles to the mile for
the first half of the journey. ()n arriving at the villages they began nego-
tiations for dogs, assisted by their guide, who could speak enough English
to make himself understood in conducting a bargain.

It is easier to begin to talk business with these people than to finish
it. There was a vexatious delay in bringing them to terms, and the
major found that his hope of return-
ing to the ships the same day was not
to be realized. They were invited to
partake of the native hospitality, but
the interior of the Korak tents was so
uninvitiug that they ritreated outside
in a very short time, aml concluded
to sleep in the open air. Through the
exertions of the guide a temporary
tent was erected, and beds of deer and
bear skins were provided. The stran-
gers shunned the stewpots of the na-
tives, and supped on steaks of deer- A "mum
meat cooked over the tire by themselves.

Fortunately they had a good supply of biscuits and tea from the ships.

But if the Korak tent in snunner was nnendurahle by the strangers,
what would they have thought of the yam-t, or winter residence of these
people? While Fred was relating,r his experience on his return to the ship,
Dr. Tonner proceeded to enlighten him further on the subject.
"I spent a winter in Siberia, as you know," said the Doctor, "and a

part of my experience was to travel among the Koraks. It used to give me
a shudder to think of entering a yum-t, but there was often no help for it,
and I had to go in and do my best. These buildings are of logs or poles,
banked around with earth. and made flat or tunnel-shaped on top. They
are half sunk in the ground, so that it is no great effort to reach the roof
from the outside. A hole in the
centre of the roof serves as a chim-
ney and door, and a pole, notched
like a fence-post, forms a ladder.

" You descend directly over the
fire, shutting your eyes and trusting
to luck. The heat and smoke are
blinding and stifling, so that you are
very apt to lose your way. When
you think you are near the floor
you jump from the ladder; you
should try to jump away from the
tire, but sometimes you go straight

which the dinner is stewing. The
smoke has no exit except through the hole mentioned, and the interior of
the your! is dimly lighted by some oil burning in a basin. The dogs hang
about the hole above you, attracted by the heat and the smell of food;
they are constantly quart-elling, and every little while one of them drops
through and tumbles into the fire or the dinner-kettle. In either event
he is flung outside, but the dinner is not spoiled by his intrusion. As the
Koraks cook the whole of a reindeer except the hide and horns, they am
not at all troubled by the presence of a few handfuls of dog's hair in
their soup."

Bargaining went on very well on the second day, and forty dogs were
procured for each ship, together with sledges and harness. Four driveis
were also engaged, two for each ship, and the party returned in high
spirits. It was not considered safe to come back without the dogs, for
fear the natives might interpose, therefore the animals and their driv-
ers headed the procession on its return to the landing-place. The whole
party was immediately taken on board, and the major and Fred wem con-
gratulated on the success of their enterprise.

The rest of the officers had not been idle; they had purchased all the
fur clothing the Chuckchees would sell, and all dressed deer-skins thePURCHASING FURS AND rut GAtutEx'rs. 107

market afforded. These would be made up by the sailors on board the
ships after leaving the coast, and with the native garments as models they
would have no difficulty in performing the work. At I'etropavlovsk they
bought a supply of lw/rlanlwrs, together with fur boots and trouscts, but
as the French officers and sailms had been there ahead of them, they did
not get all they wanted. The Incision/m- is a sort of frock with a hood,
and has to be put on over the head, like the ordinary shirt of civilized life.
In warm weather the hood hangs over the shoulders, btlt in the intense
cold of an arctic winter it is drawn over the head, and forms an admi-
rable protection). The best quality of this garment is made of deer-skin,
with the hair outside, and has a lining of the skins of very young deer
or some cheap fur. Trouscts of the same material, with deer-skin boots,
complete the costume for the far North.

They were also fortunate in finding a supply of dried fish for dog's-
food on sledge journeys; it was carefully stowed away where the animals
could not reach it, and for the present they were fed on deer-meat. As
soon as the dogs were quartered on board, it was evident that the ship
would be far less peaceful than before their arrival. The brntw had the
run of the (leek, and were constantly fighting; George said they were
never at peace unless they were hav-
ing a quarrel, and the only way to
keep them quiet was to let them fight
whenever they wished. In the night
they howled almost constantly, and it
was not easy to sleep, on account of
their noise. Luckily, they did not hurt
each other much in their fights, and
their drivets had plenty of occupation
in beating them whenever they de-
served pnnislnnent.

Two sludges wcie bought from the
natives, and also a complete ontlit of
harness for the (logs. Then there were A Kmuut um};
three sledges which had been made in
San Francisco from the arctic models; but, with all the skill of the
American carpenter who constructed them, they were nearly twice as

I heavy as the sledges of the Koraks. The drivers, Alcxy and I'etrofi, were
not favorably inclined to the American slcdges, and before the ship sailed
they obtained the necessary materials from their people on shore, and of-
fered to construct sledges on their own models.
In a couple of days after the return from the purchase of the (logs
the ships were ready to sail in search of the pole. As before arranged, it

convenient, but each was at liberty to seek its own course, and say "good-
bye" whenever it chose to do so. The evening before their departure was
marked by an event of considerable interest to our young heroes.
Captain Girard returned the compliment of Commander Bronson by
inviting him to dine on board the Gambotta, accompanied by Major Clapp

and Dr. 'l'ouuer, and also by Fred and
George. The crew of the Gav/"08!!!! had
obtained permission to get up an interna-
tional ball. to which the crew of the Vivian
was invited, and also some of the Chuck-
chees from the village on shore. The
French snilors decked their ship with all
the flags they poseesmd, and so many of
them (ll-med in fancy costume that the

affair took the form of a masked hall instead of a plain one. As there
were no ladies on board either ship, and the native belles were not accus-tomed to European dances, several of the French
sailors got themselves up in feminine dress, and
played their parts admirably.

A spectator at the dance would have been easi-
ly deceived by several of the eouples and quar-
tettes as they balanced to each other, keeping time
to the music of the violins in the hands of the per-
formers, who were on a platform of boards placed

dressed as a flower-girl, and went around pre-
tending to sell bouquets made from moss and
shrubs among which artificial flowers were deft-
ly woven. Closely following the flower-girl was
a cook with a basket on her arm, and her head
neatly covered with the cap which is the badge
of her occupation at home. Then came a stout
old sailor disguised as a fish--woman, and another
who pretended to be a peddler of cakes and
sweetmeats. Occasionally these perambulating
cha 'acters laid aside their baskets and other im-
pedimenta to join in the dance, which was as
lively as the music would permit. Some of the

dances were arranged for the accommodation of
the visitors, and at such times the Americans (lid
their best to make-a name for their country.

Fiddler Jack was there with his hand, and sup-
plied the musie for the performance whenever it
was desired to relieve the French violinists. Con-
sequently there was no lack of entertainment for
the Americans, and though they did not become as
excited as their hosts in the execution of the fig-
ures, they managed to work themselves into a con-
dition of great warmth.

The dinner in the cabin was over while the ball
was under way, and the gentlemen went on deck
to enjoy it. Jack's hand happened to be playing

when they appeared, and at once the music was shifted to the strains of
" Pinafore:" the sailors of both ships took the hint, and at once the song
was picked up, and echoed far over the waters of the Arctic Ocean, and
along the desolate shore of Northeastern Siberia:

At ten o'clock the ball came to an end, and the officers, and crew of the
Vivian returned to their ship. The sun was still above the horizon, and
consequently many of the attendants at the ball were unwillingr to close
the performance. George sugwested that it was not a good place for sing-
ing the popular air" We won't go Home till Morning," since the move-
ments of the sun would compel them to keep up a month or twu, to com-
ply with the suggestion of the chorus. Candles were of little use in such
a latitude, and nobody was inclined to look forward to the arctic winter,
when darkness would be as continuous as was then the daylight.

CHAPTER VIII.

FROM SlBERIA T0 WRANGELL ISLA.\'D.--lCEBERGS AND A BEAR-HUNT.

AT the appointed time the two exploring ships sailed from the coast

and headed to the north. A few hours before their departure a
whaler came to anchor near their moorings; Commander Bronson sent
Captain Jones, accompanied by Fred and George, to ascertain if there
was any news of importance.

The whaler reported ice in small patches to the north and east, and
said another whaler had told him there was an extensive barrier of ice
between the coast of Siberia and Wrangell Island. There were several
whalers at work there, and they had met with very good luck. Two of
them were nearly full, and would complete their cargoes before the end
of smnmer, when they Would sail
directly for the Sandwich Islands
or San Francisco. One whaler had
lost a boat in a battle with a whale,
but the crew was sa\'e(l,so that the
accident was of little consequence.
Another whaler had been nipped in
the ice, and got off without much
damage; on the whole the season's
work was satisfactory, and the whal~
ers were happy.

"I hope they'll get out of the
Arctic Ocean before the ice comes
down," said Captain Jones, as the
boat was returning to the Vivian.
" Every few years some of them get caught by the ice hefom they pass
the capes, and when it comes down with full force it crushes them like.
egg-shells. In [871 thirty-three whaling ships, almost in sight of each
other, were caught, and crushed between the ice and the shore; the wind
was against them, and the ice drifted faster than they could work ahead."
One of the youths asked how it happened that so many of them were
enclosed at once.

"They were chasing a large school of whales," was the reply, "and
went farther than it was safe to go. Finding the ice was closing on them,
and that a part of the fleet would certainly be lost, the captains decided to
abandon the ships that were in the most dangerous positions, and go on
board those which had the best chance of escaping. A few had already
been crushed between the ice and the shore before this decision was made.
but happily no lives were lost. Some of the ships were nearly full of oil,
and the loss of property was estimated at a million and a half of dollais."

" The wlialers have had a hard time in this part of the world," said
one of the youths. "I was reading yesterday how the rebel steamer
Shenandoah came here during the civil war and burned all the whale
ships she could find."

"You are not. exactly right on that point," replied the captain. "The
Shenandoah came to the Arctic Ocean in 1865, at the close of the rebel-
lion, and destroyed all the whaling ships she could find ; I was here at the
time, and my ship barely escaped destruction. I left Plover Day one
night, and sailed out into Behring Sea, and the next day the Shenandoah
came in and burned ten wlialers. All the captains knew that the war
was over, and showed newspapers and letters to confirm their assertion
to the captain of the Shenandoah, but he refused to believe them. Al-
together hc destroyed thirty whale-ships. The captain of an English
whaler, the Robert wans, warned seine of the Americans of their dan-
ger, and enabled them to escape. and was consequently threatened by the
Shenandoah.

"It's an old story now," he continued, "but every whaleman feels a
grudge against Waddell,the captain of the Shenandoah, and will hold it
as long as he lives. As the Shenandoah was an English ship. fitted out in
Liverpool,aiid well known to be bound on a. piratieal enterprise, we don't
feel very kindly towards England in consequence; especially so when she
was allowed to recruit. a crew openly in Melbourne, and received facil--
ities in that and other ports which were denied to l'nited States ships.
But here we are at: the Vivian's side, and in half an lionr we'll be on our
way to sea."

The ships went under sail, and did not even light their fires to get
away from land. The wind was blowing oil' the shore, and the breeze was
fair towards the north.

The eonise was laid for Herald Islam], in latitude 72deg north. longitude

[fem/t], but. learned, on reference to the books, that it was discovered and
named b_v Captain Kellett, of the British ship "cm/(I, in 1349. Other
navigators claimed to have seen it before Captain liellett, but the latter
was the filst to land on its shores.

The day after leaving the coast Captain Jones ordered the crew's-nest
to be rigged on the foremast. Fred and George watched the operation
with a good deal of interest, as they had already seen the crew's-nest
on some of the whalels, but had been too busy to investigate its con-
struction.

Captain Jones told them that the crew's-nest was an invention of Cap-
tain Senresby, or at all events he had the credit of it. Ordinarily a man
is stationed aloft to \\'PSll('ll for whales, and as the air is very cold he is apt
to become benmnbed, and runs the risk of falling elf. To protect him from
danger and from the cold a cask is rigged aloft, and in this cask he stands-
when on duty. Its sides shelter him from the wind, and in case he is be-
:mmbcd he cannot fall to the deck; there is a trapdoor in the bottom for
entering it, but no sailor who respects himself would think of getting in
that way. lle invariably clambers over the side, unless he has been so
chilled as to partially lose the use of his limbs.

"The crew's-nest is a point of observation when we are looking for
whales," said the captain, " and also when we are in the ice. We are not
goingr to chase whales now," he continued," but we must keep a sharp eye
on the ice to preserve the ship from injury.

"And new that we are in the region of ice,I may as well tell you
some of its peculiarities.

"There are two kinds of ice in the Arctic Ocean--that: which comes-
from the rivets, and is made from fresh-water, while the other is formed.
from the salt-water of the sea.

" All the rivets that flow into the Arctic Ocean bring down large quan-
tities of ice at their annual floods. This amount of ice would alone be
enough to till up the entire regions within thirty degrees of the pole, in
the course of a few centuries, it it were not melted by the heat of summer
or drifted away by the currents.

" The ice brought down by the flowing rivers, such as the Lena. Koly-
ma. chisei, Mackenzie. and others, is in great tloes, such as you may see-
in the rivers of the Northern States of America in the spring of the year.
lint there are other rivetscxactly similar to the glaciers of Switzerland,
that bring down masses of ice in the form of bergs. Greenland has great
numbers of glaciers. and they are the sources of the bergs which iloat

"Well," continued the captain, " the whalcmeu have distinct names
for all the varieties of polar ice. 0f comse all the salt-water ice is flat,

ficiently separated to allov a ship to sail through, it is drift-ice, and is said
to be loose or open ; when it is greatly broken up, it is brush-ice; and
when the pieces crowd each other, so as to force some of them to riseTHE ICE-BLINK. 115

higher than the rest, the elevated portions are called lmmnwcll's. In heavy
packs there are often a great many hammocks, and I have seen them not
less than thirty feet high. They are very pretty to look at, but are the
dread of all who are obliged to travel among them, as they greatly hinder
progress, whether on sledges or on foot."

Fred asked what the kaolin/l; was, as the captain paused after his de-
scription of the different kinds of ice.

"That," replied the captain, "is the name given by the Dutch sailors
to the singular appearance of the horizon where it is bounded by the ice.
It is a stratum of lucid whiteness, occasioned by the glare of light reflected
against the atmosphere from the surface of the ice; it is generally in the
form of a shining streak, and always leoks brightest in clear weather. An
experienced navigator knows by the ice-blink when he is approaching ice,
even when it is twenty or thirty miles beyond the line of direct vision.
He can even make out the quality of the ice: the blink from the packs
appeals of a pure white, while that from snow-fields has a tinge of yellow.
Many a ship has been saved from danger by the ice-blink, which warned
her commander what to do while he had plenty of sea-room before him."

Just then the captain's attention was required in another part of the
ship. and the interview was abruptly terminated. The youths \veut below
to look up the book which Captain Jones had recommended for their
perusal.

They learned from it that the glaciers from which the icebergs are
formed are sometimes several miles in width and hundreds of feet high;llt'i 'rut-z vomot-z or 'rtu: "VIVIAN."

according to the season of the year and the temperature of the at.Ino.-
phet'e. Sometimes it. may be only an inch or two daily, and at others it
may advance ten or twelve inches in the same time. As it reaches the
sea the end is pushed out into the water, and gradually sinks beneath it;
after a time the buoyancy of the water, lifting on the immense mass of
ice, causes it to break off and float away. Titus the iceberg is formed.

Fresh ice floating in sea-water has seven-eighths of its body below the
surface and one-eighth above; consequently, before the lifting force of
the water can be exerted on the end of the glacier, more than seven-
eighths of it. must be forced out beneath the surface of the sea, or of the
narrow bay where the glacier frequently has its termination. When the
break occurs the commotion is like that of an earthquake, and the position
of a ship or boat in front of the glacier is full of danger. Dr. Hayes
describes an incident of this sort; where a party from his ship had gone
on shore to take photographic views of the glacier and the mountains
around it. The ship was anchored in the bay, some distance below the
glacier, and her captain thought she was in no danger.

The boat reached the shore without difficulty, and the party proceeded
to set up their instruments on the reeks, some distance above the landing-
place. These on the ship were busy with their ordinary work, or loitering
around, when they heard some loud reports which indicated the breaking
off of pieces of the glacier. The fragments fell into the sea; the commo-
tiou they created caused the ship to roll at her anchor, and waves of con-
siderable extent broke on the rocks.

\Vhile they were regarding the strange occurrence, and thinking it
was all over, there was a report louder than all the others, followed by
the fall of a great: mass of ice, at least half a mile long and a quarter of
a. mile in width; simultaneously another mass, equally large, rose from
beneath the bay, and then the whole front of the glacier seemed to
crumble and fall.

"'oudc' at the magnificent: spectacle was changed to tlumghts of the
peril of the ship; the wares rolled up with tremendous force, one greater
than all the rest sweeping from the front of the glacier down the hay in
the direction of the ship.

As it pzmed beneath her she was lifted on its surface and borne to-

wards the rocks; but fortunately her anchor held. and she swung back to
her place uninjured. The wave broke on the cliffs above the ship, its
force being so great that the spectators estimated its height at. a lmudred
feet; the top of the wave, as it. struck the rocks, curled backward and fell
on the deck of the ship, which it deluged with water, but not enough to
sink her. Another wave followed, and then another and another, but each
was less violent than its predeceSsor, and after a while the hay resluned
its wonted quiet.

The party on shore had quite as narrow an escape as those on the ship.
They were a short distance from the beach when the wave reached them,
but by throwing themselves flat on the rocks, and clinging with all their
might, they managed to hold on. One of them lost his grasp and was
thrown several yards by the wave, but though considerably bruised, be
seized another rock and was saved. They lost all their implements, and
if they had been on the beach when the wave swept down the bay, it is
probable that not one would have escaped.

 

VERTICAL SECTION OF A GLACIKII.

Bergs are sometimes seen two or three miles long and several hundred
feet high floating in the Atlantic; remember that only one-eighth of their
mass is visible, and then think how enormous must be the quantity eon-
cealed below. Frequently several large bet-gs will be found close together,
which were evidently from the same glacier and broken off at the same
time. \Vheu the convulsion took place. by which they were thrown from
the front of the glacier it was split asunder, and thus their escape was
facilitated. In some places where the glaciers come down to the sea, the
water is too shallow to allow the bet-gs to float ofi; they become crowded
together, and as the heat of the sun is not suflieient to melt them they
lie for years close to the place of their formation.

For the present we will drop the consideration of the iceberg, and its
parent the glacier, and return to our friends on the Vivian.

Captain Jones did not put his crew's-nest in order any too soon, for not
more than an hour after it had been completed, the lookout forward re-
ported fragments of ice dead ahead. In a little while the ship was amongr

them, but. they were neither numerous nor large; beyond indicating what
might be expected before long, they were of no particular consequence.
Captain Jones caused a piece to be fished up as they sailed slowly along,
and on examination he pronounced it pack-ice that had probably drifted
from the eastward. Ordets were given to shorten sail during tlte night,
and to keep a sharp lookout lest they might. suddenly he brought against
something more serious than the fragments the" had thus far encountered.

The air was perceptibly colder than the day before, although the wind
blew from the south, and had not changed its direction a single point since
their departure from land. The next day the scene was unchangednvith
the exception that the drift-ice was somewhat more abundant, and the
lookout thought there was an indication of an ice-blink on the horizon,
betokening serious work before them.

Both vessels held their comse for Herald Island, and it. was agreed
that if they were separated during the night from any cause, they would
endeavor to meet at its eastern extremity. There was no special glory in
landing there, as the island had been several times visited since ('aptaiu
Kellett's exploration, but it contained an arctic post-oflice, where Com-
mander Bronson desired to leave letteis for future ships.

The ice increased as the ships advanced, and by the next morning.' there
was " more ice than ocean," as Captain Jones expressed it. ()u the eastern
horizon there was an appearance of a Solid pack, while to the west only
loose ice was vi ible. The signal-flags were set. at work between the Gam-
betla and "it-fan, and it was agreed that they would steer to the north-
west, aud probably sight. Wrangell Island if the condition of the ice re-
mained unchanged. At the time this agreement was made they were
exactly on the 70th parallel of latitude, and W 'angell Island was thought
to be about one hundred miles away, in a northwesterly direction. As
they changed their comse the wind died out, and there was not enough
breeze to fill the sails.

An hour or so after the signalling was over the man aloft called out,

" llear on the ice on the port bow !"

Of course there was a rush to that side of the ship. Fred ran below
for his glass, and speedily returned. It did not take long to discover the
bear, who was sitting on the ice as though wondering how he got there.
George remarked that the brute was evidently monarch of all he surveyed,
to which Fred retorted that he couldn't be much of a surveyor, as his (lo-
main was not more than a hundred feet from side to side.

A boat was lowered to go in pmsuit of the game; Major Clapp and
Dr. Tonner formed the hunting party, each armed with a heavy rifle withA\\'.\ l'l'lNG HIS PURSCERS. 1'21

which to do effective work on the occupant. of the iloe. The boat. had no
easy task befm'e it. as the sea was pretty well iilicd with loose ice, and it
was highly desirable to avoid coming in violent contact with any of the
floating: cakes. The Doctor acted as ice-pilot, and performed his work
very \vell: standing in the how he directed the course of the boat, keep-
ing the bear steadily in view, except when he was hidden by hammocks of
ice. They had about a mile to go in a direct line. but so tortuous was the
course that it took them a full hour to reach the flue where the bear had
his summer residence.

As they drew near, Bruin came close to the edge of his domain, as
though intending to dispute its possession. The major raised his rifle to
tire when within a hundred yards, but with a wave of his hand the Doctor
restrained him.

" Don't fire as long as he stands there," whispered the Doctor. "The
closer we can get, the better will be our chance of dropping him."

The major saw the force of Dr. Tanner's suggestion. and allowed the
boat to proceed, but he held his rifle ready for action at the first movement
of the beast. Evidently the hear was not accustomed to the sight. of boats.
and looked upon the new-comer as an inhabitant of the waters whose
acquaintance he had not yet made.

No allowed the boat to approach within twenty yards. and then the
major told the men to stop rowing. As the boat reduced its speed the.
rifle sent a bullet directly into the breast of the hear: he gave a leap back-
ward and fell heavily on his side,but was up in a few seconds.

It was now the Doctor's turu.aud he was quick to embrace it. The
major had a front view of the hear when he fired; as the animal rose, it
looked as though he intended to seek safety in flight. :md present only a
rear view to the Doctor. But the best. was not devoid of curiosity, and
this was fatal to him.

He turned to look at his assailants. and as he did so the Dot-tor fired as
closely to the heart as he was able to aim. Instead of the ordinary bullet
he used an explosive one; as it struck the bear's side. and was. fairly em-
bedded in the flesh, it exploded, tearing a hole large enough for the inser-
tion of one's baud. 3y this time the major had a fresh cartridge in his
Remington rifle. and sent another bullet not more than two or three sec-
onds behind the Doctor's. Down went. the hear. The boat. was now at the
edge of the ice; one of the men held it. with an ice-hook, and the Doctor
sprang on the flee, closely followed by the major.

Both thought the hear was dead. but they had learned prudence from
experience. " Always approach a dead mule by the head," said the Doc-mist'm' or A BE.\R-Ill'.\'T. 123

tor. " and a dead bear by the side. A dead mule has been known to kick,
and a dead hour will rise and bite." As they put fresh cartridges in their
ritles the bear suddenly rose again; he was not more than a dozen feet
from his assailants, and as they were standing opposite his side they had
an excellent mark.

The two bullets brought. him to the ground again, or rather to the ice.
and the major 'aid he ought to be killed by this time. An oar was brought
from the boat,and one of the sailors prodded the recumbent beast with it,
while the hunteis stood ready to shoot: in case be stirred. There was no
movement. and the game was evidently theils; but. to make assurance
doubly sure. the Doctor sent a solid bullet. through the animal's skull, re-
nutrient;r as he did so, that probably such a thing never entered the bears
h ~ad before.

It was a full-grown arctic bear, in excellent condition. and estimated to
weigh not far from twelve hundred pounds. The next thing to consider
was the question of removal: it was not easy to handle such a burden and
place it in the boat, and it would be a dillicult matter to tow it back to
the ship. The major decided to skin and divide the animal where he lay,
and as each sailor was provided with a knife, and the Doctor had brought
along a pair of sharp blades for use in case of need, the operation was
quickly accomplished.

Of course the party had been carefully watched from the ship. and the.
death of the bear \'as known there as soon as it occurred. Meantime the
course of the ship had been changed, so as to bring it within less than half
a mile of the floe where the prize was taken: another boat was sent to
assist in bringing home the provisions. and in little more than an hour
from the time the first shot was tired. the entire party was back again.
The major and the Doctor received the congratulations of their friends at
the success of the hunt. which had been a pleasant episode, and supplied
fresh meat for the table. The signal " we wish to communicate " was
hoisted: the Ham/wild. was a couple of miles to windward. and on seeing;
the signal she bore down to 1,-ome nearer her consort. The breeze con-
tinued light. and it was some time. before she was near enough for the
Writ/nix- purpose. "'hen the ships were about half a mile apart a boat
was sent to Captain Girard with one of the quarters of the bear, accompa-
nied by the compliments of Commander Bronson. and those of the two
heroes of the fray.

in the cabin of the ICU-fun they had steaks of polar bear for dinner.
and the partv was unanimous in declaring it equal to the best beefsteak
they had ever tasted. The Doctor intimated that the fatness of the bear,124 'l'tll-Z \'u\'.\t:t~: or 'rm-z '-\'l\'l.\.\'."

and probably his youth. had a good deal to do with the favorable opinion
passed upon him. "If he had happened to he old and lean," said the
man of medicine, "' we should have heard a (lifterent story. I have tried
to eat. the flesh of the polar hear when it was like devouring a section of a
boot--sole."

Fred asked what was the proper name of the animal: should he he
~alled white, polar, or arctic bear!

"As to that," replied the Doctor, "there is a difference of opinion..
Scientifically he is (flaws merit/mus, or ' hear of the sea ;' his home is on
the ice of the northern seas, and the name tits him perfealy. He is a
good swimmer, and takes readily to the water when occasion requires:
when he lives on land it is author from necessity than choice, as his food
comes mostly from the sea, or the bays that empty into it. His chief prey
is the seal, and one of these days we may see the ingenuity of the bear in
securing his dinner.

" He is a dingy yellow, rather than white, and therefore ' white bear'
does not properly describe him; we don't. know whether he is found at. the
North-pole or not, and consequently 'polar hear' may be a misnomer; his
home is in the arctic regions, and you may call him ' arctic bear' without
fear of contradiction. But if you employ any other of the names already
mentioned, none of us will dispute you; language was made for the use of
man, and not man for languwc, and nobody should lose his digestion if
our prize of today is set down as a white or a polar bear. Ursa-x mm'iliw
mus is too long for practical service."

The crew was regaled on bear-meat, and so were the dogs: the former
took their allowance in peace, but not so the four-footed members of the
ship's company. The scent of the meat excited them, and they came near
eating up their drivers in their eagerness to get at their allo\'ance of the
new food. In spite of all efforts to restrain them, they had as many tights
as there were dogs in the party, with several extra quarrels thrown in to
keep things lively.

The morning after the incident. of the hear-hunt the lookout reported
land in sight, and the connnamler mounted to the cross-trees to inspect it.
There were mountains in the background, and the coast was fringed with
ice, which threatened to be an effectual barrier to a near approach. The
position on the chart indicated that they were in sight of Wrangell Island,
and the ships were headed for it. as directly as possible. As the "Viz-fun
approached the land a strip of gravelly beach was made out, but there
were no signs of vegetation or animal life, greatly to the disappointtncut
of our young friends.wmerLI. ISLAND. 125

The ice was not so abundant as on the previous day, but the flees were

_ larger, and Captain Jones proceeded with caution, through fear of spring-

ing a leak in the sides of his craft. Frequently it was necessary to shorten

sail, and so much time was lost in this way that the long arctic day was
drawing to a close when they were yet a dozen miles from shore.

 

SCHSK IN "(ONT 1)? TI": ISLAND.

Following the charts. and the directions laid down in Mr. Gilder's " Ice-
paek and Tundra," the two ships, early the next nu'urning, headed for the
southern end of the island. and entered the harbor where the [lodgers
anchored on her cruise in search of the Jeannette. They found plenty of
\'ater and good anchorage, just as Mr. Gilder described, though the bay
was encumbered with ice that had evidently been blown there by the wind.
As there were two ships, it required considerable mantenvring to get them
properly anchored where there was no danger of their interfering with
each other; the best part of the foreuoon was gone before this work was
over, and Captain Jones decided not to send a boat. on shore until the men
had eaten their dinners.

The captain of the 0/"an was less eonsiderate. as his ship had not
settled to rest after dropping her anchor before a boat was seen stealing
away from her side and heading for the land. The French flag waved over
her stern, and it was evident that the explorers intended to hoist. the tri-
color in advance of the stars and stripes.
Fred and George wanted to start at once and get ahead of their rival.
but their proposal .\\':ls promptly checked by the comnntnder.

" Never mind \leth they do now," said he; " the island has been visited
before, and so nobody can discover it. American Whalers have been here,
and so have American exploring ships. The revenue cutter Col-min was
here in 1881, a. month or more in advance of the [Budge/av, and they both
hoisted the American flag over Wrangell Island and left records of their
visit. Let the Frenchmen enjoy themselves. Think of what the people

CHAPTER IX

A VISIT 'I'O WRAXGELL ISLAND--HUNTING SEALS, WALRUSES, AND POLAR
BEARS.

T was no easy matter for the French boat to push through the cakes of
ice, but the effort was successful; and just as the men of the Vivian
were called to dinner the French flag was seen waving on a rock just above
the shore. As soon as dinner was over a boat was sent elf from the Vivian,
carrying the two youths, with the major and Doctor. A lane through the
ice at one side of the bay had slowly opened since the Gambetta's boat
made its journey, and enabled the Americans to reach the land much more
rapidly than their rivals.

Meantime the French party had wandered off to the northward, leav-
ing two men in charge of their boat; most. of them were out of sight
beyond the rocks, and just as the Americans reached the shore the report
of a rifle was heard, followed quickly by another and another. Fred and
George started in the direction of the sounds, but before they had gone a
dozen yards one of the French officers appeared from behind a large rock
and waved his handkerchief, so that it could be seen from the ships.

' " They're probably killed a bear," said George, "and he wants a boat
to carry the prize on board."

The signal was answered from the Gambetta, and in a few minutes a
boat was on its way from that ship to the land. The oflicer then disap.
peared the way he had come, and the youths concluded not to follow him.
"Let them have their bear all to themselves," said Fred; " and if we get
one they won't have any excuse for interfering with us."

They rejoined the major and the Doctor, and accompanied by two sailors
from the boat, the four explorers started in a direction different from that
taken by the Frenchmen. It led them along the beach for half a mile or
more, where the ice lay piled up in great winrows, with here and there a
few open lanes. At the highest point where the tide rose there were many
pieces of driftwood, and our friends were able to corroborate the testimony
of Mr. Gilder, that the coast of Wrangell Island is strewn with fragments
of logs which have been borne thither by the currents. Mr. Gilder saysIZS 'rnt-z \'ovma; or 'I'lll') "VIVIAN."

that the Rodgers party found many utensils of wood here that. were made
by the natives of the Siberian and American coasts, some of them present--
ing a very ancient appearance. Occasionally there are articles of civilized
manufacture, but no one can tell whether they came from wrecks of ships
or were dropped overboard from \vhalers. Fred looked for a portion of a
spar mentioned by that gentleman, and found it lying apparently undis-
turbed since the visit of the [bulge/1v. " There could be very little reason
for its absence." said Fred, as he touched the spar with his foot. " as there
is no record that any ship has been here since the Rodgers, and the na-
tives are not in the habit of venturing as far as this from the coast."

Moralizing on the origin of the driftwood on Wrangell Island resulted
in the conclusion) that it had been brought there from America and Siberia. I
principally the former. It is evident that the prevailng tendency of the
currents is towards the west, and this theory was confirmed by observation
of the masses of ice that ground against the headlands protecting the bar-
bor where the Vienna and Gumball" were lying. Even when the wind
blew from the cast the flow of the ice was westward. Mr. Gilder had pre-
viously recorded a similar circumstance, and said that sometimes when the
people of the Bally/ers- went to bed, while they lay at. Wrangell Island, they
would see pack-ice filling the sea as far as the eye could reach; and when
they went on (leek next morning there was a vast expanse of open water,
with only a cake of ice floating here and there on the surface. Quite as
often they found the solid puck in the morning where it was cl air water
the night before; these sudden changes had given rise to a theory which
prevails among the whalers, that the ice sinks and rises in obedience to
some unknown law of nature.

After a time our friends left the beach and asuended to the higher
ground. Major Clapp was a little in advance, when he suddenly waved
his hand and intimated that there was fun ahead. Guns were set at half-
coek, and the hunting blood was apparently high. As the rest of the party
reached the ntajor's side the reason for his action was apparent.

Two bears, one of goodly size and the other a part ly-grown cub, were
walking leisurely among the rocks on their way to the seashore, where
they cridently hoped to pick up a breakfast. They had not seen the in-
truders in their domain, or at all events did not indicate any alarm. It
was decided that the major and the Doctor would attend to the old bear.
while Fred and George looked after the cub. "And as the cub will stick
by his parent," said the major, "you had better let us do our part. of the
work first."

Keeping among the rocks as much as possible, the party edged in the
ARCTIC GAME.

direction of the bears. and soon had them at short. range. The Doctor
tired titst; the etl'o.(-.t of his shot was to bring the old bear on her haunches,
and cause her to look around to discover the source of the attack; then
the major put in a bullet, and as all occasion for further concealment was
over, the whole party rushed forward, the two hunters taking the lead.

Evidently the hear was severely wounded, but not: enough to prevent
her turning"r on her assailants with a savage roar. The major told the
youths to fire, and they did so without hesitation; the older hands added
their leaden contribution, and together their efforts brought the bear to
the ground.

" Now go forward and finish the work," said the major, as he handed
his rifle to Fred. "Step close up and put a bullet through the skull, but
be ready to spring out of her way in case she rises suddenly."

Fred obeyed the instructions, and the hear was a prize to the hunters
from the Vivian.

The club did not attempt to run away, but stood as though quite dazed
at. the whole business. It seemed a pity to shoot the innocent little fellow,
and George proposed that he should be captured, and carried on board
the ship. Fred seconded the suggestion, but the major and Doctor ex-
plained to the youths that it would not be feasible to do as they wished.
" We have no place for him," said the major; "and even if we had, his
presence would excite our dogs so that their fury could not be restrained.
They would be more (liflicult than ever to manage, and we could not ltave
even the semblance of peace until he was killed and devoured. The best
way out of the perplexity is to shoot him as mercifully as possible, and we
shall doubtless find his flesh an agreeable addition to our table supplies."

The cub was promptly despatchcd, skinned, dressed, quartered, and
carried to the boat, and the skin of the old one was also taken along as
a trophy. "'hile the work was going on, Dr. Toma-r told the youths of
an incident in the experience of the author of "Seasons with the Sea--
horses," when hunting bears in Spitzbergen.

This gentleman and his friend one day saw a bear and two cubs on
the shore, and started in pursuit of them. Ile says it was touching to see
the devotion of the old bear to her young; she could have escaped with
case had it not been for the cubs, who did not: seem to realize their danger,
and needed constant assistance to get over the rough places in their way.

The hunters could move faster than the cubs, and at length they over-
took the group and succeeded in killing the old bear. ""hen they came
up to where she lay. the cubs growled viciously, and would not allow them-
selves to be touched till the men brought limx from the boat and lassoedTIL-\(JES 0F I'ltI-ZVIUL'S VISITS. 131

the little fellows. They were tied together, like dogs in a leash; on tind-
iug themselves ast they began to tight viciously, and evidently each re-
garded the other as the :ause. of his misfortune. It. was no small task to
get. them to the boat. and then to the ship. as they resisted at every step
and used their teeth freely. A cage was made for them, and they fought
against entering it; they embraced every opportunity to escape, and one
day one of them got out. of his cage and jumped overlmard. A boat was
lowered for his recapture, and he wounded one of the sailors quite severe-
ly while being restored to his old quartets. \Vith a good deal of trouble
their owners brought them to civilization, and deposited them in a public
garden, where they received much admiration.

Birds were numerous, and easy of approach: evidently visitors were
'are in that locality, and the birds had not learned to beware of the white
man and his means of destruction. .-\'o more bears were in sight, and it
was decided to bag a few ducks and other game-birds for the table. For
this purpose the shot-guns of Fred and George were better adapted than
the rifles of the mzjul' and Doctor; the latter suggested that the youths
would have a good time for practice by providng the birds for the table,
and might take easy lessons where the prey was so tame.

Ducks and plover were the principal attractions, and our friends suc-
ceeded so well that in less than an hour they had all that. were needed
for the day. The two sailors acted as retrievers to bring in the game, and
when they started for the boat with the proceeds of the slumting they had
all they wanted to carry. The ducks proved to be tender, and of delicious
flavor, and evidently had not changed their character since the visit of the
[fudge/'3. The Doctor was excellent authority on birds, and after dinner
was over he declared that the plorer of Wrangell Island surpassed anything
of the kind he had ever seen. He Inurnntred something about 'I'aft's, at
Point Shirley, but the whole of his remark was inaudible to the rest of
the party.

While the youths were busy among the game-birds the elders of the
shore party occupied themselves with so: 'ehes for the trace of previous
visitors. .~\t the head of the little harbor was a cairn of stones, which
they reached a few minutes in advance of one of the French officers, who
was evidently chagrincd that the Americans were ahead of him. llciuov~
ing the stones of the cairn one by one. a wooden box was found, and in
the box was a bottle carefully corked and sealed. Inside the bottle was
a roll of paper which proved on examination to be the record of the visit
of the Cor-wilt in August, 1551, and of the Budge/w a month later. Bottle
and paper were taken on board the Vivian, and returned the next day132 'rut: VOYAGE or 'rtn-z VIVIAN."

to the cairn, with a record of the visit of that ship and the Gumbelm
attached to the original paper.

The rocks near the sea were covered with water-fowl, and each report
of the guns sent hundreds of them flying into the air. The youths
wanted to shoot some of them, but
were restrained by the Doctor, who
said they were of no use as food, and
it would be a waste of ammunition
to kill them. There were several
varieties of these birds; among
them were the mollemoke, and the
great and little auk, the latter a
comical looking fellow who sat: up-
right on the shore, and held his
wings as though they were intended
for hands. The ank is well known
to all arctic travellers in the regions
of Greenland and Spitsbergen; he
lives upon fish, and his diet gives
his flesh a flavor not at: all to the
taste of the European.

It was getting late in the after-
noon, and the major ordered a re-
turn to the ship. During their ab-
sence the ice had drifted out of the

1'": Mat .u- noun. hay, so that they had an easier jour-

ney than when coming ashore; the

French boat started back at the same time, and they had a friendly race
for a part of the distance, which was won by the latter.

During the afternoon the lookout espied several seals on the rocks a
little farther down the bay, and a boat was sent in pursuit of them.
The second mate of the Vivian had been in the Greenland seal-fishery.
and consequently the expedition was placed in his charge; he carried a
couple of rifles, but his chief reliance was on some clubs, which he pro-
nounced far more efiective. " You must kill them at short range," said
he, " and when you come to close quarters the clttb is a better weapon
than the rifle. You don't have to stop to put in fresh cartridges every
minttte, and besides, when you hit one there's no report to frighten the
rest."

The boat reached the shore in such a position as to cut off the retreatHUNTING THE SEAL. 133

of the seals to the water. The mate sprang on shore, followed by two
of the sailors, all armed with clubs; with no other weapons they rushed
among the seals, and in a short time a dozen or more had been killed. A
violent. blow on the nose is fatal to the seal, but it is not easy to hit him in
the right spot, as he does not stand still, and besides, he shows fight when
in close quarters. The male seal is particularly fierce, and will make a
stout defence; woe be to the assailant who slips on the rocks and gives
one of these fellows a chance for a bite on arm or leg. He can sever an
arm at a single movement of his jaws, and can break the bone of a man's
leg without much elioi't.

No accident happened to the sealers, and they returned with a full load
of meat as the reward of their exertions. Not. only was the boat laden as
low as was safe to till her, but several of the seals were towed aster-n, and
had to be hoisted in with a tackle at the end of one of the spars. The
flesh of the seal is excellent eating, and sailors generally prefer it: to beef.

The crew were liberally provided with it. and so were the dogs; what

the l'irz'mz. The (lam/wile had followed her eonsort's example and sent
a boat among the seals. but evidently her men were not skilful in the pun
suit of that amphibious game, as they secured less than half as many as
the other boat.

"As fat. as a seal" is an old saying in the eastern States, and certainly
it is an expressive one. The seal is usually in excellent conditiou,aml at
certain seasons of the year contains so much oil that he is a valuable prize
to his captors. The seal-fisheries of Greenland employ great. numbers of
men, principally from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and also from Ice-
land, Norway, and Denmark. Some of the seals are taken for their skins,
but the main put-peso of (:lpture is for the oil. We have already heard of
the fur seal of the north-west coast of America, who is quite different
from his cousin of Greenland,aml far more valuable. Fur seals abound
in only a few localities on the surface of the globe, and if they were not
protected by stringent laws they would soon disappear.

During the evening Commander Bronson went on board the Gambclla
for a conference with Captain Girard. It. was decided to remain a day or
two longer at \Vraugell Islam], to lay in a plentiful store of food for the
dogs, and to make observations that might be of advantage to themselves
or future navigators. A boat was to go from each ship in pursuit of seals
and wall-uses; as the Vivian's mate was an experienced hunter after this
game, he was placed in eonnnand of the joint expedition, and while he
and his crew attended to securing the prizes, the Frenchmen were to look
after the transportation. Then each ship was to send out an exploring
party, the Frenchmen going to the north, while the Americans took a
southerly course.

Fred went with the sealers, while George was with the exploring party.
The former were off before six in the morning, and within two home they
had killed nearly thirty seals. While waiting for the French sailors to re-
move the game to the shore, and thence to the ships, they espied some wal-
ruses on the ice, beyond a point of land which formed one side of the bay,
and away they went in chase. They were Screened from the view of their
game by the intervening point of land, and managed to get quite close to
the ice without being perceived.

" \V'e'll shoot one, and perhaps two of them," said the mate, "and then
we'll take to the harpoons."

Fred asked why they did not. rely altogether on shooting, as it ought
to be quicker work than with the harpoon. The mate explained that. the

hit him on that spot your shot goes for nothing. " We may be able to get"Ctr--x ..:.--.U=<

one or two of them in that way before they take alarm," said he,"but
after that it's hard work to hit 'em. You'll know more about walrus hunt-
ing an hour from now, and then you'll see the reason of our relying on the
harpoon."

Fred was Willing to wait and be instructed. They reached the edge
of the flea where half a dozen wall-uses were taking the sun, and all un-
conscious of the impending danger. The side of the floe was about five
feet above the water, and so the boat and its occupants were quite out of
sight as they lay along-side.

With a repeating rifle in his hand, the mate stood up in the bow of the
boat, while the men held it as steady as they could with the ice-hooks
against the floe. One, two, three shots were fired almost as quickly as
you could count, and each bullet went crashing into the skull of a. walrus.

Then the rifle was passed back to one of the men, and the mate seized
the harpoon. As he did so, the frightened animals that had not been
touched by the bullets went sliding from the flee into the water.

To the surprise of Fred, the mate threw the harpoon into the smallest
of the herd, a little fellow less than half the size of any of the others.
He began to cry immediately, and then his mother came to his relief, and
with her sereml others. They showed their tusks, and threatened to at-
tack the boat; four of them were killed, and then the cub was slaugh-
tered, and as soon as he ceased crying the rest went away. The mate
said the walrus hunteis always did this when they had the opportunity,
as the mother will stay by her young, and the rest will come to assist her
to defend it. At such times the walruses are very fierce, and they have
been known to attack and sink a boat; they come along-side and book their
tasks over the gunwales, and when they get a good hold something must go.

Fred thought that seven walruses were enough for a day's catch, but
the mate said they must make it eight, in order to have no trouble about
division between the ships. They waited near the ice-flee for some time,
and finally a walrus came to the surface close to the boat; the mate threw
a harpoon and caught him, and in a little while he was finished with the
lance. Then signal was made to the ship to send another boat, and mean-
time they started off with two of the prizes in tow. Slow progress was
made, and before they rounded the point they met the boat from the
Vivian, and also one from the Gambetta. All the game of the morning
was brought in before nightfall, and Fred was congratulated on the part
he had borne in the affair. I-Ie declared he had only been a spectator, to
which Commander Bronson replied that a good spectator was not always
easy to find.memo EXPLORATIONS. 137

The land party had a more wearisome journey than (lid the seal and
walrus hunters, with less excitement to sustain them. George was ambi-
tions to plant the American flag higher than the French had placed the
tricolor the day before, and consequently li.\'ed his eye on a hill about a
thousand feet high, at least a couple of miles back from the head of the
bay. lIe carried ashore a small flag, with its staff, and started as soon as
they were lauded for the hill in question, accompanied by one of the sail-
ms. The French boat was close be-
hind them, and as the sailor was a
better climber than George, he ran
ahead and planted the flag at the
top of the hill before the French-
men had reached its base. The lat-
ter stopped, and gave three cheers
for the Americans, who had got
ahead of them, and then made for
another hill farther inland.

There was not much to be seen
on the hill,as the country was desti-
tute of vegetation save a few patch-

hard struggle for existence. George
found an enormous bone, which Dr. Tonner pronounced to he the bone
of a mammoth; other bones were found in the vicinity, and they looked
around for the task of the animal. No tusk could be found, and they
concluded it had fallen to the possession of some previous visitor.

Later in the day the tusk of a mammoth was discovered, and it was
so large that two men found it a heavy lmrdeu. They were sent to the
boat to bring an oar, and some cords for lashing it, but near the land-
lug they found a slender pole, which seemed better for the purptxse, and
it was taken along. The pole bad drifted aer \s the Arctic Ocean;
whether it grew on the banks of an American or a Siberian river nobody
could tell, but in either case the forest of its origin was many hundreds
of miles away. The tusk when weighed on shipboard was found to tip
the beam at a hundred and fifteen pounds, and it was afterwards ascer-
tained that the people from the Gum/wild had found a tusk weighing,r a
hundred and six pounds. America was therefore nine pounds ahead!

The incident naturally led to a conversation of which the mammoth
was the chief topic. Dr. Tonner said so many manunoths' tusks had been138 THE venue or 'l'lll-I " \'1\'1.-\.\'."

found in Siberia that they had become a regular article of commerce for
more than a century, though in recent years the number had somewhat
diminished.

"The scientific name of the animal," said he, " is Eloy/ms prz'mz'genius,
and he was in his time the elephant of the period. He was somewhat
larger than the elephant of to-day, but not much; his body was heavier
and clumsier, and covered with hair that enabled him to live in a colder
climate than the natural home of the elephant we are familiar with."

Fred asked if any living mammoth had been known in modern times.

"No," was the reply; " but as the bones have been found with marks
upon them, it is conjectured that they lived with man during the Stone
Age. The climate of Siberia was evidently warmer than it is new, prob-
ably like that of New York or Pennsylvania, and the mammoth found
plenty of food to eat. He had three kinds of hair: one long and coarse,
a second of finer quality, and a third like won]. The lilst was like home-
hair, and measured twelve or fifteen inches; the second resembled the
hair of a deer, and was nine or ten inches long; and the third was woolly,
and four or five inches thick. So you see he could stand the cold a great
deal better than the modern elephant, which has to be housed in the win-
ter of our northern climate.

" You may wonder how we know all this. In the year 1799 a Tungu-Tm: AGE or THE MAMMOTH. 139

sian fisherman discovered a maunnoth frozen into a bank of earth near
the river Lena. He kept the discovery to himself, and after a time re-
moved the tasks and sold them; the wolves, bears, and foxes fed upon the
flesh of the dead animal which had been so wonderfully preserved, and
when the spot was visited in 1805 by Adams, an English naturalist, not
even the whole skeleton remained. ()ne foreleg had disappeared, and a
few of the other bones were gone, but the brains were in the skull and
the eyes in their sockets. A good deal of the skin and hair was found;
as much as possible was gathered and taken to St. Petersbnrg, where the
skeleton now is.

" Elephant remains are found in America, where the extinct animal is
called the mastodon. They have also been discovered in England and all
over Europe, especially in Germany, and the evidence is very conclusive that
this animal had the range of a large part of the globe ages and ages ago."

" But how did that one get frozen into the bank where the fisherman
found him i" one of the youths inquired.

"Probably in the grand cataclysm we were talking about some time
ago," replied the Doctor. "The earth cooled suddenly, or rather this part
of it did, and the mammoth was caught in the cougelation in the same
way that fishes are sometimes found frozen in the ice of rivels. There
was this difference, though, that the fishes are frozen in their natural habi-
tation, while the mammoth was doubtlcSS drowned by the upheaval of the
waters, and then covered with the drift of earth, where he lay for thou-
sands of years until brought to light in the way I have described."

T was not deemed advisable to devote any time to the exploration of
the coast of Wrangell Islam], nor to make long exclusions into the in-
terior, as that Work had already been performed by the officers of the
Rodgers in 1881. So, on the third day after their arrival, the two ships
left the bay where they had been anchored, and headed for Ilerald Island
as directly as the drifting ice would permit.

The visit of the [lodgers demonstrated that Wrangell was not a con-
tinent but an island, and contained two ranges of mountains whose highest
peaks were less than three thousand feet high. One of these ranges lies
along the southern coast, and
the other near the centre of the
island, from east to west; north
of the backbone, or central
range, there is a rolling land,
with occasional detached peaks,
and along the entire coast line
there are numerous sand-bars
which render navigation both
difficult and dangerous. As
before stated, there is very

imal life is confined to polar
bears, seals, walruses, and numerous waterfowl.

Before they lost sight of "'rangell Island our friends had Herald
Island in full view, so that there was no necessity of an observation ex-
cept for verifying or correcting the figures of previous navigators. Near
the coast of lIerald Island they met a whaling ship, and sent a boat on
board; it returned shortly, with the announcement that the whaler had
been successful and was nearly full of oil; one whale more would com-
plete the cargo, and then she would steer for San Francisco. This au-LANDING 0N HERALD ISLAND. 141

nouncement led to a hasty completion of letters and despatehes, which
were sealed in a bag and despatched to America. The Gambetta also
sent a bag of letters, and as soon as they were on board, the \vhaler filled
away and steered to the southward. Iler captain was confident that in
a few days his cargo would be complete, and he hoped soon to be out of
the Arctic Ocean, and headed for home.

 

0N SHORE IS Tl": FAR SORT".

The approach to Herald Island was rendered difficult by masses of
floating ice, and also by a reef which extended about two miles from its
south-western extremity. There was no sign of a harbor, and so the ships
lay-to off the shore, while each sent a boat inside the reef, where a small
strip of beach afforded a convenient landing-place. The party from the
Viz-{an included the Doctor and the major, together with George and
Fred ; they got off a little ahead of the Gambetta's boat, and by energetic
pulling were the first on shore. The major and George climbed to the
top of the island, while the Doctor and Fred busied themselves with the
inspection of the beach.

The climbers did not have an easy time of it, as the rock was loose, and
liable to break off at any moment, while the sides of the ascent were very
steep. George said they made the most of their upward journey "coon-
fashion," and the return "sled-fashion." They had to go up on hands and
feet, clinging to the projections and running the risk of a tumble; they""2 'l'lll-Z \'H\'.\til~2 ()l" 'l'lll-Z "VIVIAN."

came (Iown the saute way to where the. broken shale lay piled up. like the
einders on Mount Vesuvius. ()n this they sat down and coasted, to the
detriment. of their garments, especially as they acquired a rapid rate of
progress before reaching the beach. The major estimated the ventral
elevation at about. six hundred feet, and said the whole island was visible
from it. He ('Ieseribed the island as a ridge about six miles long and
less than half a mile wide, without. a harbor where ships could anchor.
\Vt'angcll Island was visible, but; no other land could be seen in any
direction.

The beach party did not. fatigue themselves with climbing, but were
by no means idle. They found drift-wood abundant, and proceeded to
light: a fire, and then they looked about for records of previous visits.
None were discovered, although it; is certain that several ships had touched
there at different times. A cairn of stones was found at the western
extremity of the island, but it had evidently been dcspoilcd, as it contained
nothing to reveal its origitn and there was no mark on the rocks in the
neighborhood. They looked for the plank erected by the Badgers, but it
had disappeared. Assisted by the men from the Gum/wit", our friends
erected a cairn in which they placed a bottle containing a record of the
visit, and to make sure that it should be seen, a cross formed of two pieces
of drift-wood was placed above it. No bears or other quadrupeds were
visible, but there was an abundance of water-fowl similar to those on
Wrangell Island. The rifles were of little Ilse, but there was abundant
occupation for the shot-guns in killing ducks and plover for the cabin
table. Dr. Tonner killed a duck which be pronounced an eider, the pro-
ducer of the down famous the world over for its usefulness in fillingr
quilts. \Vhether the duck belonged on the island or was only there by
accident no one could tell.

The best. part of the day was spoilt in the visit, to Herald Island. and
when the boats returned to the ship the travellers were weary and hungry.
Major Clapp reported ice to the north of Herald Island as the result of
his observation from the summit, but said it did not appear to be very
thick. While the boats were on shore, the two commanders had met in
the cabin of the Gambolta, and decided to steer to the north-east, unless
prevented by circumstances then unforeseen. When the boats were hoisted
in, the ships filled their sails with the southerly breeze and steered as
agreed upon.

They were now in the domains of the midnight sun, and it was not
always easy to keep the time; as Fred expressed it,"you couldn't say
whether it was towlay or to-morrow." The sun did not go below theTHE FAR NORTH IN SUMMER. 143

horizon at, midnight, though it just touched it, and the assertion that the
sun rises in the east. and sets in the west had lost its correctness. The uses
of a clock on which the hours are marked from one to twenty-four became
apparent, and Fred and George adopted the plan of dividing the day in

that way. "Eighteen o'clock" served to indicate six in the afternoon,
and "twenty-three o'clock" meant eleveu at: night. It was rather trying
to go to bed in broad daylight, but they soon got used to it. Fred said he
couldn't think of staying awake for three months, and then sleeping for
the same length of time, and so he accepted the situation without a single
break.

As they sailed away from Herald Island,\vith the prow of the Vivian
in the direction of the pole, Commander Bronson recalled the fate of the
Jeannette.

" We are now," said he, "almost at the point where the Jeannetlc was
beset in the ice on the 6th of September, 1879. She never escaped from
it. until she sunk to the depths of the Arctic Ocean, nearly two yeais later.
and left her crew to the perils of a journey over ice and open water to the
shores of Siberia."

" Yes," responded the Doctor, "and who can tell how soon we shall be
enclosed in the icy walls, and compelled to drift wherever the currents may
take us?"

" There was one remarkable feature of the drift of the Jeannette," said
the major. " It. was not on a reasonably direct line, as though driven by a
steady current, like what we find on the coast of Greenland. The Juan-
ncite seemed to move as though propelled by shifting currents, and herTHE STORY OF THE "JEANNETTE." 145

track was very irregular. On the published chart it is in the form of zig-
zags,and crosses itself repeatedly. This was the case soon after she was
frozen in near Ilcrald Islam]; she drifted north, then east, and then south-
west, and then to the westward. ()n the 3d of November, 1880,5he was
in almost exactly the same position as on the 26th of the previous April,
but in the mean time she had drifted, or rather had been borne by the ice
to every point of the compass, and her wanderings coveted fully ten de-
grees of longitude."

" What was the rate of the drift?" one of the listeners inquired.

" It varied considerably," was the reply. "Some days it was as high
as twenty miles or more, and at other tilnes not more than half a mile.
Occasionally the ship was almost stationary for days together; this hap-
pened in the coldest weather, and showed that at such times there was very
little current.

"Captain De Long was of the opinion," the major continued, "that
even the lightest winds caused a movement. of the ice, except when it was
of great thickness. "'0 shall probably have occasion to make practical
observations on this point before many days; well drop the subject now,

swept over the surface of the Arctic Ocean, and caused a continual grind-
ing and crushing of the great flees, which threatened the instant destruc-
tion of the ship.

"The captain in his journal gives a vivid ('leseription of the noise
caused by these movements of the ice. There were loud crashes as the
flees broke against each other, mingled with the peculiar grinding sounds
of the attrition of the smaller pieces, and the roar of the wind as it im-
pinged on the roughened surface. Frequently they were called from their
beds at night, in momentary expectation that the ship would be crushed,
and for months and mouths together everything was kept in readiness for
sudden departure. The sledges and boats were on the ice near the ship_
where the flees seemed to promise the greatest security. The dogs were
quartered there, though they came aboard the ship whenever they liked
and quantities of provisions were stored near the boats or on the sledges.

"The first serious alarm occurred on the 19th of January, 1880,:111

' hour or so past midnight. The captain was seated in his room, when he
heard a sound as though some of the ship's timbers were cracking; he ran
out and found there was no movement of the ice, and after looking around
and discovering no cause for the sound, he went to bed under the impres~
sion that nothing more had happened than a bolt drawn by the extreme
cold. About eight o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly shifted
from north to north-west, and the ice began to more; it came with tre-
tnendous force against the bow, and piled up large masses in front of the
ship; but as that was the strongest part of the Jeannette, it was thought
she could stand tlte strain without injury. .

"But when the men went below to serve out coal for the day's use,
they found a stream pouring in through a crack in the fore-foot; there
were three feet of water in the fore-hold, and a correslwnding amount in
the store-room and fire-room. All the crew was called, and while some
worked at the pumps the rest removed the storm front the part of the ship
that was most seriously threatened.

"' From that day until she disappeared beneath the waters the Jeannette
was constantly leaking, and it required the steady attention and exertion
of her crew to keep her afloat. The supply of coal was exhausted in work-
ing the steam-pumps, so that if the ship had been released from the ice she
would have been com-
pelled to work under sail
alone. After this inci-
dent orders were given to
have the sledges packed
ready for instant depart-
ure. and during the gales
everybody lay down to
rest with his knapsack on
his back or by his side.
Captain De Long de-
scribed their situation Icr. is MOTION.

'like living over a pow-

der magazine, with a train laid for instant firing.' The excitement grow-
ing out of their constant peril, varied with Occasional hunts after beats
and wall-uses, were the only variations to the monotony of their existence,
and everybody suffered from the enforced inactivity.

"(if course they hoped to be released during the summer of 1880, and
have an opportunity to add to the discoveries of previous explorers. But
the Ice-king did not relent, and they remained in their prison until winter
came again. Then followed the long darkness, then the arctic spring and
summer, with the sun at midnight, and it was in this second period of con-
tinuous day that the great calamity occurred to the Jeannette.

"The ice opened, and for some time the ship was afloat; then it closed
again, crushing her sides as though they had been of pasteboard, but hold-
ing her firmly in their grasp. She remained afloat nearly twelve hours, so
that there was time for everybody to escape to the ice, with a fairly good
stock of provisions. Then followed the preparations for the journey to the
Siberian coast, and seven days after the sinking of the ship the march be-
gan to the southward.

"The boats were on sledges drawn by the men and dogs, and there was
a stock of provisions suflicient for reaching the Siberian coast. The jour-
ney occupied more than three months, including a rest of eight days on
Bennett Island, where the sledge: were abandoned and the boats launched
in the water, which had become sufficiently open for navigation.

" The party landed on one of the islands of the New Siberia group, and
afterwards on Semenovski Island. They were separated by a gale on the
12th of September, and one of the boats, commanded by Lieutenant
Chipp, was never heard from. Another, commanded by Engineer Mel-
ville, reached the coast safely, and her party soon fell in with the natives
and were saved from starvation. The other boat, in which were Command-
er De Long and thirteen others, was less fortunate than that of the en-
gineer; it reached one of the mouths of the Lena, which it ascended as far
as the ice would permit, and there the crew went on shore. It was neces
sary to abandon many things on leaving the boat; when they reached the
land the stock of provisions was very small, and there was but a limited
amount of clothing for the weary and frost-bitten men. Two sailors, Nin-
dermann and Noros, were sent away to procure help, and when nearly dead
with fatigue and starvation fell in with some wandering natives. They
could not induce these people to go with them to relieve the shipwrecked
crew, and so all of their party that had been left behind died of hunger
and cold on the banks of the Lena. The two sailors were taken to a Rus-
sian village, where they met Mr. Melville, their old oflicer; he did every--
thing in his power for the rescue of De Long and his companions, but all
in vain. The records which were afterwards found by the side of De Long
at the spot where he died showed that before Melville started on his search
the whole party had perished.

" In the following spring an expedition was sent .to the mouth of the
Lena to find the last camp of the explorers, and secure the records of the
voyage of the Jeannette. All the papers were found and preserved, the

bodies were buried, and a monument was erected over their grave. One
by one the survivors returned to the United States; and finally, in the
early part of 1884, the bodies of De Long and those who died wilh him
were brought home for burial in their native land. The story of the -[m.tll~
uctte is one of the most pathetic that has been given to us in the annals of
arctic exploration."

As the major ended his account of the adventures of De Long and
his companions, there was not a dry eye among his group of listeners.
Not a word was spoken, but silently, one by one, they sought. the deck,
and (lid not revert to the subject of the conversation.

"The ice is growing thicker in the north," said the Doctor, as he
waved his hand in the direction indicated. "The wind seems to be press-
ing the flees together, and I should not be surprised if the pack closes in
upon us before another twenty hours."

Hour by hour the ice became more abundant, and the Doctor's predic-
tion was verified. "'ithin twenty hours from the time he made it, they
were surrounded by drifting ice, so closely that: it was practically turned
into a pack. Here and there lanes of water were open, and the ships
pressed through them to make as much not-thing as possible before their
progress was arrested. The lanes narrowed, and finally disappeared alto-
gether, and the ships were enclosed where both sails and steam were pow-
erless. It was not deemed advisable to light the fires and use the engines
until there should be a prospect of reaching open water by so doing.

Where the ice came from that closed in behind them after their prog-
ress was arrested nobody could tell. In ten hours from the time they
stopped, the entire horizon to the south had changed from water to ice,
with an appearance of solidity which was anything but encouraging.
The wind was variable, as it shifted from south to east, then to south-
west, and afterwards to south-east, all within a few hours; the change
of wind caused an irregular motion to the ice-fields, and the crashing and
grinding of the fines and cakes was continuous.

Fred and George asked permission to go out on the ice, but their
request was denied. Captain Jones explained that there might be a break-
up at any moment, and they would run great risk of being cut. off from
their floating home. " The pack," said he, "is not yet solidly closed, how-
ever mueh it. may appear so; a change of wind may open long lanes of
water, and you might suddenly find yourself with one of these lanes be~
tween you and the ship. We could not send a boat. for you, as it would
be impossible to launch one, and your only chance would be to swim
norms the lanes and clamber over the cakes and flees."A SUDDEN PERIL. .151

Such a risk was not to be thought of for a moment, and they eon-
tented themselves with looking at the ice from the deck, of the Vivian.
George had a glass in his hand, and was endeavoring to find a space of
open water when he suddenly caught sight of a bear. .

The animal was at least two miles away, and coming towards the
ship, as though desirous of investigating it and ascertaining its character.
Rifles were brought, and everybody was ready for a shot in case there
was a chance for it. Captain Jones said that, if the bear came near
enough, the hunters might go out on the ice in pursuit of him; but they
must be under strict orders to return at a signal from the ship.

The bear continued to approach, and when he was within half a
mile of the Vivian, the captain gave his permission, and the Doctor and
major went over the side and down upon the ice, accompanied, or rather
followed, by Fred and George. Screening themselves as well as possible
behind the hammocks scattered over the ice-pack, they got along very
well, and were seen within range of the game. Evidently the bear-was
suspicious; he stopped in his advance and stood erect, in order to take in
as wide a. field of view as possible. This gave an excellent mark for the
rifles, and the major took a shot at the denizen of the ice. The Doctor
followed his example almost at the same instant; the bullets went true
to their mark, and the bear fell to the ice apparently dead.

The hunters advanced cautiously, and it was well they did so. The
bear rose to his feet when they were not more than half a dozen yards
away, and sprang directly towards them; already his paws seemed to be
within reach of the major's face, when the Doctor fired again and brought
him down once more. The shot was fatal, and there was no further sign
of life.

The major drew his handkerchief and waved it, as an intimation that
they had killed their bear and wanted help to carry it on board. As he
did so, a rifle was fired on the deck of the Vivian: it was the signal
agreed upon for their retum, and indicated danger.

There was no delay in attempting to save the bear, though all the
party regretted leaving such a prize to be eaten by wolves or to sink
beneath the waves. They knew that the signal would not have been
given without good reason, and possibly they might be in great peril with-
out knowing it.

Wherever the condition of the ice permitted, they ran at the top of
their speed; but there were many places where running was impossible,
owing to the roughness of the way. To prevent accidents with their
weapons, the major ordered that all cartridges should be removed, and152 THE \'omet-z 01' Till-J "VIVIAN."

on no account was one of the party to stop to shoot at anything except
in self-defence. They were near their ship, and the only hear they had
seen was dead; consequently, there was not nmch likelihood of their fall-
ing into temptation.

They were about half-way to the ship when two shots were tired in
quick succession. They naturally looked in the Vivian's direction, and
saw one of the otlieers stand-
ing at the gangway waving a
small flag. The movements
of the flag indicated that they
were to make a detour to the
right and reach the ship near
her bows. They turned as in-
dicated, and the flag ceased its
motion.

"There's open water be-
tween us and the ship," said

umnwcxs AFLOAT. the major, "' and we nmst go
about to weather it."

Again the flag waved, and another shot was tired.

" we're in great danger," said the Doctor. " {an for your lives l"

The pace was quickened, the major taking the lead.

A hundred yards frotu the ship they reached a great fissure or lane,
at least twenty feet across, with bits of ice floating at intervals of a yard
or two. These cakes were too small to render it safe to try to jump from
one to another, and the only way of escape was to pass around the end
of the lane. To their dismay, the lane extended perhaps an eighth of a
mile, and was widening and lengthening every moment,

There was a commotion below the surface which indicated a general
disruption of the pack. Every few minutes an upheaval threw pieces of
ice into the air with the sound of an explosion, and formed a hmnmock
like the top of a miniature volcano. What if the mass should separate
altogether while they were on its surface!

Faster than ever they ran along the side of the lane till they neared its
end. There was a width of four or five feet over which the major sprang
with the agility of a door; he turned to catch the Doctor, who narrowly
escaped a fall, and then the two men received Fred and George without
accident. Each of the party clung to his rifle; the major admitted after-
wards that he was too scared to think of dropping his burden, his whole
thought being to waste no time in getting to the ship.
They approached the ship under her bowsprit. Their coming was pro-
vided for, as the captain had ordered rope-ladders lowered from the bows,
so that the time of going as far aft as the gangway was saved. The
major and Fred sprang to one of the ladders, while the Doctor and
George seized the other. In a few seconds they were on the deck of the
Vivian, and safe from their peril.

The lane of water continued to widen and lengthen, and the commo-
tiou below the ice increased. While our friends were still panting from
the fatigue of their enforced run over the ice, the floes came together with
great violence, and formed a huge winrow of irregular blocks and frau-
meuts, perhaps a dozen feet high. Then it opened again, and in a. few
minutes the floes wore separated and water was visible in a dozen direc-
tions. The ice around the ship gave way and she floated free. With the
aid of the glass they could see that the same disturbance was going on in
the vicinity of the Gumbelta.

The latter vessel had been lying with her prow to the westward, but
she was gradually turned by the ice until she headed due north. Then
she spread her fonesail to catch the breeze, and soon was forging slowly
ahead.

" She's determined to sail to the pole," said the Doctor.

" Yes," answered Major Clapp, " and so are we."

As he spoke he pointed to the foresail of the Vivian, which was fol-
lowing the example of the Frenchman. Captain Jones was aloft in the
crou"s--nest, and his quick eye had noted the movement of the (Jami/elm.
As her men were ascending the rigging he gave the necessary order, and
was evidently determined not to be left behind.

 

HO'V A "I'MMOL'K lh' FORMED.
CHAPTER XI.

FAST I.\' THE ICE--GOING INTO WINTER QI'ARTERS.

BSERVATION at. noon showed the ships to he in latitude 72deg 15'

north, longitude 17 6deg 20' west; the lookout reported signs of open
water to the eastward. and after a short dialogue with the signal-flags the
ships were headed in that direction,the Vivian leading. In a couple of
hours the course was changed to the north-east, and the promise of open
water was increased,sinee there was no indication of ice-blink on the horizon
towards which they were steering. Between seven and eight o'clock, or, as
Fred expressed it, " at half-past nineteen," the open water was distinctly
visible eight or ten miles ahead of their position, and by midnight they
were practically free of the ice.

Just as they had reached clear sailing a fog set in, and it was neces-
sary to proceed with great caution. Very little way was made by either
ship, as it was impossible to determine when the ice would be reached
again, and it would be a serious matter to run against a floe while proceed-
ing at the rate of five or six knots an hour. Sail was shortened to little
more than the extent of a pocket-handkerehief, and the l'iriwn and Gam-
lletta drifted along, and literally felt their way. They did not make more
than a mile an hour in this sort of progress. and it was especially tantaliz-
ing, as there was a favoring breeze that would have borne them merrily
along if circumstances permitted. The wisdom of their precaution "'st
shown when a huge floe appeared through the fog and effectually barred
their way. The captain order )(1 an ice-anchor to be put out, and in a
little while the Vivian was moored to the flue, and the (lumbetlu followed
her example.

The fog lifted after a time, and showed that the fine was of great ex--
tent; it embraced several small icebergs, the first they had seen, and as
soon as it was considered safe to do so a party went. oil to examine them.
The largest of the bet-gs was about. a hundred feet high and five hundred
yards long, and the ice of which it was composed was remarkably clear
for the product of a. glacier. Captain Jones said he thought it must have155

IM-nt- m .n um um
come from the American coast, though pmibly it may have originated in
one of the islands diseovered by Captain De Long on his retreat southward,
after the sinking of the Jeannette. In the journal from which the ac-
count of his voyage was written, he says that he saw on Bennett Island
one glacier which was three miles across at its front, and another, some>>
what smaller, as little farther along the coast.

Several blocks were cut from the berg and taken on board the Vivian;
they melted one of these blocks, and the water obtained from it was per-
fectly fresh; this proved unmistakably that it was from a glacier. F be
ice is formed by the freezing of salt-water, but occasionally cakes and
fragments are found which have drifted down from Siberian or American
rivers, and are therefore fresh. In the heat of sunnner the surface of
a flee is often covered in many places with water two or three inches
deep; sometimes this water comes from the melting of the surface of the
ice, and occasionally it is blown there by the action of the wind; in either
case it is salt, and can never be mistaken for the product of a berg.

Fred took an ice-anger and endeavored to ascertain the thickness of V
the floe, but after boring to a depth of eleven feet he gave up the attempt.
Captain Jones said he might easily go down twenty feet without finding
bottom, and George reminded him that arctic explorers had found ice
upward of forty feet thick. Weyprecht and Payer, in the voyage of the
T egelltqfl', reported a depth of forty-seven feet in the ice which surrounded
the ship in her last winter in the North; this great thickness shows the
efiect of long continued and intense cold. If the congelation sets in early
in the beginning of an arctic winter, and the weather is steadily cold, with-
out wind, the water becomes chilled to such an extent that a few more
weeks and a few more degrees of cold would convert the entire ocean
around the pole into a solid mass.

Liberty was given to half the crew to go out on the ice and amuse
themselves in any way they liked; but it was understood that they should
return with all speed at a signal from the ship. They had a. good time,
chasing each other like sohool~boys at play, climbing on the iceberg, sliding
wherever there was a smooth surface favorable to that amusement, and
searching for shells and pieces of drift-wood. The latter sport was
mainly left to Fred and George, as it was more scientific than exciting,
and the sailors were not specially interested in it. George picked up a
piece of drift-wood similar to what had been found on Herald and
\angell Islands, and with the help of one of the men carried it to the
ship. Commander Bronson said it demonstrated that the ice was formed
in the part of the Arctic Ocean west of Behring Strait; its position, to-
gether with the iceberg imbedded in it, was an indication of an easterly
current which might prove exactly what they wanted to find.

While George was busy with the drift-wood, Fred, who had abandoned
the ice-auger, proceeded to investigate the berg from which the blocks had
already been cut and carried to the ship. With considerable difliculty he
climbed to the top, cutting steps for his feet at every advance and narrow-
ly escaping a serious fall. A few minutes after he stood upon the sunt-
mit.aud waved his hot as a signal of triumph, a large slice broke from the
farther end of the berg; and slid down with a tremendous crash. This was
a warning of the peril of his position,and he prudently descended to the
surface of the flue. Safely at the bottom, he realized the force of what
he had heard and read, that an iceberg is not to be depended on at any
time, and should be approached and tnounted with caution.

A commotion among the tnen who had strayed to the farther end of
the berg, attracted the youth's attention, and he hastened to ascertain the
cause. He had not lung to wait.

" A bear! a bear !' said one of the sailots who came running from the
gl'kflll).

" And a big one, too!" said another. who was following close behind
his cotnrade.

None of the sailots had any weapons. and Fred was without his gun.
The major and the Doctor, together with the cmmnander, were walking on
the ice not far from the ship, engaged in investigating it, and not one of
them had anything to shoot with.

" hing the rifles!" shouted all three of the gentlemen at nearly the
same instant. Scott the rifles were in their hands, and they started for the
game.

The bear seetned to understand the situation, and gave them a long
chase. lie could move faster than his biped plthleIS, and every minute
the distance between them increased. Finding there was no hope of over-
taking him. (Tonnnander Bronson dropped on one knee and tool: a long
shot, but without perceptible effect. The bear kept on as though nothing
had happened, and the chase was abandoned at the end of half a mile.
The Doctor said he was reminded of a similar chase after a bear on the
ice near the Siberian coast.a feu' yeats before; he followed the animal
for at least five miles, and the brute seemed to lead him on for the pur-
pose of tantalizing hint.

Whenever he stopped and gave up the chase. tltc bear halted and came
towards him. almost within range. Then the bear would stop and look at
hint; the Doctor would creep forward, and when about ready for a shot,
the bear invariably turned and made oil. Then the Doctor followed on a
while; when he stopped the bear stopped: and thus the performance was
repeated several times. Finally he took a long shot, with little expectation
of hitting his object; he aimed high, to allow for the course of the bullet,
and to his surprise brought the bear to the ice and disabled him. Then
he followed up and finished the bear with a shot through the skull. The
first bullet had broken a fore-leg and opened one of the large veins, but in
spite of the severe wound the bear rushed at him as he approached, and
was only stopped by the final shot.

Our friends looked about for seals and walruses, but none were to be
seen. It is probable that, if any were in the vicinity, they had been scared
off by the noise on the ice, as these creatures are very wary and must be
pursued in silence. There's an old saying, "you don't lmnt ducks with a
brass band," and it may well apply to seals and walruses. Quiet must be
observed when pursuing these animals on the ice, as they slip into the
water at the least sound. When you have a walrus harpooned you may
shout as much as you please, and you can do the same thing when killing
seals with a club, after their retreat to the water is cut off.

A gun from the ship drew attention to the signal at the peak, and
everybody went on board without delay. The dogs had been let out for a
run on the ice, and there was some trouble in getting them in again; they
resisted all control, until one of the drivers came to the gang-1.:lank and
threw out a few pieces of seal-meat. The whole drove then went aboard
with a. rush, and had their usual quarrel over the repast on the ship's deck.

The recall had been made in consequence of the clearing up of the
fog and the prospect of being able to make a farther advance. \Vhen
all were safe on board, the Vivian cast. off from the floe and the (Jamballa
followed her example. A few Scattered cakes and floes were visible in
the north-east, but there was none as large as the one to which they had
been fastened, and the captain considered the opportunity too good to be
lost.

The ships made about thirty-five or forty miles on their course, and
then the drift-ice became so thick as to necessitate caution. The captain
mounted to the crew's-nest, and in an hour or so he announced that he
could make out the ice-blink filling the horizon in the distance. It ex-
tended so far that he thought it indicated an end of their progress under
sail for the present.

Steadily the ice increased, and in ten or twelve hours after the blink
was discovered they found themselves hemmed in on all sides. The tloes
were large, and the lanes became so narrow that sailing was out of theA T.\.\T.\I.IZISG I'l7kSL'lT.

question. Once more the ships were tied up. and as a matter of precaution
(.'aptain Jones ordered the l'iz'fr/n to be warped into a little nook on one
side of a lloe, where the chances of being " nipped i' were greatly dimin-
isltetl.

" We are now," said the captain, " about as far to the north as we. can
expect to get by sailing. In a. few hours we shall probably be frozen in.
and must trust to the, currents to carry us on our way. The wind is in our
favor. and I think the ice is carrying us towards the. pole."

Then he ordered soundings to be made on the side of the ship farthest
from the ice. The lead showed forty-fire fathoms of water, with muddy
bottom; after the depth had been ascertained the lead was again east. in
order to ascertain the drift of the ice. and consequently of the ship. This
proved to be north-east; the wind was blowing front the south, and conse-
qnently the drift was not. exactly in accordance with the wind, and showed
the existence of a current.

During the night the ice closed in more firmly than before, and the
drift to the north-east continued. Observation at noon the next day
showed their position, latitude 74deg 20' north. longitude 172deg 18' west; and
it was practically at this point they were enclosed by the ice and held firmly
in its grasp.

And now began a period of monotony which we will not attempt to
record day by day. Such a narrative would be tedious. and could not.
differ materially from the stories that many naVigatms have given us in
the accounts of their hibernation in the arctic regions. Our friends fol--
lowed the example of Kane, Parry, De Long, M'Clintock, and other arctic
explorets, and proceeded to make their preparations for the season of long-
continued cold. Lumber was brought from below for building a house
over the deck; the structure was made as close as. possible, in order to
keep out the cold, and a sufficient pitch was given to the roof to let the
snow slide ofi as fast as it fell. In the centre the roof was supported by
stout rafters, and the space was tuade so roomy that it virtually added an-
other deck to the ship. The dogs were allowed the run of this enclosed
space at, certain hours of the day, but the most of their time was passed
on the ice, where shelters were erected for them. They were not. long in
findingr out the hour for meals. It was the custom to feed them at four
in the afternoon, and when the marine signal of eight bells was given
they walked up the gang-plank and indicated their readiness for duty.
Had they been the patrons of a well-regulated boarding-house they could
not have been more prompt.

The dog--shelters were made of boards, like the housing of the deck.
HSKUHJS.

A "'IXTILR RESIDENCE AMONG THE

 

A mum w um: um
Fred and George wanted to have some huts of snow or ice, and with the
assistance of the dog-drivers they constructed some. It required a good
deal of engineering, as the Chukchees are not to be compared with the
Eskimos in this kind of work; in fact, the Eskimo snow-hut is the finest
dwelling of the kind in the whole world. Fred and George made use of
the dmwings given by Captain Hall, and others familiar with the Eskimos,
and then projected their edifices as an architect makes his plans. Every
block was hewn from the ice, as a block of stone is cut for a building; the
joints were cemented with water; a tmmel was made for the entrance, on
the same plan as in Greenland; and altogether the huts, when completed,
were highly creditable to the builders.

We will describe the mode of construction of the Eskimo snow--hut by
telling how our friends made theirs.

They levelled a space on the ice to form the floor, and in order to
have as little transportation as possible for their material they selected
a spot close to a solid lunmnock. The Eskimos use blocks of snow which
have been packed hard by the wind, but as these were not available, our
friends used ice, which they quarried from the hmmnock. As before
stated, each block was carefully shaped before being set in its place;
George attended to the cutting of the blocks, amisted by one of the
drivers, while Fred and the other driver performed the work on the hut.

The first but they built was about ten feet in diameter at the base, and
was intended to be six feet clear on the inside. Of course the centre of
the dome was the only point where this height was maintained. Opposite
the entrance the floor was raised about six inches higher than in the other
half of the hut; this raised space was understood to be parlor and bed-
room, while the other was more practical in its uses, and served as kitchen,
and a lodging for the dogs when they chose to come in. The dogs, by-the-
way, seemed to undeistand from the outset that they were prohibited from
mounting to the parlor, and only on a few occasions did they ever attempt it.

The filst row of blocks was laid with mathematical accuracy, the circle
having been formed by means of a string fastened to a peg in the centre
of the prepared floor; then the second row was laid a little inside the
line of the first; and then the rows followed in regular succession till the
top was reached. Three holes for windows were left at dificrent eleva-
tions; two of these were covered with plates of clear ice an inch or more
in thickness, while the third was closed with the membrane of the stomach
of a deer. It was found that these windows admitted sufiicient light for
all practical purposes, but, the ice-windows were not to be relied on during
the period that the sun came above the horizon.BUILDING AN ICE-HUT. 163

The youths made a ludicrous blunder in their first efiort at building a
hut. Fred was on the inside, assisting in laying the blocks in place; his
attendant native was outside the hut, engaged in handing up the blocks
as they were received from George and his assistant. As they were about
to put the final block on the top it occurred to George that they had quite
forgotten to make a door for entrance. They had planned it originally.
but in the excitement of laying out the circle the door had been omitted,
and was not again thought of. And there was Fred, almost walled up
inside without means of escape!

The ice-axes soon remedied this oversight, and Fred was able to come
to daylight, after assisting in covering the dome with its cap. Then the
tunnel leading up to the door was tinished, and the youths were ready for
the inspection of their work.

They held a reception the next: day at noon. Calls were made by all
the otlicers of the ship, aml each visitor was regaled with a cup of hot tea
from a kettle prepared on ship<<
board. and kept at the right: temper-
ature by an alcohol lamp. George
said they were not quite up to the
native custom of burning oil in a
stone lamp, but they might come to
it in time.

George was ready to answer all
inquiries relative to the construction
of huts of this sort; he said they
were peculiar to the arctic regions, mm mm; w", m, mm
and were rarely, if ever, seen in the
torrid zone; Stanley and other African explorers made no mention of
them, and therefore it was to be inferred that snow-huts were not built
in the dark continent. Even in the far North they do not last through
the summer, as the sun quickly destroys them; the snow-hut is only a
winter residence, and the Eskimos take to skin tents during the warm
months.

The winter huts of the Eskimos are usually on the ice, or near it, on
account of the convenience of fishing or sealing, but their summer tents
are on the land. For a winter residence they select a bay where the ice
is not likely to drift, and the nearer they can get to the haunts of the seal
the better they like it. It not nufretpiently happens that the ice under
a village breaks up in a storm; in such case the occupants must run for
safety, and they are not always able to do this, especially if a severe gale
is blowing, and there is a. general disruption of the floe. In some in-
stances whole villages have been swept away, and in othets only a few
individuals escaped to tell how the rest were lost.

 

A "CT srnmzucru.

Fred and George spent the most of the afternoon in their ice-hut to
receive the congratulations of their friends and become accustomed to the
novelty of the situation. \Vhen evening came they abandoned it to the
dog-drivers, and on the next (lay it was the object of much interest to the
sailors, who were allowed to visit it in small parties till all had been given
an opportunity of inspection and criticism.

Evidently the youths were not in a hurry to occupy the new house they
had built, and they frankiy admitted that the cabin of the Vivian was
greatly to be preferred. " But. we'll build more of them," said Fred, "in
case they are needed for sheltering the (logs, or for any other purpose.
\Vc've got our hands in now, and can turn them off very quickly. We can
make a. whole village of these huts, and connect them by short galleries, as
the Eskimos do, so that we may step from one to another without going
out-of-doors."

The early part of the hibernation of the ships was not at. all dangerous,
as the ice-flees were not crowding each other, and there were no gales toA \VALRL'S-HUXT. 165

break up the fields and create the commotious that we have already men-
tioned. Sometimes the wind shifted suddenly, but in most cases there was
a calm interval of a. feu' hours. The weather steadily increased in cold-
ness, and by the middle of September the thermometer at night. was fre-
quently below zero.

Every day the dog-teams were harnessed for sledge journeys over the
ice as far as practicable. Visits were exchanged with the oflicers of the
(hunbettrt, and both ships made preparations for long explorations as soon
as circumstances favored. Fred and George tried their hands at driving
the dogs, and had many overturns and mishaps. No serious accident oc'
curred, however, and they counted their bruises as the honorable scars of
their warfare with the regions of ice.

llears and seals were occasionally seen, and when seen they were pur-
sued with varyiug success. One (lay a returning dog-team reported wal-
rnscs on the ice near some open water six or eight miles to the south; of
comse there was a desire on the part of everybody to go in pursuit of them,
and early next morning,r a party was off. Two dog-teams were taken, and
it was arranged that if any walrnses were killed the other teams should be
sent out as soon as intelligence could be brought to the ship.

They succeeded in killing three walrnses out of a dozen or more that
were making themselves comfortable on the surface of a floe. The sledges
were loaded with the meat, and Fred started back with them; a sharp
lookout had been kept on board ship for the hunteis, so that Fred and his
sledges were discovered before he had made half the distance homeward.
The flag of the Vivian was dipped three times, as had been arranged, and
then the youth mounted to the top of a lnnnmock, and with the small flag
that he carried he told the result of the day's sport. In a few minutes the
extra teams were off, and making the best of their way in the direction of
the hunting region. The dogs enjoyed the run immensely, and needed no
urging; in many places the ice was rough, but. by making occasional
dctours the sledgos found a fairly good road.

I'lycd did not return to where the walruses were killed, as it was too
late in the day when he reached the ship to make a. second journey. The
sledges \vcre loaded with all they could carry, and by dark all were safely
at the side of the Vic/(m. The Doctor said they had been obliged to leave
several hundred pounds of walrus-meat. and hoped to be able to bring it in
the next morning; Captain Jones thought. there would be very little use in
going for it, as the flesh could he scented a long distance by the beans, and
the chances were in favor of their devouring every ounce of it before the
hunteis could get around to the spot.

11*
"If that's the case." said George, " we'll go for it anyway, :md if the
bears have eaten up the. meat they will be likely to stay around for more,
and we can have the fun of a hear-hunt."

The suggestion was accepted as a sensible one, and early in the morn-
intor the party was off. It consisted of the major, with (icorge and Fred.
and they agreed that, as the suggestion came from George, he should have
the first shot at the bear in also they encountered one.

As they approached the scene of the previous day's sport they pro-
ceeded very cautiously; every few minutes the youths mounted to the
summit of a lnumnock and swept the horizon with a glass, in the hope of
discovering a bear. Their patience was rewarded, as a bear was revealed
where the dead walrus lay; he \'as so busy with his breakfast. that he did
not look up for an instant, and the major thought it would be easy to ap-
proach him.

The sledge was left with the dogs behind a lnnmnoek; the animals had
not seen or scented the bear, otherwise it would have been a ditlicult mat.
ter to keep them quiet. The three hunters went forward with their rifles,
George taking the lead in accordance with the agreement.

They crept along, shielding themselves as best they could, though there
was little need of precaution, since the bear was so intently occupied
with his feast of \'alrus-meat. Keeping the wind in their favor, so that
he should not discover their presence by his sense of smell, they reached a
little luumnock not more than twenty yards from where the bear stood.

"Don't be in a hurry," whispered the major; "get a good aim at his
heart, and rest your rifle against the hammock to steady it. Wait till you
have a first-rate chance, as he won't be in a hurry to move off."

George obeyed the major's directions, and secured an excellent aim
before firing.

As the report of his rifle rang out. the major and Fred sprang from
their mucealment, and were ready to give their assistance in case it was
wanted.

The bear fell on his side, but was up in an instant. He rose, to his
hind-feet, and thus gave the opportunity for George's companions. They
fired almost simultaneously, and the b 'ar dropped once more. Then
George ran forward and smashed the skull of the brute with another bul-
let. The brief and brilliant encounter was over, and the party had ex-
changed the meat of the walrus for that of the b 'ar.

While they were engaged in skinning their prize and preparing it for
the homeward journey, Fred discovered a. large bear on the ice not more
than a quarter of a mile avay. The youth desired to go on another lumt,.8--

but was restrained by the major, who argued that they already had as
much game as they could take care of: and if they killed another hear
they would be obliged to leave him for his brethren and the wolves to
devour.

" Do bears eat each other 2" said Fred, in a tone of surprise.

"Certainly they do," was the reply; " they kill and devour one another
in their battles, and if a bear is killed by a hunter, and abandoned. he will
be speedily devoured by his kindred. They are not, at all fastidious in
their tastes, and if the thing was not a physical inconvenience, I believe
a bear would eat himself up, and pick all his bones so clean that there
wouldn't be enough flesh on them to bait a mousestrap with.

" And if the beam didn't come around, the wolves would he sure to
find their way here before many hours. The meat that an arctic wolf will
decline to devour hasn't yet been discovered."

So the solitary bear on the ice was left. to himself, and no doubt. he
fared sulnptuously on what the hunters left on their return to the ship.

 

ARCTIC WOLVES.TAKING SOUNDINGS THROUGH THE ICE. 169

CHAPTER XII.

DISAPPEARAXCE OF THE SURE--INCHES" 0F HIBERNATION.--THE AURORA
IBOREALIS.

'1'le ships continued day by day to drift with the ice as it was home

by the wind and currents. A good deal depended on the wind, and
fortunately it was mostly from the southern quarter of the horizon; some-
times, when not a breath was blowing, soundings were made through the
ice in order to ascertain the force of the current. At such times the lead
was dropped to the bottom, and allowed to remain there until the slope of
the line became so great that it was time to take it in. Commander Bron-
son applied one of the problems of Euclid to the demonstration on the
drift of the ship, and perhaps the knowledge of his system may be of use
to othets.

In the first place, the lead was dropped perpendicularly to the bottom,
and the length of line paid out was carefully noted. Then, as the ship
drifted with the ice, the observations were made at a hole through the ice.
The line was run out until it sloped off at an angle of forty-fire degrees.
The additional line given out was noted,aud thus the perpendicular and
the hypothenuse were known, together with the angle between them.
Ileucet'orth it: was easy enough to find the length of the base; the latter
repmsented the distance over which they had travelled, and as the time
occupied was carefully kept, the daily drift of the ship could be averaged.

It could not be exactly obtained in this way,as the drift might vary
from one hour to. another, but it was near enough for all practical pur-
poses. Similar observations were made on board the Gambetta, and at
hours different from those of the Vivian ,' the result of the observations
was exchanged from time to time, and careful comparisons were made.
The truth of the old adage that "two heads are better than one" was well
exemplified in this case.

Sounding leads and dredges were frequently used for ascertaining the
character of the bottom of the ocean, and the results of the dredging were
sometimes quite interesting. Usually the dredge brought up nothing but
soft mud,but once in a while it revealed curious forms of marine shells,
the most of thetn so small as to need a microscope for their investigation.
One day a tiny branch of coral was secured, but whether it was formed
where they found it, or had been drifted northward from warmer regions,
nobody could tell. No fishes were caught, but for all that there might
have been an abundance of them in the water. It. would require a good
deal of stupidity as well as sluggishnezxs fora fish to be taken in a dredge
which was movintt,r so slowly as to seem almost at rest. Fred tried several
times to catch something on a hook which be lowered through a hole
drilled in the ice, after carefully baiting it with a piece of seal-fat. But
his efforts were not rewarded with a bite, nor even a nibble.

 

X.\' WINTER Ql'AllTEllS.

The depth of water varied from thirty--live to fifty fathmns, being rare-
ly less than the former figure or more than the latter. The observations
on the depth of water corresponded very nearly with those made on the
Jeannette. It is probable that the Arctic Ocean is nowhere of the great
depth of the Atlantic or the Pacific, though it may have been much deep-
er than at present in ages long gone by. The mud that forms the bottom
has been drifted down from the numerous rivets flowing into the Arctic
Sea, and has gradually accumulatcd,jnst as the mud of the Mississippi
River has partially filled the Gulf of Mexico.

Fred and George were anxious to emulate the examples of other navi-
gators and domesticate young seals and'walruses, but they did not. have the

any length of time, as their surroundings were not favorable. A walrus orA DANGEROUS POSITION. 171

seal in the cabin would not have been an agreeable companion, while out-
side it would have been liable to escape, or be eaten up by the dogs.

Next to having one of these creatures, (icorge concluded he would like
the skin of a bear without a bullet-hole in it. Now the way has not been
found for shooting a bear without breaking his skin, and the youth deter-
mined, with the proper authority, to set a trap for one. Permission was
readily given, on condition that the trap should be far enough from the
ship to be out of reach of the dogs. It was thought that a mile and a half
would be a sufficient distance, and the trap was set accordingly.

It was one of the largest bear-traps sold in the San Francisco market,
and required all the strength of two men to press the spring downward
far enough to bring the catch into its place. It was baited with a piece
of seal-meat; the snow and ice around it were arranged to appear as
innocent and undisturbed as possible, and then the trappers returned to
the ship.

The next morning word was brought to George that a bear was in the
trap, and that young gentleman, accompanied by Fred, lost no time in
going to look at, it. Sure enough, a bear had been taken, but. he had also
taken the trap and walked off with it. There was a strong chain, about
two yards long, attached to the trap, and at the end of the chain was a
"grapple," or three-pronged book, like the anchor for a row-boat. They
could see where the chain had been dragged over the ice, and had fre-
quently caught and compelled the bear to stop to disengage it.

They followed up the trail of the chain with no great difficulty; some-
times they lost it for a few minutes, but soon discovered it again through
the marks made by the hook, and also through occasional drops of blood.
About two miles from where the trap had been set they came up to the
bear, who had become badly entangled and was tugging violently at the
chain with his free font. He had been caught by the right fore-foot; evi-
dently he had stepped fully upon the trap, am gave the jaws an excellent
chance for closing in on him.

When they approached him he growled furiously, and pulled harder
than ever in his efforts to escape. Thus pulling, he succeeded in loosening
the chain from the ice, and as soon as he had done so he performed one of
those feats of intelligence for which the polar bear is famous.

Recognizing that the chain was the cause of his frequent detentions, he
stood upright on his hind-feet and gave the confined paw a twirl which
wound the chain around it close to the trap. A foot or more of the chain
hung down, and this he seized in his mouth and then started ofl' over the
ice as fast as his three unenctunbered feet would carry him.
A TRIAL OF PATIENCE.

()ur young friends looked on in astonishment at this manifestation of
sagacity: for at least a minute neither of them spoke or moved.

Fred broke silence by asking George what he would do with the skin
of that bear.

" lletter catch it iiist," was the reply; " and we're evidently a long way
yet from doing so."

" I don't see how he can be taken without making a hole in his skin,"
said Fred: "and unless we're quick about it we shall lose our trap."

They followed as fast as they could, and luckily for them the bear
could not tnake good progress with one leg disabled. But they had a
chase of at least half an hour before coming up to him; he rose to grow]
his defiance at them, and this caused him to drop the chain. so that at his
very next. step forward the hook caught on the ice and held him.

" Never mind the whole skin," said George; " let us finish him as quick
as we can, and unless the holes are too bad we can sew them up."

The trap, with its hook caught in the ice, served the very important
purpose of preventing the hear from running away, and also of rushing on
his assailants. Thus protected from danger, the young sportsmen made
quick work with their rilles at short range, and gave an agreeable addition
to the stock of provisions on the ship.

()n the way back over the ice George repeated a story, which was first
told by Sir Francis M'Clintock, of a native of Western Greenland who was
out one day examining his seal<<uets. He found a seal in one of the nets.
and while steeping on the ice over his prize he received a heavy slap on
the hack. Ile supposed it was from his companion, and paid no attention
to it; a second and harder slap made him leok around, when he found that
instead of his companion it was a grim old bear. The bear took no fur-
ther notice of the man, but proceeded to tear the seal out of the net and
eat it; the native did not stay to see the end of the meal, through fear that
the bear might not be averse to human flesh, and he had no wish to serve
as an ursine piece (1c rcsixtunce.

They met the dog-sledges when about half~way to the ship. Their
movements had been watched from the cross-trees, and as soon as they had
despatched the bear the order had been given for the sledges to start to
bring in the meat. Of course there was no lack of bear-meat as long as the
catch of the morning lasted; before it was gone another hear was taken,
and from that time onward they were fairly supplied with fresh provisions.
There were beats, seals, and walruses in almost regular rotation, though

like it, and in this respect they were far better of? than many arctic voy-
agers who preceded them--thanks to the improved weapons for pntsuing
large game.

Each day the. sun remained below the horizon longer than on the pre-
ceding one, and in a little while the nights were longer than the days.
The decrease continued, and lw-and-by came the time when the sun only
peered above the line of ice for a moment, and then sank below it.
Everybody was on (leek to see it, as they all knew the sun would not re-
appear again for nearly two months. The next day there was a flush of
light on the horizon, and Fred thought he caught a glimpse of the upper
edge of the orb's disc, but according to the Doctor's calculation he was
mistaken.

Even after the sun failed to appear there was a period of light every
day for more than a fortnight. It was the 17th of November when they
had their last view of the sun, and the observations showed that they were
very near the 77th parallel of latitude.

"The farther north you go," said the Doctor to the youths, " the
sooner will the sun disappear in the autumn, and the later will he return
in the spring. For exatnple, when Captain Tyson was wintering on board
the Palm-2's, iu latitude 81deg 36', the sun disappeared October 17th, and was
not visible for one hundred and thirty-five days. The following year,
while he was drifting south on the ice-floe, and was about latitude 70deg,
the sun re-appeared January 19th, after an absence of eiglity'threc days.
110 does not record the day of its disappearance, which must have been
farther to the north, as the iee-lloe was drifting steadily southward."

"The popular idea," said George, "is that they have six months of
day and six months of night at the North-pole every year."

"At the pole itself," replied the Doctor, "the stilt would have but two
motions to the spectator, and the popular idea might not be so far out of
the way. For six months of the year the sun would be moving in a series
of circles in the heavens, and then for six months it. Would make a similar
series of circles below the horizon. There have been interminable dis-
cussions on this subject, and much divergence of opinion, and the only
way to settle the question will be for somebody to go to the pole and
make an obserVation."

"I remember," said I"red,"a classmate of mine at college who was
constantly bringing up a perplexing question for discussion. One of his
theories was that there could not be 'sound' where there was no car to
hear it; and he used to argue that if a tree should fall in a forest a lum-
(h'ed miles from anything with ears no sound would be produced.

"He would argue that question at great length. :md whenever he got
anybody to agree with him he would shift to the other side and have the
discussion over again. Another question he. used to ask was,

"What would be the latitude and longitude of a man at the North-
pole, and his points of compass?

"No matter what answer you made he would dispute its correctness,
and proceed to demonstrate your error. "0 said he did all this talking
in order to make himself ready in debate, and he kept it up so constantly
that we all set him down as a nuisance. We used to hope he would go
to the North-pole and see for himself, and nohody ever wished him to
hurry in coming back."

"But how would we recognize the pole in case we were there?"
George inquired.

"That could be done," was the Doctor's reply, " by means of scientific
instruments, though some astronomers think otherwise. Captain Hall
was confident of reaching the pole when he sailed on his last expedition,
and in reply to the questions on this subject he used to say, 'on reaching
that point called the North--pole the North-star will be directly overhead.
Without an instrument, with merely the eye, a man can define his position
when there. Some astronotnets tell me I will find a difficulty in deter-
mining my position. It will be the easiest thing in the world. Suppose
I arrive at. the North-pole, and the sun has descended. Suppose there is
an island at the North-pole; around it is the sea. I see a star upon the
horizon. If I were to remain a thousand years at the pole, that star will
remain on the horizon without varyingr one iota in height. Then, again,
when I atu at the pole, on the 23d of June, I take the latitude of the sun:
just 23f,>>0 high at one and all hours. Five (lays before the 24th of
June, and five days after, with the finest instruments we have, you cannot
determine one iota of change. Therefore, you will see that it is the easiest
thing in the world to determine when you arrive at the North-pole. The
phenomena displayed there will be deeply interesting, provided there is
land there; and I am satisfied, from the traditions I have learned from
the Eskimos, that I will find land there.'

"Captain IIall had not the slightest doubt that. he would he ahle to
recognize the geographical pole if he once reached it, and other explorers
have been equally certain of doing so. The measurements of the angles
of certain stars with each other, and with the sun and moon. would be
the first necessities, and the position of the Nortlpstar should he care-
fully ohserved. But the North-star would not he directly overhead, as
asserted by Captain Hall, at least not for the astronomer, though it mightA TELEGRAPH Lixs OVER THE ICE. 179

sulliw for the man unprovided with instruments, or ignorant of their
use."

One of the youths asked what was the exact position of the North-star.

"That depends upon the time of the year and the relative positions of
the sun and earth," was the reply. "The polar star is one of the thirty-
six fundamental stars used for observations by astronomers and naviga-
tors, and its position at any time of the year is shown in the "Nautical
Almanac." The old astronomers made long catalogues of the stars.
Ilipparchus, one hundred and thirty years before the Christian Era, and
without any instruments to aid him, composed a catalogue showing the
positions of nearly eleven hundred stars, with their ascension and declen-
sion. Ptolemy, two hundred and sixty-seven years later, made a similar
and larger catalogue, and this was extended by Albatengi, an Arab as-
tronomer, seven hundred and eighty-three years after Ptolemy. Three or
four other (-atzflogues appeared from that time until 1712, when the cata-
logue of Flamsteed, an English astronomer, came out, with an exact loca-
tion of two thousand nine hundred and nineteen stars. Since Flamsteed's
time a good many catalogues have been made, and now we have the posi-
tions of nearly a hundred thousand stars in both hemispheres. But, as I
before said, the astronomers and navigators have settled upon thirty-six
stars which are sufiicient for their purposes; every year the nautical and
astronomical almanacs publish the positions, variations, ascensions, and
longitudes of these stars, so that they are ready for use at any moment.
This number is quite suflicient for the purposes of science all over the
globe, or at any rate to all parts where man has been able to go."

"Suppose you drop stellar science and come to lunch," said the major,
whose mind had a practical turn. Prompt assent was given to his sug-
gestion by a simultaneous movement in the direction of the cabin.

Before the sun went altogether below the horizon for his hibernation,
Fred and George, with the assistance of two of the younger ofiicers of the
Gumbalta, erected a telegraph line between the ships, for convenience of
communication in case of accident during the prolonged night. A com-
plete apparatus for the telephone and telegraph had been brought by both
ships; each had a good supply of the kind of wire used by armies in the
field, and it was arranged so that it could be strung very rapidly on light
poles specially prepared for the purpose. The ships were about a mile
apart, and the line was easily set up by fastening the poles in the tops of
hummocks along the way. Holes were cut in the ice to the depth of three
or four inches, and then each pole was firmly fixed in its place by tamping
the fine ice into the hole and pouring water upon it The telephone was
used in preference to the tclegraph,and it was found that in the dry air
of the arctic winter the insulation was perfect. Occasionally the atmos-
pheric electricity gave them some trouble, aml doubtless if the line had
been a long one, the (litlicultics from this cause would have been great.
The electrical conditions of the atmosphere were dependent on the
aurora; when the latter was line there was a great deal of disturbance,
and when there was no aurora there was rarely any electricity perceptible.
The Doctor said this was the case in all parts of the world, and established
beyond question the cause of the aurora. Long before the invention of

the telegraph it had been attributed to electrical causes by scientific men;
this idea had been ridiculed by many, but since the spread of the wires
over the globe, and the observations in consequence, all opposition to it had
ceased.

Sometimes for days together there was no aurora, and then again it
would be almost continuous for a week or more. Naturally our young
friends desired to investigate this phenomenon, and asked the Doctor
about it.

" I am not an authority on the aurora borealis, or northern lights," was
his reply, "and can only giro you what others hare said on the subject.TnE AURORA BOREALIS. 181

For centuries it has been studied by scientific men, and there is no longer
any doubt that it comes from electricity."

"I suppose it is the electric light passing through the air," said one
of the youths. " It goes irregularly, and makes the waves and flashes that
we see."

"According to Professor Loomis and others you are wrong," replied
the Doctor. "The professor says that. the light is rarely within forty-five
miles of the eartluand usually is from one hundred to live hundred miles
from it; consequently it is beyond our atmosphere, or only touches the
most rarefied part. of it. He describes one aurora that filled all the space
above the earth, beginning at forty-five miles distance and ending at. five
hundred miles."

" Ilow do they find that out 2"

"By observing the points from which an aurora is visible at the same
time. These observations, when carefully noted and the result computed,
will show the height and extent of the aurora. For example, the display
of August 28, 1859, was observed simultaneously at a great many points;
calculations showed that it was everywhere forty-six miles from the earth,
and it extended to a height of five hundred and thirty-four miles. The
luminous beams of light in this aurora were five hundred miles long, and
from five to fifty miles in diameter. Other auroras have been measured
in the same way, and the average height assigned to them is four hundred
and fifty miles."

"But I've seen the aurora behind the hills at home," said Fred," and
even here we see it close to the horizon."

"Yes," replied the Doctor, "and you see the sun on the horizon, or set-
ting or rising behind the hills. But do you suppose it is any nearer the
earth for that reason than when it is high in the heavens i"

Fred admitted that his argument was fallacions, and that the appear
ance of the aurora near the earth was in appearance only. The Doctor
explained, however, that sometimes on rare occasions the aurora might_
come within a few miles of the earth, but thus far no observer had ever
discovered it within the highest range of the clouds.

"The farther north you go," said Dr. Tonner, " the more brilliant are
the auroras, at least in the Western Hemisphere. The phenomena prevail
more in America than in Northern Europe and Asia; they cover a large
area of the heavens, but seem to be more numerous in the region of the
magnetic pole than anywhere else. In the Southern Hemispheie there is
a similar display known as the aurora australis.

"As to their electrical origin we have other proofs than the elfect on
the magnetic needle and the telegraph wires. The auroral flashes are the
same as those of a spark of electricity sent through rarefied air or through

a vacuum. The fluorescence of the electric light is repeated in the aurora,
and also--"

"I beg pardon for interrupting," said George," but what is meant by
fluorescence '5"

"There are certain substances," was the rcply,"that seem perfectly
transparent when seen in the solar light, but if you illuminc them with anTHE USES or ELI-:C'rmcrrr. 183

electric spark they appear to be self-luminous. When these substances are
illumined by the auroral light they present the same appearance as though
charged from an electrical machine. This property is called fluorescence.

"Electricity develops heat," continued the Doctor, "when it passes
through poor conductors, like wood and paper. In several instances the
auroral influence has set file to these substances, and the experiment has
been made so often as to be well known to all scientists. In fact, all the
effects of electricity have been obtained from the aurora--such as working
telegraph instruments, making sparks of light, giving shocks to the animal
system, and developing magnetism in soft iron."

" But where does this electricity come from '4" inquired one of the lis-
teners. "There nmst be a vast storehouse or factory for it somewhere."

" That is yet a counmlrnm," the Doctor answered. " Some have sup-
posed that the earth becomes charged with electricity to such a degree that
it cannot: longer retain it; the surplus is thrown off, and it is the discharge
of this electricity that makes the aurora. It has been observed that the
prevalence of auroras is in exact proportion to the presence or absence of
spots on the sun; when there are many spots there are mnnerons anrorms,
and when the sun is
free of spots there are
few or none of them.
Then, too, the influence
of the positions of other
planets has been noted,
and the whole subject
is full of mysteries and
speculations."

" "'0 are getting

George, " or rather we

"Yes," responded Fred, "babies shall be taken from the nursery and

food. When the world is filled with giants nourished from the aurora,

And with this cautious suggestion the conveisation was changed to a
more commonplace topic.

"UAMBETTA" ON FIRE.

IPORTUXE famred our friends in wind and weather. The beginning
of the arctic winter was a period of intense cold, but unaccompanied
by winds; consequently the ice formed to a great depth, and was perfectly
solid [or many miles around. For two or three weeks after they entered
the ice, and before it attained its winter thickness, there were frequent
alarms that the floes were crushing and grinding together; but before the
beginning of December there was little fear on this account. Holes were
drilled in many places within a mile or more of the ships, for the purpose
of ascertaining the thickness of the ice; in no place was it less than thirty
feet, and in several localities it measured nearly forty. Fred thought there
was not the least danger of breaking through, and he regretted greatly that
the surface was not. smooth enough for skating, even if the intense cold
would render that amusement possible.

(.)l,-servatories were established a little distance from the ship, and on
each side of it, in order to keep a record of the cold. At each observatory
there was a thermometer, graduated to tenths of a degree, and an anemom-
eter by which the direction and velocity of the wind could be noted. Both
observatories were visited every four hours, and this duty was divided be-
tween the major and the Doctor--the former assisted by George and the
latter b_v Fred. A lantern of the '* bull's-eve" pattern was carried by the
observer on his round, and the rays of this lantern, projected on the scale
of the tlan'mometer, enabled him to read it without approaching near
enough to affect the instrument by his presence. It was Not. an easy mat-
ter to make entries in a notebook when clad in heavy furs, and with the
hands encased in mittens, and Fred set his wits to work to devise a more
convenient. mode of making his records.

Taking' an alpenstork, or ice-staff, be marked upon it the degrees which
were likely to comprise all the variations of the thermometer, and also a
single degree divided into tenths. Then be arranged sliding rings or
hoops which could move freely up or down the staff, but were held firmly
in place by means of little knobs on the inside, lwaasiiig through a slot in
the wood. Similar rings were arranged for the points of compass and the
velocity of the wind, and by means of these rings the whole record of a
visit to one of the observatories could be taken. A staff was arranged for
each observatory, but it was found rather burdensome to carry two of these
aids to the memory, and they settled down upon one. For the thermomet-
rical readings at third ring was added, to show the variation between the

two instruments, which rarely exceeded one or two tenths of a degree.
while the record of the anemometer was made on a shorter staff, that vas
carried at the waist like a policeman's club. The staff, or alpenstock, was
of material assistance in going over the ice in the arctic darkness, and it
might serve as a weapon of defence, better than nothing at all, in case of
interference by a bear.

"In case you meet a bear," said the Doctor, "and he shows no disposi-
tion to retreat, your best plan will be to hold your alpeustock like a spear,)IELTING sxow TO OBTAIN WATER. 187

and let him come on. Many a bear has rushed to his death in this way.
It requires a good deal of nerve to meet him with no better weapon than
this, and I sincerely hope the emergency may never occur.

" It is one of the favorite methods of hunting the bear in Norway;
the principal danger arises frolu the ability of the animal to turn the spear
aside, which he can (10 with a single blow of his tremendous paw. The
Norwegian hunter generally manages to get him so enraged that he is
wholly occupied with rushing upon his intended victim, regardless of the
consequences."

Fresh water for the use of the ship's company was obtained by melting
snow, and great care was exercised to prevent its mingling with the salt
of the ice. Whenever there was a fresh fall of snow all hands were set
to work to pile it up for future use, and for this purpose all that gathered
on the roof of the deck~honse and away from the tloe-ice was preserved.
Snow in the arctic regions is generally like fine sand; the intense cold
causes the moisture to cougeal in the smallest particles, and not in the
form in which we usually find it in the Northern States. " Goose-feather
snow " is unusual in the Arc-
tic Circle, except in the sum-
mer months.

The uses of steam on
board the Vivian were vari-
ous. The cabin and the quar-
ters of the men were warmed
by it, the ship having been
fitted with steam-pipes and
radiators for this purpose.
When it had performed this
work, it escaped into a large >>
tuh that was always kept {
full of snow to be melted, as
already mentioned; another

occasionally turned, was used
for softening the food of the dogs, and there is no doubt that the hrutes
would have passed a vote of thanks to the engineer of the Vivian if the
subject had been brought to their compreheusion. The last of the wal-
ruses which were taken before the ice closed for the winter were piled
up near the ship, and from time to time huge chunks were chopped out
with axes and taken to the softening tub for the dogs. In its frozen
condition, and with the skin perfectly solid, it was safe from their attacks.
A frozen walrus hide is about as easy of penetration as a plate of iron.
and the dogs never attempted to gnaw it; but they kept a careful watch
over the deposit, and whenever the men went to chop out a supply of
food for them, they were in a state of great impatience until it was served.

Visits were frequently exchanged between the Vivian and (lambella.
and the telephone was in daily use. As the end of December approached,
preparations were made for celebrating that event, and also for a festivity
on Newxyear's Day. It. was arranged that Captain Girard and some of
his otlicets would eat their Christmas dinner on the l'irz'an, and that they
should give a return eutertaimuent on New-year's Eve.

In spite of the disadvantages of the surroundings, Fred and George
determined to have a Christmas-tree, and readily obtained the permission
of Commander Bronson to get it up. Trees were not to be found near
their residence, and the forest was too far off to be invaded. George
thought the best trees they could get would be the cross--trees; but these
were unhappily too high in air for their purpose. They managed to
improvise a tree by providing limbs for a small log recently found on the
ice and brought: to the ship by one of the hunting parties. lloles were
bored in the log for the insertion of sticks which served as limbs; the ends
of the sticks were festooued with strips of bear and seal skin, together
with bits of canvas and kindred thiuSS. George had prepared some
oakum from old rope, which would have decorated the tree very well, but
he was restrained by Captain Jones from using such inflannnable mate-
rial. The captaiu had a wholesome and proper dread of tire, and was not
slow to see the risk they would run in trimming their Christmas-tree
with oakmn pickings; hence the less dangerous substances, although less
picturesque.

The number of candles was limited to twelve, and as a matter of preemi-
tion a man was stationed by the tree with a bucket of water, to be thrown
over it; in case of fire. Presents were hung to the limbs or piled at the
foot of the tree, which was set in a thick plank at; the end of the Virian'x
cabin. ivory-body received something, and to make the uccasiou as much
as possible like a Christmas at home, a box of goods originally intended
for trading purposes among the Indians was opened and distributed.
Gaudy bamlkerchiefs were received by several of the men, and sheath-
knives, pocket-mirrors, combs, and kindred things by others. Christmas
cards were sent to Commander ironson, Major Clapp, and the Doctor,
while Captain Jones was made happy with a picture of part of the upper
rigging of a ship with the crew's-nest. On the sails of the ship were in-CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. 189

having frequently remarked that they
hoped to come upon fresh traces of the
work of that unfortunate navigator of
the arctic regions.

Jack and his fellow-musicians play-
ed their liveliest ails as the curtain was
removed from the tree, and George, in
the character of Santa Claus, distributed
the gifts. All the oflicers of the Vii:-
fan, with the exception of the one in
charge of the deck, were present at the unveiling of the tree; the men
were admitted in groups of four to receive what the youths had prepared
for them. At four o'clock the ceremonies ended, and then the cabin
was cleared, as the guests from the (;llllllll'l/It were (iue an hour later.

pick.

from the captain the musicians were slipped into their places so quietly
that the guests did not see them.

"What a pity it is," said Captain Gira1d,"that we haxc no forest here,
and cannot have an arbI-e dc Noel, what you call ' Christmas- tree. ' "

" Yes," replied Commander B1ouson, " but we can't expect the comforts
of the civilized world while shut 11p hole in the ice."

George and Fwd had carelessly left their seats a moment before, and
waited a sign from their chief. As the latter finished his response to the
French captain he nodded.

Down came the curtain, the candles were lighted in a few seconds, the
music struck 11p a lively air, and to the astonishment of the visitors they
had an arbre de Noel before them !

The Frenchmen rose from their seats and gave a ringing plaudit for
the Christmas-tree, which had taken them so completely by surprise. Then
the cards that had been prepared for them were handed around; each card
bore the postmark of Paris only one day before, and consequently the en-
thusiasm of the recipients increased.

Then there were songs in French and songs in English, and songs in
both languages at once. One of the Frenchmen recited some re1ses of
Beranger, and another gave a selection from one of the stately poems of
Victor Hugo. The Christmas punch was brought, in by the steward, and
as it was placed on the table, George recited a portion of the lines of Dr.
Holmes, " 0n Lending a Punch-bowl." He began with the stanza,

""l'wne on a dreary winter's ere, the night was closing dim,
"'hen old Miles Standish took the bowl and filled it to the brim.
The little captain stood and stirred the posse! with his swan],
And all his sturdy Inen-at-arms were ranged around the board."

In this way the Christmas in the Arctic Ocean was prolonged to a
late hour. When the officers of the Gumbctla returned to the ship it re-
quired several minutes to muster the sailors who had accompanied them;
the Christmas in the forccastlo had been quite as jolly as the one in the
cabin, and the men of two nations were in no hurry to separate.

For another week things went on quietly enough, and then came the
festivity 011 board the Gambetta. All who had taken part in the enter-
tainment of the ofliccrs of the French ship were invited to dinner, and it
was announced that there would be a musical entertainment afterwards,
for which Captain Jones was requested to grant leave to as many of his
crew as could be spared from duty.

The dinner must have taxed the genius of the steward and cook of the_\'E\\'-\'E.-\R'S DAY ox Tin-2 "GAMBETTA." 191

Gambelta; under the circumstances it was a gastronomic surprise, and
evoked the admiration of all the guests. Out of the materials at their com-
mand they had made a dinner which would do honor to Vefour or the Utgfe
[tic/w, and so neatly had they disguised the familiar bear and seal that no-
body could gueSS at their character. Commander Bronson remarked that

 

"nu: 1.1m>>: cal-nus . . . . s'rmnxn 't'IIE mm: mm ms swonn."

if good dinners could take an explorer to the pole, the French would have
discovered it long ago.

The entertainment was given in the house on deck, as there was not
room for it anywhere below. The (leek-house was lighted with lanterns
and festuoued with flags, and there was an attempt, to represent trees by
means of green cloth stretched over fantastic frames. Two of the oflicels
of the Gal/16d!" were quite skilful with the pencil and brush, and had pre-
pared some drawings on a large scale, which were fastened to the walls
wherever the light was best. They represented home scenes of the New
Year, and absorbed the attention of the visitors for several minutes.

Of course it was impossible to heat the deck-house like the cabin below,
and therefore the whole party donned its furs befole going there. Seats
had been placed for entertainers and guests in front of the stage, which
consisted of a raised platform close to the main-mast; the rest of the space
was devoted to "standing-room only" for the crews of the two ships.

Inasmuch as only a few of the visitors understood French, and there-
fore dialogue would be tedious, the entertainment was a musical one; it
consisted of a light Operetta ("U/L Jour de Fete") of one act and four
characters, the latter played by three of the junior oflicers and one of the
younger sailors. The sailor was made up as a girl, whose mother was per-
sonated by one of the ofliceis; considering all the disadvantages of the sit-
uation, the "make-up" was quite successful. The feminine costume was
donned outside a suit of fur; but the latter had been made of squirrel-skin
and fitted closely, so that it did not add to the stoutness of the wearers to
any disagreeable extent. The masculine costumes were also filled with
furs, and as their wearers were naturally of goodly size the efiect was
ludicrous; but since the operetta was a comic one, anything that added
to the hilarity was 'not objectionable.

The thermometer was about ten degrees below zero, Fahrenheit, in the
temporary theatre, and the breath of the audience rose like a cloud of
steam. Frost gathered on the lips of the performers, and several times it
choked their utterance; the girl in the play carried a fan, but she had
little use for it, and the same was the case with the parasol in her mother's
hands. Mother and daughter kissed once in the course of the perform-
ance, and their lips ran a narrow risk of being frozen together. The
audience applauded freely, perhaps from a desire to keep warm, and alto-
gether the performance went off merrily. The quartette of voices was by
no means a bad one, and our friends of the Vivian felt themselves more
than repaid for their eliorts at Christmas.

The operctta was soon over, and then followed a dance. There was
no fear of being overheated, and everybody exercised to the full ability of
his limbs. It was so late that we dare not tell the hour when the boat-
swain called " Vivians away!" and the visitors returned to their ship.

A week later the ofiiceis and part of the crew of the Gambetta were
invited to an entertainment on board the Vivian. They accepted, and
came promptly to find the deck-house decorated and lighted as their own

the temperature had made the place quite comfortable. The entertain-
ment comprised a minstrel performance, in which our young friends had a
prominent part and were assisted by the vocal and instrumental musicians
of the crew. Then two of the sailois who had been trained to aerobatic

performances amused the company by turning smnersaults, balancing can-
non-shot on their arms and heads, and going through other evolutions pe-
culiar to the circus. A joke arranged by Fred was perpetrated at the
close of the "ground and lofty tumbling" which produced a momentary
panic. and then set everybody in a roar of laughter.

Part of the performance consisted in handling a fifty-six pound weight
as though it were the mercst trifle; and to prove that there was no decep-

13
tion, the weight was passed around in the audience before and after being
handled by the acrobat.

When he was through with the weight, the performer allowed it to fall
on the stage with a heavy thud, close to the screen at one side; then he
threw a somersault, while his companion essayed certain tricks with the
cannon-ball. Attention being thus drawn from the fifty-six pound weight.
it was skilfully removed and a pastelmard imitation took its place.

Then the performer picked up the weight again and tied a small rope
to it; by means of the rope he whirled it in the air precisely as though it
had been a solid mass of iron; then, as if by accident, it slipped from his

hand and went flying over the audience. Heads were "ducked," and
there was a sigh of alarm from several months; the sigh was changed to
laughter when the weight was returned to its place by means of the rope,
in which a strip of India-rubber had been concealed. Nobody was hurt
except by the expansion of ribs, produced by excessive mirth.

Then George gave a short exhibition of a Punch and Judy show. II is
imitation of the time~honored amusement of London children was admira-
ble, and as a part of it was given in French, he secured the earnest ap-
plause of all the visitors. Then there was a dance, and after two hours of
fun the audience dispersed.THE "antenna" ON FIRE. 195

The next week there was a return entertainment on the Gambefla, and
every week during their hibernation when the weather permitted, and as
long as comnmuiwtion was feasible over the ice, there was something
amusing on one of the ships. There was a good-natured rivalry between
them,aud each tried to have something that would interest the other; it
was not easy to do this when the diiliculties of language were to be con-
sidered, and the success of the enterprise showed a great deal of ingenuity
on the part of all concerned. Music, jugglery, and pantomime were the
principal features of the performances, and to these may be added displays
of the magic lantern and Occasional experiments in chemistry.

One night, while the people of the Vivian were entertaining their
friends from the Gum/wile, there was a sudden interruption.

The bell of the telephone sounded, and the cabin steward called Fred
to see what was wanted. As soon as he had placed his ear to the instru-
ment he heard the appalling words,

"Le (lambda: est (an/int ."'--(" The Game/21h: is on fire i")

Fred ran to Commander Bronson with the news, and the latter imme-
diately informed his visitors. Of course the performance closed at once,
the men went to their quartets, and Captain Girard and his oflieeis and
crew started with all speed for their ship. Commander Bronson tendered
the services of his men, and at once prepared to follow to the endangeied
veSSel.

Everything was done in order, and without any excitement whatever.
There was excellent discipline on board both the ships, and every man fell
at once into his place. The relief party included Commander Bronson,
the first officer of the Vivian, two petty ofliceis, Dr. Tonner and George,
together with ten men from the crew. They followed closely on the steps
of the Gambrlta's men, and were at the side of that ship not more than a
couple of minutes behind them. The men brought axes and fire-buckets
from the Viv-fun, and Dr. Tonner was provided with whatever might be
needed for the relief of the men of either crew who should be overcome
by the smoke or tlame, or exhausted in the efforts of controlling the fire.

Smoke was pouring from the ventilating shaft in the top of the deck-
house, and as they entered the door-way leading from the gang-plank into
the covered space on deck, the cloud was of almost stifling thickness. Cap-
tain (iirard and his party were already below.

The deck was in charge of a petty oflicer and one man, all the rest be
ing below endeavoring to suppress the conllagration. Commander iron-
sou sent his Compliments to Captain (iirard, and asked if he and his men
could be of service; the answer was returned that they could do nothing
below for the moment. as the (Iconlu'tht's crew was lilling all the working,1r
Space. As a matter of precaution it was desirable to remove the stores
that were kept always ready in the deck'house, and the Vivian's party pro-
ceeded at once to perform this service.

Boxes aml barrels were thrown down the gang-plank by some of the
men, while the othels slid them along the ice to a place of safety, in case
the ship should be burned. The work was performed with grmt rapidity,
and in a quarter of an hour the deck was pretty well cleared. The pack-
:wes had been previously arranged in such a manner that they could be
hastily removed in case of necessity. The same precaution was observed
on the Vivian, and in thus acting, the commanders were only following the
example of their predecefiors in arctic exploration.

As the last of the packages was deposited on the ice, word was brought
from below that the fire was under control and would shortly be ex-
tinguished. In another quarter of an hour the danger was over, and Cap-
tain (lirard invited Commander Bronson and his oilicets to join him in the
cabin. With the politeness of his nation he apologized for having kept
them waiting on deck, and explained that he had been extremely occupied
since his return from the delightful entertainment on the Vivian.

Then he told the story of the tire, and the narration fell upon interested
ears.

The watch below were in their banks, having laid aside their furs on
descending; from the deck, as was their invariable custom, and donned
their ordinary clothing. All were asleep except two; one of the waking
ones thought he detected the smell of smoke, and after a few minutes of
hesitation mentioned it to the other. The latter was of the same mind:
and while one roused their companions, the other went to report the (lis-
covery to the oflicer on duty. Of course the matter was iunnediately in-
vestigated.

The smoke was found to be issuing from a store-room just forward of
the men's quarters; the partition was torn away to gain an entrance to
the store-room, which was so densely filled with smoke that the men who
entered it were nearly stifled. . ty creeping close to the (leek and holding'
a sponge to his nose, one of the officets found the source of the smoke,
which was below.

There was no hatch in the immediate vicinity, and so a hole was cut
in the deck for the admission of water. By this time a hose was ready
from the donkey-engine, and a stream was directed to the locality of the
fire; buckets were brought into requisition, and the filst supply of water
was obtained from a tank which was kept constantly full, for use in justHOW THE FIRE nuts sunburn). 197

such an emergency as this. Then a hose was passed outside to draw
water from a hole in the ice; this hole was opened daily, partly in order
to take soundings, and partly to have a supply of water in case of fire,
since only a limited amount could be kept on board. Of course it froze
over almost as soon as it was opened, but it was not a serious matter to
drill it clear again. There was one man in each watch whose duty it was
to open this hole wheneVer an alarm of fire was given; in the present
instance the man on duty was promptly at his post, so that the water-sup-
ply was read y the moment the hose was brought outside.

 

A HRH OS SIIH'BOJKI}.

The fire had not gained much head-way, and when Captain Girard
reached the (l'llflflbd/ltt on his return from the Viv/rm the water was pour-
ing steadily into the hold and sululuing the smoke. As soon as it was
thought safe to do so, one of the officers descended, having taken the pre-
caution to tie a sponge in front of his nose and month to prevent inhaling
the smoke. Carrying the end of the hose. he directed it against the tire
wherever it was visible, and in a little while it was extinguished. The
Gambclta was saved, and her crew were spared the horror of being driven
from their home in the middle of an arctic night to seek shelter with
their American friends.

Of comse the extent of the damage could only be ascertained by a
thorough investigation, and this could not be made until the hold was free
from smoke. A careful watch was kept to see that the fire did not: break
out afresh, and in the course of some twenty hours or more it was. an-
nounced that all the smoke had disappeared. The party from the Viv/(m
returned to their ship at the end of their interview with Captain (lirard;
George had already told Fred, by means of the telephone, that the fire
had been subdued, and when Commander Bronson and his companions
reached the Vivian's side, they were greeted with three cheers by the
assembled officers and crew.

The origin of the fire was a good deal of a mystery, but it was finally
attributed to the spontaneous combustion of some articles stored in the
fore-hold. It could be accounted for in no other way, as there was no
means of reaching,r the spot with a spark from outside, and no lamp or
candle had been carried there for some time. If it had been in the vicin-
ity of the donkey-engine, it might have been caused by the heating of the
pipes and the charriug of the timbeis, as in the case of the Rodgers in
the winter of 1881; but from the position of the engine this was not pos-
sible. Some of the French sailois were supeistitious, and thought the fire
originated from supernatural causes; one of them solemnly declared that
it must have been the work of the Ice-king, who was angry at the invasion
of his dominions. Sailms of all nations have many supeistitions, and the
French mariner is not behind his brother navigator in this respect.

"It is the peculiarity of tire," said Commander Bronson," that it do-
stroys the evidence of its origin. For this reason the cause of a tire is
frequently a mystery, and it will always be so until the habits of conlla-
grations are changed."

A little while after the return from the Gambvtta everybody who was
not required for (lnty was safely in bed. There was not much sleep, how-
ever, as most of the company had dreams of tire and the perils that ac-
company it. Fred was the victim of a nightmare, in which he imagined
the Vivian to be on tire and her crew escaping to the ice. lIe waked
with a scream that startled his companions; he apologized for disturbing
them, but explained that he was in the act of carrying the hose to the
fore-hatch, where the tire was burning fiercely, when he slipped on the
ladder and went tumbling headlong below. Naturally enough he jumped
for safety, and found himself outside his bank, and sitting on the cold
floor of the cabin.ARRANGING THE FIRE-WATCH. 199

At the very outset of the voyage the fire-watch on the Vivian was
carefully arranged, and every possible precaution: taken against the de-
struction of the ship by fire. To ensure the proper training of the crew,
after the accident on the Gambclta, alarms were given at frequent inter-
vals; every man ran to his post of duty at these alarms, and it was felt
that a serious fire could not occur on the Vivian except under the most
extraordinary circumstances.

MATEUR theatricals and musical entertainments were not by any
means the sole anmsements of the parties on the Vin/m). and Gem.-
bctta. In arctic hibernation it is necessary to have both mind and body
occupied, and only by doing so can disease be kept from making,r its ravages
among the crew. The prolonged darkness has a depressing effect on the
mental oraanization, and not infrequently the results are disastrous. This
is particularly the case with the men in the forecastle, as the otlicers are
more or 10$~ occupied with scientific observations and the care of the ship.
The crew have little regular work to do, and consequently are liable to
become despondent, quarrelsome, and insnbordinate, and cases of insanity
are not unconnnon. To prevent such a calamity, a prudent commander
will devise employments and amusements for the men; the ofiicers of the
Vivian and (iamlmlta had a clear understanding on this point, and en-
couraged in every way the occasional interchanges of courtesies at the
entertainments we have described.

On each ship schools were organized for the instruction of the sailors,
and though the proposi on was not favorably received at first, the men
soon entered cnthusi cally into the plans for their mental improvement.
Fred and George were the managers of the schools on the Viv/rm; they
received a good deal of assistance from the Doctor and the major. together
with all the other oflicers of the ship. They had classes in mathematics.
geography, astronomy, and navigation, and once a week there was a lecture
by one of the ollicers in the house on dock. The lectures covered a variety
of topics, and the programme which was prepared by the youths announced
that it was the celebrated " North-star Cotnse: to be delivered in Vivian
Ilall, corner of Bear Street and Walrus Avenue. Admission free. IIoldeIs
of tickets requested not to appear in evening dress."

The lecturing was performed under disadvantages, as both speakets
and audience were clad in furs, and their breath often tilled the enclosedWINTER srort'rs 1x THE ARCTIC OCEAN. 201

space like a cloml of steam. Some of the lectures were original, but as
the season went. on the speakers helped themselves to whatever rrraterial
they had on lraml. Dr. Tomrcrgave an amusing accotrnt of his experiences
among the lndiarrs of Arizona, and subsequently made a decided hit with
an abridgruent of John l'lrenix's Lectures on .>>'\stronomy. Major Clapp
was eloquent over the mysteries of Ichthyology, and gave a good many
facts about the habits of the blue-lish, and other products of the sea-shore,
in the vicinity of New York, brrt he was mortified to find that the sailors
laughed nrore heartily at his reading of Artemus "'ard's "Sixty Minutes
in Africa." George and Fred tried their hands at lecturing, atrd they also
gave readings and recitations whenever the occasion required. They had
a liberal repertoire, and altogether the season may be said to have passed
off brilliantly. Pri es were given in the Schools for the pupils who made
the greatest progress, and there was not a sailor in the ship who did not
add nraterially to his stock of knowledge before the winter was over.

The physical amusements included skating, sliding, and otlre' athletic
exercise on the ice. "'lreu the weather perrrritted, the men indulged in
the construction of snow forts and monrmrents, and some of them carved
grotesque figures out of the never-ending supply of material under their
feet and arorurd them. As the sun retrrrned, and the ships were retained in
their icy prison. the short period of daylight was frequently utilized by giv-
in;r half the crew of each ship liberty on the ice, and stimulating them to
get up international matches of various kinds. They had running races in
different forms--sometimes on the roads they had laid out, and at others
over the roughest ice that corrld be found. The "tug-of-war," where an
eqrral nrrmber from each ship pulled at. a rope, was one of their favorite
sports; the Americans were most frequently the victors at this game, but.
when it came to running on a smooth road they were usually left helrirrd
by the more agile Frenchmen.

Fred announced one day that no society could be complete without a
newspaper; everybody shared his opinion, and the result was that the
"Arctic Journal Publishing Company" was organized, with lirrrited capi-
tal and liability, but unlimited ability, as the prospectus described it.
Fred was appointed editor. nrrder the restriction of not being allowed to
suppress anything, but to give every correspondent the fullest liberty to
' what he pleased. In the prospectus he announced that all comrmmi-
cations would be used and not paid for, and that advertisers must invariably
pay in advance. The paper was issued fortnightly, or rather it was read
from manuscript by the editor and his assistant. George. It was rrrade up
of comments on the occurrences of the day, speculation on the prospect
of reaching the pole, social, political, and scientific intelligence, together
with jokes and advertisements. The paper was a pleasant diversion to all
on board the Via-27ml, and after the first number appeared a similar pub-
lication was started on the (Minor/ta.

In his first issue the editor of the Arctic Journal paid a handsome
tribute to the memory of his predecessols in this field of literary work.
He said that the first paper of the kind was called the Winter Chronicle,
or [/w North Georgian Gazette, and was edited by Captain Sabine on
board the IIcha, in Parry's second expedition to the polar seas. It was
in manuscript, like the Arctic Journal, and appeared every Monday during
the five winter months of 1820: the tiist number is still in existence, and
contains a colunm of miscellanies, including a list of "Arctic Miseries."
Among them is the following: "To go out in the morning for an airing,
and when setting foot out of the vessel to find a frozen bath in the cook's
hut. To go out, with a piece of soft bread in your pocket, and when you
feel hungry to find it so hardened by the frost that, instead of breaking
under the teeth, it is rather they that are broken. To give yourself up to
deep and useful meditations when out on a walk, and then to be suddenly
awakened from your perplexities by the hug of a bear."

George endeavored to rival Fred's efiorts hy composing a comedy for
performance by the company of the Vivian. It was voted that he might
imitate the example of other and more gifted dramatic authors by making
"adaptations" from the French without credit. He innnediately opened
negotiations with one of the younger officers of the Gambetta, with the
result that he was liberally supplied with French comedies from which he
might steal with a clear conscience. In less than a week he completed his
comedy and submitted it to himself; as he was one of the managers of the
theatre, it was entirely proper that. he should examine his own work, and
it is hardly necessary to add that the play was promptly accepted, and un.
dcrlined for production.

The play was entitled " Parry and Paris; or, The Search for the Pole."
"'heu Captain Parry was in the Arctic Circle, endeavor-ing to get to the
North-pole, he received a despatch from his government offering him an
important position as soon as he reached home. It seems that the Russian
Government was anxious to capture one Carolus Slyfoxsky, a Polish ref-
ugee, who was giving them a great deal of trouble, and as the English
navigator had got, nearer the arctic pole than anybody else, they wanted
him to try his skill on this Pole from \Valsaw. The first act was supposed
to occur on board the Ila-la, in her winter quarters, the second was located
in Paris, and the third in I'arry's last journey in the arctic regions, whereDRAMATIC CRITICISM. 203

he was seeking the North-pole with Slyfoxsky as one of his crew. As sug-
gested by the title, the play was largely made up of puns, and the young
author felt confident of success

Tickets were freely distributed-for the first night, and in this respect
the affair was not unlike an initial performance in Paris or New York.
There was not the array of hair-
less heads in the front rows
which one sees at a fiist night
in New York, and as there was
only one editor present, he was
unable to congregate in the lob-
by, and discuss the points of
the play with his fellow-critics.
Fred had received a ticket for
a " box," but in consequence of
the distance from home he was
unaccompanied by the ladies of
his family; perhaps it was just
as well. since his ticket only on-
titled him to an empty candle-
box that was utilized as a seat.
Chairs were scarce on board the
Vivian, and everything which V

brought into use.

In order that Fred might be entirely without bias in writing his criti-
cism of the play, George invited the young editor to supper immediately
after the performance. The supper was the best that the Delmouico of
the Vivian could get up, and when it was over, Fred was clearly of opinion
that the author of " Parry and Paris" was the most gifted dramatist of
the age. " The play that shall move the world to laughter and tears, and
to all the emotions ever found in the human heart or in 'Webster's Una-
bridged Dictionary,' will come from his talented pen. ' Parry and l'aris'
gives promise of future greatness; it contains pasages surpassing those of
'Richelieu' and 'The Lady of Lyons,' and there are scenes and situations
such as Shakspeare never incorporated in his plays; and we will add that
Shakspeare never gave such a supper to the editor after the play was over,
and we have yet to learn of mince-pies made of pemmican, and steaks of
seal-meat on toast."

George's play was repeated for the benefit of the officers of the Gam--
belle, and the example of the young dramatist was followed by the gentle-
man who had furnished him with part of the material for "Parry and
Paris." The American play was given once on board the Gumbetm, while
the French one was transferred, "for one night.
only," to the boards of the l'iw'rm. In this way
everybody had an opportunity of seeing both
productions, and it was a noticeable fact that
there was a full attendance on all Occasions, and
nobody went out between the acts. In the mat-
ter of scenery both ships were sadly deficient,
and there was a placard in front of the stage
requesting the audience to imagine a forest, a
town, or an ice-field, according to the conditions
of the play.

So the winter passed away. On and on they
drifted,eastward and northward; sometimes they mumps sm'roxsxy.
moved so slowly that it was diflicnlt to discover
any movement at all, and at other times their progress was from twenty
to thirty miles a day. The cold at times was intense; the thermometer
fell to --7-Ldeg Fahrenheit on several occasions, and
once it reached --Sldeg, or a lmndred and thirteen
degrees below the freezing-point of fresh water.
Ordinarily the winter temperature was from ten to
twenty degrees below zero; our friends soon be-
came accustomed to these figures, but when the
lowest points of the scale were reached they were
very cautious about exposing themselves to the
weather. They were all agreed on one point, that
a temperature of fifty degrees below zero, with the
air perfectly still, is easier to endure than twelve
or fifteen degrees below zero with the wind blew-
ing. At such times nobody ventured out except
on urgent duty, and all communication between
the ships ceased except through the telephone.

Fred and George made note of the curious ef-

exposed to the cold became solid as stone, and could only be cut with a
hatchet, and as for beef, it resembled red granite. The moisture in the
cans of preserved meat and vegetables caused them to become a solid mass,
from which the tin was chopped, leaving the contents like a section from
a geological specimen. If it was desired to
soften the contents before opening the can,
it was placed in the steam-box and gradual-
ly thawed into a condition of malleability.
Those articles suffered least that had the
smallest amount of moisture in them, as
there was less to be frown. Hard-tack, or

ing outside than fresh bread. and dried beef
was preferable to the canned article.

their expeditions over the ice, the supply of

eongeal was the alcohol used for making
coffee and tea, or melting snow in order to procure water. I'eunuicau and
hard bread are the best articles of food for a slcdging party in severe
weather, . s they contain little moisture, and will yield more readily than
other substances to the efforts of the hungry man to devour them. In the
severest weather the wind on the face has the same feeling as would be
produced by the blows of a small whip, and the victim feels as though the
flesh were being peeled off in shreds. This sensation is followed by numb-
ness, and then by the blood leaving the exposed places; then the skin be-
comes blue, which is an indication that freezing is about to commence.
If the face turns white it is a sure sign that it is frozen, and unless it is
violently rubbed with snow, to bring the blood back again, the consequences
are disastrous.

The face cannot be kept entirely covered, as the cougelatiou of the
breath on the fans that surround it will speedily cause the formation of a
mass of ice. Inexperienced travellers who have covered their faces with
wrappers and mufflers are sometimes unable to remove them, as they be-
come converted into muzzles and collars as. hard and stiff as iron; the best
way of avoiding trouble, and at the same time to protect the face, is to
hold the hood with one hand, allowing the breath to pass outside, and
leaving a narrow opening for the eyes to see the way. In the severest
weather it is next to impossible to move at all; and if a storm arises
the most prudent course is to wait in the best attainable shelter until it
ceases.

With every storm there were fears that the ice'fields might be broken
up and the ships threatened with destruction. Preparations for retreat in
case of accident had been made early in the winter, but everybody knew
how small was the chance of escape in case of the loss of their floating
homes. The ice>>ficld in which they were enclosed was of immense extent
and great thickness, so that it was not afiected by ordinary winds; on two
or three occasions the winds rose to the force of gales, and then the ice
rocked visibly beneath them, and the ships groaned and creaked in their
beds. The snow flew in blinding masses, and the wind blew with such
force that it was impmible to stand up against it. If the fields had
broken, and the ships gone down in one of these gales, it is not. likely that
any trace of the expedition would ever have reached us. Travel over the
broken ice would have been slow at best, and it was far indeed to the near-
est land where assistance could be obtained.

As the spring advanced, and the sun each day retuaitted longer and
longer above the horizon,therc was great anxiety to find a release from the
icy prison. Early in April, observation showed that they were in latitude
50deg 23' north, and longitude 120deg west. This placed them to the north-
ward of the Parry Archipelzg'o, in a part of the polar sea not hitherto
visited by any explorers; by the end of April they were five degrees far-
ther to the east, and two degrees nearer the pole; not, only were they pro-
gressing in the direction they desired to go, but they had another motion
which showed that sotne new force was at work. In the last nine days of
April the ice-field turned nearly one quarter around; the bows of the ships
had pointed towards the north, but were now directed to the west. As
they drifted with the ice, they might be said to be sailing very nearly stern
foremost.

Naturally the new movement of the ships was discussed by the officers,
and various theories were advanced.

" Perhaps the motion of the ice-field is caused by currents opposed to
each other," the major suggested. "If there is an easterly current to the
north of us, and a westerly one to the south, it would tend to give the ice-
field a circular motion."

All the party agreed that the major's ground was well taken.

"What is more probable," said Commander Bronson," is that there is
land on one side of us, and the ice has grounded against it. I'prlrn'ations
have shown that there is an extensive archipelago to the north of the
American continent; we know we are to the northward of the Parry Isles,AN nxrnnrrlox OVI-th 'rur: lot). 207

and the probabilities are that we are among islands not yet. known to the
geographers.

" Thus far." he continued, "we cannot say whether the land on which
our ice-field impinges is to the north or south of our position. We must
find that out by observation, and as soon as our minds are made up we
will go in search of it."

Then the commander detailed his plans for observing the movement
of the ice.

Sledging parties were to go from the ship as far as a single day's travel
would carry them, one to the north and the other to the south. There
they were to observe the drift of the ice as accurately as possible; a sim-
ilar observation would be made at the ship, and a comparison of the notes
would tell him what he wished to know.

" If it is as I suspect," said the commander, " we shall find that there
is a more rapid movement of the ice to the south of us than there is to the
north. The ice is turning, as we have seen by the change in the ship's
position, and if we can learn the drift at the points indicated we can cal-
culate with tolerable accuracy the distance we are from the land."

Everything was made ready, and early the next morning the two sledges
got away on their journeys, each carrying the necessary tools and instru-
ments for making the observations. Major Clapp and George went with
one of the sledges, while Dr. Tonner and Fred had the other. The
major's sledge made about seven miles to the north; but owing to the
rouglmeSS of the ice to the south, and some ugly breaks in it, the Doctor
found himself little more than four miles away when it was time to stop.
Both camped on the ice, each using one of the lnnnmocks for a shelter to
protect the tent from the wind, in case it should come on to blow. Snow
was melted by the aid of an alcohol lamp, and cottee was made in the
same way; pennnican and biscuit were the solid part of the provisions, and
it is unnecessary to say that the exposure and exercise gave everybody an
admimble appetite.

George and Fred had their first experience of sleeping on the ice, and
the novelty of it was a compensation for the discomfort. Catch of the
party had a sleeping-bag, which was nothing more nor less than a huge
sack of deer-skin, alnply large enough to hold its owner. To go to bed was
to creep into the bag feet-foremost and then close the top, with the excep.
tion of a small aperture for the admission of fresh air. To get up, one had
simply to creep out of the bag; and as they all slept with their clothes on,
there was no toilet to be made other than a few sh: kes and twists to get
the body into working orde ' and the joints in their proper places.
Sleepingbags are alt indispensable part. of an outfit for an arctic sledge
journey. They have been used by every explorer from the days of \Vran-
gell and Parry, and probably were employed by their prcdtmessors. In
addition to the bag there is a sort of covet-lid of furs, which is spread over
the feet of the sleepers after they have taken their places. The spreading
of this protector is no easy matter, . s it must be done when everybody is
in his bag and has very little use of his arms. After being used a few
times it absorbs moisture, which freezes as fast as it is taken in; the cov-
erlid becomes like a piece of sheet-iron, and the same is the case with the
tent and the sleeping-bags.

" It is a curious circumstance," said the Doctor, "that the sleeping-bag
belongs alike to the frigid and tlte torrid Zones. "'hen I travelled in the
deserts of Arabia we had bags of tnnslin in which we slept at night to
shield us from mosquitoes; here we have bags of deer-skin with which to
protect ourselves front the intense cold."

Breakfast was very much like the supper; at any rate, it consisted of
the saute provisions, but Fred managed to get up a change in it. " \Vhen
I went to supper," said he, "I tilst took a bite of pennnicau and then a
bite of biscuit. For breakfast I began with the biscuit and followed with
the penunican, so that breakfast and supper are not the same after all."

Both parties were fortunate enough to find crevices where the field ltad
recently broken and left only a covering of young ice a couple of feet
thick. Cutting through this youngr ice they were able to make the sound-
ings they desired, and also to use the lead for obtaining"r the direction and
rate of the drift. As soon as they had carried out the orders of the com-
mander they returned to the ship. One of the parties saw a bear, but the
animal was not, inclined to familiarity, and made off as fast as he could go.
As an attempt to capture him would have caused delay, it. was wisely de-
cided to let him alone.

The result of the observations was given to the commander, together
with notes concerning the character of the ice over which the parties had
travelled, and the crevices where the soundings were made. ()otnmatuler
Bronson made a careful computation, in which he was assisted by Major
C-lapp and Captain Jones, and in a couple of hours arrived at his decision
concerning the movement of the ice.

"According to my calculations the field where we are is resting against
the land, or, at. all events, is aground about twenty-five miles north of us.
The current is hearing it in a circular direction, or rather in the segment.
of a circle,\and if we go north the distance I have indicated we shall find
solid ground, or perhaps a roof or shoal on which the ice has touched. Ifax 1x1'1anxa'rioxa1. RACE. 209

it wete not for the haze which has filled the northern horizon for several
(lays I think we should see the land easily."

"'1'hen,"said the major, "I move that we go in search of it. If we
liud laml we shall add something to the geography of the world, as nobody
has ever been here before."

Ilis opinion was echoed by the rest, and it was at once decided to go
in search of land.

The expedition was ar'anged like the one of the (lay before, with the
exception that the party was to carry provisions for ten days. uml the
sledges were to travel in company. In their eagerncs to be ofi they got
away two or three hours before daylight, and made such good progress
that they were nowhere to be seen when the sun came above the horizon.
The commander was so busy with matters that required his attention that
he did not have time to call through the telephone to Captain (ii 'ard, and
tell him that the sledng had gone on a voyage of discovery! "'0 have a
suspicion that he did not: wish the Frenchman to know anything about it
until too late for a party bearing the tricolor to get ahead of the Americans.

With the early start, and their enthusiasm to help them along, our
friends made nearly eleven miles before camping for the night. The next
morning they were somewhat still and sore, but keen as ever for going on:
George and Fred showed a great deal of energy in getting things ready
for the start, and the drivers had their dogs harnessed and everything in
s fairly above the horizon the
sharp eyes of Fred made a discovery which filled the whole party with

excitement.

There w: the land they had been looking for, and it was exactly in
the direction and apparently at the distance predicted by Couunander
Bronson!

Everybody was in great glee at the sight, and needed no incentive to
be off. They made the best progress they could, but. there. were so many
hammocks and rough places that by noon the sludges were less than five
miles from their camp of the previous night. A halt was ordered, and
men and dogs rested from their labors. ('ieorge was impatient to know
something of the strange land they were approaching, and so he climbed
to the top of the highest hunuuoek iu the neighborhood, and scanned the
distant shore with a glass.

Having made out all that \ 'as possible. he looked to the south, to ascer-
tain if he could see the ship. Suddenly a speck on the ice caught his
eye; it was a speck of red. and was movii r. Adjusting the lenses of the
glass to bring the speck into focus. he was not long in making it out.

14210 TI"; rumor: or 'rlu: "\'l\'l.\.\'."

It was the tricolor, carried in front of the slcdges from the (/(mzbetta.

The young man came down from the lmmmoelc with the alacrity of
a school-boy escaping from a hornet's nest, and in a few strides he was
at the spot were his cmnpanions were halted.

" Hurry up! hurry up l" he shouted. " The Frenchmen are after us,
and not more than three or four miles away."

No further incentive was needed for the American part of the expe-
dition, but the dogs and their driveis were not so quick of comprehension.
While they were preparing to be off again, (ieorge mounted a hammock
to pick out the best read, and to his great delight he espied a stretch of
smooth ice, which began not, more than a mile from where they were, and
apparently continued nearly up to the land.

This smooth ice did not lie directly between them and the shore, but
farther to the westward. 110 reported it to the major, and the latter or-
dered the route to be changed so as to reach the level stretch, where the
greater distance could be more than equalized by the superior speed at
which they could travel. From that tilne till the edge of the smooth ice
was reached, one of the party was constantly at the top of a hammock,
or proceeding ahead of the sledges in order to find the best road; and
we can be sure that they frequently looked behind, to ascertain if the
Frenchmen were lessening the distance between them.

The major conjeetnred that the moving field had broken in such a
way as to leave an expanse of open water which had been speedily frozen
over, probably in a single night. There were ridges here and there, but
nothing serious, and when they were fairly upon it the teams (lashed mer-
rily along. The major had taken a hint from Captain llall and prepared
a log,whieh he threw occasionally, to ascertain the speed they were mak-
ing. It was ditticnlt to have anything like an accurate estimate, as they
were obliged to make frequent halts to remove tangles from the harness,
and otherwise straighten out the teams. A (log-team will manage to get
into a good many snarls in the course of a day's travel; it is a severe trial
of the explorer's patience, but there seems to be no help for it.

The leg was constructed on the principle of the log of a ship, and con-
sisted of a fishing-line divided into knots and wound on a reel that turned
freely on a handle in its centre. At the end of the line was an iron bolt
weighing a pound or more, and serving the same purpose as the float on
the nautical log. It was inconvenient to manipulate a sand-glass on board
a dog-sledge, or to hold a watch with mittened hands to count. the time:
to get over this difliculty the major had practised counting "one, two,
three," and so on up to ten, in almost exact unison with the beats of a

watch. \Vith this eontrivance he ascertained that the sledge sometimes
went as fast as elcreu miles an hour, but it rarely did so for more than a

few minutes at a time.
They estimated that in their filst hour on the ice they made fully six

miles, and somewhat less than that distance in the second hour. By sun-
set they were within half a mile of land; but, unfortunately, their progress
was again impeded by rough ice, which was piled on the coast in a way
' far from welcome to the anxious explorers.

" ' TE mustn't let the, fimnbeltu's people get: ahead of us,"said the
Y major, as the sledges came to a halt. at the edge of the smooth ice.
"Suppose you and (leorgc go ahead with the llag," replied the Doc-

tor, "while l'rcd and I look after the teams. We must. he the first. to

hoist our flag on the land, and claim it for our nation."

".\ll right," the major answered. " (le the flag immediately," he con-
tinued, turning to George, " and we'll show t-nr friends of the (iambdm that
we have not forgotten Wrangell Island."

Action was suited to the word witlmnt a moment's delay. and the
major aml George made the host pmsil-le speed to the shore. They had
a rough road among the hummoclts. and through the broken ice, hut
under the circumstalnres they made excellent prugreSS.

Just ahore the point. where they landed there was a rocky hill perhaps
a hundred feet high. l'ansing a. moment to take hreath, and make sure
they were not pursued, George fixed his eye on the summit of this hill;

it could wave in the arclic hreeze.

"I take pus sinn of this land in the name of the President of the

in a crevice of the rock.

"And it shall he ealled President Laudt" added the major. who had
been nhliged to ascend more slowly than his youthful companion.

 
 

 

"Wonder where our French friends are now!" said George, as the
ceremony of taking possession was concluded.

"They'll he along as soon as they can get here," was the reply. "and
perhaps they won't like it when they find we're got ahead of them."

The glass had been left with Fred and so our friends had only their

unassisted eyes to see with. They scanned the horizon in the direction
they had come, but could not. discover any indication of the French
sledges.

" "'0'" leave the flag here for the present," said the major, "' and see
what we can do to help Fred along. There they are, struggling among
the lunnmoeks; see, there is a sort of lane right from the edge of the
smooth ice close up to the shore, and evidently they haven't. seen it."

George proposed to go and guide the sledges into the lane the major
had pointed out; the latter was to remain and watch the flag, and also keep
possession of the land they had discovered and annexed to the possessions
of the United States. The major approved the suggestion, and away
went the youth down the hill, but, hardly with more rapidity than he had
climbed it.

The sledges were quickly guided in the right direction, and by dusk
the whole party was on shore. The tent. was put up at the foot of the
hill, and to make the possession of the land beyond question, a flag which
Fred drew from the baggage was huntar above it, and waved a greeting to
the one on the summit of the hill.

"Two souls with but a single thought," said the Doctor, as he lacked
at Fred and George, who stood admiring the banners they had spread to
the breeze.

" Yes," responded the major. " If two heads are better than 0110, why
are not two flags, even though they be small '6"

"They're large enough to hold President Laud against: all comers,"
said George, " and I don't care now how soon our French friends come
along."

Fred scanned the expanse of ice with his field-glass, bat: the growing
darkness impeded his vision; he could see nothing of their rivals, and
as all hands were heartily weary, they proceeded to get supper and pre-
pare for sleep. The dogs were fed by their drivers, and aided by the
alcohol lamp the party was soon provided for as liberally as circumstances
would allow. Soon as supper was over they crawled into their bags, and
slept soundly till early in the morning.

Fred was the tiist to rise, and immediately on getting out of the tent
he looked to see if the flags were where they had been left. Both were
unharmed, aml when satisfied on this point the young man took his glass,
and climbed the hill to ascertain what had become of the party from the
Gambetta.

They were at the edge of the rough ice that had given the Americans
so nmch trouble the day before, and were just starting in among the hunt-Exl'LORlNG THE COUNTRY. 215

mocks to make their way to the shore. Evidently they were ignorant of
the existence of the lane which had been discovered from the hill--top the
day before, and were in the same error that had befallen the Doctor and
himself. "'ithont a. moment's delay he descended the hill, and went out
among the rough ice, to put the
Freuclnnen in the proper way. In
a little while they were in the right
road and safe on land; they pitched
their tent about three hundred yards
from that of the Americans, not from
any spirit of unfricndliness, but in
order to keep the dogs from lighting.
The party from the Gumbeltu. gra-
ciously accepted their defeat in not
being first on land, but promised to
be ahead of the Americans the next
time anything of the kind was "11- U
dertaken. m "I...

It seemed that they were not
able to get over the smooth iee until after sunset, and the latter part of
their ride across it had been done rather slowly, for fear of accidents in
the growing darkness. When they reached the rough ice they saw the
case was hopeless, and the Americans were certainly ahead of them in
getting to land. Very sensibly they spread their tent where they were,
and waited till morning before going on.

It was decided that the two parties should act together in exploring
the newly discovered land; and as the Americans had given the title to
it, the French should have the right to name the highest mountain. It
was further agreed that all mines of gold, silver, or other valuable product
of the earth, should be the joint property of the two expeditions, and no
concession to work mines or till the soil should be valid without the
signatures of the captains of the I'll-inn and Gambctta. Fred suggested
that it. would be well to arrange for the establishment of an army and
navy. and also for a police force to maintain order in President Laud, but
his idea did not secure speedy adoption. It was agreed, however, that the
government of the country must be republican, and the inhabitants would
have the right to make their own laws without danger of interference
from the home authorities.

These preliminaries settled, it was agreed that the exploration should
be made to the westward by the party from the Vivian, while the Gum-
[Mimic people would examine. the country east. of the camp. ()ue entire
day was to be allowed for the exploration; if either party was detained
from camp overnight, it was to be nndelstood that a serious accident. had
happened.

The ground was too rough for the sledges to he of any use, and conse-
quently they were left. at the camp, together with everything else not need-
ed for the day's journey. During the remainder of that. day the region
around the camp was examined. and the next morning both parties made
an early start. of course the dog-drivers remained at. the camp to keep
the dogs from straying, but all the rest of the party went to explore the land.

It did not take long for them to decide that the scheme for the gov-
ernment of the country would he of little use, as the inhal.)itants wouhl not
submit to it. The only residents they could find were bears, foxes, and
other wild beasts, and a republican form of government has never been
popular among these creatures. They are autocratic in their dispositions,
and generally adhere to the principle that might makes right.

Fred got. a shot at a white hear before they had gone half a mile from
camp, but the animal made off altogether too fast {0' anybody to follow.
Then the rifle was handed to the Doctor, but no game was discovered for
Some time. There was very little vegetation, only a few mosses and stunt-
ed shrubs, and our friends were unanimously of the opinion that it, would
not pay to attempt to colonize the country. ,lack of the camp, and per-
haps a couple of miles inland, there was a hilly ridge about three hundred
feet high. It was quite steep, and composed of broken shale, which made
it difiicnlt of ascent. The Doctor and Fred climbed to the top of the ridge,
while the major and George proceeded along its base.

Back of the ridge was a broad extent of ice which proved to he a
glacier, the first that Fred had ever seen. Dr. Tonner shouted his discov-
ery to the major, and then followed along the ridge to find a good point:
for venturing on the surface of the ice. As there was nothing to be seen
at the base of the ridge, the major and George climbed up to join their
companions, and then it was (lecided to cross the ice, or at least make an
investigation of its character.

The glacier was evidently an ancient and permanent one, as the sides
of its channel were worn into precipices by the long continued flow of the
river of ice. It was no easy matter to get fairly on the ice, owing to its
broken character at the edge, and our friends walked a considerable (lis-
tance before finding a satisfactory spot. There were deep fissures in the
ice, and as the party vas unprovidcd with the proper apparatus for glacier-
climbiug, it was necessary to proceed with great caution.
A DANGEROUS POSITION.

At length a bridge of ice seemed to promise secure footing. am] one
after another they ventured upon it. George slipped when nearly over:
fortunately he fell on the side where the depth of the fissure was only a
few feet, and escaped without injury. 0" the opposite side there was a
sheer descent of some thirty or forty feet, and the Consequences of a tumble
them would have heen serious.

Close to the ridge the ice was dirty, and mingled with the (IF/"ls of
rock and earth it had gathered in its contact with the wall that kept it in
place, but towards the centre the appearance changed to a. pure white.
Evidently the air was not filled with dust in this locality, or the surface of
the glacier would have revealed it. George thought the bank of the glacier
offered an excellent spot for building a summer-house, as the site was a
cool one, and the expense of having the ice-carts call every morning would
be avoided.

Fissures were numerous, and some of them were concealed by freshly
fallen snow, which greatly increased the danger. The major ordered a
return to the land at, the first favorable opportunity, and their intention of
crossing the glacier was abandoned. Following down twu or three hun-
dred yards they found a place where the solid ice touched the wall of roel:
and enabled them to set foot on the earth again.

From this point it was decided to follow the glacier to its month, if not
too far away. The fall was so slight that the surface was apparently level,
but still there must he a fall in order to give the mass a movement on-
ward. There was no living thing on the surface of the glacier, but. in a
little valley enclosed by some of the hills which formed the ridge the Doc-
tor saw a herd of musk-cattle plucking the very seanty herbage that grew
there. Creeping around, so as not to alarm them, he managed to get a
shot at close range, and brought down one of these animals of the far
North. The rest ran away at the report of the rifle, and at the apparition
of the strange beings that rose from the ground as soon as the shot was
fired.

"Now that we have a musk-ox," said the major, "what will we do
with it?"

The question was a. perplexing one. As they were unable to carry the
meat to camp, aml had no means of cooking it where they were, it was
decided that they would mtnrn that way if przwticahle, and take enough
of the meat to camp to have some fresh steaks for supper, provided the
bears and foxes did not come upon the prize in their absence.

As this is the first. of these animals that we have seen, we may as well
give a description of him.DESCRIPTION OF THE MUSK-OX. 219

The musk-ox is peculiar to the polar regions of America, and its range
is confined to the Arctic Circle, or very near it. It is twice as large as the
reindeer, and when full grown is little if any smaller than a cow two years
old; it has strong horns that bend around the head like those of the wild
sheep of the Rocky Mountains, or
wild goat of the Himalayas, and
its body is covered with long hair
to protect it from the cold. The
flesh when fat is not much unlike
beef, and has an agreeable flavor;
but when the animal is lean, it has
a strong smell of musk which only
a ravenous appetite can overcome.
Expeditions in the arctic regions
have frequently relied on the musk-
ox for their supply of fresh meat,
and in several instances these ani- A "SH".
mals have been the sole support
of parties for several months. They are not easy to approach, and can
run very fast in spite of the shortnm of their legs.

So much for the musk-ox, which our friends left with a sigh, and the
Doctor half regretted having wasted a bullet upon. " What a pity he did
not come down to our camp to be shot," said Fred, " as he would then have
been handy for us to use. The only proper way of hunting is to bring
in your game alive, and then kill it when it is wanted."

They traced the course of the glacier to the sea, but found nothing of
consequence after walking five or six miles. Then it was time to return,
and they decided to follow the shore back to camp--or rather the Doctor
and the major did so, while the youths went to bring in the steaks for sup-
per. The walkiug was not so easy along the shore as it was at the ridge
farther inland. A good deal of the ground was covered with snow, and
all the hollows were filled with it; generally it was hard enough to bear
the weight of a man, but this was not always the ease, and whenever it
gave way the walking was laborious.

In some places the shore sloped from the ridge down to the water, or
rather to the ice, while in others it was steep and precipitous. "'hcrever
there were any cliffs there was a great number of birds, and their tameness
showed that they were not accustomed to the visits of man. There were
gulls, auks, cider-ducks, lunnnc, and several other members of the feathered
tribe, but it was too early in the season to find their nests. Ten or twelve
ducks were obtained by knocking them down with stones, and the major
said he could have killed a hundred in this way if he had wished to do so.
More and there, where the ground sloped to the water, they found pieces
of drift-wood,and when they reached the camp the major was rejoiced to
find that the dog-drivers had had the forethought to gather enough wood
during the day to make an excellent fire. Thus the cookingr of their food
was provided for, and they were not. long in getting the ducks ready for
III-oiling. The youths arrived a few minutes after the major and Doctor
had reached camp, bringing as much of the meat of the ox as they could
well carry.

 

DUCKS 0N PRESIDENT LAND.

In a quarter of an hour or so the French explorers appeared, and were
welcomed with a loud cheer by the Americans. They had been about ten
miles to the eastward, over ground similar to that traversed by the Ameri-
cans, bnt somewhat more broken, and their progress had been stopped by
a. ridge of rocks and a glacier which they were unable to cross without
the proper appliances for ice-travel. Just beyond the ridge was a conical
rock two or three hundred feet high,and so far as they could ascertain it
was the most elevated point in the neighborhood. One of the officersDISCOVERY or A COAL-BED. 221

made a sketch of the rock, which he named the "Butte Napoleon ;" the
major said it reseIIIbled the " Devil's Thumb," at the entrance of Melville
Bay, which had been so named on account of its fancied siIIIilaI-ity to an
eIIorIIImIs thumb pointing in the air. Near the base of this ridge a seam
of coal was found, and the indications on the surface showed that it was
apparently of great extent. George and Fred at once suggested the for-
mation of the "\'iriaII-GaIIIhetta Coal Cmnpany, Limited," but the party
was altogether too weary from the day's exertions to draw up the articles

latter returned the compliment with an abundant supply of bear-meat, for
feeding the (logs from the Vivi/m. Men and dogs went to sleep with full
stomachs--an excellent preparation for the fatigues of the return journey
to the ships.

In the morning there was some difliculty in getting the sledges on the
ice again, as there was a movement of the field along the shore. During
the night a strong breeze blow from the south-west, and an hour or so
after it set in the crashing and grinding of the ice along the shore showed
that it was in motion. Cracks and narrow lanes were opened in two or
three places, and a good many huge blocks were forced upon the beach.
It was evident that the explorers ought to get back to the ships as speedily
as possible, or they might find themselves altogether cut off from retreat
by the breaking up of the ice.

 

AN EMITY SLEDGE.

A practicable spot was found close to the French tent, and, without
waiting for breakfast, all the teams started over the route they had come
a couple of days before. Following the lane already described, through
the rough ice, they reached the smooth field and then halted for rest and
food. The remains of the supper of the previous evening served for the
morning meal, with the addition of pemmicau and tea; the dogs looked
wistfully on, but it would have been contrary to custom to feed them im-
mediately before the long run which they were to make. Soon as breakfast
was over the journey was resumed; but it was not accomplished as quickly
as the outward one, owing to several cracks in the ice, over which it was
necessary to lift the sledges. Before the line of lunnmocks was reached
the ships were plainly discernible, and each had a large flag flying, to
enable them to be made out as easily as possible. The major thought
the position of the ships had been changed considerably since the partyAGAIN ON THE SHIPS--A GALE. 223

left them, and the Doctor agreed with him. It seemed that they were
farther to the east: than before, and evidently the drifting had increased
during their absence.

When they reached home again they were welcomed with all the hon-
ors, Both ships were dressed in llagS, a salute of two guns was fired by
the Vivian and a similar one by the (Iambctla, and the crews were ranged
at. the gangway to greet the travellers with three ringing cheers. Com-
mander Bronson said he had been watching for their return since morn-
ing, and the movement of the ice had caused a good deal of alarm for
their safety. A man had been kept in the crew's-nest with the most pow-
erful glass the ship possessed, to watch out for them and report their ap-
proach; and the same precaution had been taken on the Gambetta. The
lookout on the latter ship was the first to announce the return of the
sledgcs, and therefore the French captain was consoled, to some extent at
least, for the march the Americans had stolen on him in starting ahead
of his party, and taking lmsxsession of the land before his people could get
there.

It was late in the afternoon of the second day from land when the
sledges reached the ships, and the wearisome journey was ended. The
best supper that could be provided on board the Vivian was ready for
our friends, and they sat down to it with the kecnest of appetites. During
the progress of the meal they told the story of their adventures, and of
the addition they had made to the geography of the arctic regions. After
supper Fred proceeded to designate on the map the position of President
Land; the point where the sledges reached it was set down as latitude
83: 24' north, longitm'le 115deg 10' west. It: was known to extend about
ten miles east and west from that point, but of its area to the north they
were entirely ignorant.

The breeze continued to blow from the south-west, and by morning it
had increased to half a gale. The ice heaved and cracked in many places,
and the progress of the field to the north and east was more rapid than
ever. Everybody was on the alert, and the developments of each hour
were looked forward to with the greatest anxiety. The dogs and sledges
were taken on board the ship, but the casks of provisions that had been
placed there in the event of the sinking of the Viz-[an were allowed to
remain, as they might be needed at any moment. While it was desirable
to be prepared for the loss of the ship, it was equally necessary to be
ready to float away in her in case she should be released from her icy
prison. The boats were made ready for launching; clothing, provisions,
and equipments were piled close to the rail, ready to be thrown out at a2:24: 'rne vomon or Tin-z v1v1.\.\'."

moment's warning; and those who were not on duty went, to sleep with
their clothes on and their knapsacks by their sides. It is hardly necessary
to add that, under the circumstances, nobody slept soundly.

Discipline was carefully maintained. The watches were changed as
regularly as though the weather was of the finest and the ship were sail-
ing across the Pacific under the steady influence of the trmle-wind. As
the day advanced, the movement of the ice increased; a little past noon
a large crack opened from the bow directly ahead, and another parallel to
it a hundred yards away. About the middle of the afternoon the man in
the crew's-nest called out "lg/Jul!" and of course everybody was full of
anxiety to see it.

 

COAST SCHNH IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE,

It was fully half an hour before it: could be made out from the dock,
and then only faintly. From the course they had been drifting it was
evident that the land in sight was the region lately visited by the sledges,
and if they continued to go on as they were then proceeding, they would
be close upon it by the following morning. The Doctor went to the
crew's-nest, and was quite positive he could recognize the "Butte Napo-
leon" from the description and drawing of the French officers. It was
thought that the land was about fifteen miles distant, and in the course
they were drifting they would pass to the eastward of it.ls)

IN A HIGH l..\'l'l'l'lYDl-J. 2'5

Some of our readets may wonder that they were so near the land be-
fore seeingr it. It must be remembered that the island was covered with
snow, except in a few places, and consequently its appearance was almost
identical with that of the ice-fields which surrounded it. The weather
was hazy, and a clear horizon was the exception rather than the rule; and
furthermore, the land was not sufliciently elevated to be visible at a great
distance, even if all the other conditions had been favorable.

"' Well, we can't go ashore just now," said the Doctor, when he returned
to the deck, "and it's lucky we embraced the opportunity when we did."

"Yes," responded the major, "and it's luckier that we embraced the
opportunity to get back again. If we had remained there another day
it is doubtful if we would have returned at all."

The subject was not a pleasant. one for contemplation. Nobody liked
to think what would have been their fate if left on that desolate and
hitherto unknown island, and the conversation took another turn.

" If we go on in this way without accident," said the commander, " we
may be at the pole before the middle of summer. But 1 (:0!th 1 don't
understand it altogether."

" .\'or do 1," said (.'aptaiu Jones. who had just joined the group.
" Here is the ice threatening to break up in the beginning of May, fully
two months before we have any reason to expect it. It looks very much
as though we were on the borders of the Polynia of the Russians, and the
barrier was about to divide, and let us into the open polar sea."

"At any ate," replied the commander, "we are beyond the latitude
of any previous navigator, and must; not. be surprised at anything. 3y to-
morrow noon we will be north of the S-l-th parallel of latitude, which has

.\ call from the lookout aloft arrested their attention. Captain Jones
mounted rapidly to the crew's-nest. and then. with more excitement than
was usual with him, he shouted to Commander Bronson.

The latter lost. no time in ascending to the captain's side. The rest
of the party waited breathlessly below while their superiors were observ-
ing the state of the ice, and the conditions ahead of the drifting Hoe.
After what seemed hours to our friends. but was really less than twenty
minutes, the commander returned to the deck, leavingr the captain aloft.

"The way we are now drifting," said he, "will carry us close to what
appears to be a. point of land projecting to the eastward of the 'Butte

mentioned from the breaking of the ice."A GLOOMY PROSPECT. 227

The casks of provisions were hoisted on board and piled close to the
rail, where they could be thrown overboard in case of necessity.

The sun had set, and the twilight of the arctic was upon them. "Shall
we ever see the sun again ?" was the question which each asked himself as
he watched the disappearance of the orb of day.

The captain descended from the rigging, and the party retired to the
cabin. They could plainly hear the creaking and groaning of the ship
as the ice moved around her, and occasionally there came a sound louder
than usual which told of the extraort'linary strain upon their floating home.
There was little convetsation at supper, and as soon as the meal was over
the commander said they must get what sleep they could during the night,
and be prepared to leave the ship at any moment. The same precautions
were taken as on the night before, but every one realized that the peril
was more imminent, and escape from the ship was by no means indicative
of an escape with life.

There was little sleep on the Viz-751m, and the same was doubtless the
case on the Gumball". All were anxious for the morning, and for items
and hours it seemed to Fred and George that the darkness was without
end.

recalled the lilies in one of his school-books:

The T'icz'an. was standing upright in the ice, as she had stood for
weeks, but the Gumbelm was heeled over so that her yards almost touched
the water. The point of land, concerningr which there had been so much
anxiety on the previous evening, was about a mile away, on the port side
of the lr'icz'un, and the ice was piled upon it: in great masses, which ap-
peared in some places hundreds of feet. in height. It was an immense
relief to know that the ship had weathered this miniature cape, and they
had not to contend with the horror of being (lashed upon it. And oh!
welcome sight, which they had not known through all that long winter,
beyond the jutting point there was an expanse of open water! True, it was
encumbered with cakes of ice that stippled its surface as far as the eye
could see, but compared with what they had known during their imprison-
ment, it was like a pellueid lake in the mountains.

Around them the ice-field was cracked and broken in many places,
and several lanes of water were visible. The telegraph line connecting
the ships had been taken up soon after the return of the explorers from
the island, and when the increasing wind made it probable that. the ice
would move more rapidly to the nortlnvard. The route where the wire
had been stretched could be traced over the mounds of ice, except in two
or three places where there had been extensive breaks in the field, and
some of the mounds had altogether disappeared. Connuunicatiou betweenRELEASED FROM THE [er riusox. 2:29

the ships was conducted by signal-flags; when the (imnlwlm heeled over,
our friends expected every moment the announcement that she was sink-
ing, but. as she displayed no signal, it was concluded that; there was no
immediate danger.

They drifted with the ice as before, but appeared to more in a circui-
tous direction, in consequence of the edge of the field impinging on the
land. Suddenly there was a loud (rash, and the ice split in front of them,
directly in line of the crack which had opened the evening before. The
land-ice, as we may call it, swung away from the ship, while the rest re-
mained practically in its former position; then the Vivian heeled orcr,
broke loose from the lloe, righted to an even keel, and was afloat!

 

NBA" 1'"): ICE.

The captain ordered the engineer to get up steam as soon as possible.
The tires were ready for lighting, and in a few minutes a dense volume of
smoke was pouring:r from the funnel.

The lane in front of them widened as the flees swung apart from each
other, and though the water was full of floating cakes, it was comparatively
open and suitable for navigation. Pending the readiness of the engines
to propel the ship, the sails were spread; their inllueuce was quickly felt.
and almost instantly the Vivian \'as forging ahead, with the water rippling
heneath her hows.

In spite of the peril of their position, with the ice on three sides and:33" 'I'lll-I vovaur: or 'rnI-z ~\'I\'t.\.\'."

the land on the fourth, (Taptain Jones called for three cheers as the ship
began to move. Officers and men responded with all the vigor of their
lungs; whatever danger might threaten them, it was a great delight to be
free once more, and they signified their feelings by the energy with which
they cheered. As the last cheer died away the Gum/mute rose from her
reclining position to an even keel; the Vivian fired a gun and ran up a
flag in token of congratulation, to which the French ship responded in the
same manner.

The lead showed ten fathoms of water; the captain ordered the helm
aport, so that the Vivian could reach the expanse of water formed on the
lee side of the point of land we have described. In a little while there
was sufficient steam for turning the screw, and with engines to aid the
sails the Vivian soon found a harbor.

At the same time the Gambutta was in motion. The ice did not open
as readily around her as around the Vivian, for the reason that it was not
drawn to one side by its contact with the land ; but a lane formed, through
which she crept slowly forward, partly through the aid of engines and
sails, and partly by the ellbrts of her crew. The men were sent out with
ice-anchors, which they made fast lmder the direction of an ollicor sta-
tioned in the cross-trees; as soon as an anchor was fixed it was drawn in
by the steam-winch, and thus the ship w: :lowly advanced. Finally, only
a narrow line of ice separated her from the clear water; this was blown
up with a can of powder, and then by hard pushing with her engines the
(iambdm was afloat in the harbor that held the Vivien.

Afloat. and uninjured after all the peril they had passed through! It
was an occasion for rejoicing, and as the Gum/wild swung parallel with
the Vivian and slowed her engines, the yards of both ships \vcre manned
by their crews, and the cheering that went up from the throats of those
happy sailors must have astonished the listening bears and musk-cattle on
President Land. Never before were the echoes of that harbor awakened
by lmman voices, nor yet by the guns which tired a salute, each ship to
the other, in eong'atulatiou over their release from imprisonment in the
ice-field and the perils of the escape.

They were in unknown waters, with the land close aboard; consequent
ly it \'as necessary to proceed with caution, and the ships moved with only
enough speed to give stec'age-way. The Vivian was in advance, and
nearer shore than the Gambcttu, and therefore in more danger of taking
the ground; she kept the lead going steadily, but: in no place did it show
less than six fathoms, and there \'as no danger except from hidden rocks
or shoals.:NTHRING A new HARBOR. 23!

The bay was about four miles in length from the point of the peninsula
which had served to break up the ice, and the next projection to the north.
Its depth was something more than two miles, perhaps two and a half,
and in the direction the wind was then blowing it was well sheltered.
The farther side was terminated by a.
promontory or foreland which closely
resembled the North I"oreland of Fro-
bisher, at the entrance of the bay
named after the enterprising mariner
of the early days of arctic explora-
tion. The waves were breaking at
the foot of this promontory, and be-
yond it the ice was pressing north-
ward under the influence of the wind
and current. As an attempt to pass
out of the bay might bring,r the ships
into the ice again, it was deemed pru-
dent to anchor, and make an investi-
gation with the boats before proceed-
ing.

Down went: the anchors for the
first time in many weeks, and the
chains rattling through the hawse-
hole was a welcome sound. Then _
a boat was lowered from the Vivian, Tm; mm" mum".
and another from the (iamlnzlta .- the
Vivian's boat. rowed to the side of the Gumbdta, and it was hastily agreed
that she should proceed to investigate the condition of the water as far as
it could be seen from the top of the promontory. Meantime the Gum-
lmtm's boat would take soundings in the direction of the forelaud, and as
far beyond it as would be safe to venture.

George and the major were assigned to the work of exploration with

i the boat's crew from the Vivian, and away they went in the direction of
the land. It was easy enough to row over the water, but not so easy to
tind a landing-place.

Apparently the tide was out, and the beach was concealed by an ice.-
collar eighteen or twenty feet lligli,exactl_r similar to the ice-collars which
explorers in other parts of the arctic seas have described. A rope with
an ice-anchor formed part of the boat's equipment; this anchor was
thrown over the ice, and after several failures it caught and held firmly.
Two men pulling upon it with their entire weight were not able to more
it, and then the most nimble of the sailors climbed up and assisted the
othels to follow. Two men were left in the boat, and the rest of the
party ascended the pl'oll)ntltol'_\'.

 

('LIMIII Mi AN ICE-COLLAR

Their attention was attracted to the vast nmnbers of birds that tilled
the air, and flew so close to the explorers as to be easily knocked down
with sticks. George wanted to stop long enough to get a supply for the
ship, but the major commanded that no delay should be made, as the
birds were altogether a secondary consideration.

They had an hour of the hardest kind of climbing to reach the top of
the hill, as the broken shale which lay in many places retarded their foot-
steps and frequently compelled them to fall on hands and knees. George
was the first at the top, where he waved his cap and gave a loud hurrah:
evidently his progress was noted from the ships, as the Vivian dipped
her flag three times in honor of his achievement, and the Gillllllclttl did
likewise.

The view beyond the hill was encouraging, as it revealed a wide strip
of open water between the land and the pack of heavy ice which spread
away to the eastward. This water extended as far as they could see, and
the major decided without hesitation that it would be quite safe to rent-
ure into it. In front of the hill the ice-pack was not more than a quartetGATHERING BIRDS' EGGS. 233

of a mile from land; the indications were that there was plenty of water
between the forelaud and the ice, though this could only be made certain
by actual soundings.

Descending the hill they tool: a route different from the one by which
they went. up; on their way down, when near the base, they had the good-
furtnue to come upon several nests of the cider-duck, of the variety known
as the " king," which breeds earlier and farther north than the conmmn
cider. The binds were just beginning their period of nesting; no nest
contained more than one egg, with the exception of two or three which

had two eggs ('flt'lL The major said the cider-duel: usually lays from fire

to seven eggs, and does not begin incubation until about the end of May.
They gathered all the eggs they could find, and managed to get nearly

three dozen. They killed eight or ten ducks by knocking them down with
sticks, and on reaching the boat they found that the sailors had secured
as many more by the simple process of striking them with the oars when
they flew or swam near the boat. Several hnnme and auks had been
taken in the same way. and when the boat returned to the l'i/'irm it had
a good supply of food for the cabin table.

George was surprised to tind that the egg of the cider-duck is about
twice as large as a hen's egg; and when the harvest of the day had passed
through the hands of the cook, he decided that the eggs were as delicious
as they were large. ""hile the party was discussing the novel dinner,
Captain Jones said these eggs were considered the greatest of all deliea~
cies by the Labrador fishermen; and in the season when they were obtain-
able the whalers in the far North had all they wanted to eat. lle said
he had frequently gathered fifteen or twenty dozen in half an hour or St.)
on the islands where the ducks have their breeding-places, and that. the
down from the nests paid them handsomely for their work.

George's curiosity was aroused, and he wished to know more of the
process of obtaining down from the cider-dunk.

"I can't tell you exactly," replied the captain, "as I have never studied
the habits of the bird very carefully; but I believe that: when the eggs are
laid the female plueks the down from her breast and places it around
and beneath them. After she begins inculnuiun the male bird deserts
her, and when she has occasion to leave the nest; in search of food, she
pulls the down over the eggs to keep them warm (luring her absence.
If the nest is robbed of eggs and down, she finds another mate and begins
the work over again: and if she is robbed a second time, she seeks a new
mate. As she has stripped her breast of all its down to supply the two
nests, the third is supplied by her last companion.

" The down from a nest will fill your hat, but it doesn't w gh more
than an ounce, and generally less. I have seen nests that yielded two
or three ounces, and have heard of some that. contained half a pound of
down, but I never saw them, and very much doubt if anybody else ever
did."

The captain further said that the down was worth three or four dol-
lars a pound in the English market, and \'as highly prized on account. of
its lightness and warmth.

While our friends were absent on land another boat had been making
a survey of the harbor muler the charge of the Doctor and Fred. They
had taken soundings in seve 'al places, finding plenty of water for anchor-
ing within a hundred yards of the shore, and made a tracing of the shore-
line, together with the bearings, both true and magnetic. They namedLEAVING nnonsox an. 235

the place "Bronson my," in honor of their commander, and with the
assent of the major the promontory which the latter had ascended was
designated " Clapp's Cliff," in commemoration of the event of the day.
Meantime the crew of the Gal/Lbctta's boat had made soundings to the
front of the forcland, and found plenty of water; they were in some
danger from the waves, which broke rather furiously at the base of the
steep rook, but by keeping well out from the shore they escaped accident.
It wz'e'. decided to steam around the foreland and into the open water
heyond it, and as the Gambclta had made the soundings she took the lead.

Steaming slowly as before she made the passage without hinderance,
and then the Vivian followed. Once around the foreland they had plenty
of water; and though it was full of fragments of ice, like the hay they
had just left, there was not. enough to trouble them. Keeping a sharp
watch for shoals and rocks, throwing the lead continually, and holding
themselves as far from land as the ice-puck would permit, the reSSels kept.
on for some twenty miles or more, when they were stopped by another
projection of land. The ice-pack was crowded close up to this projection,
and was so dense that. it was not deemed prudent to venture into it with-

Again they anchored, and this titne the tires were drawn, in order that
there might he no unnecessary consumption of coal. .liesitles, it was tlte end
of the long arctic day,and everyhotly was suflieiently tired out to need a rest.

The next morning there was great activity on both ships. Each of
them sent a boat to land, and another to explore the hay where they were
anchored; the land parties were provided with rifles and shot-guns, as
well as scientific instruments, and were instructed to bring in any game
they could find, in addition to determining the position of the hay and the
character of the water heyond, if any could he seen. The Vivian's boat
was the first to get away, but it was thought proper to allow the Gambctlu's
people to he tirst on shore, iuasnmclt as they had given the Vivian's
party the exclusive occupation on the previous day.

Without following the movements of all the parties in detail we will
see what they accomplished.

The hay was simply an indentation in the land, about twenty miles
long, sheltered from southerly and north-westerlyr winds, and other winds
hetwecn them to the west, hut open to all others. It was named " (.iirard
Bay," in honor of the captain of the Gllfiloc'lld.

At. the northern end of the hay there was a steep elifi or bluff about
three hundred feet high, which was named "French Head," to commemo-
'ate the nationality of the tlag that was unfurled front its summit.

The position of French llead was found to he latitude Sideg 31' north,
longitude 114deg 45' west.

About four miles south of French llead the hay was studded with
rocky islands, of which only two or three could he visited, on account of
the ice that lilled the channels. The Doctor and Fred clituhed to the top
of one of these islands (which was named in the Doctor's honor), and the
young man made a sketch of the scene while they rested from the fatigue
of the ascent.

The party that ascended French lIead reported that; the pack~ice filled
the horizon to the eastward, and there was no hope of escape in that direc-
tion; hut there was open water north of the elitl', and the coast seemed
to trend away to the westward. If they could manage to pass the clilt', it.
was the opinion of the oflicer in charge of the observation that they could
go at least twenty-five miles, and perhaps twice or three times that dis-
tance, without ohstructiou.

At one time the ice seemed inclined to sweep away from French Head
and allow them to pass. Steam was ordered on the ships, and the signal
of recall for the heats w
got ready to move, the ice closed in again.

t; hut hefore they could return, and the vesselsA CHANNEL DISCOVERED. 237

The parties were not especially successful in hunting, as they saw noth-
ing larger than birds. The fact was they had no time to spend in sport,
as they were chiefly occupied with their observations. The second day of
their stay in Girard Bay was principally devoted to hunting; and as the
birds were very tmne, they were knocked down by hundreds. The crews
of both ships had an ample repast from this source of supply, and so did
the dogs, though the latter would have preferred fish or beef. They
bolted the birds, feathers and all, and when a (log had finished his orni-
thological breakfast he had a fringe of feuthels around his muzzle which
seemed to change him into a hitherto unknown specimen of the canin
race.

 

FRENt ll HEAD.

One of the hunting parties came back with a report; of the existence
of a channel just back of French IIead, which might let. the ships through
into the open water to the north. They had entered it from the little
group of islands explored by Dr. Tonner and Fred, and in their chase for
birds they ascended it a mile or more. The tide was running through it
very gently, but enough to show that there was communication between
(iirurd Bay and some other body of water.l0
to

'I'llli \'()\'.-\(il". "l" 'l'llli "\'l\'l.-\.\'."

A couple of days were spent in exploring this channel, a boat going
from each ship for that. purpose. The result of the exploration was that
the channel was found a dangerous one for the ships to enter; it was
narrow in many places and quite tortuous, and there were several ugly
rocks along the way. The passage was possible, but: very hazardous, and
it was determined not to attempt it until all chance of escape around
French Ilead was hopeless.

For nearly a fortnight the ships remained at anchor in (iimrd Bay,
waiting a favorable opportunity to continue their journey. All the seieu~
titic men of the expeditions were busy with observations on the flora, the
fauna, and other productions of President Land, and on the character of
the rocks, the traces of mioeeuc and pliocene formations, and other things
that interest the geologists and students of natural history. George and
Fred were of great assistance to their elders in making the records of the
observations, and in packing away the Specimens of the products of this
hitherto unknown land.

One afternoon the wind chopped suddenly round to the westward, and
gradually increased as 'the hours went on. By six o'clock it was a strong
breeze, at nine it was a high wind, at twelve it was half a gale, and by
three in the morning it was a full-fledged gale " with its coat off," as the
captain expressed it.

Each ship put out an extra anchor, and everything was made snug
aloft. " I think something '!I come of this gale," said the captain, " and
we must make the most of it."

Evidently "something was to come of it," as the force of the wind car-
ried the ice out to sea and left the front of French llead quite free of
it. Here and there scattered fragments were visible, but nothing to im-
pede the progress of a ship.

For twenty hours the gale blew steadily, and was of the kind that
shaves the hair from the back of a dog, or removes the shoestrings even
when properly tied. Then it subsided as slowly as it had risen; the fall
of the barometer was more moderate than is the case in southern latitudes.
and it did not begin until an hour or so before the cessation of the gale.

Now was the opportunity for the ships!

"'heu the tempest had reached the condition of half a gale the tires
were started in the furnaces of the ships. and by the time it, was down to
a high wind they were ready to proceed. lip came the anchors, and in
a little while the Vic/(m and Gumbella had rounded French llead and
were steaming through " Internatiomil 1' ach," the name which had been
given to the stretch of water beyond the promontory.AN A DVENTUROCS JOURNEY.

of this reach, so that we could go ahead at full speed. It's less than four
hundred miles to the North-pole, and who knows but what we've got an
open road to it?

"I guess it's the same here as it is in Smith's Sound," he continued.
"From the looks of things we've got the laud-water :ame as we have it
there. Frequently, when the sound is full of ice, there's an open strip
along the western side, and not a few ships and boats have made their
way north through that water."

Yes, they had the laudwvater, and what. was more, the strip widened
as they went. north: or, rather, the land treuded away to the north-west,
while the edge of the ice-pack seemed about: on a due north-aml-south
line. As they hauled away from land the sounding-lead showed a steady
deepening of the water. Five miles from the shore-line they had thirty
fathouis, and then it was deemed safe to increase the speed to eight knots.
lint all the time the lead was kept going. and a sharp leukout was main-
tained in the crew's-nest, on the cross-trees. and on the hows. Occasion:-
ally the lead indicated the shoaling of the water, and whenever this was
the ease the pace was reduced to little more than steerage-way until the
soundings deepened again.

"There's one thing in our favor." said George to Fred, as they were
looking over the ship's side and studying the line of the coast they were
passing, "we are in no danger of collision with other ships trying to cross
our track."

"Don't be so sure of that," was the reply. "Who knows but we may
encounter : ship that has forced its way through the ice ahove Smith's
Sound and is making for the pole, just as we are. The same conditions
that; have favored us may give sotnehody else a similar chant-e."

George admitted the possibility of such an event. hat was still inclined
to the opinion that they would have plenty of sea-room.

()hservation at noon showed they were in latitude 55deg 10' north, longi-
tude 113' 50' west. Only three hundred miles to the pole!

The advancing season and their high latitude had dispelled the arctic
darkness. Daylight was continuous. and there was no necessity for lying

the ice-blink to the eastward showed that the pack was still in their neigh-
borhood. The wind was steady from the west, and as a prudential meas-
ure the fires were extinguished, and the ships relied altogether upon their
sails.

The farther the ships went from land the less numerous were the sea--
birds; but not so the whales, which were visible in great numbers. Dozens
of them were in sight at once, and they did not appear disturbed by tile
plescnce of the ships. Eridently they were ignorant of the destructive
propensities of man, as they played around the ships, and sometimes were
altogether more familiar than was desirable. Several times, after diving,
they came up beneath the bows of the Vivian, and were so near that they
could have been harpooned from the ship. Once a whale scraped his back
against the vessel's keel, but fortunately for our friends he seemed to treat
the affair as a joke, and did not resent it. While the thickness of the V131;-
ian's sides might have saved her from injury, it would have been a serious
matter if he had dashed at her with the immense momentum of his huge
body.

"What a place for a whaler l" said Captain Jones, as he looked at
the huge ectaceans playing in the waters. "' It beats the old days of the
()khotsk Sea and Seammou's Bay, when a ship could fill up in a month
and go home. Seine of 'em are good for two hundred barrels, and they're
all to be had for the taking."

"Sail ho!" shouted the man in the crew's-nest, and the captain's dream
of the whaler came to an abrupt termination.

"r I": last place in the world for a sail l" eXcIaitned the captain, as he

sprang into the rigging, and mounted with the agility of a cat. "' It's
a Yankee pole-hunter, or one of those Scotch whalers from Dundee, I'm
sure."

Of cmnse there was great excitement: in the party on deck during the
captain's absence aloft, and all sorts of conjectures were made, and various
theories proponnded. The captain eyed the strange sail through a glass
for at least a quarter of an hour; then he scanned the horizon in every
direction, again looked intently at the sail for ten minutes or so, and finally
closed his glass and returned to the deck.

" It's no sail at all," said he, with a mingled expression of satisfaction
and disappointment on his face. " It's an iceberg, but it looks so much
like a ship under full sail that I don't wonder the lookout was deceived.

"It's a big one, too," he continued, " and we shall probably see more
of 'em. It's larger than any berg we've come across yet, and I'm curious
to know where it came from."

A couple of hours later another iceberg was reported, and some time
afterwards another.

3y observation and (lead-reckoning, when the sail was announced, they
were within less than two hundred miles of the pole. The presence of
the icebergs reduced greatly the probability of an Imohstructcd voyage to
the point; where there is neither latitude nor longitude.

The iceberg first seen was about four points off the port how, while
the second was almost dead ahead. It was not considered advisable to
change the course of the ship in order to look at. one mountain of ice,
when another could he reached without any divergence. The Vii-[4m held
her way, and in due time reached and passed the second iceberg; it was
so nearly in her course that she was obliged to turn aside a little in order
to keep at a respectful distance.NEAR ax ICEBERG. 243

As well as they could estimate its size, it was fully half a mile long
and a. third of a mile broad; an enormous belt seemed to encircle it, as
though the layer of snow in one year had been different from what pl"-
ceded and followed it. This appearance is not at all unusual in icebergs;
Captain llall describes one of exactly the same formation, and says he
gave it the name of "the belted iceberg," on account of its enormous
girdle.

 

THE BIILIHD ICEBERG.

The part of the berg below the water was much broader than the por-
tion above, and accounted for its ability to float in the depth they were
navigating. Just as they were in front of it a mass " as large as a church"
broke off from one side and fell into the water with a loud splash. The
wave it created caused the Vivian to pitch and roll as though in a heavy
sea.

" You see the advantage of not going very near those fellows," said the
captain. "If we had been close up to the side of that berg we might
have been swatnpet ."

I'Iverybmly could see the force of the captain's assertion. and there was
no inclination for a nearer view of the \vhite-robed stranger. Naturally
they discussed the origin of the bergs, and wondered whence they had come.

"I think," said the captain, "we shall find land before long, and that2-14 'l'llli "WAGE 01':Tlll-Z "\'l\'l.\.\'."

it. contains glaciers which have given birth to these bergs. It's a pity we
could not explore President Land more thoroughly than we did; it Would
be interesting to know whether it had more glaciers in it than what we
saw there."

There were many fragments of ice floating in the water; in fact, during
all their voyage in the polar sea thus far, they had never been entirely free
from them. After passing the bet-gs we have described, the number of
lloating fragments increased, and it began to look as though the way to
the pole was far from being an open one.

The weather changed for the worse: it became colder, and the sky
was frequently overcast. Once in a while a snow-stptall set in, and made
it impossible to see far ahead; at such times the ice was decidedly dan.
.\sary for the ships to shorten sail.

"After all," said Commander Bronson, while they were passing through
one of these squalls, " we could not expect a long continuance of the line
weather that followed the gale. The polar regions can hardly be unlike
the rest of the world; storms and calms follow each other, and so we may
expect an offset to the weather that has layored us."

The squall lasted for an hour or more, and then the s y became clear
again. The wind continued favorable, and by varying her course now

 

   

and then the Vivian managed to make good progress and avoid all injury
from the ice.

The captain's prediction was realized, for within less than twenty hours
after he made it land was sighted. It proved to be somewhat more moun-
tainous than President Land, and as the Vivian approached it the front
of a glacier was plainly to be seen at the end of a triangular hay. An
iceberg which had recently broken ofi was lying inside the entrance of the
bay and nearly filled it; the berg appeared to be resting on the ground,
and the captain said it; would be necessary for a good deal of it to be
melted away by the sun before the rest could float and liud its way out
to sea.

They coasted along the land, looking for a good point to send a boat
on shore, as the bay where the iceberg lay was not considered farm-able.
At length an opening was seen through a cliff, and as there was good an-
chorage in the vicinity. the III-ion fnrled her sails and came to a stop.
The (famed/a continued. with the evident, intention of sending a boat on
shore at another point. and making the exploration as extensive as possible.

Great flocks of birds were seen on the cliffs, and while the boat with
the Doctor and Fred was gone to explore the land, another carrying the
major and George went to lay in a stock of game for the table..ZD-hTAr-- why--Cu:

They rowed along towards the base. of the cliff, and as they did so a
sound reached their eats like the rumbling of a railway train or the fall
of a cascade. I: increased as they approached the clitf. and finally be-
came so loud that they could hardly hear each other. The noise was
made by the birds that had just begun their period of nesting, or. as
George expressed it after seeing the way the birds lay their eggs, "their
period of rocking."

" You observe,"

said the major, "that the face of the cliff consists of
a series of steps or ledges from one to two or three feet deep. These birds
are the lunuue, which we saw on President Land, and they are common
through all the arctic regions.

" The female lays only one egg. and this she deposits on the bare ledge
of rock. Look at the creatures and see how they are stowed away there."

George looked. and saw that the birds were sitting close together, with
their heads outward, but they were not keeping very quiet. In some
places they were packed in Solid rows, and so near were they to each
other that where the ledges were narrow and frequent they almost hid the
face of the reek from view.

"The female bird can only cover her egg by placing it upright," the
major continued. "This she does with her bill, and then she sits down
on it and waits for the hatching. If she doesn't keep quiet; she may top.
ple the egg over the ledge, where it is broken by the fall,and then she is
eggless.

"When she has lost her egg, she watches her chance to steal another.
The birds are obliged to leave their eggs occasionally in search of food,
and when one does so she generally finds on her return that some other
bird has stolen her property and is sitting upon it. She accuses somebody
of the theft, and there is a fight; and that's what all that noise is about.

"Sometimes the tight becomes general, and dozens of birds will be
engaged in it. In the tumult litany of their eggs are rolled over the elifi',
and the losers content themselves by stealing the titst they can seize. For
this reason one of these lunnue rookeries is the noisiest place you can
imagine."

The {inst shot sent a great many birds into the air, and for a time it
looked as though a cloud had come between the boat and the sun. F-vch
shot brought down several birds, and the work did not require any exercise
of skill. In a little while they had all the boat could carry, and then made
the best of their way back to the ship.

As there was no probability that the shore-party would return for sev-
eral hours, Captain Jones decided to change his anchorage and send outABUS DANCE 01" GAME. 2-H

two boats to secure more birds. The Gambctla anchored two or three
miles farther north than the Vivian, and sent a boat on shore; then she
fullewed the Vivian's example and sent two boats after luuunc, so that the
flocks were a good deal disturbed.

 

SHOOT! KG LI'MM E.

Two or three hours sufficed to supply both ships with all the birds they
wanted. The lunune is lea: desirable than the duck as an article of food,
but he is a great deal better than nu hird at all. Officers, men, and (lags
had all the hnntne they wanted, and the feast was enjuyed by all con-
corned.

The shore-parties had been ordered not to remain on land more than
ten or twelve hours, and to return innnediately in case of a signal to do
so. A snow-squall arose, but was of short duration. and as there was
enough to do in examining the coast where the ships were lying, the ex-
plorers on land were allowed to stay the full time allotted to them.

Twelve hours after their departure Fred and the Doctor returned;
they were pretty well tired out with their excursion, and had excellent ap-
petites for the dinner which awaited them. They reported that the land
was principally a mass of rock, and they had been able to go only about
two miles from where they left the boat. They had gone to the rear of
the cliff, which they estimated to be not far from live hundred feet high,
and found that there was a 'ange of hills in the interior, bordering abroad
valley filled with a glacier. It was the same glacier they had seen in the
bay, and was much wider where they saw it than at its entrance into the
sea. Through an opening in the hills they could see another glacier, but
could give no estimate as to its extent.

Of course they hoisted their flag,r at the highest point they reached, and
allowed it to wave for several minutes in the arctic breeze. The Doctor
gave the name of "Mount Lincoln " to the peak, but the naming of the
land, of whose extent they could not be certain, was courteously left for
their French allies.

As soon as the boat returned from shore the Vivian made sail, and
hoisted the signal "we wish to cmnnnmicate." The Gumbettw remained
at her anchorage, and the View>>, stopped again within five hundred yards
or so of her consort. Meantime, while the Vivian was changing her posi-
tion, the Gambcttw's boat returned, and the Doctor went on board the
1"r'neh ship to cmnparo notes, and ascertain what name would be given
to their latest discovery.

Captain Girard felt; highly complimented at the politeness of the
Americans, and after a. brief conference it was decided that. the new land
should be set down on their chart as "La Terra Lqflq/utte" (Lafayette
Land). The position was fixed at latitude 87deg 10' north, longitude 112deg
50' west.

Less than three degrees from the pole!

The French explorers had discovered a glacier, evidently identical with
the one seen by the Doctor and Fred. They had found the rocks very
difficult of ascent, and though keeping a sharp lookout for bears, musli-
oxen, and other animals, they had seen none. One of the Frenclunen
found the t'acks of a bear, but the animal that made them was evidently
far away. At all events he did not show himself, and the party returned
without any trophies of the chase.

Then the Doctor returned to the Vivian, and the two ships filled awayCAUGHT IN A FOG. 2-19

on their voyage to the North. It was understood that they would follow
the coast unless it trended too far to the westward, but neither was to be
hampered by the movements of the other. As far as they could see, the
coast-line was about north and south, and if it continued in that direction
it would not carry them out of their way.

 

\'ll;\\' [5 LAFAYETTE LAND.

On they went, but unforeseen difficulties arose. They had not been
three holus under way when a dense fog set in, and compelled them to
lay to. What with the ice and the unknown coast it would be dangerous
to go on; any moment they might come in collision with an iceberg or be
dashed on the rocks, and either fate was not. to be risked. The fog lay
thick about them for several hours, and when it lifted, the Vivian. was un-
pleasantly near a jutting headland, which terminated in a mass of rough
and ugly rocks. The Gumbel/a was about a mile to the eastward, and close
under her lee lay a huge iceberg, towards which the ship was slowly drift-
ing. Evidently the escape was a narrow one for both navigators!

The sounding-10ml showed a depth of eighty or a hundred fathoms in
some places, and not more than half that amount a short distanee away.
The bottom of the sea was as uneven as. the land in its neighborhood, and
any minute they might, come on a rocky islet, with no shoals around it to
give warning of its proximity.

The fog cleared away :md they made sail again. When they had
gone three or four miles, the GIN/Mattie suddenly backed her sails and
made signal "'1 am aground." The Vivien answer-d that she would go250 Tin-z vovxen or 'rln: --v1vi_\x."

" Lucky it. wasn't a rock instead ol' a shoal," said Captain Jones as they
dropped the (J'Itllllh'l/d'a' cable and saw it. pulled on board. "I think we
want water more than land, and we'll give the shore a wide berth."

The Vivian headed off in a north-easterly direction, and the (hem/[elm
did likewise. In a couple of hours they had a hundred and fifty fatholns
under their keels, and no sign of rocks or shoals. Then Captain Jones
ordered the northerly course to be resumed, but commanded the officer
of the deck to maintain their present distance front laud. " If you tind
we're making it closer than ten miles 'aid be, "you will steer to the
eastward. Keep a sharp lookout for islands or icebergs, and give 'em all
the oiling they want."

Steaming cautiously along when the weather favored, and slowing
down or stopping altogether in fogs or squalls, the ships advanced to the
north. In clear weather the land was distinctly visible over the port side.
but too far off for detailed observation. It seemed to be a series of cliffs
and headlands, with now and then a stretch of comparatively level land
of two or three miles. George thought: he saw a house at. the base of one
of the hills, but a careful observation showed it to be a mass of rock curi-
ously shaped like a lunnan habitation. Fred was not to be outdone in
discoveries, and excitedly announced that he had found a church over-
looking a small village at the edge of one of the sloping plains. But the
telescope brought him to grief as readily as it had disappointed George:
the church and village were clusters of large rocks, evidently deposited by

   

a glacier or swept down by a flood in ages gone by.

Every few miles the white face of a glacier was visible, and the origin
of the icebergs that abounded in the waters was no longer a mystery.

All things have an end, and this voyage to the North-pole was not to
be an exception to the rule. Three days after the grounding of the (1am-
Mm there was unusual excitement on board the l'ician, and we may
presume that. the same was the case on the French ship.

The ship's position was announced as latitude 89c 30' north, longitude
111deg west. The pole was only thirty miles away !

But this was not all. On their left the land scented to terminate in a
conical mountain eight or ten thousand feet high, and from the top of this
mountain :1 column of smoke and steam floated away on the wind.SYMMES'S HOLE. 2251

 

AN AIKUUC VOLCANO.

"Who would have thought there was a volcano at the pole l" said one
of the youths, as he gazed upon the novel spectacle.

"Better, :1 good deal, than Syuuues's Hole," remarked the Doctor, in
reply. "Better for us, at any rate."

"Please tell us about Syumies's Hole," said George. "Who was
Symmes, and what was his theory '5"

"John C-leres Symmes was born in New Jerser about 1780," Dr.
Touuer answered, "and died in Hamilton, Ohio, in 1629.

"He was a captain in the United States Army, who fought bravely
and honorably through the war of 1512 and was afterwards engaged in
supplying the troops on the upper Mississippi with provisions. For the
last ten years of his life he devoted himself to the elaboration of his theo-
ries eolmerning,r the formation of the earth, and making them known to
the public by lectures and pamphiets."

"' \Vas he what they call a 'erauk ' in these modern times?" one of the
youths inquired.

" It is not always easy to define the boundary between the scientific
theorist and the crank," answered the Doctor, "and so I cannot answer
your question by a simple 'yvs' or 'uo.'

"Captain Symmes believed that the. earth was a hollow globe, open at
the poles, the southern opening being,' somewhat larger than the northern2.32 'rnt: VOYAGE or THE "rtvnx."

one. According to his theory the shell of the earth was about a thousand
miles thick. and the northern opening two thousand miles in diameter.
Take an orange four inches in diameter, with a very thick rind, cut holes
at top and bottom. each of them one inch across, scoop out the interior
till only the thick rind is left, and you have a fair idea of the shape of the
earth according to Captain Symmes."

" Int what. did he have on the inside of his globe T" Said Fred.

"The inside was composed of land and water, like the outside," was
the reply. " It was warmed and lighted by the sun shining in through the
openings, first at one end of the earth and then at the other. The waters
flowed through these openings, just as the currents flow on the outside, and
his theory was that only by such a formation of the earth could the equa-
torial, Gulf Stream.and polar currents be satisfactorily accounted for. The
inhabitants of the inside of the earth, if there were any, lived on a concav-
ity, just as we live on a convexity, and they had land and water in about
the same proportions as ourselves.

"Captain Symmes brought forward a formidable array of facts in
support of his theory, and he had a great many followers. llis ideas were
based on scientific reasoning, however incorrect may have been his deduc-
tions, and his pamphlets were read with interest at the time. He delivered
his lectures in various parts of the country, principally in the west; in the
winter of 1826--27 he lectured before the faculty of Union College. and
was listened to with profound respect by the well-known doctols,linott
and "'ayland. lidicnle was excited by the peculiarity of his them-y, and
' Synnnes's Ilole' became a bvaord; but there is no doubt that he was a
man of intelligence, honor, and integrity. IIe secured the attention of
the scientific and scholarly men of his day, and was so confident of the
correctness of his theory that he offered to command an expedition to
verify it."

At times the clouds closed in upon the volcano and concealed it from
sight, and at others only the sharp cone at the summit was visible. Our
young friends longed to go on shore and be the first to ascend this hither-
to unknown mountain, but the suggestion was not favorably received
" \Ve will visit the pole first of all," said Connuander Bronson, "and then,
if circumstances favor, we'll explore the land in the vicinity. The oppor-
tunity to get to the pole does not come every day."

They left the smoking mountain behind them as they moved onward
towards the north. Before them the sea was stipplcd with fragments and
patches of ice, but there was no indication of Sulltl earth. The Gumball"

began to recede, Captain Jones observed that. the cloud of smoke from the
French funnel was becoming more dense, and the ship was increasing hcr
speed. Just as he (lid so the fog fell around them, and the debetta was
hidden from sight.

" The I-'rcnclnnan's trying to beat us to the pole," said the captain, as
he sprang to the speaking-tube counnimicating with the engineer.

 

A \'IE'I' THROUGH "IR CLOUDS.

What he said to the engineer was not audible to those on deck, as they
were too far from the bridge to hear distinctly, but its efi'eet was to in-
crease the speed of the Vivian. As soon as the steam could perform its
work the screw was making its maximum number of revolutions every
minute. The captain caught the first. puff of a breeze on his cheek, and
instantly gave the order for making sail. In five minutes the sails were
filled, and away went the Vivian. at the highest speed she had made since
passing the icy barrier.

"\Ve'll show him a trick or two," said the captain, displaying more
excitement than was his custom. " We got that breeze just in time, and
if we can lead him a couple of miles before the fog lifts he'll have hard
work to make it up. A stern chase is a long chase."

The man at the wheel had plenty of occupation. The lookonts were
continually announcing cakes of ice, and the captain had to think quickly
in giving his orders. For two or three hundred yards around the ship
there was comparatively clear vision, but beyond it they had to trust to
good-fortune. The smaller cakes were not heeded, but. the larger ones re-
quired to be treated with respect, for fear of serious consequences.

For more than an hour this excitement ctmtinued, and then the fog
lifted. There was the (iamlwtla, with her engines working at their best,
but she had neglected to make use of her sails; the result was she was
fully a mile :Lstcrn of the Vivian, and before she could follow the latter's
example and spread her sails another half mile had been lost.

And the pole was less than ten miles away!

"Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye!" said the captain, waving his hand
in the direction of the Gambctla. "The Ameri -an flag will be the first
to float over the pole."

Land was announced on the port bow. The captain mounted to the
crew's-nest, and soon descended with the report that there appeared to be
an island in the direction indicated. As well as he could make out, it was
a mass of conical peaks with a volcano in the centre; but considering that
it didn't cover the pole, he was not concerned about it for the present.

To the surprise of every one, the disappearance of the fog was followed
by the ('lisappearance of the ice. Hardly a speck was visible in front of
them, and there was no hinderance to their progress. As there was no
chance that the Gum/101m could pass them, the sails were taken in one by
one, but they were only partially clewed up, lest their rival might steal a
march on them by an unexpected slant of the wind. Occasionally the
engines were slowed a little to enable the crew to take soundings, but as
no bottom could be found with thirty fathoms of line, it was considered
safe to go ahead again at full speed.

The elements combined in favor of our friends, as the clouds and fog
rolled away and gave them a clear horizon all around. The horizon seemed
farther off than usual, but whether this was the effect of imagination. or
the peculiarity of the atmosphere, or because the earth is flattened at the
poles, nobody could say. Whether the sun was stationary or not, as Cap-
taiu IIall claimed it. would be at the pole, they were then unable to de-
termine, but, with the activity that prevailed in the use of instruments, a
speedy solution of the problem was likely. All the quadrants and sex-
tauts that the ship contained had been brought on deck, and were beingTut-1 rota; AT LAST! 255

No stars to aid them while the sun was shining, but fortunately the moon
was in the heavens, and proved of great. assistance to the navigators in
determining their position.

\\'hales and seals played about the ship itt great numbets, and flocks
of birds filled the air. The pole was far from being a scene of desolation,
so far as animal life was concerned; the captain endeavored to he calm,
but: when the whales in their total absence of fear lazily rolled on the sur-
face within fifty yards of the Vivian, he could not help thinking what
havoc he would make if his mission had been for oil instead of science.

When the (-ln'onomcter indicated twenty-two minutes past three o'clock
in the afternoon (Greenwich time) of the ninth day of June, the Vivian
described a circle in the Arctic Sea, and then stopped her engines. The
-aptain announced that they were exactly over the North-pole.

The ship was dressed in hunting, the American flag being at the fore,
and the tricolor holding the place of second honor. The sailots mounted

CHAPTER XVIII.

DISCOVERIES AT THE POLE--LEAVING THE POLAR SHA.--ESt'.\l'E TIIROl'GlI THE
IL'E-IMRRIl-ZIL

i ()R a description of the land discovered by the Vivian. as she ap-
proached the pole. and of the scientific observations made by both
ships during their stay in the open polar sea, We must ask the readers in-
dulgence. We are permitted to state, ln'nvever, that nothing out. of the
usual order of things was found there. Disappointment awaits those who
have supposed that the North-pole is nothing mote than a flag-staff firmly
set in the earth at the point where there is neither latitude nor longitude.
()ne of the sailors of the Viv/mt was possessed with this idea, which he
expressed in the hearing of Frank. The young gentleman good-uaturedly
endeavored to uudeeeive the illiterate mariner, and made the followng
explanation :

" The word ' pole,' as applied to this part of the earth, does not mean a
staff or pole of wood. It is derived from the Greek miAng (polos), which
in 'ans a pivot 0- axis, and is supposed to be the pivot on which the earth
turns around once in twenty-four homs."

" lint. I don't see any pivot at all," responded the sailor; " and if there's
a shaft for the world to turn on, it seems to me there ought to be a gudgeon
for it to turn in."

Fred abandoned the attempt to give instruction in physical geography
to one who was so literal; he contented himself with the reflection that
the sailor was not alone in believing that the axis of the earth is something
more than imaginary.

Disappointment. also awaits those who have imagined that the open
polar sea is more like the tropics than the arctic regions. It. is warmer
there than farther sontln as had been established by the observations of
several explorers previous to the Vivian} voyage, but it is by no means
like the (inlf of Mexico or the Sea of Arabia, as some writers would have
us believe. The birds that. li)' to the north make their summer homes
and their nests on the islands of the polar sea, but. at the approach of

17
winter they retreat to the southwanl, like the feathered inhabitants of
Greenland and Labrador.

Birds are very abundant on all the islands of the polar se: , as naviga--
tors have long believed through observing the vast numbers that fly north-
ward. There is no one to disturb
them, and they can breed in perfect:
security,so fa ' as the presence of man
is concerned. The arctic foxes may
trouble their nests occasionally, but

the number they can devour, in the egg or out of it, can make no per-
ceptible impr ssion on the size of the tloeks. The fox goes long distances
in search of food, and generally knows where it is to be obtained. It isUEORG E'S CARRIER-PIGEONS. 259

probable that he exists through all the islands of the far North, and might
tell the story of the pole if he could speak or write.

One day George made a suggestion, which was adopted by Commander

ll'onson, and also by Captain Girard as soon as he heard of it.

" Ilcrc are these birds all about us," said George, "and they'll go
south at the end of their breeding season. Suppose we catch as many as
we can, and mark their wings with the date of ollr reaching the pole, and
the name of the ship; we can do this when there is nothing else to occupy
our time; and, besides, it will not draw our attention from the scientific
work, as the catching and marking can be done by the sailms. If we
should be so unfortunate as not to escape from this polar sea, or be de-
layed here for a winter or two, perhaps one of these birds will be the
means of telling how far we came to the north.

 

M.\|IKIMSS .\ l'Atuunlt-l'louus.

"They mark the wings of carrier-pigeons in the way I propose," he
continued, "and it. will he an easy matter to do so with these birds. Of
course there is not one chance in a thousand, or even ten thousand, that
one of them will fall into the hands of anybody who will find the mark,
and know what it means; but that is a risk we must take."

Stamps similar to those used in post-offices were prepared from mov-
able types, giving the names of the ships and the dates of their reaching
the pole; after that time, whenever a binl not needed for food was taken,
the mark was placed on his wing and he was liberated. Indelible ink26" THE \'()\';\(il'2 til" 'l'lll-I "VIVIAN."

was used for the stamping, so that the mark could not be washed out by
the sea-valcr. The birds objected to the business, and frequently the
sailors were sc'atehed and bitten in a way that would have discouraged
persons less hardy than they were after their winter in the . The men
considered it capital sport, and while the exploring and surt ving parties
were busy on the islands, the sailors occupied themselves with the con-
version of geese, ducks, mollemokes, :ntks,lnnnne, and other feathered deni-
zens of the polar regions, into carrier-pigeons.

On one of the islands where they were looking for birds, the major
and George found a vein of excellent coal coming out close to the water's
edge. The discovery was reported to Commander Bronson and Captain
(li-ard, and an examination of the specimens showed that the coal was
identical with what the Vivian's bunkers had been filled when she left
San Francisco.

Already there had been anxiety at the consntnption of fuel, and this
discovery was of great. importance. The ships were taken into the little

 

bay where the coal was found, mining operations were begun, and in a
few days every available place on the Vivian. and (I'm/100th: was filled
with fuel.

As the end of July approached it became necessary to consider the
future. Should they pass a winter in the polar sea or make their \'ay
out at once, if possible?

The ships had remained nominally in company after the coaling \'as
completed, though frequently out: of sight of each other among the islands
around the pole, or driven apart by the winds. It was understood that
when separated they Would endeavor to meet again at the spot where they
last exchanged signals. It was further undetstood that if a ship was not
at the rendezvous four days after the last exchange of signals, she would
not be there for four days more; but unless she was there at the end of
the second four days, she was detained by accident or stress of weather.
The plan worked very well, and at each meeting notes of the surveys were
exchanged, and lunch valuable information \'as obtained relative to the
winds and currents, by means of simultaneous observations in different
localities.

()n the 26th of July they made a rendezvous in front of the volcanic
island which was discovered when the ships first aplu'oached the pole.
It was a collection of sharp coni -al peaks, of which the central one was
an active volcano. Ordinarily there was little more than a thin cloud of
smoke and steam pouring from its summit, but when the Vivian ap-
proached it on the 26111 of July it was more active than usual.AN IN'rlam-zs'nxe SPECTACLE. 261

 

.\ VOLCANIL' L'Iil'l'l IUN.

" It looks as though we might witness a polar eruption," said Fred, . s
they regarded the volcano front the deck of the ship.

"' Yes," replied George, "a pyrotechnic display in honor of our fare-
well."

As they drew near they found the violence increasing. Columns of
smoke and steam rose high in air, and formed a dense cloud fllNH'c them;
ashes fell on the Vivian's deck, and with the aid of their glasses they
could see stones ejected with great force, as though thrown from a cannon.
A stream of lava poured down the side of the mountain, and reached the
sea at the end of a uarrow hay at its base. There were loud reports, re-
sembling the crashing of whole batteries of artillery fired at once. and
altogether the scene was like what may be witneficd at; the eruption of a
volcano in more accessihle regions.

Both the youths desired to go on shore, and asked the permission of
the commander to do so. liut the request. was refused, and strict orders
were given that. no boat should leave the ship except for Communication
with the debctta. There was nothing' peculiar about this polar erup-
tion, and it. was not. deemed prudent, under the circumstances, to risk an
accident. which might. prove very serious.

The Gnu/(161m met the Fir/(m, at the time and place agreed: Captain
(iirard came on board the l'zrirm with two of his Uillcol's, and there was262 THE VOYAGE or '1'111-: -1v1v1.\x."

a conference of an hour or more on the subject of their future movements.
lt was afrreed that no wood was to be gained h\' spendin-r a winter in the
-\1'etie Sea sutlicient to compensate for the attendant dan1ger,11nd it was
adfisable to 1ret out of it before tl1e1'11l1eut of the se1 tsou of cold and
darkness.

"There are two routes we can follow," said Commander Bronson:
" we can try that by Spitzbergen, or the one through Smith's Sound.

" If we enter the ice- barrier, hr following the meridian of Gr'eeuwieh, '
he continued, " we shall come \erv nearlv upon the trza1k of Parry, where
he found the 111.0 dr ift.in1g1 south almost as fast' as he prom'essed to the north.'

" Tree Men," remarked Captain (iirard.

"And by following the meridian of 130deg west," Commander Bronson
responded, " we shall strike the ice-belt in the line of the farthest northiugg
of the Nares expedition of 1375--76. Then if we are fortunate in tiuding
a passage through the barrier we shall enter Robeson Channel, and thence
go through Kennedy Channel to Smith's Sound. Once there we have a
well-known route before us through Baflin's .llay, Davis's Strait, and the
Atlantic Ocean, to an aneho 'age in New 'ork harhor. "

"(,'L at only/11.71pm," answered the I'rench captain. "Je 12171101113 [as
Jew: routes."

Connuander Bronson thought well of the proposition, and it was ar-
111nged that the Gum/mud should endeavor to find her way out of the polar
sea by the route of Spitzberfg'eu, while the Vivian would seek the passage
through Smith's Sound. Each would carry despatches and letters for the
other, and, in order to aim time for their prepa '11tion, the ships were to
meet four (lays late', at or near latitude 87deg north, longitude 30" west.
At that point they would separate, and each was to make the best of its
way homeward.

For the next four days writing materials were in great demand on
board the Vivian, and we may be sure the same was the case on the (lam-
ltetta. The letters and ofiicial despatehes were carefully enclosed in a ruh-
her bag, whose outside bore in conspicuous letters the address of the Navy
Department, \Vashiugtnn. It \'as to he delivered to the American consul
at the tirst port of Europe reached by the (I'm/11mm, and forwarded thence
to its destination.

The ships met as 111greed,thele'~terb111gs were excl1a111ged,and then each
steered away on its own course. ] lags were dipped and guns fired, and
the oflicers and men of both vessels cheered themselves into a coudititm
of hnskiuess before the fresheuing breeze carried them out of each other's
hearing. Would they ever meet again '5IN SIGHT or cmxr LAND. 263

Just beyond the 86th parallel a large island compelled the Vivian to
make a (1(2er to the eastward, and when she turned again to the south
she found the ice increasing in quantity. Careful olmervatiou showed that
it was drifting to the south, and the gallant craft boldly entered the pack,
aml trusted herself to be carried where it chose to take her.

Steam was raised on the engines as soon as the Vivian entered the ice,
and every advantage was taken of lanes of water, or breaks ill the pack, to
work the ship to the south. The pack was not a close one, and the skill of
Captain Jones as an iceApilot, combined with the efliciency and persever-
ance of his officers and crew, gave a good result. By the noon observation
on the 5th of August they were in latitude 34deg 35' north, longitude 60deg
10' west. Seventy-five miles farther they would be at the highest point
reached by the Nares expedition.

The ice now closed in, so that the engines were of little use, and the
tires were put out. The usual precautions for escape in case of the loss of
the ship were taken, and the deck was piled with provisions, clothing, and
materials for a journey over the ice, in the same way as on the previous
winter. For the present there was no great danger, as the ice was not: as
heavy as that which surrounded them to the north of llerald Island. But
it was proper to be prepared for anything that might happen, and every-
body was ordered to have his knapsack ready at his side whenever he lay
down to sleep.

To deseribe the experience of our friends in the ice-pack would he tell-
ing over again the story of their drift to the uortlnvard, before their release
in front of President Land. Their progress was slow, often not more than
three or four miles a day, but sometimes it reached fifteen or twenty miles.
()n the 20th of August the coast of Grant Land was in full view, and on
the 23d a sledge expedition was sent out in charge of Major Clapp, with
instructions to visit the land and seek the traces of previous navigators.

According to the calculations they were close to Cape Sherman, and the
little harbor where the Aim-e passed the winter.

The major was accompanied by Fred and two sailors, with a team of
fifteen dogs and one of the (lt'l\'( ; these (logs were all that remained
of the original forty. Some had died of disease, others had strayed front
the ship at different times. and four had jumped overboard while the Viv-
ian. was cruising in the polar sea.

The major was instructed to observe carefully the bearings of the ship.
and during his absence :1 large tlag was kept constantly flying. lle reached
the land after about forty hours" travelling, and found that their calcula-
tions were correct. A cairn supposed to have been erected by the Aim-PS13
crew was discovered; but though it was carefully taken down, no record
could he found. The major killed a musk-ox in good condition, and the
whole party was regaled upon the flesh of the animal. Choice steaks were
reserved, and brought back in sufficient quantity to supply the cabin table
for a single dinner.

 

A \"HALEoSlIII' IN "'INTIZR Ql'AflTliks.

The expedition was absent three days and a half, and in the mean time
the Vivian drifted about fifteen miles to the south. The season was so
late that the chance of getting through Smith's Sound was very doubtful;
already the weather was cold, and the young ice, wherever there were an y
open spaces, formed to a. thickness of two inches in a few hours when the
wind was not blowing.

On the lst of September they were fairly within Robeson Channel.
For a week the ice seemed to be very nearly stationary, and Commander
Bronson determined to look for a good place for passing the winter, as it.
was pretty certain that Kennedy Channel would close before they could
reach it. .

Under the influence of a strong," wind from the north, the pack broke
sufficiently to allow the ship to be warped through several leads close up
to the eastern shore. A favorable opportunity offered to get the Viriuu
into Polaris Bay, and it was promptly embraced; immediately afterwardsWIS'I'ERLVU 1x POLARIS BAY. 265

the ice shut in Solidly to the south, and it was decided to pass the winter
where they were.

The Vivian \'as laid up about a mile from where the Polaris passed
the winter of 1871--72, and there she remained until the following July.
She was housed over in the same way as on the previous winter, and a
high bank of snow was built around her. This bank of snow is a great
protection against the cold, and makes a great economy of fuel during the
long hibernation. The Hudson's Bay and other northern whaleis invari-
ably surround their ships with snow while lying up during the winter,
and sometimes they give the embankment the appearance of a miniature
fort.

Fred and George were greatly interested when they learned they were
at the scene of Captain Hall's last winter ill the far North. As soon as
they could obtain permission they visited his grave, which they had no dif--
lieulty in finding through the description by Captain Tyson. They found

that the board originally placed there had been blown (lowu by the wind.
altd the inscription almost wholly obliterated. The brass tablet, which
was placed at the foot of the grave by the Nares Expedition, was nudis-
tnrbed. The tablet was prepamd in England, and the inscription closes
with the Words, "Erected by the British l'olar Expedition of 1875, who,
following in his footsteps, have profited by his experience."

Another board was prepared, with a copy of the inscription taken from
the old one, as follows:

LATE COMMANDER OF THE NORTH POLAR EXI'EDITION.
DIED NOV. 8. t87l.
AG ED 50 X' LLRS.

""hen this board was ready all the officers and sailors of the Vivien.
who could be spared from duty went in procession to the grave of the
zealous explorer, and solemnly placed the memorial at the head of his last
resting-place. All were silent while Commander Bronson pronounced a
brief eulogy in honor of the man whose earnestness, perseve-auce, and
endurance are familiar to all those who have studied the history of arctic
explorations. Their memories went back to that sad occasion in the long
darkness of the arctic winter when the crew of the Polarit- buried the re-
mains of their late conunander. Ilere is the :ccount in Captain Tyson's
journal:

"Xm'. ll.--.\t haleast eleven this morning we placed all that was mortal of our late ('qu-
mander in the frozen ground. Even at that hour of the div it was almost. dark, so that i had to
hold a lantern for Mr. Bryan to read the players. ' ut,
unless. perhaps, the steward and molt. It was a gloomy day, and well befitting the event. The
place, also, is rugged and desolate in the extreme. .tway otl', as far as the dim light enables us to
see, we are bound in by huge masses of slate rock, which stand like a barricade, guarding the bar.

   

'c all the ship's company was pre

frozen waters of Polaris Bay. the show strewn with great ice-IuIm-ks. The little hut w Ill'il they
call an observatory bears alol't, upon a tall flag-stall. the only cheering object in sight; and that is
sad enough to-day, for the stars and stripes droop nt half-mast.

" As we went to the grave this morning. the eeflin h lied on a sledge, over which

Lest we might weary our readers we will pass hrietl y over the Vivian's
second winter in the ice. The ingenuity of everybmly was taxed to the
utmost to make the long night pass without the. inroads of physical and
mental disease amontz.r the officers and crew, and it is our pleasure to record
that the effort was successful. Hunting parties were organized wheneverl..\.\T HONORS TO A "RAVI". 3|.\.\'.

 

m- nun. w rmux mu.
circumstances favored; there were skating, leapfrog, base-ball, and other
games in the open air; theatrical and other entertainments were given, as
in the previous winter; classes were organized for instruction in various
branches of education; lectures were delivered; and altogether, as the
chronicles record, "the season passed off pleasantly." There was not a
single case of serious illness in the entire crew, and nobody "sulked" or
became despondent. What an.improvement over the experiences of arctic
wintering a hundred years ago!

The spring came and then the summer, or rather the spring ran so
quickly into summer that it required a quick observer to note the period
of transition. When the sun returned above the horizon, several expedi-
tions were sent out to explore the interior of the country; but they added
nothing of consequence to the data of previous navigators. A sharp look-
out was kept for the first sign of open water, and after the middle of June
no one was allowed to go far from the ship.

By the lst of July there was open water both north and south of
Polaris Bay, but the ship still remained in her winter position. The ice-
drift had begun some time before, and the movement through Robeson
Channel into Hall's Basin, and thence into Kennedy Channel, was continu-
ous. 0n the 3d of July the ice in the buy broke in many places, and
on the morning of the 4th the Vivien was free. The anniversary of
American independence was henceforth to be doubly remembered by
every individual of the ship's company!

The wind carried the ice out of the bay, and the Vivian. followed it.
Until the head of Kennedy Channel was reached, the water was compara-
tively clear; steam was ordered on the engines, and with its aid they made
good progress and passed Cape Morton, at the end of I'etermann Peninsula.
Beyond this cape the channel was thickly blouked with ice, and the engines
were powerless to force the vessel through it.

Captain Jones watched his opportunity and made fast to a flee, in a
position similar to that taken by the Vivian when beset in the ice of?
Herald Island. Thus protected from danger of a "nip," the vessel drifted
south with the ice through Kennedy Channel into Smith's Sound, the speed
varying from one to one and tln'ee-quarter miles an hour. 011 the fourth
day after leaving the winter position the Vivian was fairly in Smith's
Sound, and the opening of the ice allowed her to make use of her engines
once more.

She passed near Rensselaer Harbor, where Dr. Kane winter-ed with the
Advance during 1853--55. Here she was caught again in the ice, and drift-
ed through Smith's Channel past Port Foulke, a well-known name in arcticA GATEWAY TO THE pom-z. 069

chronology. It is the plaee where Dr. llayes wintered in 1860--61, in the
schooner Unilal Sluice. From that point he made a sledge journey over
the ice, and reached latitude 81deg 37' north. Dr. llayes was a firm believer
in the open polar sea, and down to the time of his death he entertained
the hope of one day reaching the pole by way of Smith's Sound.

 

DH. 1. 1. "AYES.

Littletou Island is at the narrowest part of Smith's Sound, in latitude
78deg 24' north. Of late yeais it has been a place of deposit of coal and
stores for exploring expeditions, and it contains a post-office where ships
may obtain information of each other. Commander Bronson desired to
visit the island, and accordingly the Vivian steamed into a little nook not
far from the scene of the loss of the Polaris, and nearly opposite Lifeboat
Cove, where Dr. Kane found shelter. As the VII-[4m dropped her anchor.
two skiu~clad forms came out from amour;r the rocks a quarter of a mile
away and advanced to the water's edge. Soon as a boat could be lowered
the commander and Major (L'lapp went on shore, and were eagerly wel-
comed by "the whole population."

The inhabitants included the two individuals already mentioned, theAN iARCTlC POST-Ot't-'ICt-Z. 271

first strangers our friends had seen since leaving the coast of Siberia.
They 'proved to be lnnuits or Eskimos, and luckily one of them had
worked on an American whaleship, and could speak enough English to
make himself understood. lIe and his companion had come over from
the main-land two or three days before, and were preparing to leave when
they saw the Vivian.

They guided our friends to a heap of coal, which had been left there
the previous year by an American supply-ship, in accordance with the ar-
rangements mentioned in the early part of this book. It was protected
front the weather by a roof of flat stones, and on one side of the roof
were painted the directions for finding the " Littleton Island Post-otliee."
Appended to the directions were the words, " don't allow natives to accom-
pany you."

Signal was made fo' another boat to cotne ashore, and in a few min-
utes it was dancing over the \'ater and among the cakes of icey bringing
Dr. 'l'olmer with Fred and George. The situation was quickly explained.
and while the youths went with the natives to see the spot where the
Polaris- went ashore. the elders of the party sought the lmst-otlice.

It was a hole in the solid rock, about a foot square and two feet deep.
To its mouth was titted an iron door, fastened in its place with cement.
and so Solid was the construction that no tools lmssessed by the natives
could make an impression on it. The surface of the door was studded
with the heads of bolts:' turning two of these one quarter round, accord-
ing to the printed directions issued by the Navy Department to arctic ex.
ploring ships, and then sliding two others front the sides towards the
ecntm, ("omntauder lh'onsou unlocked the door of the safe where the
letters were concealed.

the door was relocked. The bolts were rusty, and the operation had re-

Before Captain Ilnddington left he gave the wreck of the steamer and
everything on shore to the chief of the Eskimos, but shortly after the trans-
fer the steamer broke loose from her moorings in a gale and drifted out
to deep water, where she sank. The natives were obliged to content them-
selves with what was left on shore, but they mourned earnestly the loss of
the ship and the abundant store of wood of which she was constructed.

TIII-I SIGNAL SERVICE STATIUX--'I-'RUM LITTLETOX ISLAND T0 I'PERNAVIK.

4'VIDI'INTLY the post-ofliee on Littletou Island was not extensively
patronized, as it. contained only three letters and a newspaper, the
latter more than a year old. The letters were for the use of any one who
choose to read them; they recorded the visits of exploring ships, but there
was no news of special interest to our friends. There was a. memorandum
concerning the signal service party under Lieutenant Greely, which is
known to the readers of the newspapers as " Tile Greely Colony."

Commander anson read this paper tarefully, and then explained
as follows, partly in his own words and partly from the notes:

" Lieutenant \l'eypreeht, of the Austrian North-pole Expedition, recom-
mended that a ring of observing stations should he placed around the
pole, as near as was consistent with safety, [or the purpose of making
meteorologieal observations for the period of one year. Ilis plan included
the joint action of several nations, and at the three International Polar
Conferences, held at IIanthurg, in 1879, at llerue, in 1-380, and at St.
Peteisburg, in 1881. the progmnnue and details were settled. .-\t the last
meeting it was decided to delay the beginningr of the enterprise from 1351.
as first, proposed, until 1382. Preparations had been made in the United
States. however, for carrying out the original progrannne, and in the sum-
mer of 1881 two expeditions set out, one for the northernmost point of
Alaska, under Lieutenant I'. ll. Ray. the other. under Lieutenant A. \\'.
(ireely, for Discovery llarhor, Lady Franklin llay, 81deg 50' north latitude.
and (35deg west longitude, 500 miles from the pole. The other ten stations
selected were Fort Ray. north of Manitoba, by the British; (.'quheuland
Island, north of Hudson's Ilay, by the Germans; (tomlhaab, (ireenlaud, by
the Danes; .Iau .\Iayen Island, by Austria; Spilzhergen. by the Swedes:
liosskopp. near North ('ape, by Norway ; a point near the White Sea, by
Finland: Nova Zombla, by the Russians, who had another station at the
mouth of the Lena Hirer in Siberia: and Dickson lIareu, near the month
of the Yeuisei Ili\'er, by the Dutch.

[8274 'rm-z mum-1 or 'J'nt: --\'t\'l.\.\'."

" The Dutch expedition failed to re: :h its destination,having been
'tlllgllt in the ice in the Kara Sea. Observations were made during the
winter, however, and the party made their escape when their vessel sank,
on the breaking up of the ice in the following summer.

"The most northerly of these stations was manned by otlieers and
men of the United States Signal Serfice, under eounnaud of lieutenant
(ireely, and they went there in the summer of 1881,:1. year in advance
of the rest. The expedition was carried to its destination on the. steamer
Proteus, and it was agreed that a ship should be sent to its relief in the
following year, or in the summer of 1883 at farthest."

" Then they have all been taken away by this time," one of the youths
remarked.

" Not yet," was the answer. "Lieutenant Greely was to start south by
the 1st of September, 1883, if no help reached him before that time, and
it had been arranged that the relief steamer should land stores at Littleton
Islam] on her way up. Thus, in case of the loss of the steamer, he would
accmnplish his retreat in boats or on sledges, and feel sure of finding stores
at Littleten Island. But this memoramlum says the relief steamer, the
I'l'uleus, the same that carried him north in 188], did not. stop here on
her way north, and she was crushed in the ice before she could reach Lady
Franklin Bay. ller crew returned to the south, and thus there was no
comnnmication with the men who had passed two winters in this very
high latitude."

" And what became of them '1"

" Hopes and feats are about equally balanced," was the connuamler's
answer. "We may believe that Lieutenant Greely remained at Lady
Franklin Bay for a third winter, and found sufficient food by killing
musk-cattle, bears, seals, and walrnses before winter set. in: or we may
think he started south, was relieved by the Eskimos of Cape York, and
reached the Danish settlements of Northern Greenland. Then there is
ground to fear that he and his men endeavored to carry out the programme
laid down for them, but perished of hunger on reaching Littleton lslaud
and liuding that the promise of a deposit of prm'isions had not been car-
ried out. Of course there has been a court of inquiry; everybody con-
cerned is endeamring to shift the responsibility on the shoulders of some-
body else, and with a. fair prospect of success."

"' What a pity we did not know about it when we were on our way
south I" one of the youths remarked.

"It is indeed," answered the commander. "as we might have searched
the bay and perhaps found the members of the observng party; besides,SEARCH FOR Tut-z GREELY COLONY. 275

we could have renewed our stock of fuel. There is said to be a fine seam
of anthracite coal at Discover' Harbor; some say it is the finest in the
world, and could furnish an inexhaustible supply for all the wants of
navigation."

" A very small seam would supply all that will be wanted for naviga-
tion hem," said Captain Jones, "and there is no chance that it can ever be
carried to another market."

" Well, at any rate," responded the major, " Lieutenant Greely did not
suffer for want of fuel."

" No, it was the existence of this vein of coal that caused the selection
of Lady Franklin Bay as an observing station. You may be sure there
have been plenty of denunciations of the selection since the mishap of
1883, and dozens of scientific men can demonstrate that it was unwise.

"Public attention has doubtless been roused by this time, and you may
be sure there will be plenty of relief sent in the summer of 1884:, perhaps
when it is too late. Some of the ships used for whale or seal fishing will
be bought or chartered, and sent here as soon as the season will permit."

A record of the visit of the Vivian was prepared, and then the whole
party returned to the island, carrying the letters and paper that had been
taken from the strong-box in the rock. The most interesting reading to
our friends. apart from the account of the signal service, was in a letter
from San Francisco, printed in the newspaper which was found in the
box. It gave a long account of the outfitting and departure of the Vivian,
and her voyage acroa' the Pacific Ocean. It said the latest news from her
had just arrived by a whaling ship, which received a bag of letters from
the Vivian in the vicinity of Herald Island. "According to what I can
learn of the contents of the letters," said the writer of the communication,
"the Vivian was about to enter the icy barrier in the hope of finding her
way to the pole. Perhaps she will come out through Smith's Sound, or
by way of Spitzbergen, and it is to be hoped the government will keep a
sharp watch for her, as it did for tho Jeannette in 1881." '

"Perhaps we shall meet a relief expedition before we get far from
here," said the commander, as he finished the printed letter. "Who knows
but they will send to this very island to find us 2"

"And we're ready to be found," said the major, "although we are not
sadly in need of relief."

 

" The author earnestly hopes to be able to add a note, It. the end of this volume. announcing
the saiety of the Greely party. Though not without misgivings, he believes they remained at Lady
l-'nmklin Bay during the winter of 1883--84, subsisting on the products of the country, as already
indicated. and came south in the spring to meet a relief party at Littleton Island or Upemnvik.
"If you see an opening in the ice, and a ehanee of getting away from
here," said the commander to the captain, as they started for the shore
again, "tire a gun and hoist the recall signal. We'll come back in a hurry,
and you can trip the anchor as soon as you see us on our way.

"We might take some of this coal," he continued, as they reached
the land, "but I don't: think we'll need it as badly as some that may come
after us. We've enough to get to Upernarik, unless we have a hard time
in the ice on our way down."

They returned the letters and paper to the box, and with them the rec-
ord of the Vivian's visit. Then they closed the box again, according to
the directions, and restored the Littleton Island I'ost-ofliuc to its original
condition. Of course they had been joined by their Eskimo friends as..

soon as they landed, but these fellows had been judiciously taken to one
side, and kept there by Fred and the major while the box was being closed.

Then they looked around for traces of the visit of any of the Greely
party, but found none. Evidently nobody had lived on,the island since
the crew of the Polaris \vintered there, with the exception of the wander-
ing Eskimos who had occasionally visited it for a very brief stay.

A gun from the steamer attracted their attention, and they hastened to
obey the signal. When they reached her side she was ready to start, and
before they had mounted to the deck the water was churned into foam by
the screw.

"There's an opening in the ice around the point," said the captain,
"and I want to make the most of it."

"Make it as fast as you like," answered the commander; "you can't
go south too rapidly for us.

" It was not far from this point," said he, "that the Polaris separated
from the floe party, as deseribed by Captain Tyson in his narrative. The
ship was drifting south with the ice, and was about opposite Littleton
Island on the fifteenth day of October. A gale arose, the ship was nipped
by the ice, and there was great fear that she would be crushed and sank.
Boats and provisions had been placed on the ice in anticipation of such
an event, and while Captain Tyson and eighteen others were engaged in
arranging things, so as to save as much as possible, the ship, to use his
words, ' broke away in the din-lines and was lost to sight in a moment 3'

"It was in the night, and a fearful snow-storm was raging. Some of
the men were left on small cakes of ice, but were gradually brought to-
gether by their sh-ipmatcs, who made good use of the boats for this work.
When all were assembled the boats were hauled on the ice, and everybody
songht what shelter he could get till morning.

" It was in this way that the remarkable voyage of Tyson and his party
on the ice-flue had its beginning. Fortunately there were several natives
with Captain Tyson who undelstood how to catch seals, and it was on seal
and bear meat that the shipwrecked marinels mainly lived until they were
rescued. Let us hope that we may not have to repeat their experience by
a journey on an ice-flee."

As the Vivian steamed away from her anchorage, she was followed a
short distance by one of the natives whom they had left on shore. He was
an object of great curiosity to our young friends, as they had not yet seen
an Eskimo in a skin canoe.

The skin canoe, or loyaclc, of the Eskimo is very much like the [middl-
of the inhabitant of North-eastern Siberia, both in shape and the materialAN Esxmo KYACK. 279

of which it is constructed. It is made of seal--skin stretched over a frame,
and is sharp at both ends; it eurves almost in the form ofa. bow from
stem to stern, and the occupant sits
in a hole near the centre. The skin
that forms the deck is drawn tight-
l_v around him, so that he suffers no
injury if the water breaks over the
boat.

The natives go fearlessly on the
water in these apparently frail boats,
and will often venture where the
white man hesitates with his strong-
er construetion of wood and iron.

or paddles, with blades at both ends;

along at a Wonderful rate.

" They perform curious feats with these l'yaelcs." said the major, as the
party were looking over the side of the ship and admiring the dexterity
with which the native handled his little craft.

" They will turn souieisanlts in the water," he continued, "and keep it
up a dozen times in succession."

0f emnse this assertion caused some surprise, and the major went on
to explain:

 

 

SOMIIZIKSAL'LT IS A KYACKC/280 'rut: \'HYAGIJ or 'rm-z ~\'l\'l.~\.\'."

" It is proper to say that only a few can do it, and they never make the
attempt unless a friend is present with his l'yue/c to render any needed
assistance.

"I once saw a (ireenland Eskimo perform it. lie turned over and
over till we thought he did not intend to stop, and felt himself well paid
for the feat with the present of a pocket-knife. One moment he was com-
pletely under water and the next above it, and he was so well secured in
his place that only his hands and face were wet. The danger of the per-
formance lies in the risk of his paddle breaking while he is under water,
and also the chance that he may make a false stroke.

"Another trick they perform is for a native to run his l'yrlck over an-
other without injury to either. This he does by dashing forward at the
greatest speed and passing the bow of his own boat over the centre of his
friend's, just in front of where its owner sits. There is less liability to in-
jury to either craft than to the occupant of the one that is overrun; a
little miscalculation may send the point. of the l'ym-lc through the man, who
is so bound in his place that he cannot get out, of the way."

The steamer turned the point of Littleton Island and put her prow in
the direction of L'atiin's Bay. The ice covered the water to the eastward.
close up to the Greenland shore. but along the western side of the strait
there was open water, and the Viz-I'm; went through the loose pack with-
out much difficulty. It was ten or twelve hours before she was fairly out
of the ice, and where she could get along without using her engines.

The tires were extinguished and the ship proceeded under sail, passing
Ellesmere Land and North Devon without hinderance. Off the entrance
of Lancaster Sound the ice became thick again and the tires were re-
kindled.

From Lancaster Sonnd the Vivian headed south-easterly across llafiin's
Bay, and live days and four hours after she left Littleton Island she was
within twenty miles of the coast of Greenland, in latitude T3" 35' north.

some of these settlements the governor is the only white inhabitant, and
if he has any family his wife is pretty certain to he a native.

"Dr. Hayes describes the Governor of Karsuk," the captain contin-
ued, "as a native of Denmark, who was married to an Eskimo woman and
lived in a hut rudely constructed of earth and stones; but it difiered from

sticking through the roof, and in being lined with pine boards obtained
from the chief of the district at, Upernavik. No other house was per.
mitted to he as elegant as the governor's, and by comparison with the rest
it might be called a palace.

" In the common houses the family and the dogs lived together, but
the governor had a separate residence for his (legs a short distance from
his own. llis house had a window, while the others had none; and while
the single room of his dwelling was sixteen feet by twenty, the others
were only eight feet by twelve. The governor had no trouble to main-
tain his authority with the few natives under his control. They paid the
taxes in oil and seal-skins with gr 'at promptness, and altogether conducted
themselves like well-disposed subjects.
The government purchases all the
wlmlelmne, oil, narwhal- ivory, cider-
down, and other products of the region
that the natives have to sell, and pays
for them in money, or in goods from the
storehouscs."

"And they do one thing which other
govermnents might imitate to advan-
tage," said the major; "they sell to the
native anything he wants in the way of
food, clothing, tea, coffee, or other goods,
with the single exception of spirits. All
traffic in spirits is forbidden, and thus A Gkfifixh'xn GuVchxolt.
the natives are not in such a condition
of demoralization as those of the Siberian coast. It is a pity Russia will
not follow the example of Denmark, and forbid the trach in spirits in her
Siberian ports and among the natives."

"The rule of Denmark in Greenland has been of the most paternal
and conciliatory character," added Dr. Touner. "Its object has been to
make the natives useful subjects, instead of keeping them in a state of
dependence; they are encouraged to be industrious and provident, and as
they tind their rulets set them a good example, they have nearly all cm-
braced Christianity."

George wished to know something of the Greenland form of govern-
ment.

"Greenland is a province of Denmar '," was the reply, "and the cal"
ital is at Julianshaab, near the southern extremity of the peninsula. It
has a population of about seven thousand, and is divided into twelve dis-
tricts; the inhabitants live along the coast, as the interior is quite unlit
for human beings to dwell in. The governor lives at Julianshaab and has
general jurisdiction over the country, but his power is far from absolute.
The six northern districts are united into one inspwztorate, :md the six
southern districts into another. Each inspectorate is controlled by an ' in-

the government is therefore one in which the people have a voice, and
any matter, however trivial, may be brought up for the consideration of
parliament.

"Dr. Hayes visited the parliament house while the distinguished body
was in session. He says, 'The house is a one-story plain building, about.
sixteen by twenty feet, and built of pine boards. There is a single room
inside which contains a loner table llanked with rough benches, on which
the parliamentarians sit. There are twelve membels of parliament, and
the thirteenth seat at the head of the table is occupied by the pastor of
Juliaushuab, who presides over the sessions. The members are dressed
in seal-skin trousels and Guernsey frocks, and such a thing as a coat to

relate in some way to fishing or hunting, generally the former.

" For example: while Dr. Ilayes was present at the session a native

was to be charged to the account of parliament.

"There were several cases in which men had lost their boats or fishing
implements; where the accident was not caused by their own carelessness,
and the sufierels were thrown out. of emplu_\'|nent by their losses, the.)' were
reimbmsed by the parliament. The reason of this is that it is desirable to

" If he does so from further misfortune: was the reply, " and the
facts are shown, the time for payment is extended; but if his refusal to
pay is based on idleness, or unwillingness to meet his debts, there is a very
effective way of bringing him to terms."

" What is that ?"

"The amount of the loan is deducted from what he brings to the gov-
ermnent storehouse for sale; and if this plan fails, he is not allowed to
buy anything there on any terms. The government has the only shops
or stores in the country, and it is impossible to obtain te:1,(e(>>fl('(r, sugar.

its warehouses. The obstinate man can't hold out long under these cir-
emnstanees. Crimes are very rare in Greenland; small ones are punished
by fines, and in capital cases the accused is sent to (,'openhagen for trial.

"They have here an excellent system for encouraging industry. The
government buys everything the native has to sell, and pays him in money
or goods as he may prefer. There is a certain standard of prices for

every article brought in by a native until he has reached a certain figure;
above that figure there is a sliding-scale of higher prices as an inducement
to ind ustry.

"Perhaps you may not fully understand me. "'0", suppose the. stami-
ard price of seal-skins to be ten cents. and that, each man is expected to
catch a thousand seals every year; he gets ten cents for each skin, whetherTill-2 ROYAL GREENLAND FISHING AND TRADING COMPANY. 287

he brings in a thousand or only a lumdred. But for every skin between
one thousand and twelve bundled he receives twelve cents; between
twelve hundred and fourteen hundred, fifteen cents a skin; and between
fifteen hundred and two thousand he receives twenty cents a skin, or
double the first standard. These are not the exact figures, but are given
to illustrate the system."

George wished to know when this plan was adopted, and how long
Greenland had been under the control of Denmark.

" In the year 1781," said the Doctor, " the Royal Greenland Fishing
and Trading Company was formed on much the same plan as the Hudson
Bay and the East India companies. It received a charter giving it the
exclusive control of commerce in Greenland and the management of the
natives; fortunately the company was in the hands of men who thought
more of doing good among the savages than of making money. Its profits,
while fair, have not been large, and the prosperity of the people has been
carefully looked after. Spirits and other injurious things have been ex-
cluded, :md no foreigner is allowed to trade with any Danish subject in
Greenland. The natives have all the civilization they need, and for more
than a. century everything has gone on peaceably."

Here the conversation was interrupted by the announcement that they
would soon be in the harbor of Upernavik, unless prevented by accident.

CHAPTER XX.

SIGHTS IN GREENI.A.\'D.--.\'EWS FROM Monti--END OF THE VOYAGE.

AS they neared the shore Fred espied a boat of a different construction
from the l'y/ac/r, but evidently of native manufacture. It was com-
ing out of a narrow passage near one of the islands, and the crew was
evidently having a good time, to judge by the laughter that rung over the
water.

Fred called the attention of his friends to the novel craft, and wondered
what it was.

" That is an oomz'ak, or women's boat," said the captain. "If you
permit an Irish bull, you may say it is manned by women."

" Do you mean that all the crew are women '5" asked the youth; "there
are six or eight at the oats, and one in the stern with the steering-oar."

 

AN WMIAK.

"Those at the oars are certainly women," replied the captain, "and the
other may be either a man or a woman. This is how it happens:

"The ll'yac/c that you saw at Littleton Island is a man's boat, and

women are not allowed to use it. The open heat, such as you see, is only

i for women, and a man would consider himself disgraced by being one ofBOATS ROWED BY WOMEN. 239

its crew. He might sit in the stern and steer the boat, but it would be
contrary to custom for him to handle an ear."

"Anyway it is a comfortable looking craft," replied the youth, "and
the women seem to understand perfectly how to manage it."

"They are very expert in the management of the omnialc," was the
response, " and are accustomed to it from infancy. The boat is apparently
frail in construction, but it can sail well, and is of great use to the natives
for purposes of transportation. A l'yuc/c is intended for hunting and fish-
ing, and has no place for :arrying anything more than its occupant, while
an comic/k can hold a great deal of freight."

Further investigation led to a description of this style of boat.

The 0071;;th may be anywhere from fifteen to forty feet in length. It
consists of a framework of poles securely lashed together with thongs of
seal-skin, and held apart at the top by thwarts which serve as seats. The
bottom is flat, and has a rude floor, but a stranger must step very carefully
to keep his feet from going through the bottom.

When the flamework is ready it is covered with seal-skins, and as no
single skin can be large enough for a boat, there must be a munber of
skins sewn together. The women perform this work with sinews, and
they do it so well that not a drop of water :au leak through. The frame
is turned bottom upward and the covering is spread over it, and fastened
to the rail with strong thongs. When the covering is put on it is moist;
it shrivels as it dries in the sun, and becomes hard as leather, but it is so
full of oil that it has a very slippery feeling. It is impervious to water,
and will last a long time unless brought against hard substances. \Vheu
it dries it becomes t 'anslucent, and when you are a passenger in an comic/c
you can see how deep you are in the water without looking over the side.

The next (lay Fred had an opportunity to inspect an oamz'ak which
was drawn up on the beach at Upernavik, and also to have a near view
of its crew. It is safe to say he was fully as umch interested in the latter
as in the former.

The crew consisted of seven young women, six of them "before the
mast." while the seventh was the commander. Their costume was the
funniest. that the youth had ever seen worn by a boat's crew, and he was
quite sure it would make a sensation among the young ladies of his ac-
quaintance who are fond of rowing.

The dress was of furs and skins. Beginning at the feet, there were
long boots of seal--skin reaching to the knee, where they met pautaloons of
the same material: the boots were of various colors, and some of them
quite tastefully painted, and the trousers had bright stripes on the side or

in front, formed by sewing in pieces of leather of bright hues. Above
the trousels was a jacket, with a bright stripe just below the waist, and
terminating at the throat in white fur or some other ornamental material.
The hair was gathered in a knot at the top of the head, and altogether the
costume of these Greenland boat-women was by no means unhandsome.

Fred asked what were the uses to which this boat was applied. He
was told that it carried the governor wherever he wished to go in the
neighborhood; and when the men went out hunting or fishing in their
kyaclt's, the women frequently followed in the oomial: to bring home the
game or fish that might be obtained. "They go long distances," said his
informant, "and the women do not hesitate to go out in any kind of
weather." Ordinarily the boat is rowed by its crew, but it has a mast,
and when the wind is fair a sail is spread and the breeze utilized. If the
owner can afiord to buy canvas for his sail, it is made out of that material;
but if he cannot endure the expense, the sail is made of seal-skins.

There are two anchorages at Upernavik, one being an open roadstead,
where ships have no shelter from southerly or westerly winds, while the
other is a landlocked harbor. The former is directly in front of the set--
tlement, and is used by ships that intend to remain only a few hours; the
latter is behind the town, and beyond a rocky ridge, but, though giving
perfect shelter to ships, it is not very easy to enter. Captain Jones de-
cided to anchor in the outer harbor until they could communicate with
the governor, and determine whether they would proceed at once or re-
main a. few days.ARRIVAL 1x A GREENLAND PORT. 291

Major Clapp and Dr. 'l'ouuer went on shore as soon as the Vivian had
anchored, and made a call upon the inspector. The latter said he was ex-
pecting ships from the South, but none had arrived, with the exception of
two or three Scotch whalcrs who had gone forward to look for whales in
Melville Bay. The yearly ship from Colmnhagen would be due in a few
days--in fact, she might arrive at any moment--and meantime the strait-
gels were welcome to anything in his power to give them.

He was greatly surprised on learning the route by which the Vivian
had arrived at L'pernavik, and heartily cougmtulatcd our friends on their
success in reaching the pole. He said that a supply of provisions and five
hundred tons of coal had been left there the previous .year by an Ameri-
can war-ship, for the Ilse of any exploring expedition that might need it,
and especially any ship from the United States.

 

 

l'l'M'NAVIK.

The major and Doctor returned to the l'ivian with the information:
they had obtained. Commander Bronson said he thought no one could
have a better right to the coal than themselves; he had expected to find
coal at L'peruavik and was not disappointed. The engineer reported that
they had less than seven tons remaining, and therefore a new supply
would be very acceptable.

The l'iz-iun immediately proceeded to the inner harbor. and in a little
while was safely anchored where no ordinary \viud could disturb her.
\Vhile she was being taken from the enter to the inner anchorage, Com-
mander Bronson went on shore with the major to pay a visit to the in-
spector, and arrange for such assistance as they could have for taki g in
coal. Fred and George occupied their time in an inspection of [Tperna-
vik, and as the place was small it did not take long.

The inspector's house was, as might be expected, the most elaborate
building; but even that was not large. There were about twenty other
houses, all occupied by Eskimos, and altogether the town had less than a
hundred inhabitants. There were a good many dogs wandering about;
some of them were inclined to familiarity not of a friendly nature, but by
vigorous flourishing of sticks and flinging an occasional stone they kept
the brutes from doing harm. The houses were anything but cleanly in
appearance, and neither of the youths had any desire for a permanent res-
idence in Uperuavik.

Back of the settlement, and on the slope of the ridge separating it
from the inner harbor, is the cemetery. There are crosses and stones to
indicate the position of the graves, and little enclosures (or mounds) of
stone. Very little vegetation can be seen at Upernavik, and the ground
is so hard that there is rarely any attempt to dig deeply to form a grave.
Bodies are placed on the surface and covered with stones: unless the work
is thoroughly done, the remains become exposed in course of time. The
youths found one of the coflius nearly uncovered, and through its broken
lid the occupant could be plainly discerned.

The inspector returned the visit of the ofiicers of the Vivien, and re-
mained to dine with them. Most of the men of Upon-navik were away in
pursuit of seal or walrus, and the inspector said he would not be able to
give any assistance in loading the coal beyond showing the best way of
getting around the harbor. There were two whale-boats in the harbor,
which he kindly loaned to the captain; the latter said that by using these
boats he could easily load in two or three days all the coal he needed for
getting to New York.

A hundred tons of coal were taken on board by using the whale-boats
as barges, and towing them back and forth between ship and shore. While
the coaling was in progress the inspector asked (lounuander lh'onsou and
his oflicers to take tea with him ; the invitation included Fred and George,
and was gladly accepted by all concerned.RECEI'TIOX Ix TIIE INSPECTORS HOUSE. 293

The house was comfortable, though not large, and our friends passed a
delightful hour in the society of the host and his family. They had tea
and coffee, and a variety of little cakes and good things prepared by the
lady of the house, together with some canned fruits which came from
Europe or America. They were particularly struck with the flowers which
were kept growing in the windows of the house, and learned that every
inhabitant of Greenland who can afiord it keeps an abundance of living
plants in his dwelling. Dr. Tonner said he had observed the some thing
in Siberia, where the homes of people in comfortable circumstances often
resemble conservatories.

 

 

THE txsl'kzcma A)" "Is FAMILY.

When the coal was all on board, and farewell visits had been made to
the governor's house, the order for departure was given. Just as the an-
chor left the bottom, and the ship was beginning to more, a native came
paddling his Iryack into the harhor in great haste, and yelling at the top of
his voice.

It was not easy to make out his meaning, but a streak of smoke on the
sky served as an interpreter. A steamer was coming!

The engines were stopped, and the anchor dropped once more to the
hottom. The cloud of smoke increased, and in a little while a steamer
flying the American flag came in sight in front of Upernavik and cast. an-
chor in the outer harbor. The crew of the Vivian cheered lustily as they
caught sight of their national banner, and there were teats of joy in the eyes
of our young friends. Our country's flag is a most welcome sight when
we are far from home and in a foreign land. Especially dear must it have
seemed to those arctic explorels after their Sojouru of two long winters in
the regions around the pole!

 

THE SEW ARRIVAL.

It was a ship of the United States Navy, and as soon as the anchor was
dropped she sent an officer on board the Vivian, with a letter-hag addressed
to Commander Bronson. And what recent dates! 'l'wenty-two days from
New York! It seemed to carry them home in an instant, and for a while
some of the party forgot that they were yet in the far North and within
the Arctic Circle.

There were letters for everybody--for Fred and George, as well as for
the elders of the party, and also for the junior ofliccrs and the crew. For
an hour or more there was silence on hoard the ship as the seals were bro-
ken and the contents of the missires eagerly devoured."OM I-Z\\'.-\ RD BOL'N D. 295

The majority of the letters were private, and therefore we will not ex-
amine them. Fred Wondered how it had been found out that they were
coming that way, and why a ship had been sent to meet them at L'pcrna-
vik. A slip cut from a newspaper and enclosed in one of his letters told
the story. It read as follows:

" It will be remelnlwred that in Oetober of last year a wildtgoose .
near Quebec, which had the words t' l'iniun, North-pole, June 9, 18--,

killed on Lake St. Charles,
stamped on the featheis or
one wing. As the l'h-iun was known to have gone in search of the pole, the stamp is Supposed to

 

 

indicate the accomplishment of her object. It "'35 thought nllt' would return by way of Smith's
Sound, if possible, and the Government will send a steamer in the hope of meeting her at one of
Ihe Greenland ports early in July. Lent-Is intended for this ship should he sent in care of the
CUIIIIH-Ilfliulll ut the Bmoltlyu .\ vr Yard not later than June 10th. The steamer will proceed north
as far my be consistent with sal' y. and if no news is obtained of the explore-Is, it will neturn
to New York during the month of September."

   

So it wag one of the carrier-pigeons, improvised according to George's
suggestion, that gave the news of the Vivian and her successful voyage to
the Nortlrpole!

Both ships remained at Upernavik long enough for the Vivian. to re-
ceive a plentiful supply of all the provisions she needed for her voyage to
New York. They sailed together, but were separated in a gale just after
passing Cape Farewell, at the southern extremity of Greenland, and did
not meet again until they were off Fire Island, about forty miles from
Sandy Hook. Almost side by side they er ssed the bar and entered the
(-apacions harbor at the mouth of the Hudson River. made a brief halt. at
Quarantine. and then continued on their eoutse till they dropped anchor
between the Battery and liedloe's Island. The Vivi/tn. thus completed the
voyage front the Golden Gate to Manhattan Island by way of the north>>
west passage and the polar sea.

Four days after her arnval a telegram front (iranton. Scotland, att-
nount-ed that the (l'tmflu'll'tl had reached Reykjavik. in Iceland, and after
taking coal and stores would proceed to llavre. The youths (could not
understand why the telegram should he dated at Granton until the major
informed them that there was a line of steamers between that port and
Reyltjmik. " We shall probably reeeive letters from our l-'reneh friends."
said he. "as soon as the mail can bring them, and also the letter-bag we
intrusted to the (lulnllrllrt. They would he very sure not to miss the
steamer to Granton."

Sure enough, the Liverpool steamer, a fortnight later. brought the

 

 

Vivian's letter-bag for the Navy lh-partntent. and also a paelu-t of letters
in care of the postmaster of New York. The packet was to be delivered

to Commander Bronson, or any officer of the Vivian, or held to await the
arrival of that vessel. Among the letters was one for George from the
young ofiieer who assisted him in the preparation of " Parry and Paris."
With George's permission we translate the material part of his friends
missive:
* as * * -X- * * as

"After separating from the Vivian we steered south-east, and reached
the meridian of Greenwich about latitude 85deg. Them we encountered
much ice, and hesitated two or three days before entering the pack, which
contained so many bergs as to be very dangerous. At last we found an
opening in the pack, and worked our way slowly through the lanes and
among the flees to latitude 84deg. There the pack closed in upon us, and
we had a narrow escape from being crushed between two enormous tioes.
With a great deal of difficulty we sawed and blasted away the ice suflicieut-
ly to reduce the pressure, and bring the vessel to an even keel.THE END or THE VOYAGE. 297

"We found that the ice was drifting southward, the same as in Gap-
tain Parry's sledge journey, and for some time we had hopes that it would
enable us to get out before the close of the season. But our progress was
so slow that the end of August found us in latitude 81deg 20' north, longi-
tude 20deg east, and it became necessary to look for winter-quarters. 0n
the lst of September the ice opened sufliciently to enable us to enter a
small bay in the most westerly of the 'Seveu Islands,' and as soon as we
were inside it. closed again. We had hoped to reach Hccla Core, where
Perry's ship remained during his attempt to reach the pole, but. this was
impossible, owing to the drift of the ice.

"\Ve passed the winter in much the same way as the previous one,
bllt missed greatly the company of our good friends the Americans. We
were in less danger from the ice than before, on account of the shelter
which our bay aflorded, and we were able to make hunting exclusions on
the ice. We found that the Dutch navigators had been there before us,
and on the rocky shores there were the skeletons of unfortunate sailors
who had died there. The solid ground makes it impossible to dig a grave,
and the only mode of sepulture is to place the coflin on the ground and
cover it with a few stones. Sometimes even this was not done, and in
course of time the skeletons became fleshless through the action of the
winds and the intense cold.

"In the spring we had some hunting experiences, and made sledge
journeys over the ice to the northern extremity of Spitzbergen, but dis.
covered nothing of importance. We were all glad when the breaking up
of the ice released us, and the drift carried us to the westward. We
escaped from the ice-fields without serious injury, and then sailed past
the island of Jan Mayen to Iceland. \Ve tried to land on Jan Mayen, but
were prevented by the fog, which made it extremely dangerous to seek a
harbor. From Jan Mayen we sailed to Reykjavik, and hole we are once
more in communication with the civilized world. We hoped to learn some-
thing abont the Vivian on our arrival here, but are disappointed; we shall
look for letters from you when we reach I'Iavre, and feel confident that
you will not be far behind us in reaching home."

letters had been sent to I'Iavre, bearing the congratulations of the V732)-
z'an's party to all on board the Gambetta, immediately on the publication
of the despatch from Granton; consequently each expedition learned of
the safety of the other. And so ends the story of
