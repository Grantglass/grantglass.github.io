TlIE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a pre])aration for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathematics are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of Analysis it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per'
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.

PREFACE.
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy.
In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belief, that
in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no similar
treatise.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore."
The class should he encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
• It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

and 6 shillings for a cap; how many shillings did he
pay for both?
Analysis. Since Eli paid 9 shillings for a pair of
skates, and 6 shillings for a cap, he paid for both, the
sum of 9 shillings and 6 shillings. The sum o/9 shil-
lings and 6 shillings is 15 shillings. Therefore, he paid
J 5 shillings for both.

O. Addition is the process of uniting several numbers
of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result
is called the Sum or Amount. The sign of addition is
written thus, -(-, and is called plus. When placed between
two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be
added together. Thus, 5 -f- 3 -|- 2 signifies that 5 and 3
and 2 are to be added together, and is read Jive, plus three,
plus two.
The sign of equality is written thus, =. When placed
between two numbers or quantities, it signifies that the
latter is equal to the former.

The sign of multiplication is written thus, X, and, placed
between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to
be multiplied together. 5X4 = 20, shows that 5 multi-
plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called
times. 5 X 4 is read 5 times 4.

17. What will be the cost of 3 cows, at 23 dollars
apiece?
Analysis. Since 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 3 cows, which
are 3 times 1 cow, will cost 3 times 23 dollars. 23 is equal
to 2 tens and 3 units; 3 times 3 units are 9 units, and 3
times 2 tens are 6 tens, or 60; 60 and 9 are 69. Therefore,
if 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 8 cows will cost 69 dollars.

Note. Dollars and cents are separated by a period (.); thus, $2.10, ia
read 2 dollars 10 cents.
A Simple Number contains but one name or denomina-
tion; thus, 5, 84, 12 bushels, 65 dollars, are simple numbers.
A Compound Number contains two or more names or
denominations; thus, 5 dollars 25 cents, 16 bushels 3 pecks,
3 days 10 hours, are compound numbers.
Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one
denomination to another, without altering their value; thus,
changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to
cents, &c, is reduction.

* FRACTIONS.
37. 1. "What is understood by one half, one
third, one fourth, one fifth, &c.?
Ans. When a number or thing, as a unit or an
apple, is divided into two equal parts, each of the
parts is called one half; when into three equal parts,
each of the parts is called one third; two of the parts
are called two thirds, &c.
2. How many halves in 1?
3. How many thirds in 1?
4. If a peach be divided into 2 equal parts, what
is each part called?
5. If an orange be divided into 3 equal parts,
what are the parts called? .
6. How many halves in 4?
Analysis. Since in 1 there are 2 halves, in 4 there are 4
times 2 halves, or 8 halves. Therefore there are 8 halves in 4.
7. How many halves in 5? in 6?
8. How many halves in 7? in 7 and 1 half?
9. How many thirds in 3? in 4? in 5?

13. How many halves in 10 and 1 half?
14. How many thirds in 9 and 2 thirds?
15. In 8 halves how many whole things?
Analysis. Since in 2 halves there is one whole thing,
in 8 haloes there are as many whole things as 2, the num-
ber of halves in 1, is contained times in 8, which is 4
times. Therefore, in 8 halves there arc 4 whole things.

Analysis. The money to be expended is -fgj of itself,
and the commission yj^, or of this sum; hence the
whole amount sent to the agent is XJ}$, or ||. Since $780

86. Interest is a sum paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The Principal is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The Amount is the sum of the principal and interest.
The Rate per Cent, is the sum paid for the use of
$100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent, per
annum.
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths
(t&cO or of tne principal; at 8 per cent, it is 8 hun-
dredths or ^ of the principal.
Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.
1. What is the yearly interest of $80, at 5 per cent,?
Analysis. Since the interest is 5 per cent,, or Tjfo, equal
to ^ of the principal, the interest of $80 is ^ of $80,
or $4. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since the interest of $1, or 100 cents, is 5 cents

Analysis. Since the interest for 1 year at 8 per cent,
is equal to fa, of the principal, for 3 years it is 3
times fa, or fa of the principal, fa of $150 is $6, and
fa of $150 is 6 times $6, or $36. Therefore, fyC.

93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent,, will $60
gain $15 interest?
Analysis. The gain, or interest, is or \ of the prin-
cipal, equal to 25 per cent, of the principal. (77j Ex. 7.)
If a given principal gain 5 per cent, in 1 year, it will re-
quire as many years to gain 25 per cent, as 5 per cent, is
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, Sfc.
Or thus: Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent,, will gain
$3 interest, it will require as many years for $60 to gain
$15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5
times.

Analysis. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per
cent, in 200 years; at 5 per cent, in \ of 200 years, or 40
years.

94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re-
ceived $18 interest; what was the rate per cent,?
Analysis. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is
f§> or ^ of the principal, for 1 year it is \ of or
of the principal, equal to 6 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
Or, thus: At 1 per cent., the interest of $1 for 4 years is
A cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300
cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent, of $75
for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent, as $3 is
contained times in $18, which is 6 times, equal to 6 per
cent.

12. At what per cent, will $2500 gain $200 in-
terest in 1 year and 4 months?
13. At what per cent, will a given principal double
itself in 5 years?
Analysis. Since a given principal must gain 100 per
cent, to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will
require \ of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, Sfc.

95. The present worth of a note payable at a future
time is such a sum as, put at interest at the given rate per
cent, until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the
note.
Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money
before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the
present worth from the given sum or face of the note.
1. What is the present worth of $180 payable in
3 years 4 months at 6 per cent,?
Analysis. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at
6 per cent, is \ of the principal, (88,) the amount, $180,
is equal to the principal, -£, added to the interest, -J, equal to
f of the principal. Since $180 is f of the principal, J of
$180, or $30, m i, and $30 is £ of 5 times $30, or $150.
Therefore, fyc.
Note. The discount is the difference between $180 and $150, which
is $30.

7. 5^ times a number is 21 greater than 3| times
the same number; what is the number?
8. If 24 chestnuts be divided among some boys,
giving 4 apiece to £ of them, and 2 apiece to the
others, how many boys are there?
Analysis. Since one boy received 4 chestnuts as often
as another received 2 chestnuts, 2 boys received 6 chestnuts;
there were as many times 2 boys as 6 is contained times
in 24, which is 4 times, and 4 times 2 boys are 8 boys.
Therefore, fyc.
9. Mary gave her chickens 26 grains of corn; ^
of them had 5 grains each, the others but 3 each;
how many chickens had she?
Note. The above gives the following question: —
10. 5 times § of a certain number, plus 3 times ^
of the same number, is 26; what is the number?
11. A class received 29 merit marks; ^ of them
received 5 apiece, \ of the remainder 3 apiece, | of
the remainder 2 apiece, and the rest 1 apiece; how
many scholars in the class?
12. 26 melons were stolen, * of the party getting
4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but
2 apiece; how many were there in the party?
Analysis. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would
have been 28 melons; then 4 limes £ of a number, plus 3
times £ of the same number, or J, would equal 28. Since
28 is J of a number, \ of 28, or 4, is and 4 is £ of 2
limes 4, or 8. Therefore, fyc.
13. 4 times \ of a number, plus 3£ times the
same number, is equal to 28 plus 5; what is the
number?
14. Henry said that 4 years more than ^ of his
age, increased by 5 times ^ of it, and that sum by 4
times ^ of his age less 4, would make the sum 50
years; how old was he?
155
15. A drover paid $5 a head for \ of his flock, $4
a head for as many more, $3 a head for A of the
remainder, and $2 a head for the rest; the nock cost
$115; how many sheep had he?
16. A grocer received $10 for a lot of baskets;
for \ of them he had 6 dimes each, for | of the re-
mainder pins 3, 4 dimes each, for -J of the rest plus
2, 3 dimes each, and for the rest 2 dimes each; hoV
many baskets did he sell?
17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times |
of it increased by 6 times £ of it; how old is he?
Analysis. 5 times Henry's age equals J34, 4 limes § of
it, plus 6 times ^ of it, equals Js4-, and less equals £
of it, which, according to the conditions of the question, is
3; and 3 is ^ of 3 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc.
18. 6 times a number is 4 less than 7 times | of
it, plus 5 times ^ of the same number; what is the
number?
19. Bridget, wishing to get a certain number of
pounds of meat, found, if she took beef at 5 cents,
she would have 4 cents left; if pork at 7 cents, she
had not money enough to pay for it; and therefore
she took | of the quantity in beef, the rest in pork,
and paid for it; how many pounds did she get?
20. Pour times a number is 6 greater than 5 times
^ of the same number; what is the number?
21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep,
found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left;
if he paid $5 a head, he had not enough to pay for
them; if he took \ the number at each price, he
could just pay for them; how many sheep would
his money buy?

103. 1. The sum of two numbers is 27; their
difference 5; what are the numbers?
Analysis. Since 27 is the sum of two numbers whose
difference is 5, 27 less 5, or 22, would be twice the less num-
ber; $ of 22 is 11, the less number, which increased by 5
equals 16, or the greater number. Therefore, fyc.

cost of the colt, multiplied by | the cost of the cow,
equaled the cost of the cow; what did he pay for
each?
14. A lady purchased a dish and cover for 24
dimes; \ of the cost of the dish, increased by the
difference between the cost of the dish and cover,
equals the cost of the cover; what was the cost of
each?
15. A grocer purchased 25 pounds of butter of
two women; ^ of the number of pounds he took of
one, increased by the difference between the amounts
purchased of both, equals the number of pounds he
took of the other; how many pounds did each sell?
16. The sum of two numbers is 10; their differ-

103. 1. A grocer paid $12.60 for 30 bushels of
potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and
20 cents a bushel for poor ones; how many bushels
were good?
Analysis. If all had been good, he would have paid
S15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones
made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as many
bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel)
is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on all,) which is
8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones; the difference be-
tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the
good ones. Therefore, fyc.
2. A farmer bought 28 sheep for $76, paying $3
for old sheep, and $2 for yearlings; how many old
sheep?
3. A flour merchant paid $82 for 20 barrels
of flour, giving $4.50 for first quality, and $3.50
for second quality; how many barrels were first
quality?
4. Henry sold his watch for $18, and by so doing
lost | of what it cost; what did it cost?
5. A man, employing an equal number of men
and boys, paid each boy 5 dimes, and each man 7
dimes, and to them all he paid $7.20; how many
were there of both?
6. An old lady sold an equal number of chickens
and turkeys for $4, receiving for chickens 3 dimes
each, and for turkeys 5 dimes each; how many fowls
did she sell?
7. A speculator bought an equal quantity of
wheat and beans, giving $1.50 per bushel for wheat,
and $1 for beans; the wheat cost $7 more than the
beans; how many bushels of beans did he buy?
8. A man engaged to work 25 days, on condition
that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and
159
pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received
at settlement $38; how many days was he idle?
Analysis. As many days as $3, (the difference made
by 1 idle day,) is contained tunes in $12, (the difference
made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times. Therefore he
was idle 4 days.
9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, re-
ceiving $2.50 for every day's labor, and forfeiting $1
for every day he was idle; he received $43; how
many days did he copy?
10. Job, having some chestnuts, gave f of them
to John, who, after eating 6, gave f of what remained
to his sister, and still had 5 left; how many had Job?
Analysis. If John gave £ to his sister, the 5 left was ^;
5 is ^ of 4 times 5, or 20, and 20, plus the 6 he ate, male
26, which is § of Job's, fyc.
11. Mary gave f of her flowers to her playmates^
| of the remainder to her teacher, and had 2 left;

wages for clothes, $12 for a watch; he then lent §•
of what he had left, and having paid $3 for a pair of
boots, had $5 left; what were his wages?
15. A laborer engaged to work 20 days, on con-
dition that he should have 12 dimes for a day's labor,
and pay 2 dimes for every idle day for board; he
received as many dollars as he worked days; how
many days was he idle?
1©4. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so
that | of the longer piece was equal to the shorter;
what was the length of each piece?
Analysis. The longer piece is divided into 5 equal
parts, 2 of which equal the shorter; the sum of the 2
pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals i- of 28 feet,
or 4 feet; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which are 8 feet,
the shorter piece; b parts equal 5 times 4 feet, which are 20
feet, the longer piece. Therefore, fyc.
2. A tree 56 feet high was broken in a storm ; -| of

7. Henry traveled 140 miles in 2 days; the firrt
day he traveled 1J times as far as he did the second;
how far did he travel each day?
8. Prom Buffalo to Bergen is 50 miles, from Bergen
to Utica is 1| times as far as from Utica to Schenec-
tady, which is 280 miles from Buffalo; how many
miles from Buffalo to Utica?
9. David caught a trout 17 inches long; the tail
was | as long as the body, and the head was 3 inches
long; how long was the tail?
10. Divide 36 into 2 such parts that 14 times
one shall equal the other.
161
11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples; | of
Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has;
how many has each?
Analysis. Harlan has 6 more than J as many as Ho-
mer, which makes the sum 48, 6 greater than if he had but
J as many; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3
parts plus 6 apples are equal to Harlan's; then 4 parts
plus 3 parts, plus 6 apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42,
and j of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equul
24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num-
ber Homer has. Therefore, fyc.
12. Rochester is 52 miles from Geneva, via Vic-
tor; of the distance from Geneva to Victor, plus
4 miles, equals the distance from Victor to Roches-
ter; how far is Victor from each place?
13. From the ground to the top of a church steeple
is 146 feet; | of the height of the steeple above the
church, plus 6 feet, is equal to the height of the church;
what is the height of the steeple above the church?

15. A coat and vest cost $19; ^ of the cost of the
coat, plus $3, equals the-cost of the vest; what is the
cost of each?
16. Wilson has 15 oranges and lemons; \ of the
oranges equals \ of the lemons; how many of each
has he?
Analysis. Since \ of the oranges equals % of the lemons,
§, or all the oranges, equal § of the lemons; we then have
the oranges and lemons divided into 5 equal parts, 2 parts
of which equal the oranges, and 3 the lemons, fyc.
17. A father gave his 2 sons 50 cents; | of

the value of what is in it; what is the purse worth?
21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied,
"The time past noon is equal to ^ of the time to
midnight," What was the hour?
Analysis. The time to midnight is divided into 5 equal
ports, one of which equals the time past noon; then 5 parts
plus 1 part equals 6 parts; and 12 hours, the time from
noon to midnight, must be § of the time it lacked of being
midnight; since. 12 it f, which is £ of |, will be £ of 12
hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock,
P. M.
22. What was the time, provided § of the time
past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.?
23. $ of the time from this instant to 5 o'clock,
P. M., equals f of the tune past midnight; what'is

equal the other piece; hence 5 parts plus 3 parts plus 6 yards
equal 38 yards, or 8 parts and 6 yards, equal 38 yaras; 38
yaras minus 6 yaras eo/waZ 32 yards, or 8 parts, §c.
2. A lad inquiring his mother's age, his father
replied, "§ of my age is 9 years more than f of

7. A rope was cut into 3 pieces; the first piece
was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first
plus \ of the third, and the third was as long as the
other two; what was the length of the rope?
Analysis. Since the third piece is as long as the other
two, it must be J- of the rope; the second piece, being £ as
long, is %; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds with
the 5 feet of the first piece, make 10 feet, which must be the
other fourth; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, Sfc.

106. 1. Malcom is 8 years old, and Martin 25;
in how many years will Malcom be £ as old as
Martin?
Analysis. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of age;
in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old,
in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 17
years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old.
Therefore, fyc.
2. A father is 22 years older than his son, and the
son's age is | of the father's; how many years since
the son's age was £ the father's?
3. Helen is 9 years old, her sister is 22; in how
many years will Helen be J as old as her sister?
4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who
had 45; Henry won as many as he had to commence
with; when they quit, each had the same number;
how many had both?
Analysis. Since Henry won as many as he had, he left
off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles,
now having the same number, must have had 3 times as
many as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3
times ^ of 45, or 15,'and 45 -f- 15 is 60. Therefore, fyc.
5. A farmer, having 60 sheep in one field, took as
many from them as he had in another field, and put
them with the others, when the Locks were equal;
how many sheep had he?
6. From a bin containing 52 bushels, 2 more than
as many bushels as were in another bin were taken
and put in the other bin, when both contained the
same quantity; how many bushels in both bins?

between | and £ of his age, is 6 more than |- times
his age; how old is he?
8. Henry earned 20 dollars in the spring; in the
fall he earned as much as in the spring and ^ as
much as in the summer, and in the summer as much
as in the spring and fall; how much did he earn in
all?
9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and % as
many as B, and B lias as many as A and C; how
many sheep have they all?
Analysis. Since B has as many as A and C, he must
have £ of the whole; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -J- § of i,
plus equals £ -\- 20, or the whole number of sheep; hence
20 equals J the number, and 20 is J of 6 times 20, or 120
sheep. Therefore, SfC.
10. A, owning 74 acres of land, sold B | as much
as B owned; then B's farm was |^ as large as A's;

the numbers?
15. The difference between the cost of a horse
and a buggy is $40 ; | of the cost of the buggy equal
.jSj of the cost of the horse; what is the value of

20. Find the ages of A, B, and C, by knowing
that C's age at A's birth was 5A times B's, and now
is "equal to the sum of A's and B's; also that if A
were now 3 years younger, or B 4 years older, A's
age would be equal to | of B's.
107. 1. Two boys are running in the same
direction; one is 27 rods in advance of the other in
pursuit, who gains upon the foremost 3 rods in a
minute; iii how many minutes will he be overtaken?
Analysis. In as many minutes as 3, the number of rods
gained in one minute, is contained times in 27, the number
of rods to be gained.
2. A, after traveling 2 hourst at the rate of 5
miles an hour, was followed by B, at the rate of 7

A and C; what did B and C pay?
7. The hour and minute hands of a watch are
together at 12 o'clock; when will they next be to-
gether?
Analysis. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand
11 timtg in 12 hours, if both are at 12, the minute hand will
pass the hour hand the first time in T\ of 12 hours, or in
1-JT hours, equal to 5^- minutes past 1 o'clock. There'

APPENDIX.
The author desires to call the attention of teachers to the number ancj
variety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec-
tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
others of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
"changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
- effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they afford for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to some
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy and 'comprehensible.
To aid beginners,, the blackboard maybe used to advantage; and to
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section
71, page 171-3:—
^ of 35 is § of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus: —
f X 35 = JX ? X 18?
Call upon some pupil to read the question according to the first form,
and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given; and
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of the
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus :—
*X35=$X§X —?
which is read
f of 35 is $ of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use'of tin
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil,
but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu-
sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on.
A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.

TlIE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a pre])aration for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathematics are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of Analysis it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per'
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.

PREFACE.
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy.
In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belief, that
in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no similar
treatise.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore."
The class should he encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
• It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

4. 1. Eli paid 9 shillings for a pair of skates,
and 6 shillings for a cap; how many shillings did he
pay for both?
Analysis. Since Eli paid 9 shillings for a pair of
skates, and 6 shillings for a cap, he paid for both, the
sum of 9 shillings and 6 shillings. The sum o/9 shil-
lings and 6 shillings is 15 shillings. Therefore, he paid
J 5 shillings for both.

O. Addition is the process of uniting several numbers
of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result
is called the Sum or Amount. The sign of addition is
written thus, -(-, and is called plus. When placed between
two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be
added together. Thus, 5 -f- 3 -|- 2 signifies that 5 and 3
and 2 are to be added together, and is read Jive, plus three,
plus two.
The sign of equality is written thus, =. When placed
between two numbers or quantities, it signifies that the
latter is equal to the former.

The sign of multiplication is written thus, X, and, placed
between two numbers or quantities, shows that they are to
be multiplied together. 5X4 = 20, shows that 5 multi-
plied by 4 is equal to 20. The sign is commonly called
times. 5 X 4 is read 5 times 4.

17. What will be the cost of 3 cows, at 23 dollars
apiece?
Analysis. Since 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 3 cows, which
are 3 times 1 cow, will cost 3 times 23 dollars. 23 is equal
to 2 tens and 3 units; 3 times 3 units are 9 units, and 3
times 2 tens are 6 tens, or 60; 60 and 9 are 69. Therefore,
if 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 8 cows will cost 69 dollars.

* When it is necessary to express a quantity loss than a unit, we may
regard the unit us Uiviued into some number of equal parts, and uso
one of these parts as a new.unit of less value than the unit divided.
Thus, if a yard be divided into two equal parts, each of the paits is
called one half; when into three equal parts, each of the parts is called
one third; wneu into four equal purts, each of the parts is called one
fourth; when into five equal parts, each of the parts is called one-fifth;
two pf the parts, two fifths, &c.; when into sic equal parts, each of the
parts is called one sixth; two of the parts, two sixths, three of the parts,

or 9 cerate. 7f 1 pound cost 9 cerate, 6 pounds, which are
6 times 1 pound, will cost G ftVraes 9 cerate, or 54 cents.
Therefore, if 3 pounds of coffee cost 27 cents, 6 pounds will
cost 54 cerate.
Or thus: § pounds will cost 6 (»! 1 third of 27 cents; 1
third of 27 cents is 9 cents, and C <»nes 9 cerate are 54 cerate.

A Compound Number contains two or more names or
denominations; thus, 5 dollars 25 cents, 16 bushels 3 pecks,
3 days 10 hours, are compound numbers.
Reduction is the process of changing numbers from one
denomination to another, without altering their value; thus,
changing pounds to ounces, ounces to pounds, dollars to

* FRACTIONS.
37. 1. "What is understood by one half, one
third, one fourth, one fifth, &c.?
Ans. When a number or thing, as a unit or an
apple, is divided into two equal parts, each of the
parts is called one half; when into three equal parts,
each of the parts is called one third; two of the parts
are called two thirds, &c.

3. How many thirds in 1?
4. If a peach be divided into 2 equal parts, what
is each part called?
5. If an orange be divided into 3 equal parts,
what are the parts called? .
6. How many halves in 4?
Analysis. Since in 1 there are 2 halves, in 4 there are 4
times 2 halves, or 8 halves. Therefore there are 8 halves in 4.
7. How many halves in 5? in 6?
8. How many halves in 7? in 7 and 1 half?
9. How many thirds in 3? in 4? in 5?

13. How many halves in 10 and 1 half?
14. How many thirds in 9 and 2 thirds?
15. In 8 halves how many whole things?
Analysis. Since in 2 halves there is one whole thing,
in 8 haloes there are as many whole things as 2, the num-
ber of halves in 1, is contained times in 8, which is 4
times. Therefore, in 8 halves there arc 4 whole things.

86. Interest is a sum paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The Principal is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The Amount is the sum of the principal and interest.
The Rate per Cent, is the sum paid for the use of
$100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent, per
annum.
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths
(t&cO or of tne principal; at 8 per cent, it is 8 hun-
dredths or ^ of the principal.
Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.
1. What is the yearly interest of $80, at 5 per cent,?
Analysis. Since the interest is 5 per cent,, or Tjfo, equal
to ^ of the principal, the interest of $80 is ^ of $80,
or $4. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since the interest of $1, or 100 cents, is 5 cents

11. A's money is to B's as 2 to 3; if £ of A's
money be put at interest for 3 years 9 months, at
10 per cent,, it will amount to $550; how much
money has each?
93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent,, will $60
gain $15 interest?
Analysis. The gain, or interest, is or \ of the prin-
cipal, equal to 25 per cent, of the principal. (77j Ex. 7.)
If a given principal gain 5 per cent, in 1 year, it will re-
quire as many years to gain 25 per cent, as 5 per cent, is
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, Sfc.
Or thus: Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent,, will gain
$3 interest, it will require as many years for $60 to gain
$15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5
times.
2. How long will it take $120 to gain $24 interest,
at 6 per cent,?
3. In what time will $500 gain $35, at 7 per

cent,?
8. In what time will $49 gain $12.25, at 5 per
cent,?
9. In what time will any given principal double
itself at 4 per cent,?
Analysis. Since, to double itself, any sum of money
must gain 100 per cent., at 1 per cent., it will require 100
years, at 4 per cent,, £ of 100 years, or 25 years. Tliere-
fore, fyc.

per cent,?
15. In what time will $175 double itself at 20 per
cent,?
16. In what time will a given principal treble it-
self at 5 per cent,?
Analysis. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per
cent, in 200 years; at 5 per cent, in \ of 200 years, or 40
years.
17. In what time will $100 treble itself at 6 per
cent,? at 7 per cent,? at 8 per cent,? at 10 per
cent,?
94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re-
ceived $18 interest; what was the rate per cent,?
Analysis. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is
f§> or ^ of the principal, for 1 year it is \ of or
of the principal, equal to 6 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
Or, thus: At 1 per cent., the interest of $1 for 4 years is
A cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300
cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent, of $75
for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent, as $3 is
contained times in $18, which is 6 times, equal to 6 per
cent.
2. At what per cent, will $200 gain $49 interest
in 3J years?

12. At what per cent, will $2500 gain $200 in-
terest in 1 year and 4 months?
13. At what per cent, will a given principal double
itself in 5 years?
Analysis. Since a given principal must gain 100 per
cent, to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will
require \ of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, Sfc.
14. At what per cent, will a given principal double
itself in 10 years?
15. At what per cent, will a given principal double
itself in 12 years 6 months?
16. At what per cent, will $200 double itself in 4

95. The present worth of a note payable at a future
time is such a sum as, put at interest at the given rate per
cent, until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the
note.
Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money
before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the
present worth from the given sum or face of the note.
1. What is the present worth of $180 payable in
3 years 4 months at 6 per cent,?
Analysis. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at
6 per cent, is \ of the principal, (88,) the amount, $180,
is equal to the principal, -£, added to the interest, -J, equal to
f of the principal. Since $180 is f of the principal, J of
$180, or $30, m i, and $30 is £ of 5 times $30, or $150.
Therefore, fyc.
Note. The discount is the difference between $180 and $150, which
is $30.

101. 1. Benjamin, meeting some beggars, gave
each of them 5 cents; had he given them 7 cents
apiece, it would have taken 8 cents more; how many
beggars were there?
Analysis. Since 2 cents was the increase paid to 1
beggar, and 8 cents the increase paid to all, there were as
many beggars as 2 is contained times in 8, which is 4 times.
Therefore, fyc.
2. Edward gave 6 plums to each of his playmates,

8. If 24 chestnuts be divided among some boys,
giving 4 apiece to £ of them, and 2 apiece to the
others, how many boys are there?
Analysis. Since one boy received 4 chestnuts as often
as another received 2 chestnuts, 2 boys received 6 chestnuts;
there were as many times 2 boys as 6 is contained times
in 24, which is 4 times, and 4 times 2 boys are 8 boys.
Therefore, fyc.
9. Mary gave her chickens 26 grains of corn; ^
of them had 5 grains each, the others but 3 each;
how many chickens had she?
Note. The above gives the following question: —
10. 5 times § of a certain number, plus 3 times ^
of the same number, is 26; what is the number?
11. A class received 29 merit marks; ^ of them
received 5 apiece, \ of the remainder 3 apiece, | of
the remainder 2 apiece, and the rest 1 apiece; how
many scholars in the class?
12. 26 melons were stolen, * of the party getting
4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but
2 apiece; how many were there in the party?
Analysis. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would
have been 28 melons; then 4 limes £ of a number, plus 3
times £ of the same number, or J, would equal 28. Since
28 is J of a number, \ of 28, or 4, is and 4 is £ of 2
limes 4, or 8. Therefore, fyc.
13. 4 times \ of a number, plus 3£ times the

$115; how many sheep had he?
16. A grocer received $10 for a lot of baskets;
for \ of them he had 6 dimes each, for | of the re-
mainder pins 3, 4 dimes each, for -J of the rest plus
2, 3 dimes each, and for the rest 2 dimes each; hoV
many baskets did he sell?
17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times |
of it increased by 6 times £ of it; how old is he?
Analysis. 5 times Henry's age equals J34, 4 limes § of
it, plus 6 times ^ of it, equals Js4-, and less equals £
of it, which, according to the conditions of the question, is
3; and 3 is ^ of 3 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc.

and paid for it; how many pounds did she get?
20. Pour times a number is 6 greater than 5 times
^ of the same number; what is the number?
21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep,
found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left;
if he paid $5 a head, he had not enough to pay for

103. 1. The sum of two numbers is 27; their
difference 5; what are the numbers?
Analysis. Since 27 is the sum of two numbers whose
difference is 5, 27 less 5, or 22, would be twice the less num-
ber; $ of 22 is 11, the less number, which increased by 5
equals 16, or the greater number. Therefore, fyc.

103. 1. A grocer paid $12.60 for 30 bushels of
potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and
20 cents a bushel for poor ones; how many bushels
were good?
Analysis. If all had been good, he would have paid
S15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones
made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as many
bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel)
is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on all,) which is
8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones; the difference be-
tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the
good ones. Therefore, fyc.
2. A farmer bought 28 sheep for $76, paying $3
for old sheep, and $2 for yearlings; how many old
sheep?
3. A flour merchant paid $82 for 20 barrels
of flour, giving $4.50 for first quality, and $3.50

were there of both?
6. An old lady sold an equal number of chickens
and turkeys for $4, receiving for chickens 3 dimes
each, and for turkeys 5 dimes each; how many fowls
did she sell?
7. A speculator bought an equal quantity of
wheat and beans, giving $1.50 per bushel for wheat,
and $1 for beans; the wheat cost $7 more than the
beans; how many bushels of beans did he buy?
8. A man engaged to work 25 days, on condition
that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and
159
pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received
at settlement $38; how many days was he idle?
Analysis. As many days as $3, (the difference made
by 1 idle day,) is contained tunes in $12, (the difference
made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times. Therefore he
was idle 4 days.
9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, re-
ceiving $2.50 for every day's labor, and forfeiting $1
for every day he was idle; he received $43; how
many days did he copy?
10. Job, having some chestnuts, gave f of them
to John, who, after eating 6, gave f of what remained
to his sister, and still had 5 left; how many had Job?
Analysis. If John gave £ to his sister, the 5 left was ^;
5 is ^ of 4 times 5, or 20, and 20, plus the 6 he ate, male
26, which is § of Job's, fyc.

of what he had left, and having paid $3 for a pair of
boots, had $5 left; what were his wages?
15. A laborer engaged to work 20 days, on con-
dition that he should have 12 dimes for a day's labor,
and pay 2 dimes for every idle day for board; he
received as many dollars as he worked days; how
many days was he idle?
1©4. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so
that | of the longer piece was equal to the shorter;
what was the length of each piece?
Analysis. The longer piece is divided into 5 equal
parts, 2 of which equal the shorter; the sum of the 2
pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals i- of 28 feet,
or 4 feet; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which are 8 feet,
the shorter piece; b parts equal 5 times 4 feet, which are 20
feet, the longer piece. Therefore, fyc.
2. A tree 56 feet high was broken in a storm ; -| of

to Utica is 1| times as far as from Utica to Schenec-
tady, which is 280 miles from Buffalo; how many
miles from Buffalo to Utica?
9. David caught a trout 17 inches long; the tail
was | as long as the body, and the head was 3 inches
long; how long was the tail?
10. Divide 36 into 2 such parts that 14 times
one shall equal the other.
161
11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples; | of
Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has;
how many has each?
Analysis. Harlan has 6 more than J as many as Ho-
mer, which makes the sum 48, 6 greater than if he had but
J as many; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3
parts plus 6 apples are equal to Harlan's; then 4 parts
plus 3 parts, plus 6 apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42,
and j of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equul
24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num-
ber Homer has. Therefore, fyc.
12. Rochester is 52 miles from Geneva, via Vic-

coat, plus $3, equals the-cost of the vest; what is the
cost of each?
16. Wilson has 15 oranges and lemons; \ of the
oranges equals \ of the lemons; how many of each
has he?
Analysis. Since \ of the oranges equals % of the lemons,
§, or all the oranges, equal § of the lemons; we then have
the oranges and lemons divided into 5 equal parts, 2 parts
of which equal the oranges, and 3 the lemons, fyc.

the value of what is in it; what is the purse worth?
21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied,
"The time past noon is equal to ^ of the time to
midnight," What was the hour?
Analysis. The time to midnight is divided into 5 equal
ports, one of which equals the time past noon; then 5 parts
plus 1 part equals 6 parts; and 12 hours, the time from
noon to midnight, must be § of the time it lacked of being
midnight; since. 12 it f, which is £ of |, will be £ of 12
hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock,
P. M.
22. What was the time, provided § of the time

7. A rope was cut into 3 pieces; the first piece
was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first
plus \ of the third, and the third was as long as the
other two; what was the length of the rope?
Analysis. Since the third piece is as long as the other
two, it must be J- of the rope; the second piece, being £ as
long, is %; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds with
the 5 feet of the first piece, make 10 feet, which must be the
other fourth; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, Sfc.

106. 1. Malcom is 8 years old, and Martin 25;
in how many years will Malcom be £ as old as
Martin?
Analysis. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of age;
in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old,
in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 17
years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old.
Therefore, fyc.

the son's age was £ the father's?
3. Helen is 9 years old, her sister is 22; in how
many years will Helen be J as old as her sister?
4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who
had 45; Henry won as many as he had to commence
with; when they quit, each had the same number;
how many had both?
Analysis. Since Henry won as many as he had, he left
off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles,
now having the same number, must have had 3 times as
many as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3
times ^ of 45, or 15,'and 45 -f- 15 is 60. Therefore, fyc.
5. A farmer, having 60 sheep in one field, took as
many from them as he had in another field, and put
them with the others, when the Locks were equal;

8. Henry earned 20 dollars in the spring; in the
fall he earned as much as in the spring and ^ as
much as in the summer, and in the summer as much
as in the spring and fall; how much did he earn in
all?
9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and % as
many as B, and B lias as many as A and C; how
many sheep have they all?
Analysis. Since B has as many as A and C, he must
have £ of the whole; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -J- § of i,
plus equals £ -\- 20, or the whole number of sheep; hence
20 equals J the number, and 20 is J of 6 times 20, or 120
sheep. Therefore, SfC.

The author desires to call the attention of teachers to the number ancj
variety of changes that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec-
tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
others of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Ring-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
"changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
- effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they afford for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to some
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy and 'comprehensible.
To aid beginners,, the blackboard maybe used to advantage; and to
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section
71, page 171-3:—
^ of 35 is § of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus: —
f X 35 = JX ? X 18?
Call upon some pupil to read the question according to the first form,
and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given; and
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of the
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus :—
*X35=$X§X —?
which is read
f of 35 is $ of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use'of tin
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil,
but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu-
sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on.
A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
conceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.
