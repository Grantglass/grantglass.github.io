ROBINSON CLINGINGTO THE WREOK ........................... 93MEMOIR OF DE FOE.

DANIEL FOE, or, as he subse-
quently styled himself (though ' V
at what time and on what ooca-- '
sion is not known), De Foe,
was born in the parish of St.
' Giles's, Cripplegate, London,
in the year 1661. The earliest _
of his ancestors of whom there '-
is any account, was Daniel Foe,
a yeoman, who farmed his own
estate at Elton, in Northamp- , .
tonshire. He maintained a pack of bounds; from whence it 7' - 1*
may be reasonably inferred that his means were above com-
petency. A custom of the times in bestowing party names
on brutes is thus mentioned by our author. " I remember,"
he says, "my grandfather had a huntsman that used the
same familiarity with his dogs; and he had his Roundhead,
and his Cavalier, and his Goring, and his Waller, and all the
generals of both armies were hounds in his pack; till the
times turning, the old gentleman was fain to scatter his pack,
and make them up of more dog-like surnames." It is from
his grandfather that De FOe is supposed to have inherited

have occasion to consult, he says, "I have both a native and
an acquired right of election." Our author's father, James
Foe, followed the trade of butcher, in St. Giles's, Cripplegate:
and these few barren facts are all that 1s to be gathered of
the ancestoxs of Daniel De Foe. "He had, " says Mr. Wil- f1 .'
son, in his excellent work, "The Life and Times of Daniel (L 11*,
~De Foe," a work abounding with the most curious and Em
minute information on the period of which it treats--" He I
had some collateral relatives, to whom he alludes oeeasion- "fix
ally in his writings, but with too much brevity to ascertain I!
the degree of kindred." '

At an early age, De Foe is said to have shown that vivac-
ity of humour, and that indomitable spirit of independence,
that remained with him through after life, "making a. sun- . _
shine in the shady place" of a prison, and arming him as the '
champion of truth in humanity in the most perilous times. ' ,1
An anecdote related by our author is illustrative of the dis-
cipline that governed the home of his boyhood. During that
part of the reign of Charles II. when the nation feared the
ascendancy of Popery, and it was expected that printed
Bibles would become rare, many honest people employed '
themselves in'copying the Bible into short-hand. To this ,
task young De Foe employed himself, and he tells us that
"he worked like a horse till he had written out the whole of
the Pentateuch, when he grew so tired that he was willing
to risk the rest. " The parentsl of De Foe were non-conform-

ists, and his education was consonant to the practice of that
faith. Family religion formed an essential part of its disci-
pline; and it was made matter of conscience to instruct the
children of a family and its dependents in their social,
moral, and religious duties.

Although the enemies of De Foe vainly endeavoured to
sink his reputation by representing him as having been bred
a tradesman, there is ample evidence to prove that he was
originally intended for one of the learned professions.* When
he had, therefore, sufficiently qualified under inferior tutors,
he was, at about fourteen years of age, placed 1n an academy
at Ncwington Green, under the direction of " that polite and
profound scholar," the Reverend Charles Morton, who was '
subsequently defended by his pupil, some aspersions having H ,j'
been cast upon the character of the master by an ungrateful '
scholar who had deserted to the church. De Foe writes, " I
must do that learned gentleman's memory the justice to affirm,
that neither in his system of politics, government, and disci-
pline, nor in any other of the exercises of that school, was
there any thing taught or encouraged that was anti-monarch-
ical or destructive to the constitution of England." <<a

"' " It is not often," says De Foe, in his Review, vi. 341, "that I trouble you,
with any of 1113' divinity; the pulpit is none of my oflice. It was my disaster
first to be set apart for, and then to be set apart from, the honour of that sacred
employ."

\ a was ww'i' '\x'

.vu
now to speak with any certainty. He tells us in one of his
"Revietrs" that he had been master of five languages, and
that he had studied the mathematics, natural philosophy,
logic, geography, and history: he was one of the few who,
in those days, studied politics as a science. He went through
. a complete course of theology, and his knowledge of ecclesias-
tical history was also considerable. He was, however, at-
tacked by party malice as " an illiterate person without
, ' education." To this he calmly makes answer:---"'I'hose _
gentlemen who reproach my learning to applaud their own, " " "
shall have it proved that I have more learning than either of
them--because I have more manners." He adds, " I think
I owe this justice to my excellent father still living (1705),
and in whose behalf I fully testify, that if I am a blockhead,
it is nobody's fault but my own." He proceeds to challenge
his slanderer "to translate with me any Latin, French and
Italian author, and after that to retranslate them crossways,
for twenty pounds each book; and by this he shall have an
opportunity to show the world how much De Foe, the hosier,
is inferior in learning to Mr. Tutehin, the gentleman."

At one-and-twenty, De Foe commenced the perilous trade
--most perilous in his day--of author; at the which he la-
boured through good and through evil report, with lasting
honour to himself, and enduring benefit to mankind, for half a
century. It is now ascertained that De Fee's first publication

was a lampooning answer to "L'Estrange's Guide to the

Inferior Clergy," and bore the following quaint title:--
"Speculum Crape-Gownorum; or, a Looking-Glass for the
Young,r Aeademicks new Foyl'd; with Reflections on some
of the late High Flown Sermons: to which is added, an Essay
towards a Sermon of the Newest Fashion. By a Guide to
the lnferiour Clergie. Ridentem discere Verum Quis Vetat. _
London: printed for if}. Rydal. 1682." This title De Foe
borrowed from the erape gowns then usually worn by the

Dissenters against what he terms the libels of the established
clergy. " The fertility of the subject," says Mr. \Vilson, "soon
produced a second part of the 'Specuhunf in which the
author deals more seriously with the government, and, by a
practical view of the effect of persecution, exposed its
absurdity." '

\Ve have entered more at length into the nature and pur-
pose of De Fee's first book, than will be permitted to us by
our limits to do with each of the works that now followed, in
rapid profusion, from the pen of our author. All that we
purpose to ourselves is, to give the strongest outlines of his
character the principal events of his career: and, avoiding
on one hand a jejune brevity, that confines itself to mere
dates, attempt not, on the other side, a minute description of
' events incompatible with our present object.

\Vhen the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme, De Foe
was among those who joined the standard of the hapless

nobleman. " A romantic kind of invasion," says Welwood,
"and scarcely paralleled in history." At the age of four-
and-twenty, we see De Foe, the author of " Robinson Crusoe,"
a soldier; as ready with his sword as prompt with his pen, in
the cause of rational liberty. Of Monmouth, De Foe seems
to have had some previous knowledge, having often seen him -
at Aylesbury races, where the duke rode his own horses, a
circumstance alluded to by our author in his "Tour." De
Foe had the good fortune to escape the vengeance visited upon
so many of the duke's supporters, and returned in safety to
l .;'\\' London; where, leaving the stormy region of politics, he now
"7 directed his attention -to trade. The nature of his business
'4' has been variously represented. In several publications of
E}, the time, he is styled a " hosier;" but, if we may believe his

own account, he was a hose~faetor, or, the middle-man between
the manufacturer and the retail-dealer. This agency concern
he carried on for seine years, in Freeman's-court, Cornhill;
Mr. Chalmers says, from 1685 to 1695. On the 26th of ., 5'
January, 1687--8, having claimed his freedom by birth, be r i, '
was admitted a liveryman of London. In the Chamberlain's lg:
book, his name was written "Daniel Foe." " 'x .
When the Revolution took place, De Foe was a resident ll '
in Tooting, in Surrey, where he was the first person who at-

tempted to form the Dissenters in the neighbourhood into a I
regular congregation. De Foe was for many years a resident l f

in this part of Surrey; it is likely that he had a country- . \

house there during the time that he carried on his hose-agency
in Cornhill. Dc Foe was one of the most ardent worshippers
of the Revolution: he annually commemorated the 4th of
November as a day of deliverance. "A day," says he,
" amous on various accounts, and every one of them dear to
Britons who love their country, value the Protestant interest,
or have an aversion to tyranny and oppression. On this day,
he (King \Villiam) was born; on this day, he married the
daughter of England; and on this day, he rescued the nation
from a bondage worse than that of Egypt; a bondage of soul,
as well as bodily servitude; a slavery to the ambition and
raging lust of a generation set on fire by pride, avarice, cruelty
and bloor ." In order to do honour to the king, and add to
the splendour of the procession, on the royal visit to Guildhall, .
many of the citizens volunteered to attend \Villiam as a ,-
gnard of honour on the Occasion. Among these was Daniel ' '
Dc Fee.

The commercial speculations of our author, though at the
first prosperous, were ultimately unsuccessful. That they
were of a various character, is evident from the fact of his
having engaged with partners in the Spanish and Portuguese
trade. It is very clear, from a pawige in his "Review," that
he had been a merchant-adventurer. In the number for
January 27, 1711, he alludes to an old Spanish proverb.
"which," says he, "I learnt when I was in that country."

It further appears, that while residing there, he made himself
vii
a master of the language. De Fee's losses by shipwreck ap-
pear to have been very considerable. The occupations of
trade, however, according to De Fee's own confession, assert
ill with literary feelings. "A wit turned tradesman!" he
cxelaims; no "apmn-strings will hold him: 'tis in vain to
lock him in behind the counter; he's gone in a moment."
He concludes 2--" A statute of bankrupt is his Ercunt Ozizncs,
' and he generally speaks the epilogue in the Fleet Prison, or

In allusion to the misfortunes of our author, Mr. Chalmers --
observes :----" With the usual imprudenee of genius, he was
Carried into companies who were gratified by his wit. He
spent those hours with a small society for the cultivation of
polite learning, which he ought to have employed in the cal-
culations of the counting-lumse; and, being obliged to ab-
scond from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attributed those
misfi)rtunes to the war, which were probably owing to his
own misconduct. An angry creditor took out a commission
i of bankruptcy, which was soon superseded, on the petition

of those to whom he was most indebted, who accepted a com-
position on his single bond. This he punctually paid, by the
efforts of unwearied'(liligenee; but some of these creditors,
who had been thus satisfied, falling afterwards into distress
themselves, De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claim, '2
being then in rising circumstances, in consequence of King l
William's favour." De Foe, being subsequently reproached

by Lord Haversham for mercenary conduct, he tells him, in l |
1705, that, "with a numerous family, and no help but his 1
own industry, he had forced his way, with undiseouraged I J I
diligence, through a set of mislbrtunes, and reduced his debts,
exclusive of composition, from seventeen thousand to less ,'
than five thousand pounds." E}?
It deserves to be remembered that, in the time of De Foe, L 2,: if
our laws against bankrupts were as inhuman as they were i '2' ?
foolish. " The cruelty of our laws against debtors," says De
Foe, " without distinction of honest or dishonest, is the shame ..

fly out of the kingdom rather than submit. To stay here,

this is the consequence: as soon as he breaks, he is proscribed ,

as a criminal, and has thirty to sixty days to surrender both '

himself and all that he has to his creditors. If he fails to do xi. .- '

it, he has nothing before him but the gallows, without benefit 1%

It is certain that De Foe, whilst under apprehension from '5 a
his creditors, resided some time at Bristol. "A friend of /

mine in that city," says Mr. Wilson, "informs me that one Q;

. of his ancestors remembered De Foe, and sometimes saw him
1' i/ll walking in the streets of Bristol, accoutrcd in the fashion of
% the times, with a fine flowing wig, lacc ruffles, and a sword
4-; l by his side: also, that. he there obtained the name of 'thc

flfi pearance in Bristol, clothed in goatskins, in which drek' he
yug' was in the habit of' walking the streets. and went by the name
' ' of Alexander Selkirk. or Robinson Crusoe! It was during
this retreat from London that Dc Foe wrote his celebrated

E? "Essay upon Projects." though he did not publish it until

 
 

r
',

nearly five years afterwards.

, It app xars that at this titne Dc Foe was invited, by some
merchants of his acquaintance residing in Cadiz, to settle in
Spain, .with the otl'er ofa good commission: "' but," says our
author, "Providence, which had other work for me to do,

placed a secret aversion in my mind to quitting England

upon any account, and made me refuse the best ott'er of that
kind, to be concerned with some eminent persons at home, in
proposing ways and means to the government for raising
money to supply the occasion of the war, then newly begun."

De Foe suggested a general assessment of personal property,

the amount to be settled by composition, under the inspec-
tion of commissioners appointed by the king. It was, doubt-
less, owing to these services, that De Foe was appointed to
the office of accountant to the commissioners of the glass duty,
in 1695: the commi$ion ceased in 1699. It was probably
about this time that De Foe became secretary to the tile-kiln '-
' . and brick-kiln works at Tilbury, in Essex. Pantiles had
been hitherto a Dutch manufacture, and were brought in
, large quantities to England. To supersede the necessity of
their importation, these works were erected. The specula-
tion proved unsuccessful, De Foe himself losing by its failure
no less than three thousand pounds. He continued the
works, it is believed, until the year 1703, when, being dc-
prived of his liberty for a libel, the undertaking came to an
end.

Towards the close of the war, in 1696--7, De Foe gave to

vl
the world his "Essay upon Projects ;" a work alike admira- , Ii
ble for the novelty of the subject, and the clearness and in- iy;

 

genuity with which it is treated. The projects of our author _
may be classed under the heads of politics, commerce, and ("
benevolence; all having some reference to the public im- '
provement. The first relates to banks in general, and to the a,
royal or national bank in particular, which he wishes to be ii, )*
rendered subservient to the relief of the merchant, and the
interests of commerce, as well as to the purposes of the state: .
his next project relates to highways; a third, to the improve-- 3
meat of the bankrupt laws; a fourth, to the plan of friendly
 

societies, formed by mutual assurance, for the relief of the
members in seasons of distres; a fifth, for the establishment;
of an asylum for " fools," or, more properly, " naturals,"
whom he describes as "' a particular rent-charge on the great
family of mankind :" he next suggests the formation ofacade-
mics, to supply some neglected branches of education; one
of these was for the improvement of the English tongue, " to
polish and refine itfy and this project combined a reforma-
tion of that "foolish vice," swearing: the next project of our
author was an academy for military studies; and, under the
head of " Academies," he suggested an institution for the
education of Ifemales:----" \Vc reproach the sex every day,"
says he, " with folly and impertinence, while, I am confident,
had they the advantages of education equal to us, they would
be guilty of less than ourselves."

In January, 1700A, appeared De Fee's celebrated poem
of " The 'l'rueborn Englishman." It was composed in answer
to " a vile, abhorrcd pamphlet, in very ill verse, written by
one Mr. Tutchin, and called 'The Forei'gncis,' in which the
author--who he then was I knew not," says Dc Foe--" fell
personally upon the king and the Dutch nation." How many
thousands, familiar with the following new proverbial lines,
know not that with them opens " The Trueborn Englishman !"

" Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
The devil always builds a chapel there;

r\: De Foe traces the rise of our ancient families to the Nor } r
l man invader, who eantoned out the country to his followers, |
and "every soldier was a denizen." The folly of indulging ~ti ,
this pride of ancestry is finely painted in the following 5' #
lines :-- l
5 " These are the heroes who despise the Dutch, 1)
' And rail at new-come foreigners so much;

l l, Forgetting that themselves are all derived
I From the most seoundrel nice that ever lived.

' A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones,
"'7 Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns;

From whence your True-Born Englishmen proceed.
And lest by length of time it be pretended
The climate may the modern race have mended,
Wise Providence, to keep us where we are,
fl Mixes us daily with exceeding cure."

De Foe concludes with the following striking lines :--

" Could but our anc'estors retrieve their fate.
And see their ofl'spring thus degenerate;
How we contend for birth and names unknown,
And build on their past actions, not our own,
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,
And then disown the vile, degenerate race;

For fame of families is all a cheat,

"'When I see the town full of lampoons and invectives
against Dutchmen," says De Foe, in his "Explanatory Pre-
face," "only because they are foreigners, and the king re-
proached and insulted by insolent pedants and ballad-mak-
ing poets, for emploving foreigners, and being a foreigner
himself, I confess myself moved by it to remind our nation
of their own original, thereby to let them see what a banter

they put upon themselves: since, speaking of Englishmen, ,

ab orfir/l'nn, we are reall_v all fiweigners ourselves."

It is to this poem that he Foe was indebted for a personal
introduction to King William. He was sent for to the palace
by his Majesty, convt. 'sed with him, and had repeated inter-
views with him afterwards. The manners and sentiments of
De Foe appeared to have made such a favourable impression
on the king, that he ever after regarded him with kindness;
and, conceiving that his talents might be turned to a beneficial
account, he employed him in many secret. services, to which
he alludes occasionally in his writings.

The effect produced upon the country by the satire was
most beneficial. De Foe himself, nearly thirty years after-
wards, writes, "National mistakes, vulgar errors, and even a
general practice, have been reformed by a just satire. None
ot'our countrymen have been known to boast of being Truc-
Bmz English/zen, or so much as use the word as a title or ap-

pellation, ever since a late satire upon that national folly was V
published, though almost thirty years before."

In 1700--1, on the meeting of the fifth parliament of King
W'illiam, we 'find Dc Foe strenuously engaged advocating the
necessity of settling the succession in the Protestant line; an
important object with \Villiam, as the only means of perpetu-
. ating the benefits which the nation had reaped from the Rev-
I ' olutiou. To this great end, De Foe devoted all his energies,
I ,C' labouring with unwearied zeal in the cause. His conduct on .
l a? the imprisonment of the Kentish gentlemen, whose names , ' '
are historically associated with the presentation of the famous
Kentish petition, was marked with all the intrepidity of his
character. , The Commons had imprisoned the petitioners,
who prayed the House for the settlement of the Protestant , p 1 ,
[j succession, for having presented a petition "scandalous, inso- : _- ""13
lent, and seditious." On this, De Foe drew up his celebrated
E "Legion Paper." In what manner it was communicated to

    

the House does not appear upon the journals. It was reported
at the time that De Foe, disguised as a woman, presented it . , .- t
to the Speaker as he entered the House of Commons. The 35 i
"Legion" petition rang like a tocsin throughout the king- i' M "X
(lorn. As, however, the author remained concealed, the 53"
Commons did not think fit to pass any particular censure :1 ';
upon it. The Kentish petitioners were discharged by the '5 '
prorogation of parliament on the 24th of June: they were '

subsequently feasted at Mercers' Hall, where De Foe attended. '6'wlrtyar '7'

"Next the Worthis," says a pamphlet of the time, " was

By the death of King "'illiam, "more mortally woundet ,"

of going to a conventicle, there would not be so many suf-
ferers." These arguments found high favour with both the
Universities. The High Church Party never suspected the

sincerity of their partizan, and, charmed and won by the '
fierce doctrines of their champion, were unsuspicious of the
satire of their extravagance. It was, however, De Fee's hard
fate to be misunderstood by both parties. Whilst the High
Churchmen congratulated themselves on the addition of '
another advocate, the Dissenters treated him as a real enemy.
The Church Party, however, fell into the trap laid for them
by De Foe; for, by expressing their delight at the fiery sen-
timents of the author, they avowed them as their own true
feelings on the question. De Foe subsequently taunts the ' '
party thus:----" We have innumerable testimonies," he says,
"with which that party embraced the proposal of sending all
the Dissenting ministers to the gallows and the galleys; of
having all their meeting-houses demolished; and being let ,
loose upon the people to plunder and destroy them." In 5'.
another place, De Foe characteristically portrays the common
fate of the subtlety of wit, when judged by the multitude.
He says--" All the fault I can find with myself as to these
people (the Dissenters) is, that when I had drawn the picture, , , .. l
I did not, like the Dutchman with his man and bear, write is, '
under them, ' This is the man,' and ' This is the bear,' lest the ' i Q.
people should mistake me; and having, in a compliment to 5., )
their judgment, shunned so sharp a reflection upon their
senses, I have left them at liberty to treat me like one that '3 I
put a value upon their penetration at the expense of my

own." The first detection of our author is said to have been {a
2 xvii 2,:
owing to the industry of the Earl of Nottingham, one of the
secretaries of state. When the author's name was known,
people Were at no loss to decipher his ohjeet; and those who
had committed themselves by launching.r forth in his praises
were stun}; with madness at their own lolly. It was at once
resolved hy the party in power to crush l)e Foe by a state - ,
prosecution. In the height of the storm, our author sought.
eont-eahm-nt: when a prm-lamation was issued by the Gov
ernment, otll-rin;r PS50 for the diseoyt-ry of" his retreat, and
advertised in "The London Gazette," for January 10, 17023-3. ,v
- It was as tollows: I

"\Wn'reas. Daniel De. Foe. alias De l'looe, is charged with

. \t'ritin;r a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, "I'he
D Shortest, \Vay with the llissenters.' He is a middle-sizwl,
} spare man, ahout lorty years old; of a hrowu complexion,
i and dark brown coloured hair, hut; wears a wig; a hook nose,
a sharp chin, grey eyes. and a large mole near his mouth:

was horn in London, and tor many years was a ltosc-faetor
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill: and now is owner of the brick
and pantile works, near 'l'illmry Fort, in. Essex: whoever
shall discover the said Daniel De Foe to one of her Majesty's
principal secretaries of state, or any of her Majesty's justices
of peace, so he may he apprehended, shall have a reward of
501., which her Majesty has ordered immediately to be paid
upon such discovery."
In the House of Commons, it was resolved that the book
"be burnt by the hands of the common hangman in Palace
Yard." The printer of the work and the bookseller being:r
taken into custody, De Foe issued forth from his retirement,
to brave the storm, resolving, as he expresses it, " to throw
himself upon the favour of government, rather than that
Edema others should he ruined by his mistake." De Foe was in-
U)?" dicted at the Old Bailey sessions, the 24th of February, 1703,
a>>:

l l

  

f and proceeded to trial in the followingr July. It may be
gathered from his own account of the proswutiou, that when '
>'\\ his enemies had him in their power, they were at a loss to
$7 know what to do with him. lle was therefore advised to
A2 throw himself on the mercy ofthe Queen, with a promise of
'i. protection; which induced him to quit his defence, and
E) acknowledge himself as the author of the offensive work.
, ()n this, be Foe was sentenced to pay a line 01'200 marks to
the Queen; to stand (In-m: times [a [lie pillory ; to be im-
prisoned during the Queen's pleasure, and to find sureties for

his good behaviour for seven years. '
The people, however, were with De Foe. Hence, he was
guarded to the pillory by the populace; and descended from
it with the triumphant acclamatious of the surrounding mul-
titude. De Foe has himself related, that "the people, who
were expected to treat him very ill, on the contrary, pitied
him, and wished those who set him there were placed in his

room, and expressed their affections by loud shouts and ac-
xix
clamations when he w:1s taken 11011.11" Tradition reports

PS3,500; and he had now a wife and six children dependent
upon him, with no other resource for their support than the
product of his pen. Hence the leisure of De Foe, whilst in
Newgate, was not that of idleness or dissipation. Some of
" his subsequent writings leave no doubt that he now stored '
his mind with those facts relative to the habits and pursuits

figee of the prisoners, which he has detailed with so much nature ,_ ' -

   

/

l , i as well as interest. A great part of his time was devoted to
l f the composition of political works which our limits will not
i )4 permit us to dwell upon. It was likewise whilst in Newgate .
l that he projected his "Review," a periodical work of four ,

E17 quarto pages, which was published for nine successive years
Ar" without intermission; during the greater part of the time,
'3. three times a week, and without having received any assist- t

E) ance whatever in its production. Throughout this work, he ' 15%| 14'
1 carried on an unsparing warfare against folly and vice in all , %,'

K? their disguises: it pointed the way to the " 'l'attlers," "Spec- '5

 

tators," and "Guardians," and may be referred to as contain-
ing a vast body of matter on subjects of high interest, written g I, fi
with all the author's characteristic spirit and vigour.

The Tories vainly endeavoured to buy up De Foe: but ' . -
Newgate had no terrors for him, and he continued at once 1' "
their prisoner and their assailant. Upon the accession of ' .)
Mr. Harley to office, his own politics not being dissimilar to '1 ,1
those of De Foe, the minister made a private communication l i

to our author, with. the view of obtaining his support. No M;
xxi ' '
immediate arrangement, however, took place between them,
as De Foe remained a prisoner some months afterwards.
Notwithstanding, it is most likely that the Queen became ac-
quainted with De Foe's real merits through the medium of
the minister, and was made conscious of the injustice of our

gate. For this purpose, she sent money to his wife and
family, at the same time transmitting to him a sufficient sum
; for the payment of his fine, and the expenses attending his
discharge from prison.

On his release from prison, De Foe retired to Bury St. Ed-
munds. Party clamour, and party malice, however, pursued
him there. On the miserable libels issued at this time against
him, he says, "I tried retirement, and banished myself from
the town. I thought, as the boys used to say, 'twas but fair
they should let me alone, while I did not meddle with them.
But neither a country recess, any more than a stone doublet,
can secure a man from the elamour of the pen." In his eleg
on the author of " The True-born Englislnnan," he alludes
to the report that the Tories had exerted themselves in his
favour. He says, in answer :--

" So I. by Whigs abandoned, bear
The Saytr's unjust lash;
Dye with the scandal of lheir help,
But never saw their cash."

his presence upon the continent. The miwion, whatever it 5 5
'91:, l was, appears to have been attended with some danger, and 3
:f to have required his absence for about two months. Harley }' '
K's/'3' seems to have been so well satisfied, that upon De Fee's re- 7'
E\ turn, he was rewarded with an appointment at home. In {55 1
5 31706, De Foe wrote voluminously 011 the subject of the union 5 ' .. $
f 11 1th Scotland, which measure he advocated with all the
. strength of his powers. This advocacy obtained for him a . '
1'" .)SS confidential mission to Scotland, where he was received with
'1"? <<rreat consideration. \Vhile in Edinburgh, he published his .
,U "Caledonia," &c., a poem in honour of Scotland and the
E). Scots nation. Of the union, he says, in his "Review," "I

havetold Scotland of improvement in trade, wealth, and '--' ~
shipping, that shall accrue to them on the happy conclusion '

of this affair; and I am pleased doubly with this, that I am
likely to be one of the first men that shall give them the
pleasure of the experiment." In 1708, De Foe was rewarded f
with an appointment and a fixed salary. When the union
was completed, he published " The Union of Great Britain."
In 1710, De Foe resided at Stoke-Newiugton, and appears to '
have been comfortable in his circumstances. In 1712 was
closed the last volume of the "Review." In a long preface
to this volume, Dc Foe has a most eloquent defence of this

work, and of the mode in which he had conducted it.

MEMOIR OF DE FOE.

Nothing can be finer, more manly, or more conclusive. In
allusion to his sufferings during the progress of the work, he
says, " I have gone through a life of wonders, and am the
subject of a vast variety of providenccs; I have been fed

   

 

more by miracle than Elijah when the ravens were his pur-
veyors. I have some time ago summed up my life in this ',

distich :--

" No man has lasted (lifl'ering fortunes more,
And thirteen times I have been rich and poor.

In the school of'aflliction, I have learnt more than at the

academy, and more divinity than from the pulpit; in prison,
I have learnt to know (lull liberty does not consist 2'22 open doors,
and the free egress and regress of locomotion. I have seen
the rough side of the world as well as the smooth, and have,
in less than half a year, tasted the difference between the
closet of a king and the dungeon of Newgatc." This preface
may be considered as a review--a summing up of the events
of De Fee's political life, and, as such, is of the highest value
for the noble spirit of conscious truth breathing in and ani-
mating cvcry line of it. As a piece of English, it is exquisite
for its innate strength--the beauty of its simplicity. De F 00,
however, was again doomed to taste the dungeon sweets of
Neu'gate, being Committed there upon the foolish charge of
writing libels in favour of the Pretender."

After the death of Queen Anne, De Foe, who had been a.
xxiv
political writer for thirty years, retired from the thorny field
to the more pleasant paths of instructive fiction. Whilst
writing "An Appeal to Honour and Justice," he was struck
with apoplexy; he, however, recovered, and, in the early
part of 1715, committed to the press one of his most valuable '
treatises, "The Family Instructor." In 1719 appeared the '
immortal "Robinson Crusoe!" Nearly the whole circle of
booksellers had in vain been canvassed for a publisher. Wil-
liam Taylor, the fortunate speculator, is said to have cleared
a thousand pounds by the Work, which rose into immediate . '
popularity, despite of the raneorous assaults of the petty, _..' "
vulgar minds abounding amongst De Fee's political enemies.
There can be no doubt that the idea of the work was first .
suggested to De Foe by the story of Alexander Selkirk, which _ ' f >>
had been given to the public seven years before. The ene- l .
mies of De Foe charged him with having obtained this man's
journal, and, from its contents, producing "Robinson Crusoe."
The truth is, Do Foe was as much indebted to Selkirk for
the materials used in his immortal work, as was Vandyke for
his portraits to the colourman who furnished him with pig-
ments. In a number of "The Englishman," Sir Richard .
Steele gave the true and particular history of Selkirk. The '
place in which "Robinson Crusoe" was composed has been l -' )
variously contested. It seems most. probable (says Mr. Wil- 'l "j
son) that De Foe wrote it in his retirement in Stoke-Newing~ l i '

ton, where he resided, during the principal part of Queen ,>> \

Anne's reign, in a large white house, rebuilt by himself, and
still standing in Church street. The work has been printed
in almost every written language--has been the delight of
men of all creeds and all distinctions--from the London ap-
prentice in his garret, to the Arab in his tent. u

"Robinson Crusoe" was speedily followed by the "Account 3 ,
of Dickory Crooke," the "Life and Piracies of Captain Single- '
ton," the " History ofDuneau Campbell," the " Fortunes and
Misfortunes of Moll Flanders," the " Life of Colonel Jacque,"

4: the "Memoirs of a Cavalier," and that extraordinary work,
314-? the " Account of the Plague." "'0 might possibly have laid
H57 before the reader a correct list of the multifarious productions

I" . be obtained, had not the spirit of the times called for complete

' editions of De Foe's works, most welcome and valuable ofi'er-
ings to the reading part of the nation.

The latter years of De Foe's life must have been those of
competence--a most honourable competence--insured to him
by his works, and the rapidity with which editions followed
editions. There is, however, a too miserable proof of his
sufl'crings, inflicted upon him by the cruelty and undutiful-
ness of his songwho, to quote a letter of Do Foe, written in
his anguish, " has both ruined my family and broken my ; a;
heart." De Foe adds,--"-I depended upon him, I trusted 1 ',
him, I gave up my two dear unprovided children into his 5
hands; but he has no compassion, and suffers them and their .v

crave, as if it were an alms, what he is bound, under hand i
and seal, besides the most sacred promises, to supply them
with; himself, at the same time, living in a profusion of
plenty. It is too much for me."

" For some years before his death, De Foe was tormented
with those dreadful maladies, the gout and the stone, occa-
sioned, in part, most probably, by his close application to
study, a hilst making posterity the heirs of undying wisdom.
De Foe expired on the 24th of April, 1731, when he was ',
about seventy years of age, having been born in the year
1661. The parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, in which he '
drew his first breath, was also destined to receive his last. He
was buried from thence, on the 26th of April, in Tindall's
burial-ground, now most known by the name of Bunhill " i l'
Fields. His wife died at the latter end of the following year.
De Foe left six children, two sons and four daughters, whose ,
descendants are living at the present time. >> f

The character of De Foe was but the practical example of I", "
his noblest writings. As a citizen of the world, his love of A '

truth, and the patience, the checrfulness, with which be en- ' um
(lured the obloqu y and persecution of his enemies, endear him {1 *
to us as a great working benefactorto his race. His memory 1 )

is enshrined with the memories of those who make steadfast '
our faith in the nobility and goodnem of human nature. As l ,

a writer, De Foe has bequeathed to us imperishable stores of ' 1 ~,
xxvii @l
l

J the highest and the most useful wisdom. If he paint vice, it
- is to show its hideousness; whilst virtue itself receives a new
attraction at his hands. IIis poetry is chiefly distinguished
for its fine common sense; it has no flights--it never wraps
us by its imagination, but convinces us by its terseness; by
the irresistible eloquence of its truth. De Fee's prose, though
occasionally careless, is remarkable for its simplicity and
" strength. \Vhat he has to say, he says in the shortest man-
ner, and in the simplest style. He does not--the vice of our
day--hide his thoughts under a glittering mass of words, but
uses words as the pictures of things. It is owing to this '
happy faculty, this unforced power, that De Foe occasionally
rises, as in many instances in the golden volume now offered
to the reader, almost to the sublime. In his picture of the
despair of Crusoe, we have, in words intelligible even to in- q
fancy, a wondrous delineation of the soul of man in a most ("film
trying and most terrible hour. De Fee is, in the most em- I'm '
phatie sense of the word, an English writer. Cobbett has >>
been compared to him; and in many of the minor parts of r: " 7
authorship there is, certainly, a similitudc; but Cobbctt was $ l
singularly deficient of imagination, the power which gave a Z ,.
colour and a beauty to all that De Foe touched, even though 51' ,5
of the homeliest and most unpromising materials. 5

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of
IV a. reputable family. My father was a na-

' Hull for some time, gained a. very plentiful a, )
"' fortune. He married my mother at York, 11 '1
and as her maiden name was Robinson, I was called Robin- : 4

8071: Ki'eutznaer: which not being easily pronounced in

'6:
  
  

the English tongue, we are commonly known by the name
of Crusoe.

I was the youngest of three brothers. No charge or
pains were wanting in my education. My father designed
me for the law, yet nothing would serve me but I must go
to sea, both against the will of my father, the tears of my
' mother, and the entreaties of friends. One morning my
3? father expostulated very warmly with me: "\Vhat reason,"

Lo says he, "have you to leave your native country, and enter

    
         
       
  
 
 
 
    
  
    
    
  

" into a wandering condition of uneasineSS and uncertainty?"
<<225%, He recommended to me Agar's wish, "Neither to desire
\cfi poverty nor riches ;" told me that a middle state of life
a" was the most happy, and that high, towering thoughts of
a3 raising our condition by wandering abroad, often ended in
' confusion and disappointment. " I entreat you, nay, I com-
mand you," says he, "' to desist from these intentions. H
d) you will go," added he, " my prayers shall he offered for
your preservation; but a time may come, when desolate,

l oppressed, or tinsaken, you may wish you had taken your
poor father's counsel." He pronounced these words with
such a moving and paternal eloquence, while floods of
tears ran down his aged cheeks, that it seemed to shake my
resolutions. But this soon were 011', and a little after I
informed my mother, that I could not settle to any business;
and begged she would gain my father's consent only to go
one voyage; which if it did not prove prosperous, I would
never attempt a second. My mother warmly expressed her
dislike of this proposal.

I was then,I think, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a school-fellow going with his father,
who was master of a. ship, to London; and acquainting him
with my wandering desires, he assured me of a free passage,
and a plentiful share of what was necessary. 'Thus, without
imploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my parents, I
took shipping on the 1st of September, 1651.

After various adventures we made the Brazils, where
having dispatched some nece$ary business, we sailed north-
ward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we made
Cape Augustine; from whence going further into the ocean,
out of sight of land, we steered as though we were bound
for the Isle Fernand (le Nm-enha. leaving the islands on the e"
east; and then it was that we met with a terrible tempest, ' ?
which continued twelve days, the winds carrying us wher-- 9'
ever they pleased. In this perplexity one of our men died, '9' l
and another and a boy were washed overboard. When the " r
weather cleared up a little, we found ourselves in eleven Q) '
degrees north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon g . J
this the captain gave reasons for returning, which I opposed, i 1, ,
counselling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I l "4

supposed, might be attained in fifteen days. So, altering _ 3

our Course, we sailed northwest and by west, in order to
reach the Leeward Islands; but a seeond storm succeeding,
drove us to the Westward ; So that we were afraid of falling
into the hands of cruel savages, or the paws of devmxring
beasts of prey.

In this great distress one of our men, early in the morn-
ing, cried out, "Laud! land I" which he had no sooner
said, hut our ship struck upon a sand-hank, and in a mo.
ment the sea lil'olie over her in sueh a manner, that, we
expected we shnuld all have perished immediately. We
knew not where we were, or upon what lapd we were
driven; and we could not so much as hope that the ship
would held out many minutes, withuut br 'lllilllg in pieCes,
CXCept the wind, hy a miracle, should change imnm'liately.

my feet, I ran as fast as I could, lest another wave should
pursue me, and carry me back again. The sea came after
me like a high mountain, or furious enemy. The next
dreadful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep,
but at the same time carried me with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore; when raising myself, I held
out till the water, having spent itself, began to return, at
which I struck forward, and feeling grottnd with my feet,I
took to my heels again. I was at length dashed against a
piece of rock, in such a manner as left me senSeless; but
recovering a little before the return of the wave, which, no
doubt, would have overwhelmed me, I pushed hastily for-
ward and reached the main land; when clambering up the
cliti's of the shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on the
grass, free from the dangeis of the foaming ocean.

No tongue can express the cestaeies and transports that
my soul felt at the happy deliverance. I was wrapt in
contemplation, and often lifted up my hands, with the pro-
fuundest humility, to the Divine power, for saving my life,
when all the rest of my companions were drowned. 1
cast my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could see no house nor people;
I was wet, yet had no clothes; hungry and thirsty, yet had
nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to destroy any creature
for my sustenance, nor defend myself against devouring
  
      
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe,
and a box half filled with tobacco. The darksome night
coming upon me, increased my fears of being devoured by
wild creatures; my mind was plunged in despair, and
having no prospect, as I thought, of life before me, I pre-
pared for another kind of death than what I had lately
escaped. I walked about a flu-long to see if I could find
any fresh water, which I did to my great joy; and taking
a. quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up into a thick
bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could not fall, a
deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried my sor-
rows in quiet repose.
1' It was broad day the next morning before'I awaked;
if) when I not only perceived the tempest had ceased, but saw
' the ship driven almost as far as the rock which the waves
J had dashed me against, and which was about a. mile from
K the place where I was. When I came down from my
apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles
\ distant on my right hand, lying on shore as the waves had
cast her. I thought to have got to her, but there being an
inlet of water of about halfa mile's breadth between it and
me, I returned again towards the ship, as hoping to find
something for my immediate subsistence. About noon,
when the sea was calm, resolving to get to the ship, I
stripped and leaped into the water; it was my good fortune
  

to apy a small piece of rope hanging so low, that by the
help of it, though with great. difficulty, I got into the ship.
The provisions I found in good order, with which I crammed

my pockets, and, losing no time, ate While I was doing
other things. I also found some rum, of which I took a
hearty dram ; and now I wanted for nothing except a boat
to carry away what was needful for me.
     
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    

Necessity quickens invention. We had several spare
yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three large spars
of wood. With these I fell to work, and flung as many of
them overboard as I could manage, tying every one of
them with a rope, that they might not drive away. This '
done, I went down to the ship's side, and tied four of them
fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found
it would hear me, but not any considerable weight. Upon
which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast into ~ '
three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal of
labor and pains. I then considered what I should load it
with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks
and boards I could get; next I lowered down three of the
seznnen'e chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice,
three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and
some European corn ; and for liquors I found several cases
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some
cordial waters, and four or five gallons of rack, which I
stowed by themselves. By this time the tide beginning to
flow, I perceived my coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim away,
which I left on the shore; as for my linen breaches and
stockings, I swam with them to the ship, but I soon found

clothes enough, though I book no more than I wanted for

the present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with;
and, after a long search, I found out the carpenter's chest,
which I got safe down on my raft. I then looked for arms
and ammunition, and in the great cabin found two good
fouling-pieces, two pistols, several powder-horns filled, a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I likewise
found three barrels of powder, two of which were good;
also two or three broken oars, two saws, an axe and a ham-
mer. I then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three
eneouragemeuts. 1. A smooth, calm sea. 2. The tide _
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little wind there was
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile,
I found the raft drive a little distance from the place where
I first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: upon
which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was my
concern, when on a sudden the fore part of my raft ran
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone ,
in the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water '1)'1'
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river i
with land on both sides, I landed in a cave, as near the -,
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any prov- l

identially passed that way. a
Not far off I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur-
rounded with lesser hills, and thither I was resolved to go
and view the country, that I might see what part was best ,
to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming myself with a '
pistol, a fowling--piece, powder and ball, I ascended the
mountain. There I perceived I was in an island, encom-
passed by the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scattering
rocks that lay to the west: it seemed to be a barren place,
inhabited only by wild beasts. I perceived abundance of ,
' fowls, but ignorant of what kind, or whether good for nour--
ishment; I shot one of them at my return, which occasioned
a confused screaming among the other birds, and.I found
it, by its color and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh
was perfect carrion.

] When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore,

and fearing that some cruel beasts might devour me in the

S) night-time, I made a kind of but or barricade with the
_ chests and boards. I slept very comfortably, and the next

3 morning got on board as before, and prepared a second

raft, far nicer than the first, upon which I brought away
the carpenter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, 3, great
jack-screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grindstone,
two or three iron crows, two barrels of musketbullets,
another fowling-piece, a small quantity of powder, and a
large bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took all the
men's clothes I could find, a spare foretop-sail, a hammock,
and some bedding; and thus completing my second cargo,
I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already. But I only
found a little wild-cat, sitting on one of the chests, which,
seeming not to fear me, or the gun that I presented at her,
I threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate and
departed.

When I had got these effects on shore, I went to work,
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some
poles which I had cut for that purpose; and having finished
it, what things might be damaged by the weather I brought
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the
better to fortify it against, any sudden attempt of man or
beast. After this I blocked up the doors with some hoards,
charged my gun and pistol. and laying my bed on the
ground, slept eomtbrtably till next morning.

Now, though I had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet despairing ot' a sudden deliverance, I coveted as nmch
as I could: and so long as the ship remained in that condi-
tion, I daily brought away one nece$ary or other, particu-
larly the rigging, sails, and cordage, some twine, a barrel of
wet powder, some sugar, :1 barrel of meal, three casks of
rum, and, what indeed was most welcome to me, a whole
hogshead of bread.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. My next thoughts
were, how I should secure myself from savages and wild
beasts, if any such were in the island. At one time I
thought of digging a care; at another, I was for erecting a i
tent; and, at length, I resolved to do both.

I found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards j
which being as steep as a house-side, nothing could descend ,
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolved
my tent should stand. This plain (lid not much exceed a
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
lightful green before my door, with a pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-
side, lying on the northwest side of the hill, so that it was
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this I
drew a semicircle, containing ten yards in a semidiameter
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of
strong stakes, not six inches from each other; then, with a
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove
another row of piles, looking within-side against them, he-

tween two and three feet high, which made me conclude it
a little impreguable castle against men and beasts. And
for my better security I would have no door, but entered in
and came out by the help of a ladder which I also made.

Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried
all my riches, ammunition, and stores. After which,
wc-rkiug on the rock, with what dirt and stones I dug
out, I not only raised my ground two feet, but 'made a
little cellar to my mansion-house; and this cost me many ,
days' labor and pains. One day in particular, a shower of .- I. . '
rain falling, thunder and lightning ensued, which put me
in terror lest my powder should take fire. To prevent
which, I fell to making boxes and bags, in order to separ- 7
ate it, having by me near 150 lbs. weight. And thus being '
established as king of the island, every day I went out with
my gun to see what I could kill that was fit to eat. I soon
perceived numbers of goats, and shot one suckling, a young
kid; which, not thinking its dam slain, stood by her uncon-
cerned; and when I took the dead creature up, the young
one followed me even to the inclosure. I lifted the kid
over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive; but
finding it would not eat, I killed that also. '

It was, by the account I kept, the 30th of September,
when I first landed on this island. About twelve days

after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of time, nay,

; 1' 0 not have set up this mark; for, among my parcels, I found
1 k the very things I wanted, particularly pens, ink, and paper;

(1311150 two or three compasses, some mathematical instru~

larly a spade, pickaxe, or shovel, to remove the earth. It
was a year before I finished my little bulwark.

Having raised a turf wall against the outside of my hab-
itation, I thatched it so close as might keep it from the in-
clemency of the weather. I also improved it within, en-
larged my cave, and made a passage and door in the rock,
which came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next
proceeded to make a chair and a table. When I wanted a

plank or board, I hewed down a. tree with my hatchet, ,
making it as thin with my axe as possible, and then smooth
enough with an adze to answer my designs; thus in time I
got boards enough to shelter all my stores.

But now a very strange event happened: for one day
finding a bag, which used to hold corn for the fowls, I re-
solved to put gunpowder in it, and shook all the husks and
dirt upon one side of the rock, little expecting what the
consequence would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a 4 i

amazement, something began to look very green and flour-
ishing; and when I came to view it more nicely every day I
as it grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green barley
appearing in the very same shape and make as that in
England.

I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this
sight. Hitherto I had looked upon the actions of this life
only as the events of blind chance. But now the appear-
ance of this barley, flourishing in a barren soil, and my ig-
norance in not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude that miracles were not yet ceased; nay, I even
thought that God had appointed it to grow there without
any seed, purely for my sustenance in this miserable and
desolate island. And, indeed, such great effect this had

, upon me, that it often made me melt into tears, through a
g grateful sense of God's mercies; and the greater still was
l

few days before, and about a month after, to my great lq
.,
9

my thankfulness, when I perceived about this little field of
barley some rice-stalks, also, wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in the island, and therefore made a diligent
search among the rocks; but not being able to find any, on
a sudden it came into my mind how I had shaken the
husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration

ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking
18
it was but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;
though even the manner of its preservation might have
made me own it was a wonderful event of God's kind

providence. '7 ,9
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of this I

corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, together with ll"
3
i

twenty or thirty stalks of rice, expecting one day I should
reap the fruit of my labor; yet four years were expired

' before I could allow myself to eat any barley-bread, and f
' mnchlonger time before I had any rice. After this, with

indefatigable pains and industry, for three or four months,
at last I finished my wall on the 14th of April, having no
way to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall. April

17th I finished my ladder and ascended it; afterwards 333%?

pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and de.
scended into my new habitation, where I had space enough,
and so fortified that nothing could attack me without scaling
the walls. ' '

It was not long after that, when a horrible tempest arose,
at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. It
continued raining all that night, and some time the next
day. As soon as the weather cleared up I resolved to
build me a little but in some open place, walled round to
defend me from wild creatures and savages.

When I began to put my resolutions in practice, I was

up. Having secured these, I made to the ship, whose stern f' ";

was torn off, and washed a great distance ashore; but the
rest lay in the sands.

At this time I was afflicted with an aglle; thirsty, yet
could not help myself to water; prayed to God in these
words: "Lord, in pity look upon me: Lord, have mercy
upon me; have mercy upon me 1" After this I fell asleep
and dreamed. When I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful; I was very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, but I found myself much altered for the
better.

never had seen any of the human kind, I accounted myself
as sole monarch, and, as I grew better, having secured my
habitation to my mind, I resolved to make a tour round my
kingdom, in order to make new discoveries.

The 15th of July I began my journey; I first went to the
creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore, and travel-
ling further, found that the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water, is
on the banks of which were many pleasant savannahs, or "

meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the Q" '
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach,I i a
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong 5. V'
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of i {L

were; l saw also several sugar-canes, hut imperfect for

back that night, and slept emttentedly in my little castle.
The next day, gain;r the same way. hat further than the

and trees. Here I perceired ditl'erent fruits in great abun-

and slept very emntln'tahly. thnngh it was the first: time I

came, I proc-eeded with great. pleasure, on my way, travel-
ling,r ahnnt, fuur miles, as I imagined. by the length of the
valley, directing my course northward. At the end of the
valley, I came to an opening. where the country seemed to

streams running directly east. And, indeed, here my senses
were charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature
could afford; for the country appeared flourishing, green,
and delightful. I then descended on the side of that
delicious vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange,
lemon, and citron trees, but very wild and barren at that
time. The limes were delightful and wholesome, and the
juice, mixed in water, was very cooling and refreshing. I
resolved to carry home a store of grapes, limes, and lemons,
against the approaching wet season; and returned to my
little castle, after having spent three days in this journey.

And now, contemplating the fruitfulness of this valley, its
security from storms, and the delightfulness of the adjacent
"'UOdS, I resolved to make a little kind of bower, surround-
ing it with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
staked and filled with bnlrushes, and having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the first of August
before I began to enjoy my labor.

0n the 30th September, casting up the notches on my
post, which amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the
anniversary of my landing; and, therefore, humbly pros-
trating myself on the ground, confessing my sins, acknow-
ledging God's righteous judgments upon me, and praying to
Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve

hours till the going down of the sun, and then, eating a

biscuit and a. bunch ot'grapes laid me on the bed, and with
great comfort took my night's repose.

I now resumed my intention of exploring the island;
taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit-cakes, a great
bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, I began my journey. Having passed the vale
where my bower stood,I came within View of the sea, lying
to the west; when, it being a clear day,I descried land,
extending from the W. to the S. W. about ten or fifteen
leagues, but could not say whether it was an island or con--
tiuent.

As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine; the fields fragrant, adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with several
very fine weeds. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my cmnpauion, but it was with
great. ditliculty I could knock one down; andI kept him
some years before I could get him to call me by my name.

I Continued my journey, travelling about twelve miles
further towards the east, where I set a great pile on the
shore for a mark. In this journey my dog surprised I: kid,
and Would have killed it, had I not prevented him. As I
had often been thinking of getting a kid or two, and so
raising a breed of tame goats to supply me after my ammu-

nition was spent, I took this opportunity of beginning, and

having made a collar for this little creature, with a string ' m

food, and it followed me like a (log; and as I constantly' , -' '-
fed it, it became so 101 1111;, gentle, and fond, that it would
nex er leave me.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the 30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual, it being the third year of my abode in the
island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable and less sinful than that of human society,
and for the communications of his grace to my soul, in sup-
pmting, comforting, and encou1aging me to depend upon . ,

ricd home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead of
threshing it; and when the harvest was over, found my g
half peek of seed produced near two bushels of rice, and $1 il
two bushels and a half of barley. I knew not how to grind '
my corn, neither how to bake the bread. 9 )

The want of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to
dig it, I conquered by making a wooden spade. The want l
of a harrow I supplied by dragging over the com a great l F4
bough of a tree. When it was growingI was forced to '67

fence it; when ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, and
part it from the chafi'. And after all I wanted a mill to
grind it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into .
bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work \
to find some expedient for every one of these necessaries
against the next harvest.

And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of ground,
near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, , i
' and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up three - _
months; by which time the wet season coming on, and the " '
rain keeping me within doors, I found several occasions to
employ myself, and, while at work, used to divert myself in '
talking to my parrot, learning him to know and speak his 1 3
own name, Poll, the first welcome word I ever heard '
spoken in the island. I had been a long time contriving
how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely,
when it happened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found
8 therein a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as \
a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think of burning ' J's}
some pots, and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing 3:)
them with lead, I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three .' )
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round the 7
outside, and dry wood upon the top, till I saw the pots in j
the inside red-hot, and found that they were not cracked at 1K.

all ; and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of
them stand in the fire about five or six hours, till the clay
melted by the extremity of the heat, and would have run
to glass had I suffered it, upon which I slackened my fire
by degrees, till the redness abated, and watching them till
morning, I found I had three Very good pipkins, and two

The want of an oven I supplied by making some earthen E . '
pans, very broad but not deep. When I had a mind to 1
bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which ii
I had made myself; and when the wood was burnt into
live coals, I spread them over it, till it became very hot; t'

then sWeeping them away, I set down my loaves, and turn- E i
ing down the earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and ] >5,
coals all round the outsides of the pots, to continue the i ,'K "

heat, and in this manner I baked my barley loaves as well
as if I had been a complete pastry-cook, and also made of 37%
the rice several cakes and puddings.

These things took me up the best part of a year, and what
intermediate time I had was bestowed in managing my new
harvest and husbandry, for in the proper season I reaped
my corn, carried it home and laid it up in the ear in my
large baskets, till I had time to rub, instead of threshing it.

All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place, and I began to
think whether it was not possible for me to make a canoe,
such as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But here
I lay under particular inconveniences; want of tools to
make it, and want of hands to move itin the water when it '
was made. However, to work I went,--I first cut down a

cedar-tree, which was five feet ten inches diameter at the
29

lower part next the stamp, and four feet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened
for a space, and then parted into branches. Twenty days
was I a hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom, four-
teen more in cutting 011' the branches and limbs, and a
whole month in shaping it like the bottom of a boat. As
for the inside, I was three weeks with a mallet and chisel
clearing it, till it was big enough to carry twenty--six men,
much bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and Con-
, sequeutly sufficient to transport me and all my eli'ects to
i ' that wished-for shore.

Nothing remained now, but to get it into the water, it
lying about one hundred yards from it. I proceeded to
measure the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal ,.
in order to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not . "
bring the canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be im-
practicable, under the space of eleven or twelve years, I
concluded the attempt altogether vain. I now saw what
stupidity it is to begin work before we reckon on its cost, or
judge rightly our own abilities to go through with its per-
formanee.

In the height of this Work my fourth year expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary, but kept it with rather greater devo-
tion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I

fax

i
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with,
and well might I say, as father Abraham said unto Dives,

" Between thee and me there is a gulf fixed." I was sepa- I
rated from its wickedness too, having neither the lust of '
the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life; I had
nothing to covet, being lord, king, and emperor over the '
whole country, without dispute and without control. Corn,
plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above
measure. What was all the rest to me? The money I had,
lay by me as despicable dross, which I would freely have
given for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or a hand-mill to grind
my corn; in a word, the nature and experience of these
things dictated to me this just reflection: That the good
things of this world are no further good to us, than they are
for our use; and that whatsoever we may heap up to give
to others, we can but enjoy as much as we use.

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual.
Evury time I sat down to meat, I did it withthankfulness,
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in this wilder-
new, had spread a table for me.

As long as my ink continued, which, with water, I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days of
the month on which any remarkable event happened.

The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the biscuits ,
which I had brought out of the ship, and though I allowed ,/

In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen had been gone long before. However, I had preserved
about three dozen of the sailors' checkered shirts, which

proved a great refrwhment to me, when the violent beams
  

of the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seamen's
heavy watch-coats, which made me turn tailor, and after a
miserable botehing manner, converted them into jackets.
To preserve my head, I made a cap of goat's skin, with the
hair outwards, to keep out the rain, and afterwards, a. waist-
coat and open-kneed breeches of the same. I contrived a
sort of umbrella, covering it with skins, which not only
kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also. Thus being
easy and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to
Converse with God, in prayer.

For five years after this nothing extraordinary occurred
to me. Though I was disappointed in my first came, 1
A made, at intermediate times, a second, of much inferior
"'3 size, and it was two years before I had finished it. But as

I perceived it Would no wise answer my design of sailing

, to the other shore, my thoughts were Confined to take a tour
K round the island, to see what further discoveries I could
. make. To this int/ant, after having moved her to the water,

\ and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my

boat, and made a sail of the ship's sail, that lay by me. I
then made lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put in neces-
saries, provision, and ammunition, which would preserve
them dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea, and in
the inside of the boat, I cut a long, hollow place to lay my
gun in, and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang over it.
My umbrella I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to
keep the heat. of the sun all me. And now resolving to see
the circumtereuee of my little kingdomJ \'ietualled my
ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-
hread loaves, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little
hottle, of rum, halt' a goat. powder and shot, and two watch-
eoats. It was the 61h of November, in the 6th year of my
eaptirity. that I set out on this voyage, which was much
longer than I expected, heiug ohliged to put farther out on
account of the rocks. After a While, however, I brought
my lmat safe to a little cove. aml laid down to take a wel-
eome repose. Whenl awoke, I considered how I niight
get my hoat home. and coasting along the shore, I came to
a good hay which ran up to a rivulet or brook, \rhere,
tiuding a good harlmr, I stowed her as safe as it' she had
heen in a dry dock made on purpese for her.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

9 repeated Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly
afl'righted, I started up; and no sooner were my eyes fully
open, but I beheld my pretty I'oll sitting on the top of the
hedge, and soon knew that it was he that called me, for
just in such bcwailing language I used to talk and teach
him, which he so exactly learned, that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor
{obinsou Crusoe, where areyou? where have you been?
how came you here ?" and such like prattle, I had constantly
taught him. int even though I knew it to he the parrot, it
was a great while before I could adjust myself, being
amazed how the creature got thither. But now being
assured it could he no other than my honest Poll, my won-
der ceased, and reaching out my hand, and calling famil-
iarly, Poll, the creature came to me, and perched upon my
thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to me with
"Poor Robinson Crusoe! and how did I come here, and
where had I been?" as if the bird was overjoyed to see me,
so I took him home with me.

I now began to lead a very re'tircd life, living near a
twelvemonth in a very contented manner, wanting for
nothing except conversation.

My powder beginning to fail, I contrived many ways to
ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, par-

ticularly a she-goat witlt young. At last I had my desire;
for making pitfalls attd traps, baited with barley and rice,
I found one morning. in one of them, an old lie-goat, and in
tlte other, three kids, one male, the other two females. It
was some time heliu'e they would feed: bttt throwing them
sweet Corn, it so much tempted them that they began to be
tamer. I concluded, that if I designed to furnish myself
with goat's flesh when my aunnuuitiou was spent, tlte tatnely
breeding them up like a llnck of sheep, about my settlement,
was the only method I could take. I resolved to separate
the wild from the tame; and the best way for this was to
have some inclosed piece of ground well fenced, that those
within might not break out, or those without break in.
Such an undertaking was very great for one pair of hands;
but as there was an absolute necessity for it, my first care
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and ' "
shelter to keep them from the sun. I resolved to inclose a l
piece of ground about one hundred and fifty yards in length,
and one hundred in breadth, suflicient for as many as would
maintain tne till my flock increased, and then I could add
more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and
it took me about three months to hedge in the first piece.
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, feeding them
as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and indeed
36
I very often carried some ems of barley, or a, handful of
rice, and fed them out of my hand; by which they grew so
tame, that when my inclosure was finished, and I let them
loose, they would run after me for a handful of com. In a e \,
year and a half '3 time I had a flock of about twelve goats,

kids and all; and in two years after they amounted to Q? '
forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my sus- I)
tenance. After which I inclosed five pieces of ground to 311'
feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I might

take them as I had occasion. ' cf;

to presume to do so till I had done. I'oll, as if he had

been my principal court favorite. was the only person per-
mitted to talk with me. My old, but t'aithl'ul dog, contin-
ually sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each
side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a mark

\ of my royal favor. In this manner did I live, wanting for
nothing but conve1sation. One thing: indeed concerned
me. the want of my boat: I knew not which way to get her
round the island. One time I resolved to go along the
shore by land to her; but had any one in England met
with such a figure, it Would either have afi'righted them, or
made them bmst into laughter.
The cap I wore on my head was great, high, and shape-
less, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or penthouse hang-
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to
shoot the rain ofi', nothing being more pernicious than the
rain falling upon the flesh in these climates. I had a short
jacket of goat's skin, whose hair hung down such a length
on each side that it reached to the calves of my legs. As
for my shoes and stockings, they were made like buskins,
and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously
V shaped like the rest of my habit. Iliad a broad belt of

, goat's skin dried, girt round me with a couple of thongs in-
stead of buckles; on each of which, to supply the de-
ficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and saw.
Another belt, not so broad, yet fastened in the same man-
ner, hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my
left arm, two pouches, made of goat's skin, to hold my
powder and shot. My basket I carried on my back, and
my gun on my shoulder, and over my head a great, clumsy,
ugly goat's-skin umbrella, which, however, next to my gun,
was the most necessary thing about me. As for my face,
the color was not quite so swan-thy as the Mnlattoes, as
might have been expected from one who took so little care
of it, in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the equator.
At: one time my beard grew so long that it hung down

about a quarter of a yard; but as I had both razors and
39
scissors in store, I cut it all off, and suffered none to grow,
except a large pair of Mohammedan whiskers, like what I
had seen worn by some Turks at Salee, not long enough,
indeed, to hang a hat upon, but of such a monstrous size as
would have amazed any Englishman.

I had now two plantations in the island; the first, my
little fortification, with many large and spacious improve-
ments. The piles with which I made my wall were grown
so lofty and great, as secured my habitation. And near
this commodious and pleasant settlement, lay my well-culti-
L . vated and improved corn-fields, which yielded me their
fruit in proper season. My second plantation was that near
my country-seat or little bower, where my grapes flourished,
and where, having planted many stakes, I made inelosures
for my goats, so strongly fortified by labor and time, that it
was nmch stronger than a wall, and Consequently impossi-
ble for them to break through. As for my bower itself, I
kept it constantly in repair. and cut the trees in such a man-
ner, as tnade them grow thick and wild, and form a mest
delightful shade. In the centre of this stood my tent. I
had driven i'onr piles in the ground. spreading over it a
piece of the ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of a
couch with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and other
things; and having laid thereon one of the sailor's lilank-
cts, which I had saved from the wreck of the ship, and cov-
  
  

  

e1 mo my self with a great watch- coat, I took up this place
for my country retreat. Very frequently from this settle-
ment did I visit my boat, and keep her in good order.

You may easily suppose, that after having been here so
long, nothing could he more amazing than to see a human
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boat, I
saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evi-
dent on the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of it.
' Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape,I
' could not have been more confounded. My willing ears
I gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but
could satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded
. alternately to may part of the shore, but with equal efi'ect,
Eli) neither could I see any other mark, though the sand about
'~ it was as susceptible to take impression as that which was
( so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and

1' horror, I returned to my habitation frightened at every

2 bush and tree, taking every thing for men, and possessed

thh the Wildest ideas. That night my eyes never closed;

I formed nothing but. the most dismal imaginations; all my

religious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would

not now protect me by his power, who had wonderfully
preserved me so long.

In the morning I ventured out of my castle and milked

lnyg oats, one of which was almost spoiled for want of it.

I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and milked
my flocks there also; when, growing bolder, I went down
to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot to
mine, to see perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, I found it much superior in largeuess; and so
returned home, now absolutely convinced, that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited,
'_ and therefore that I might be surprised before I was aware.

I began to think of providing for my security, and re
solved in my mind many ditfereut schemes for that purpose.
>> I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn my
tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing the
same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-fields for
the very same reason. And lastly, I concluded to demolish
my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivauce, they
might come farther, and find out and attack me in my little
castle.

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me; and
I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king Saul, when
not only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by
God. And it is strange, that, a little before, having entirely
resigned myself to the will of God, I should now have little
confidence in him. fearing those more who could kill this
fading body, than Him who could destroy my immortal soul.
Wandering one day tnore to the west of the island than
ever I had yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea,
methought I perceived a boat at a great distance, but could
not possibly tell what it was for want of my perspective-
glass. I considered then it was no strange thing to see the
print of a man's foot, and, concluding them cannibals,
blessed God for being cast on the other side of the island,
where none of the savages, as I thought, ever came. But
when I came down the hill to the shore, which was the
S. W. point of the island, I was confirmed in my Opinion ;
nor can any one describe my horror and amazement, when
I saw the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones
of human bodies, and, particularly, I perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which
I conjectured these wretcltes sat, and unnaturally sacrificed
and devoured their fellow-creatures.

The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle
confounded tny senses; I returned towards tny habitation,
\ and, in my way thither, shedding floods of tears, and falling
down on my knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to these wretches, and delivering me so long out of
their hands.

Though reason and my long residence here had assured
me that these savages never came up to the thick woody
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre-
hensive of a discovery, yet such an ahhorrcuce (lid I still
retain. that, for [Wu ycars al'rcrI mnlined myself only to
my plantations. In I-i'ugrc.~s of time my dreadful appro-

sons compare their circumstances, not with those above
them, but with those innumerahle unhappy objects beneath
them,I am sure we should not hear those daily nnn'nun'ings
and complainings that are in the world. The terror which
the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions for my
own convenience. For now my inventions were how I
might destroy some of these cannihals, when proceeding to
their bloody entertaimnents, and so saving a victim from
being sacrificed, that he might after become my servant.
I think I now was in the twenty-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts much easier than formerly, having con- .
trived several pretty amusements and diversions agreeably
to pass away the time. By this time my pretty Poll had
learned to speak English, and pronounce his words very
articulately and plain, so that for many hours we used to
chat together in a familiar manner, and he lived with me
\' no less than twenty-six years. My dog. which was nineteen
h years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, (lied some
t time ago of mere old age. As for my cats they multiplied
' so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into the
woods, except two or three which became my particular
favorites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three
hollrehuld kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my
hand, and two more parrots which could talk indiflerently,
and call Robinson Crusoe. I had also Several sea-fowls,

hit what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment of this uncertain life! It was now the month of De-
cember, in the Southern solstice, and time of my harvest,
which required my attendance in the fields, when going out
pretty early one morning, before it was light, there appear-
ed front the sea-shore a flaming light. about two miles from
me, at the castend of the island, where I had observed
seine savages had been before, not on the other side, but to
my great affliction, it was on my side the island.

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I
returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me,
making all things look as wild and natural as I possibly

could. In the next place I put myself in a posture of

defence, loaded my mnskets and pistols, and committing
myself to God's protection, rCSoIved to defend myself till
my last breath. Two homs after, impatient for intelligence,
I ascended to the top of a hill, where, laying myself down,
with my perspectivc'glassfl perCeired no less than nine
naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eating, as I sup-
posed, human flesh, with their two canoes hauled on shore,
waiting for the flood to carry them off again. I cannot

easily express the eonsternation I was in at this sight, but
when I perceived their coming must be always with the
current of the ebb, I bccame more easy, being fully con-
vinced that I might go abroad with security all the time of
flood, if they were not before landed. Before they went
off, they danced, making ridiculous postures and gestures,
for above an hour, all stark-naked. When I saw them
gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and placing a
couple of pistols in my belt, with my great sword hanging
by my side, I went to the hill, where at first I made the
discovery of these cannibals, and then saw there had been
three canoes more of the savages on shore at that place,
which with the rest were making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when, going to
the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other man-
gled parts of hmnan bodies appeared in my sight, and so
fired was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be
revengud on the first that came there, though I lost my life
in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits

 

which they make to this island are not very frequent, it " '
being fit'tcen months befone they came again, but still I was {IQ
very uneasy lest they should surprise me unawares. Q9 9

That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with i )
my watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my 4 a, '1
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till I i ; t '
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great $1

rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as to
take from me all government of my canoe, so that in two
hours' time I came up to a wreck. It seemed to be a
Spanish'vessel, stuck fast between two rocks, her stern and
quarter beaten to pieces by the sea, her mainmast and fore-
mast were broken oti' short. As I approached near, I per-
ceived a dog on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and
cried, and no sooner did I call him, but the poor crea-
ture jumped into the sea, out of which I took him up.

almost famisbed with hunger and thirst, so that when I

' gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf could
devour it more greedily; and he drank to that degree of
fresh water, that he would have burst himself, had I suffer-
ed him.

The first sigbt I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one
another's arms; hence I very probably supposed, that when
the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men, not being
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of
the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandyI could not be positive, which lay in the
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out,
of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend to med-
dle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I sup-

boat, without examining what was in them.
Searching further, I found a cask, containing about
twenty gallons of liquor, which, with some labor, I got into e??<

my boat; in her cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there, but took away with me a great powder-horn, a? , k'
with about four pounds of powder. I took also a fire-shovel {I'-- {f}:
and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make choco- i '
late, and a gridiron, all which were extremely useful to me,
especially the fire~shovel and tongs. And so with this -- .
cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came away, the tide -
serving for that purpose, and the same evening I attained
the island, after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in the boat, resolv- .
ing the next morning to harbor whatI had gotten, in my ' I
new-found subterraneous grotto, and not to carry my cargo
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed myself, and
got all my effects on shore, I next proceeded to examine
them, and tapping the cask, I found the liquor to be mm.
In the chest I found a very fine case of bottles, containing .
the finest and best sorts of cordial waters; each bottle held '
about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. Also, two pots
full of the choicest sweetmeats, and two more which the
water had utterly spoiled. There were likewise several
good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and about one

dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs and colored 2
neckcloths, the former of which were absolutely necessary '
for wiping my face in a hot day ; and in the till I found three
bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one
of which, decently wrapped up in a piece of paper, were
six doubloons of gold, and some small bars and wedges of 4,
the same metal, which I believe might weigh near a pound.
In the other chest, which I guessed to belong to the gun-
ner's mate, I found only some clothes of very little value,
except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three . I

' flasks, kept, as I believe, for charging the fowl'ing-pieces,
so that, in the whole, I had no great advantage by this
voyage. The money was, indeed, as mere dirt to me, use-

with for two or three pair of English shoes and stockings; 1" '
things that for many years I had not worn, except those
which .I had taken off the feet of the unfortunate men I
found drowned in the wreck. When I arrived at my castle,
every .thing seemed safe and quiet.

Having retired to my castle after my late voyage to the , ,.. .
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my con- - - '
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I
had as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had
for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them,
one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four-aud-

impossible to express what innumerable thoughts came into
my head. I traced the whole history of my life in minia-

had occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom.
In my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the
happy posture of my atl'airs in the beginning of my reign,
to this Iit'c of anxiety, fear, and concern, sinceI had discov--
ered a print of a foot in the sand. "'hile my thoughts were
agitated, my resignation to the will of Heaven was entirely
suspended, so that I had no power to fix my mind to any
i . thing, but to the project of a voyage to the main land, till
nature, being, as it were, fatigued and exhausted with the
thoughts of it, made me submit myself to a silent repose.
Still bent on my deliverance from the island, I reflected
~. , that one sure way of escaping was to get a savage ; that after
t_ I had ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws
;) of his devonrers, the natural sense he might have of such a
preservation, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and
most sincere affection. I at length resolved, right or wrong,
to get one of these savages into my hands, even though I
should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with this reso
" lution, I set my wits at work to find out, what methods I
should take to accomplish my design. This, indeed, was
m difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any probable
means to execute; I therefore resolved continually to be in
a vigilant posture, to perceive when the savages came on
shore, and to leave the rest to that event.
Such were my fixed resolutions, and accordingly I setROBINSON BESCUES FRIDAY.
myself upon the watch. I waited for above a year and a ,
half. This was a very great discouragement; yet the edge i
of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed
to be delayed, the more eager was I for it. 3
I was one day seriously musing how I should attain my '7 .
end, when I was very much surprised by seeing no less E \$
than five canoes all on shore together, on my side of the ,
island, and the savages that belonged to them all landed, l
and out of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted
my measures; for, seeing so many boats, each of which
would contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell
how to order my measures; and much dispirited and per-
plexed, I lay still in my castle, which, however, I put in a , i.
proper posture for an attack; and having formerly provided <<1'3
all that was necessary, was soon ready to enter upon an en- 34: u
r gagement. Having waited for some time, my impatient "r"? '
temper would let me bear it no longer; I set my guns at I
' the foot of the ladder, and, as usual, ascended to the top I" I; 9
of the hill ; and here, by the assistance of my perspective- l
glass, I observed no less than thirty in number around a . "h
fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed. How they "1) '1
cooked it, or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell; 5,
but they were all dancing and capering about the flames, i "
using many frightful and barbarous gestures. l '

But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding these '6

wretches, my spirits sunk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done
before. It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden

sword; while two or three others went immediately to work ["4

cutting him open for their cookery, while the last unhappy
captive was left by himself till they were ready for him.
The poor creature looked round him with a wishful eye,

spired him with hopes of life, he started away from them,
and ran, with incredible swiftness, along the sands, directly

to that part of the coast where my ancient and venerable -==

castle stood.

You may well imagine I was dreadfully afl'righted upon
this occasion. However, my spirits beginning to recover, I
still kept upon my guard, and I now plainly perceived there
were but three men out of the number that pursued him.
I was infinitely pleased to see with what swiftness the poor
creature ran from his putsuers, gaining so much ground
upon them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus hold out
for half an hour, there was not the least doubt but he would
save his life from the power of his enemies.

Between them and my castle there was a creek, where I
not swim for his escape. But soon was I out of pain for
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over

in about thirty strokes, and then, landing, ran with the
same incredible strength and swiflness as before. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I

perceived could not swim, returned to his company, while i i

the others, with equal courage, but much less swiftness, at--
tained the other side, as though they were resolved never to
give over the pursuit. And now or never, I thought, was
the time for me to procure me a servant, companion, or

assistant. I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my guns, which, as I
said before, were at the bottom of them, and taking a short
cut down the hill, I interposed between the pursuers and
pursued; hallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing to A
t , look back, was, no doubt, as much terrified at me as I at I"
' ;, them. I beckoned to him with my hand to return back;
in the mean time advancing towards the pursners, and
rushing on the foremost, I knocked him down with the
stock of my piece, and laid him flat upon the ground. I
was very unwilling to fire, lest the rest should hear. The
other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as if he had
been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I could per-
ceive him take his bow from his back, and fixing his arrow
to it, was preparing to shoot at me. In this case of self-
preservation, I immediately fired at him and shot him (lead,
just as his hand was going to draw the fatal string. All
this while the savage, who had fled before, stood still, and
had the satisfaction to see his enemies killed. So afl'righted
was he with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood _ .
fixed and immovable, without either sense or motion. This '3)

obliged me to halloo to him again, making the plainest i , ,4
signs I could to him to draw nearer. I perceived he un- 'PS .
derstood those tokens by his approaching to me a little l
way, when, as if afraid I should kill him too, he stopped

again. Several times did he advance, and as often stop in
this manner, till coming more to my view, I perceived him
trembling, as if he was to undergo the same fate; upon
which I looked upon him with a smiling countenance, and
still beckoning to him, at length he came close to me, and > '
kneeled down, kissing the ground, laid his-head upon it, '

4:111;

as I understood afterwards, was a token of swearing to be
my slave forever. I took him up, and, making much of
him, encouraged him in the best manner I could.

The great astonishment that my new servant conceived,
was the manner of killing the savage at such a distance,
without a bow and arrow. First he turned him on one side,
then on another, wondering he could perceive no quantity
of blood; and after sufliciently admiring the wound the
bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and
arrows and came back again; upon which I turned to go
away, making signs to him to follow, lest the rest, missing
their companions, might come in pursuit of them; and this
I found be conceived very well, by his making me under- '
stand that his design was to bury them, that they might not ' .
be seen if it happened, and which I made him sensible I
very much approved of. Immediately he fell to work, and
never was a graveodigger more dexterous than he was; for
in an instant he scraped a large hole in the sand with his
hands, suflicient to bury the first in; there he dragged
him, and, without any ceremony, he covered him over; in
like manner he served the other. All this was done in less
than a quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and
instead of carrying him directly to my castle, I conveyed
him to my cave on the farther part of the island.

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and
water to drink; on which he fed very cheerfully, to his ex-
ceeding refreshment. I then made him a bed with a parcel
of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, and pointing to it,

. made signs for him to lie down to sleep; upon which the

poor creature went to take a welcome repose.

Indeed, he was a very handsome young fellow, extremely
well made, with straight long limbs, not too large, but tall
and well-shaped, and, as near as I could reckon, about
twenty- s-ix years of age. His countenance had nothing' in
it fierce or surly, but rather a. sort of majesty, and, espe-
cially when he smiled, he had all the sweetness and soft-
ness of a European. His hair was not curled like wool, as
many of the blacks are, but long and black, with the most
beautiful yet careless tresses spreading over his shoulders.
He had a very high and large forehead, with a great vi-
vacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. His skin was
not so tawny as the Virginian Brazilians, or other Ameri-
cans, bnt rather of a bright dun olive-color,_that had some-

thing agreeable in it, though not very easy to describe. ,
His face was round and plump, with a small nose, very
different from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty small '
mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the
driven snow. In aword, such handsome features, and ex- 1'

act symmetry in every part, made me consider that I had
saved the life of an Indian prince.

As I understood him in many things, I made him sensi- s '
ble I was very well pleased with him; and 1n a little time "
I began to speak to him, and taught him to talk to me
again. In the first place, I made him understand his name
was to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his
life; then I taught him to say Master, which I made him
sensible was to be my name. I likewise taught him to say
Yes and No, and to know what they meant. I gave him
some milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while I
drank it before him, and soaked my bread in it. I gave
him a cake of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise, to
which he readily consented, making signs of the greatest
satisfaction. . ~

All that night I kept him theie; but 1n the morning I ' ;
ordered him to arise and come along with me, with certain
tokens that I would give him some clothes like mine, at
which he seemed very glad, being stark naked.

I carried him with me to my castle, and gave him a pair

of linen drawers, which I had taken out of the poor gun- '
ner's chest, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him
very well. In the next place I made him a. jerkin of goat's
skin, such as my skill was able to manage; and indeed I
thought myself then a tolerable good tailor. I gave him

also a cap which I had made of a hare's skin, very conve<<

nient and fashionable. Thus being clothed tolerably well,
my man was no less proud of his habit than I was of seeing
him in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at first, the

drawers being heavy on his thighs, not used to bear any

weight, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoul-
ders and the inside of his arms; but by a little easing wher'e
he complained they hurt him, and by using himself to
them, at length he took to them very well.

My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my- ' <<
self, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place between
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and the out-
side of the first; and as there was an entrance or door into
my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to -
open on the inside; I barred it up in the night-time, taking
in my ladders too, so that, was my man to prove treacher-

my innermost wall, without making so much noise in get-
ting over that it must waken me.

But there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely
a master never had a more sincere, faithful, and loving ser-
vant than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullen- r "
nose, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his afl'ec- '_' l
tions were as much tied to me as those of a child to its '7 as,
parents; and I might venture to say, he would have sacri- Q}? l
ficed his life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion f , .,
whatsoever. y ,1 PS4>>

One morning I took him out with me, with an intention l

. [l it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying down in
LE the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Immediately '
t ' I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding him stand I
i591. , still and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot one of the ' v}

// kids. My poor servant, who, at a distance, perceived me
"55' kill his adversary, and yet did not know by what means, or *1
is" :r:\ how it was done, stood trembling and surprised, and looked
flip so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk into the
{\f earth.

I brought home the kid, and the same evening took ofl"
V N the skin and divided the ca1case as well as I could. Part
\'1, of the flesh I ste\v,ed and then, spreading my table, I sat
{I down, giving my man some of it to eat, who was wonder-
\j fully pleased.
K It was new high time I should set my servant to work,
,' so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in _ ,
3 the same manner I had done before. And really the fellow if
was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing I r a 4}
ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it C' it
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see i' '1'"
me make it. In short, he did every thing I ordered him in ' 1|
3 little time, as well as I could perform it myself.
I must own, that this was the most pleasant year I ever
had in the island, for after some time Friday began to talk
pretty well, and understood the names of those things which

62 le'
I was wont to call for, and the places where I used to send
him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been use-
less so many years, except in an exclamatory manner,
either for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occu-
pied in teaching and talking to my man Friday, for so inno- '
cent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear to me,
that I began entirely to love him, and I spared no pains or
diligence to instruct him, according to my poor share of

knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the adoration , ' '

that he ought to pay to the true God. , . ,

You may well suppose, that by the frequent discourse we ,
had together, my man and I became most intimately '
acquainted, and that there was but very little that I could

say but what Friday understood; indeed he spoke very .

fluently, though it was but broken English.

It was from this time I had strong inclinations to venture
over, and use my utmost efforts to join the white bearded
men, described to me by Friday as occupying the distant
coast, and who undoubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguese.
To which intent my man and I went to search for a proper
tree to fell, whereof we might make a large canoe, to
undertake the voyage, and indeed we were not long in find-
ing one fit for our purpose, there being enough wood in the
island to have built a fleet of large vessels; but the thing
we principally wanted, was to get one so near the water
thar we might launch it after it was finished, and not com-
mit such a mistake as I had done once before.

After a great search for what was best and most conve-
niellt. Friday, at last, whose judgment. in such afl'aiis was
much superior tn mine, pitched upun a kind of wood most
lit for it. hit though my man exceeded me in his knowl-
edge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him a much
better and clearer way to make a canoe than he knew
before ; fur he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the
tree, in order to make this boat, but I then told him how he
might do it with tools, instructing him at the same time
llu\\' to use them, which he (lid very dexteronsly, so that in
a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, by
cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. Atter this
it took us a full lbrtnight before we could get her into the
water, which we did, as it were, inch by inch, upon great
rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried
twenty men, with all the case imaginable.

As I was 'very well pleased, you may be sure, at the
launching of this man-of-war of mine, I was no less amazed
to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. "'cll, Friday, said I,
what do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry
us over? "Yes, master," said he, "me venture over well,
though great blew wind." But my design was yet farther,

As to a mast, that was no difficult thing to procure, so I

managed myself. I very well knew I had some old ones,
or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six-and-twenty

    
     
   
   
   
   
   
     

years by me, but not being careful to preserve them, as '

thinking I should have no occasion to use them any more,
when I came to overlook them, I found them all rotten
except two, and with these I went to work, and, after a

great deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching for want ; I ,

of needles, at length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing,
like what we call in England a shoulder--of-mutton sail, to
go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit at the
top, like those which our long-boats use, and which I very
well knew how to manage.

It was near two months, I think, before I completed this

navigation, for though he very well understood how to pad-
dle a canoe along, he was an utter stranger to a sail and a
rudder, and was amazed when he saw me work the boat by
them, and how the sail jibed and filled this way or that

way, as the course we sailed changed. After some time
and a little use, I made all these things very familiar to
him, so that he became an expert sailor, except in relation
to the compass, and that I could make him understand but
little of. But as it happened, there was seldom occasion
for it, there being but little cloudy weather, and scarce any
3 fog in those parts; the stars were always visible in the
, night, and the shore perspicuous by day, except in the rainy
season, which confined e1 ery one to his habitation. And
this season beginning to come on, obliged me to keep the
longer withiu- doors; but bef01e this,I brought my new
vessel into the c1eek, whe1e I had landed my rafts from the
ship, and hauling her 11p to the shore, I ordered my man
Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and deep
enough to give her water, wherein she might float; and
then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across
the end of it, to keep out the water, by which means she
lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain
from her, We thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house. So we waited for the months of Novem-
ber and December, in which I designed to venture over the
ocean.

As soon as the seasonable weather began to draw near, I
prepared for the voyage. The first thing I thought on was,

to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, as a sufficient

store for such an expedition, intending in a week or fort-- ,
night's time to open the dock, and to launch out the boat
for that purpose. But one morning, as I was very busy
upon something necessary for this occasion, I called Friday
to me, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could
find a turtle or tortoise, a. thing which we commonly had '
once a week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for the

sake of the flesh. He had not been long gone, before he
came running back, as though he was pursued for life, and,
as it were, flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one that
felt not the ground, and before I had time to inquire the
reason of his precipitation. he cries out, " O dear, master;

0 sorrow, O sorrow! Bad! 0 bad !" Why, what's the
. 67 .
matter, Friday? said I. " O yonder, yonder!" said he,
"there be one, two, or three canoes! two three!" Surely,
thought I, there must be six, by my man's way of reckon-
ing: but on a stricter inquiry, I found there were but three.
Well, Friday, said I, don't be terrified; I warrant you we

will not only defend ourselves against them, but kill most 1::

of these cruel savages. But though I comforted him in the
best manner I could, the poor creature trembled so, I scarce
knew what to do with him. " 0 master," said he, "they

come look Friday; cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." Why, ,
\ Friday, said I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my

danger is as great as yours. But since it is so, we must re-

 

solve to fight for ourlives. \Vhat say you! Can you fight, _ ; . ,

Friday? " Yes," said he, very faintly, " me shoot, me kill .L n .
what I can; but there come a great many number." That's , ix '

no matter, said I again; our guns will terrify those we do
not kill ; I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop
of my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me,
and obey my orders in whatsoever I command? Friday
then answered," 0 master, me lose life for you; me die
when you bid die." Thus concluding all questions concern-
ing his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram of

rum. After he had drank it, I ordered him to take the 3-
two t'owling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them i '

with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets; then I
took four mnskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five
small bullets each, charging my two pistols each with a
brace: I hung my great sword, as customary, naked to my
side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent wea- '
pon for defence.

Thus prepared, I took my perspective-glass, and went up
to the side of a hill to see what I could discover; and I per-
ceived very soon by my glass that there were one-and-twenty .

savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and that their 1,
' chief concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
the three poor human bodies, a thing which by this time I
had observed was very common with them. I also re
marked that they did not land at that place from whence .
Friday made his escape, but nearer to the creek, where the -'= 5 '_' '
shore was low, and where a thick wood came very close to 5 '
the sea. My soul was then filled with indignation and ab- ' " .7
horrence at such inhuman wretches, which put a period to '
all my former thoughts in their vindication; neither would

told me, as he did before, "When I bid die, he would
die." '

And I now divided the loaded arms betwixt us. To my
man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his girdle, with three
guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great, I confess, to
bear; but what must a poor king do, who had but one 501- '
dier in the world? But to show I made him bear no more
than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other pistol in
i my girdle, and the other three guns upon my shoulders;
nay, something more, a small bottle of rum, which was soon .

out, under a ponderous load of armor, like two invincible
champions, with a quantity of powder and bullets, to stand
our battle, and load again when the pieces were discharged.
I charged F riday to keep close behind me, and not to stir,
or shoot, or attempt any thing till I commanded him, and
in the interim, not to speak so much as one word.

I soon entered the thick wood (my man Friday following
close behind), when, with all possible weariness and silence,
I marched till I came to the skirt of it, on that side which
was the nearest to them; for only one end of the wood in-
terposed between me and them. I called very softly to
Friday, and showing him a great tree that was just at the
corner of the wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and
bring me word if he could perceive their actions. He did
ROBINSON CRUSOE.

as I commanded him, and came back with this melancholy
story, that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of
one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the
sand, at a little distance from them, which they designed

for the next sacrifice; and this, he told me, was not one of .V

    
   

their nation, but one of those very bearded men who were '; \

driven by a storm into their country, and whom he had so
often talked to me about. You may be sure that, upon
hearing this, my soul was ready to sink within me; when,

ascending a tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man,

who lay upon the beach, with his hands and feet tied with
things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes, and
seemed to be an European. From the tree where I took
this prospect, I perceived another tree, and a thicket be-

yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where I was, i:

which, by taking a small circle round, I might come at un-
discovered, and then I should be within half a shot of these

devourers. And going back about twenty paces, I got be- :-

hind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to
the other tree; and then I ascended a little rising ground,
not above eighteen yards' distance, where I had a full view
of these creatures, and could perceive all their actions.

No less than nineteen sat upon the ground, close hud-
dled together, expressing all the delight imaginable at so
barbarous an entertainment; and they had just sent the

other two to murder this poor unhappy Christian, and bring
him limb by limb to their fire; for they were then going
to untie the bands from his feet in order for death, as fet-
ters are knocked off the feet of malefactors before they go
to the place of execution. Hereupon, immediately turning
to my man Friday, Now, Friday, said I, mind what I say: '
fail in nothing, but do exactly as you see me do. All
which he promising, I set down one of my muskets and
fowliug-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same ,
by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him do the like. Are you ready? said I;
"Yes, master," said he. Why, then, fire at them, said I;
and that very moment I gave fire likewise.

I only killed one and wounded two; but. my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful conster-
nation at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had
yet escaped our shot, immediately jumped upon their feet,
but were in such confusion, that they knew not which way
to run, not knowing from whence their destruction came.
\Ve threw down our pieces, and took up others, giving a
second dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only with
swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we perceived only two of
them fall, though many Were wounded, who ran yelling and
screaming about like mad creatures. New, Friday, said I,

lay down your piece, and take up the musket, and follow
me. He did so, with great courage; when showing our-
selves to the savages, we gave a great shout, and made di-
rectly to the poor victim, who would have been sacrificed \
had not our first fire obliged the butchers, with three others,

to jump into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them all, by their
falling to the bottom of the boat. However, he killed two,
and mortally wounded a third. In the mean time, I cut ,4
the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature, 5 . -
and lifting him up, asked him, in the Portuguese tongue,
what he was? He answered me in Latin, Christianus; but '
so very weak and faint, that he could scarcely stand or '
speak. Immediately, I gave him a dram and a piece of -
bread, and asked him what countryman he was. He said, = '
Hispaniola, and then uttered all the thankfulness imagin-
able for his deliverance. Seignior, said I, with as much
Spanish as I was master of, let us talk alter-wards, but fight
now. Here, take this sword and pistol, and do what you
can. 'And, indeed, he did so with such courage and intre<<
pidity, that he out two of them in pieces in an instant, the
savages not having the power to fly for their lives. I or-
dered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at the tree,
which he brought me with great swifiness, and then I gave

him my musket, while I loaded the rest. There happened

a fierce encounter between the Spaniard and one of the
savages; and though the former was as brave as could be
expected, having twice wounded his enemy in the head,
yet being weak and faint. the Indian had thrown him upon
the ground, and was wresting my sword out of his hands,
which the Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out his pis-
('01, and shot him through the body, before I could come
near him, though I was running to his assistance. As for
Friday, he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet,
dispatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him.
The Spaniard, takingr one of the tbwling-pieces, wounded
two, who running into the "mod, Friday pursued and killed;
but the other, netwithstamling his wounds, plunged himself
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the canoe,
which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of one-
('5 and-twenty.

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out of
i our reach, and Friday was eager in pulsuing them; and,
l indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape, lest, after
the news had been carried to their people, they should re-
turn in multitudes, and destroy us. So, being resolved to
pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid
Friday follow me; but no sooner \'as I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I fouud another poor creature bound hand and foot
for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been, with very
  

little life in him. I unbound him, and would have helped
him up, but he could neither stand nor speak, but groaned
piteously, thinking he was only unbound in order to be
slain. Hcreupon, I bid Friday speak to him, and tell him
of his deliverance, when, pulling out my bottle, I made the
poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the joyful news he
had received, so revived him, that he sat up. As soon as
Friday heard him speak, and looked more fully in his face,
it would have mowed any one to tears to perceive his un-
common transports. He kissed, embraced him, hugged :
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung,
wrung his hands, and beat his face and head, like a dis-
tracted creature, so that it was a great while before I could
make him speak or tell me what was the matter; but at
last he told me it was his father.

I was infinitely moved to see the dutiful and tender affec-
tion this poor savage had to his aged parent. He would
sit down by him in the boat, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom, half an hour together, to

cherish him. His arms and ankles, which were stifi' and _ ."
numbed with binding, he chafed and rubbed with his hands. {9
Perceiving what the case was, 1 gave him some rum, which . -;

proved of great benefit to him. 4:
While we were thus employed, the savages were almost 1 4
out of sight; and happy it was we did not pursue them, for '6'

i i there arose from the northwest such a violent storm, that l

36 After this, I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had
(5'? i given his father any bread? He shook his head, and said,
N? "None, not one hit; me eat a up all ;" so I gave him a

'4): cake of bread, and likewise a dram for himself, and two or 1' >> ,

~ ' fort him.

kifi which revived his spirits more than all the rum I had given
\Pfi,' him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the

Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum, as he had
done his father's. Every minute he was employed in this,
he would cast a wistful eye towards the boat where he left
his father sitting, who suddenly disappearing, he flew like

3 erted himself, he could not stand; upon which, I ordered

lightning to him, and finding he had only laid himself down '

to ease his limbs, he returned to me presently, and then I
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where
I would take care of him. Upon which, Friday took him

Y Then he ran for an earthen jug of water for his father, :'
upon his back, and carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father, and presently stepping out again, i
launched the boat efi', and paddled it along the shore faster }
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard; and '
having brought them safe to the creek, he took them out of '

. the boat; but so weak were they that I was forced to make '3 I
' a kind of hand-barrow to convey them to my castle. {1"}? I
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered 5 it: :

Friday to kill me a yearling goat, which, when he had '
done, I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into . ,
' small pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice " ' 7
into the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table,
dined with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard '
too, who spoke the language of the savages pretty well. H
After dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms
from the field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly.
I made Friday inquire of his father whether he thought
' these savages had escaped the late storm in their canoe?
I and if so, whether they would not return with a power too
great for us to resist? He answered that he thought it
impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if they were
driven southwardly, they would come to a land where they
would be certainly devoured. . .-' \i

N o canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my appre- ffl

me that sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese,

who had been shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that
though they were in union with the savages, yet they were
very miserable for want of provisions and other necessaries.
When I asked him about the particulars of his voyage, he
answered that their ship was bound from Rio de la Plate

to the Havana; that when the ship was lost, only five men
perished in the ocean; the rest, having saved themselves
in the boat, were now landed on the main continent. And
what do they intend to do there? said I. He replied, they

had concerted measmes to escape by building a vessel, but .

they had neither tools nor provisions, so that all their de-
signs came to nothing. Supposing, said I, I should make
a proposal, and invite them here, would they not carry me
prisoner to New Spain? He answered, No; for he knew

them to be honest men, who would scorn to act so basely

to their deliverer; that, if I pleased, he and the old savage
would go over and talk with them about it, and bring me

 

an answer; that they should all swear fidelity to me as '-

their leader; and he would not only do the same, but stand : 5 5' '

to the last drop of his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an objec-
tion, which carried great weight with it: " You know, sir,"
said he, "that having been some time with you, I cannot
but be sensible of your stock of rice and corn, sufficient,
perhaps, for us at present, but not for them, should they
come over presently, much less to victual a vessel for an
intended voyage. Want might be as great an occasion for

them to disagree and rebel, as the children of Israel did
79
against God himself, when they wanted bread in the wil-
derness; and, therefore, my advice is, to wait another har-
vest, and in the mean time cultivate and improve more
land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions, in order
to execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him ever
> after. We all four went to work upon some more land,
and against seed-time we had so much cured and trimmed . ,.
up as was sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels of barley and
sixteen jars of rice. As we were four in number, and by
this time all in good health, we feared not a hundred In-
dians, should they venture to attack us; and while the corn
was growing, I pitched upon some trees fit to build us a
'K large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over, which being

( marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them down,
'\ appointing the Spaniard, who was now my privy-councillor,
/ to oversee and direct the whole. I likewise increased my
l flocks of goats, by shooting the wild dams, and bringing
home their kids to my inclosure. Nor did I neglect the
grape-season, but cured them as usual, though I had such
a quantity now as would have filled eighty barrels with
raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they in work-
ing, and I in providing for them, till harvest came, God

Almighty blessed the increase of it so much, that out of
80
 
 

twenty-two barrels of barley, we threshed out two hundred
and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, sufficient to vict-
ual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any
part of America.

Thus the principal objection being answered, I sent my
two ambassadors over to the main land, with a regal anthor-
ity to administer the oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and V
have an instrument signed under their hands, though I
never asked whether they had pen, ink, or paper; when, ,
giving each of them a musket, eight charges of powder and ..
ball, and provisions enough for eight days, they sailed
away with a fair gale.

Scarce a fortnight had elapsed, when, impatient for ,
their return, I laid down to sleep one morning, when a :1 . -3
stxange accident happened which was ushered in by Fri- 7"
day's running to me, and calling aloud, " Master, master,
they are come, they are come." Upon which, not dream-
_ ing of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put on my
' clothes, and hurried through my little grove, when looking
towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a league and a i' 5*
half distant, standing in for the shore with the wind fair. '
I beheld they did not come from the side where the land
lay, but from the southernmost end of the island. So these
being none of the people we wanted, I ordered Friday to
lie still till I came down from the mountain, which I now

ascended, in order to discover more fully what they were,
and, with the help of my perspective-glass, I plainly per-
ceived an English ship, which filled we with such uncom-
mon transports of joy as I cannot describe, and yet some
secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not 7 '
what cause, as though I had reason to be upon my guard.
It was not long before I perceived the boat approach the
shore, as if they were looking for a place where they might
conveniently land; and at last they ran their boat on shore
upon the beach, about half a. mile distant. Now I was '- I
fully convinced they were all Englishmen, three of which
were unarmed and bound; when immediately the first four
or five leaped on shore and took those three out of the boat .
as prisoners; one of whom. I could perceive, used the most . ~
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while sprig ;
, the others showed great concern. <<13" 1%,
K Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as- ' " '7
( tonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to fl" 9
'. ascend the mountain. "0, master," said he to me, "you {Q' i
see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans." '
"And do you think they will eat them, Friday?" said I. '1'
" Yes," said Friday, "they eat a all up." " No, no," said I. I
" Friday, I am much more concerned lest they murder '
them; but as for eating them up, that I am sure they will l
never do." I

I lamented that I could not come within shot of them un- i 3'

were going to kill. But some comfort it was to me, that I ' }
perceived they were set at liberty to go where they pleased, -

mind to see the place; and so long did they negligently
ramble, that the tide had ebbed so low as to leave the boat
aground. Nor were the two men who were in her more
circumspect; for, having drunk a little too much liquor,

they fell fast asleep; but one of them waking before the
83
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground for his
strength to move, he hallooed out to the rest, who made all
possible expedition to come to him; but as Providence
ordered it, all their force was inefi'ectual to launch her,
when I could hear them speak to one anotli'er, "Why let . "
her alone, Jack, can't ye, she'll float next tide ;" by which "
Iwas convinced they were my own countrymen. I took
two fusees on my shoulder, and gave Friday three muskets;
besides, my flirmidable goat-skin coat and monstrous cap.
.> made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules of old,
' -. especially when two pistols were stuck in my belt, and my
naked sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
a was dark; and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor dis-
tressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were seated
under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter of a mile
from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I approached
them, with my man following behind me, and before I was
perceived, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are
ye, gentlemen?"
At these words they started up in great confusion, when 4,
they beheld the strange figure I made. They returned no i"
answer, but seemed as if they would fly from me. " Gen-ROBINSON CRUSOE. g: -

have a friend nearer than you expect." " He must be from i
heaven," said one of them, gravely, pulling 03 his hat, " for '

we are past all help in this world." "All help is from

heaven," said I; "but. sir, as I have perceived every ac-
tion between you and these brutes since your landing, only 5, -

inform me how to assist you, and I will do it to the utmost it, - 3K

habit will tell you I am a man, and an Englishman, willing

to assist you, having but this servant. Here are arms and

ammunition; tell freely your condition. Can we save you i"

"The story," said he, "is too long to relate, since our 3, ~'

butchers are so near; but, sir, I was master of that ship,

my men have mutinicd, and it is a favor they have put my

mate, this passenger, and me on shore, without murdering

us, though we expect nothing but perishing here." " Are

i your enemies gone ?" said I. "No," replied he, pointing

to a thicket, "there they lie; while my heart trembles, lest,

having seen and heard us, they should murder us all."

" Have they firearms?" said I. "They have but two

pieces," said he, "one of which is left in the boat." He
also told me there were two enormous villains among them,

that were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were

killed or seized, the rest might return to their obedience.
"' Well, well," said I, "let us retire farther under cover of
the woods ;" and there it was I made these conditions with
him:

1. That, while they stayed in the island, they should not ,
pretend to any authority; but should entirely conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
their hands.

2. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afi'ord
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England.

\Vhen he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire,
I gave him and his two companions, each of them, a gun, ' mm
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon $1
them as they lay sleeping. The captain modestly said, that Ecidg t',
he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other hand, to 't'" 'I";
let these villains escape, who were the authors of his 1 ' /
misery, might be the ruin of us all. " \Vell," said he, " do [1"
as you think fit ;" and so accordingly I fired, killed one of f V" l
the captain's chief enemies, and wounded the other, who 'V
eagerly called for asistance; but the captain, who had re- {1'
served his piece, coming up to him, " Sirrah," said he,
" 'tis too late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to
God to pardon your villany;" and so knocked him down i

with the stock of his gun. Three others were also slightly {a

wounded, who, at my approach, cried out for help. This
the captain granted, upon condition that they would swear
to be true to him in recovering the ship, which they sol- .
emnly did; however, I obliged the captain to keep them \ '
bound. After which I sent Friday and the captain's mate i
to secure the boat, and bring away the oars and sails;
when, at their return, three men coming back and seeing
their late distressed captain now their conqueror, submitted
to be bound also. And then it was, that, having more lib- , J

erty, I related the adventures of my own life, which he 51,; . '
heard with serious attention. After this, I carried him and
his two companions into my little fortified castle; showed
them all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such ,
provisions as I could afford. When this was over, we .' , 5' =N
began to consider about regaining the ship. He said there i
were twenty-six hands on board, who, knowing their lives
were forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, were
so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small '
company to attack them. This was a. reasonable inference RSV i
indeed; but something we must resolve on, and imme- " 3%
diately put in execution. We, therefore, heaved the boat 9 '*
upon the beach, so high that she could not shoot ofi' at '
high-water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to be -
stopped; so that all the signals they gave for the boat to i

come on board were in vain. This obliged them to send 'e

another boat ashore, with ten men armed, whose faces the
captain plainly described, the boatswain being the chiet
officer; but he said there were three honest lads among
them, who were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I
y gave him fresh courage. When the sailors landed, and
K>j beheld their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed,
31"" but fired for their companions to hear, yet they received
ERIC) no answer. This struck them with horror and amazement;
and thinking they were murdered, they made as if they
\I would return to the ship. I could perceive the captain's
K /'\' countenance change at this; till of a sudden, three men ' >>
'95". were ordered to 101 Ik after the boat, while the other seven ,
leaped on shore in order to search for their companions;
Q and, indeed, they came to the brow ot' the hill, near my '
ancient castle, from whence they could see to a great dis- '
, tance in the woods, and there shouting and hallooing till
E tired and weary, they at length seated themselves under a

spreading tree. My opinion was, that nothing could be
\ done till night, when I might use some artifice to get them

all out of the boat; but of a sudden they started up and

made to the sea-side. I then ordered Friday and the cap-

tain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they

could, and so decoying them into the woods, come round to

me again. And this, indeed, had good effect; for they fol-
lowed the noise, till coming westward to the creek, they
called for their boat to carry them over, and taking one of

the men out. of her, left two to look after her, having fast-
ened her to the stump of a little tree on shore. Hereupon
immediately the captain and our party passing the creek
out of their sight, we surprised them both, by the captain's

knocking down one and ordering the other to surrender '3,

 

upon pain of death; and who, being the honestest of them a :

all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it was pretty
late; when the rat returning to their boat, which they

found aground in the creek, the tide out, and the men _

gone, they ran about wringing their hands, crying it was
an enchanted island, and that they should be all murdered
by spirits or devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our
party. But to be more certain, Friday and the captain
crawled upon their hands and feet, as near as possible;
and, when the boatswain approached in sight, so eager was
the captain, that he fired and killed him on the spot; Fri-
day wounded the next man, and a third ran away. Here-
upon I advanced with my whole army; and it being dark,
I ordered the man we had surprised in the boat to call them
by their names, and to parley with them, which he did, and
they were at length induced to lay down their arms in token
of submission.

Afier this, the captain expostulated with them, telling
89
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might ,I x.
execute them here, but he thought they would all be sent ' '
to England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to pre-- ' 1 il

pare for death the next morning. Hereupon Atkins im-
plored the captain to intercede for his life, and the rest
begged they might not be sent to England. This answered
our project for' seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins :Q,

and two of the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest
being committed to my bower, I sent the captain to treat

with them in the governor's name, offering them pardon if

they would assist in recovering the ship. Upon which

they all promised to stand by him to the last drop of their '

blood, and whoever acted treacherously should be hanged
in chains upon the beach. They were all released on these
assurances, and the captain repaired to the other boat,
making his passenger captain of her, and gave him four

    

men well armed, while himself, his mate, and five more .I '

went in .the other boat. By midnight they came within '

call of the ship, when the captain ordered Robinson to bail
her, and tell them, that with great diflicnlty they had found
the men at last. But while they were discoursing, the

captain, his mate, and the rest, entered and knocked down 3

the second mate and carpenter, secured those that were
upon deck, by putting them under the hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and secured the forecastle; they
then broke into the round-house, where the mate, after some
resistance, shot the pirate captain through the head, upon
which all the rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus
the ship being recovered, the signal was fired, which I
heard with the greatest joy imaginable, nor was it long
before he brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's

month, where, coming to me unawares, " There," says' he,

"my dearest friend and deliverer, there' is your ship, and
we are your servants," a comfort so unspeakable as made
me swoon in his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we
were tenderly embracing each other.

Nothing now remained, but to consult what we should do
with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to take
on board. Cuncerting with the captain, I dressed myself in
one of his suits, and sending for them, told them that I was

stay. Herenpon I told them my whole story, charging
,, them to be kind to the Spaniards that were expected, giving
'9 them all my arms, and informing them of every thing neces-
\ sary for their subsistence, after which I and my man Friday
<5 went on board. But. the next morning, two of the men
( came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the captain to
( take them on board, though he hanged them afterwards,
complaining how barbarously the others used them.
Upon which I prevailed with the captain to take them in,
and being severely whipped, they proVed more honest for
the future. Thus I bade farewell to this island, carrying
along with me iny money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat's
skin cap; setting sail December 13 1686, after twenty--eight

years, two months, and nineteen days' residence, landing in
92
 

England, June 11, 1687, after five--and-thirty years' absence
from my own country, cured of my rambling inclinations,
and only desirous to end my days in peace.

FOR LITTLE FOLKS-

r IIIS Series of FAIRY STORIES has for generatious been listened to and

read by children with an inexpressihle delight, which other books have
failed to atl'urd them. The extravagance of the stories--the attractive manner
of telling them--the picturesque scenery described--the marvellous deeds rc--
, \/ lated-the reward of virtue and punishment. of rice, upon principles strictly in
l f accordance with ethical laws. as applied to the formation of character, render them
i ,<<b\ peculiarly adapted to induce children to acquire a love for reading. and to aid

\ 1:?>> them to cultivate the atl'ections. sympathies, fancy. and imagination.

,\"<<,7 The principle. that good examples only should he imitated. has hitherto been

KN. lost sight of in the pictorial embellishments of these standard FAIRY Sromes,
l

A, upon the assumption that iuditl'crent pictures are good enough to give first im-

pressions of art to children. lt~ this holds true, then language and morals of a

questionable cast will subserve the same ends; but the fallacy of this dogma, not--
withstanding. no one upon reflection will deny.

That this edition of these stories may he more perfect than any other extant,

, the publisher has embellished it with exquisite specimens of high pictorial art,

. from which children may derive those correct ideas that will mature into the bean-

tiful and grand.
A great norelty in this Series is an exquisite colored Frontispiece to each vol-
ume, in imitation of an oil painting. a new feature in book illustrations in this

country.
